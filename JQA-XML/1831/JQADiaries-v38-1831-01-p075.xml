							<l>Lord of Creation—will thine eye</l>
					<l>Behold a Mortal’s Adoration?</l>
							<l>And from thy living Throne on high</l>
					<l>Receive his humble Supplication.</l>
					<l>His thanks, for Blessings, scatter’d still,</l>
					<l>O’er all his days, without restriction?</l>
					<l>His meek submission to thy will;</l>
					<l>Tried in the Furnace of Affliction?</l>
							<l>His Praise? Oh God! can Mortal Praise</l>
					<l>Admittance gain in Heavenly Story;</l>
							<l>While Angels and Archangels raise</l>
					<l>Immortal Anthems to thy glory?</l>
							<l>His Prayer? His humble, fervent Prayer</l>
					<l>For good, to fill his heart with gladness?</l>
					<l>Or—if thy Judgments he must bear,</l>
					<l>Thy aid, to sooth his Soul in sadness?</l>
							<l>Be Joy, or Sorrow, Gracious Lord</l>

							hope that the election for members of Congress there has been decided in
							favour of the <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> ticket— M<hi

								ref="mclane-louis">M’Lane</persRef>, our Minister in London, a
							shrewd and intelligent observer, wrote to him on the 14<hi

								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef>, and his

							Baron de Sacken does not believe in the news of a Declaration of War by
							Russia against France— Says he has Letters direct from S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg of 13. November, only 48 days
							since; which say not one word of War, but speak with great alarm, of the
							ravages and dangers of the Cholera Morbus, a disease, spreading from
							Hindostan, till it has reached Moscow. Van Buren and Livingston agreed
							in the opinion of the all-absorbing importance of the recent and
							impending Events in Europe. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell’s object
							was to enquire for the precedents of original diplomatic appointments by
							the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> during the recess
							of the Senate— This question has come up again, upon the Turkish Treaty,
							before the Senate— I referred him to the 10<hi rend="superscript"

							State Papers. He says that my Instructions to <persRef

								<persRef ref="finch-william">Captain Finch</persRef> sat in the pew

							of the Supreme Court of the United States, had been served upon the
								<persRef ref="gilmer-george">Governor of Georgia</persRef>— Taylor
							read me part of a Letter from <persRef ref="hammond-jabez">Jabez D.

							Election. The <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> Masons in

							nomination of their own; to prevent their voting for <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> Electoral tickets; and with
							the object of dividing the electoral votes, and of bringing the Election
							into the House of Representatives— Judge Spencer is very averse to this,
							and thinks that the Anti-masons may yet be propitiated to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay. Taylor said there were about 30 <pb
								n="77" type="ms"/>opposition members who met at Davis’s every
							Thursday Evening to consult together upon what was to be done— But the
							anti-masonic members from New-York declined meeting with them— The

							The Resolutions of the Legislature of Georgia setting at defiance the
							Supreme Court of the United States, are published and approved <pb
								n="78" type="ms"/>in the Telegraph, the Administration Newspaper at
							this place. By extending the Laws of Georgia over the Country and People
							of the Cherokees, the Constitution, Laws and Treaties of the United
							States were quo ad hoc set aside. They were chaff before the wind. In
							pursuance of these Laws of Georgia, a <persRef ref="tassel-george"
								>Cherokee Indian</persRef> is prosecuted for the murder of <persRef
								ref="fallon-andrew">another Indian</persRef> before a State Court of
							Georgia tried by a Jury of white men and sentenced to death. He applies
							to the <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice</persRef> of the
							Supreme Court of the United States, who issues an injunction to the
								<persRef ref="gilmer-george">Governor</persRef> and Executive
							Officers of Georgia upon the appeal to the Laws and Treaties of the
							United States. The Governor of Georgia refuses obedience to this
							injunction, and the Legislature pass Resolutions that they will not
							appear to answer before the Supreme Court of the United States— The
							Constitution, the Laws and Treaties, of the United States are prostrate
							in the State of Georgia. Is there any remedy for this state of things?—
							None. Because the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Executive of the United
								States</persRef> is in league with the State of Georgia. He will not
							take care that the Laws be faithfully executed. A majority of both
							Houses of Congress sustain him in this neglect and violation of his
							duty— There is no harmony in the Government of the Union. The arm
							refuses its Office— The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint—
							This example of the State of Georgia, will be imitated by other States,
							and with regard to other National Interests— Perhaps the Tariff— Still
							more probably the Public Lands— As the Executive and Legislative now
							fail to sustain the Judiciary, it is not improbable that occasions may
							arise in which the judiciary will fail in turn to sustain them. The
							Union is in the most imminent danger of dissolution from the old
							inherent vice of Confederacies, Anarchy in the Members— To this end, one
							third of the People is perverted—one third Slumbers—and the rest wring
							their hands, with unavailing Lamentations, in the foresight of evil
							which they cannot avert— The Ship is about to founder. A Merciful
							Providence can save.</p>

							the Clay members from Ohio, for the issue of the election to the Senate
							of the United States in the place of <persRef ref="burnet-jacob">Judge
								Burnet</persRef>— It was feared that a Jackson man named <persRef
								ref="williams-micajah">Williams</persRef> would be chosen. But this

								Ewing</persRef>, a Clay man, by a vote of 54 to 51. and 2 votes for
							<persRef ref="king-edward">E. King</persRef>. <persRef ref="wright-john">J. C. Wright</persRef> was chosen a

							he cannot be chosen but by voting for himself. The election will fall

						<p>Walk round the Capitol Square before Sunrise— <persRef ref="storrs-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs</persRef> a member of the
							House of Representatives from New-York, and at the request of <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l. </hi>P. B.
								Porter</persRef>, left with me for perusal, a Letter from him to
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Van-Buren</persRef>, and a copy of the opinion of <persRef
								ref="conkling-alfred">Judge Conkling</persRef> upon the suit of the
							United States against General Porter— The judge does not consider the
							act of Congress of 1821. as inoperative—but it was limited to two years;
							and from the time of its expiration he adjudged that the Commissioners
							under the Treaty of Ghent, were entitled for the remainder of their term
							of Service, to the same Salary of a thousand Pounds Sterling a year,
							which they had received before the act of Congress, reducing it to 2500
							dollars a year. This decision covers the whole claim of the Government
							against General Porter; and leaves a balance of 281:88 in his favour,
							which he requests M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren to cause to
							be paid to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs— The Letter is measured
							in its language, though as Storrs remarked rather tart in its import.
							Storrs spoke with disgust and indignation of the correspondence with the
							British Government upon the Colonial Trade question; and particularly of
							the Instructions from Van Buren to <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>M’Lane</persRef>. They directed him to urge as argument to the
							British Government, to obtain concessions from them, that the present
							Administration was friendly, and their predecessors hostile to Great
							Britain— Thus making a merit with the other party of their sacrifice of
							the interests of their own Country, to obtain beggarly favours in
							return. M’Lane’s note is accordingly a memorable monument of this base
							prostitution. It is in truth a humble supplication to the British
							Government to permit the United States to surrender their rights and
							interests—to concede as a favour to us that which is entirely and
							exclusively advantageous to themselves— The arrangement which has been
							made is humiliating in form, and injurious in substance to the United
							States; and the late <persRef ref="herries-john">Chancellor of the
								Exchequer Herries</persRef>, in presenting to Parliament a bill to
							increase the duties upon our importations in the West-Indies, very
							naturally indulged a spirit of exultation upon the victory, they had
							atchieved over us— Storrs moved in the House for copies of this
							Correspondence which were immediately communicated, but M’Lane’s Notes
							were already published in a New-York <pb n="80" type="ms"/>Newspaper— I
							had a visit also from <persRef ref="webster-noah">Noah
							Webster</persRef>, and conversed with him about his spelling books and
							Dictionaries. His large Dictionary is a work of immense labour and
							research, but his etymologies want sagacity, and his powers of analysis
							are irremediably feeble and inefficient— He said he introduced himself,
							and when I claimed old acquaintance with him, asked when and where he
							had ever seen me before— I told him at his own house in Hartford, in
							January 1791. and again at New-York in 1794.—both had escaped his
							recollection— He appeared not even to recollect his correspondence with
							me which has been considerable and at various times— He complained that
							a <persRef ref="worcester-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Worcester</persRef> of Cambridge was depriving him of the profits of
							a duodecimo abridgment of his dictionary— <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Gardner</persRef> likewise called upon me— His last Station is at
							the Pea-patch. I left Cards for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster,
							and <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah

							the visit of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren, who was keeping
							house for the Influenza— The <persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Chevalier
								Huygens</persRef>, Minister from the <persRef ref="william-i">king of
								the Netherlands</persRef> was with him— <persRef
								ref="huygens-constantia;huygens-r;huygens-unknown">His

						<p>Both Houses of Congress adjourned over from yesterday till Monday, and I
							received visits from several of the members. Two of those from New-York
								<persRef ref="dewitt-charles">DeWitt</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="beekman-thomas">Beekman</persRef> were unknown to me before—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Witt mentioned that there was an
							application under consideration of a Committee of which he was a member,
							from a <persRef ref="barron-ann">daughter</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="barron-william2">William Barron</persRef>, first Lieutenant of
							the Boston Frigate in 1778. killed by the bursting of a gun fired to
							bring to a vessel in the Night on a voyage from Boston to France— The
							Petition stated that this Lady, who never has been married, had hitherto
							forborn to make any application for assistance from the Country, which
							she now finds herself under the necessity of doing, and for the facts
							relating to her father’s death, she refers to <persRef
								ref="tucker-samuel">Captain Samuel Tucker</persRef>, and to me, then
							a passenger in the frigate. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Witt said
							there was a certificate from Captain Tucker, very honourable to
							Lieutenant Barron, and stating that he was killed on that passage but
							not in what manner. I told him the circumstances of the case as they
							dwelt upon my memory fresh after the lapse of 53 years— I also mentioned
							the universal esteem in which Lieutenant Barron was held on board the
							ship, and the general gloom occasioned by the disaster which caused his
							death— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Witt said that my statement
							agreed perfectly with the certificate of Captain Tucker— That the
							Committee had some difficulty in determining what could be done for the
							Petitioner, but they would propose to give her the benefit of a
							Resolution of the Confederation Congress, and allow her the half-pay of
							a first Lieutenant for seven years. I told him that whatever could be
							done for her <pb n="82" type="ms"/>would be very agreeable to me, and
							very just— For Lieutenant Barron had lost his life, though not in
							battle, yet in the discharge of his duty and in the public Service, and
							far remote as the time of his death was, I remembered how deeply it was
							lamented by all on board the ship, and how sincerely though then but a
							child I had shared in that feeling. <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef> said that the
							second return of <persRef ref="barbour-james">James Barbour</persRef> to
							the Legislature of Virginia would again be contested: that if all the
							illegal votes should be thrown out the majority in his favour would be
							increased, but that it was not possible to say what under the impulse of
							party feelings, the decision of the house would be. He said that
								<persRef ref="newton-thomas">Newton</persRef> would be a Candidate
							for election to the next Congress with fair prospects of success.
								<persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chambers</persRef> mentioned the election of <persRef
								ref="martin-daniel">D. Martin</persRef> as Governor of Maryland,
							without opposition; although there was a question whether he was
							eligible by the Constitution— He said too there was a question, whether
							there should be a legislative nomination of <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> at this Session:
							upon which he had received two Letters from Annapolis; they asked
							advice, but he knew not what to answer: His own opinion was against it,
							but he did not wish to have the appearance of throwing obstacles in the
							way. As to the election in Kentucky <persRef ref="letcher-robert"
								>Letcher</persRef> had told him there were eight or nine members of
							the Legislature friendly to Clay, but who would not, at least on the
							first ballot vote for an anti-<persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> Senator— They would vote for a Jackson man but
							not for the person supported by the party. And then after satisfying
							their party scruples it was hoped they would come over, and vote for a

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church, <persRef ref="burnap-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap</persRef> of Baltimore, from
							Psalm 119.71. “It is good for me that I have been afflicted”—leaving out
							the remainder of the verse—“that I might learn thy Statutes.” The part
							of the verse selected by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap
							generalizes that which in the whole verse is limited; and in the text
							itself there is another limitation not noticed in the discourse— The
							Psalmist says it is good for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, that <hi
								rend="italic">I</hi> have been afflicted; and adds the reason <hi
								rend="italic">why</hi> affliction had been good for him—that he
							might learn the Statutes of the Lord— It is just now forty years since I
							heard a Scotchman by the name of <persRef ref="u">Brown</persRef>, who
							was going to Nova-Scotia, preach at Boston, from the whole of this
							verse, a Sermon which made a deep impression—upon my mind and which I
							have retained to this day— His subject was the opportunity and
							inducement presented by affliction, for the faithful Study of the holy
							Scriptures; and the peculiar fitness of the Scriptures to afford
							consolation in affliction. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap in
							generalizing the Sentiment of the Psalmist discarded its appropriated
							character, considered the text as an unqualified commendation of
							affliction, and in his argument drew closely to the conclusion that
							human happiness consists of human misery. This is a position upon which
							it is more easy to be eloquent than persuasive— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Burnap said that his text was one of the most consolatory
							sentences that ever fell from the pen of man—and that it afforded a
							solution to the most perplexing mystery of divine <pb n="83" type="ms"
							/>Providence—the permission of evil, upon Earth—and then he expatiated
							largely upon the uses of adversity—which <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> says, like the Toad,
							ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head— The French
							proverb says a quelque chose, malheur est bon, and the English one It is
							an ill wind that blows nobody good— The topic is common-place, and apt
							to run into the wild extravagances of the Stoics— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown’s treatment of the text was more
							instructive— After Church I visited <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi

						<p>Snow all Night— This morning the ground was covered, and it continued to
							Snow at intervals till noon— In the evening there was rain— I took my
							usual walk before dinner, and for the rest of the day wrote little and
							read much— My Diary Index was nearly four months in arrear, besides the
							old one of nine years. A few days will redeem the last. There is nothing
							that brings home to me the rapid lapse of time so effectively as the
							constant accumulation of these arrears— I answered <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
							Letter, and made some observations upon the present State of Europe—
							Perhaps the most important point of view in which we should consider it
							is the influence which it will exercise over this Country. Its first
							effect will be, or rather has been to strengthen the principle of
							democracy over all Europe and America, and it will proportionably
							diminish the securities of property— In England the Reform in Parliament
							cannot be effected without intrenching upon very extensive rights of
							property— The reduction of taxes will necessarily require at least a
							partial spunging of the National debt— It is scarcely possible to
							foresee the extent to which this will stagger the rights of property and
							shatter the confidence of credit—the abolition of tithes must overthrow
							the established Church, and dissolve the connection between Church and
							State, and shake the pillars of the Christian Religion. That it will
							only shake its pillars I hope and believe— If the gates of Hell shall
							not prevail against it, neither will the Revolutions of Empires, nor the
							Convulsions of the People— In France the Alliance between political
							reform and religious infidelity is closer than in England. It is every
							where formidable— The fall of the Church in England will exclude the
							Bishops from the House of Peers, and the Hereditary rights of the
							temporal peerage will not much longer withstand the consuming blaze of
							public opinion: A hereditary crown, has no support in popular sentiment,
							and none in reason, but as forming part of one system with an hereditary
							Peerage— All are equally obnoxious to democracy— The abolition of
							Slavery, will pass like a pestilence over all the British Colonies in
							the West-Indies; it may prove an Earthquake upon this Continent— The
							present English Ministry are nearly as much pledged to it, as to the
							Reform in Parliament— They will flinch from it, and forfeit their
							pledge, but they will probably not last long; a <pb n="84" type="ms"
							/>more democratic ministry will succeed, and reform will not, cannot
							stop short, till it makes an effective attempt for the abolition of
							Slavery— This is perhaps the only part of the doctrine of European
							democracy which will find no favour here. It may aggravate the condition
							of the Slaves in our Southern States; but the result of the Missouri
							Question, and the attitude of Parties, has silenced all the declaimers
							for the abolition of Slavery in the Union— This State of things however
							is not to continue forever— It is possible that the danger of the
							abolition doctrine, when brought home to the Southern States, may teach
							them the value of the Union; the only thing that can maintain their
							system of Slavery. However this may be I apprehend that the inevitable
							predominance of democracy which is impending over Europe, will not end
							without producing bitter fruits in our own Country—</p>

							were bounded by the present life— His duties to his neighbour were under
							no stronger guarantee than the Laws of the Land, and the opinions of the
							world. The tendency of this condition upon a mind of great compass and
							powerful resources is to produce insincerity and duplicity which were
							his besetting sins through life. He says nothing of his adventure with
								<persRef ref="walker-elizabeth3">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Walker</persRef>, nor of the correspondence to which it gave
							rise—but it is extant, though it forms no part of this Edition of his
							works. Small returned to Europe, about the time that Jefferson left the
							College in 1762. after <pb n="85" type="ms"/>introducing him as a
							student at Law to <persRef ref="wythe-george">George Wythe</persRef>,
							and to the acquaintance and table of <persRef ref="fauquier-francis"
								>Governor Fauquier</persRef>, the ablest man who had ever filled
							that Office— His friendship with Wythe continued through life. In 1769.
							he was chosen a member of the house of delegates, and so continued until
							the Revolution— He began by an effort to obtain a permission for the
							emancipation of Slaves, which failed, and he claims the invention of
							Committees of Correspondence between the Colonies in 1773— With the
							Revolution commenced the important Series of his Labours, in Congress
							and in the Legislature of Virginia— He was foremost among those who
							pressed forward to the Separation from Great-Britain, and the most
							active and energetic of those who after that event, laboured to adapt
							the Legislation of the State, to its new Republican Character— By one
							Act he converted all Entailments into Fee-simple Estates: by another he
							abolished the Law of Primogeniture—by a third for the Establishment of
							Religious Liberty, he cut off the Establishment of the Episcopal Church,
							and by a fourth he partially introduced Juries into the Chancery Court,
							though <persRef ref="pendleton-edmund">Pendleton</persRef> defeated this
							by an amendment, making the call of a Jury, contingent upon the option
							of either party to the suit— I propose to continue these notes as I
							proceed in reading the book.</p>

						<p><date>12. VI. </date>Wednesday. The Sky cleared off in the Night, and this was a day of bright Sun-shine,
							with a North-wester, and growing colder from Morn to Night— I took my
							walk before breakfast, and passed the remainder of the day without
							interruption at home. There is no condition of existence which affords
							me here and in the winter Season so much enjoyment, with an occasional
							visitor now and then for a variety of conversation. My only discontent
							is with myself for my own misapplication of Time— I wrote this day a
							Letter to <persRef ref="hobby-william">William Hobby</persRef> at
							Boston, in answer to two received from him; read a remainder of the
							third Canto of <persRef ref="childeharold">Childe Harold</persRef>, and
							a few pages in the first Volume of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef>— I finished the Memoir of his life, which
							terminates on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of March 1790. when
							he arrived at New-York to take upon him the Office of Secretary of
							State. There it ends, and there as a work of much interest to the
							present and future ages it should have begun— It is much to be regretted
							that he did not tell his own Story from that time until his retirement
							from the Office of President of the United States in 1809. It was then
							that all the good and all the evil parts of his character were brought
							into action— His ardent Passion for Liberty and the Rights of Man— His
							Patriotism—the depth and compass of his understanding—the extent and
							variety of his knowledge, and the enviable faculty of applying it to his
							own purposes— The perpetual watchfulness of public opinion, and the
							pliability of principle and temper with which he accommodated to it his
							own designs and opinions, all these were in ceaseless operation during
							those twenty years—and with them were combined a rare mixture of infidel
							philosophy, and Epicurean Morals— Of burning Ambition, and of Stoical
							self-controul—of deep duplicity and of generous sensibility, between
							which two qualities and a treacherous and inventive Memory, his conduct
							towards his rivals and opponents appears one tissue of inconsistency—
							His treatment of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>,
							of <persRef ref="knox-henry2">Knox</persRef>, of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef>, who made him President of the
							United States, and lastly of me, is marked with features of perfidy,
							worthy of <persRef ref="tiberius">Tiberius Caesar</persRef>, or <persRef
								ref="louis-xi">Louis the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef>
							of France— This double-dealing character was often imputed <pb n="86"
								type="ms"/>to him during his life time, and was sometimes exposed—
							His Letter to <persRef ref="mazzei-phillip">Mazzei</persRef> and the
							agonizing efforts which he afterwards made to explain it away. His most
							insidious attacks upon my father, with his never ceasing professions of
							respect and affection for his person and character, and his Letter to
								<persRef ref="giles-william">Giles</persRef> concerning me, in which
							there is scarcely a single word of truth indicate a memory so pandering
							to the will that in deceiving others he seems to have begun by deceiving
							himself— The doubly posthumous attack upon James A. Bayard, admits not
							even of that extenuation— After bargaining through <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">Samuel Smith</persRef> for the vote of Bayard in
							1801. and obtaining it by the pledge which he authorised Smith to give,
							he first violates his pledge, then solemnly denies that he had given
							it—attempts to pervert the transaction into a charge against Bayard of
							tampering with Smith in behalf of <persRef ref="burr-aaron"
								>Burr</persRef> five years afterwards, when Bayard and Smith had
							given depositions upon Oath to the facts. Jefferson makes a private
							memorandum, charging Bayard’s statement with falsehood, and affirming
							that it is contradicted by Smith, when in fact Smith’s deposition
							confirms that of Bayard completely. This Memorandum he carefully files
							in his Porte Folio, and eleven years after the death of Bayard leaves it
							to be published by his own Executor after his own death— In the discord
							of human nature could a baser string be sounded?</p>

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at<space/>I walked round the Capitol Square before breakfast,

								<persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef>, and a long Conversation with him upon the
							Prospects of the Country, which appear to me nearly desperate— The
							System of internal improvement, and the promotion of domestic Industry
							which from the close of the last War with Great-Britain, had been
							pursued till the present Administration came into power, and as they
							offer in its stead the remission of Taxes, they will in all probability
							be supported by the People— The controul of the general Government over
							the Separate States will also be abandoned, and the Powers of the
							Judiciary Department prostrated— The People will also sustain this— The
							entire discharge of the National Debt will dissolve one of the strongest
							ties which hold the Union together—and the doom of the National Bank at
							the expiration of its Charter is already sealed— Of the two Systems that
							of the present Administration sacrifices the future and remote benefit
							to the present, and therefore addresses itself more to the feelings, and
							prejudices of the People. A War in Europe, which can scarcely fail to
							happen within the next two years must necessarily change the aspect of
							parties and the objects of political contention in this Country— But
							whether its effects will be to recement the Union or to consummate its
							dissolution is beyond the reach of my foresight— It will perhaps create
							a new National debt <pb n="87" type="ms"/>and its tendency may be to
							save the Bank and the Judiciary; but it will add new virulence to the
							rancour of party Spirit, and put keener instruments into the hands of
							needy, unprincipled and desperate Ambition— There is a Providence which
							brings good out of evil, and in which all my hopes of the future are
							concentrated. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall told me that the

								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van

							prevalent rumour that a challenge passed between them— I wrote a Letter
							to <persRef ref="robinson-jeremy">Jeremy Robinson</persRef>, in answer
							to one received from him at Quincy, and read 20. Stanzas of the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Canto of <persRef ref="childeharold"
								>Childe Harold</persRef>, and a few pages of the first Volume of
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>— There are in
							the Memoir of his Life some very meagre minutes of the debates in
							Congress upon the Declaration of Independence and upon the
							Confederation—the last on the single question whether the votes in
							Congress under that compact should be individual or by States. In his
							account of the passage of the Declaration of Independence there is one
							of those errors of Memory, which though of little Importance in itself
							casts a shade of distrust upon his whole narrative— He says that after
							the Declaration was brought in and adopted on the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July; it was signed by every member
							present, and that the copy, engrossed upon parchment, afterwards brought
							in and signed by all the members present on the second of August, and by
							others afterwards was a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> signature by all
							the members— Now the original Declaration unanimously adopted by the
							States on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July was not a
							manuscript, but a printed paper— It was not signed by all the members,
							but like all the other Acts and Ordinances of Congress at that time, by
								<persRef ref="hancock-john">John Hancock</persRef> President, and
								<persRef ref="thomson-charles">Charles Thomson</persRef> Secretary—
							It is yet extant in the Archives of the Department of State where I have
							often seen it— The exception that he makes of <persRef
								ref="dickinson-john2">John Dickinson</persRef>, as the only member
							who did not sign on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July shews
							that as his Memory ceased to be tenacious it became inventive—</p>

						<p>I rose this morning with a continued pain in my left side, which I
							attributed to my self-exposure yesterday, and which deterred me from
							repeating it this day. The morning was cold, and about noon came on a
							Snow Storm which continued all the remainder of the day and Evening. A
							person named <persRef ref="u">Ormsby</persRef> came with a Family
							Grammar, upon one large sheet, like a sheet Almanack; invented by
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-jeremiah">Jeremiah Greenleaf</persRef> at
							New-York— He said he came to me by direction of the inventor; but I told
							him I had no present occasion for a grammar in my family— He said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf wished for a recommendatory
							certificate from me for his work; which upon a general rule, I declined
							to give— I received a Letter from <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.
								Calhoun</persRef>; now Vice President of the United States, relating
							to his present controversy with <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef> and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">William
								H. Crawford</persRef>— He questions me concerning the Letter of
							General Jackson to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, which Crawford alledges to have been
							produced at the Cabinet Meetings on the Seminole War; and asks for
							copies if I think proper to give them of Crawford’s Letter to me which I
							received last Summer, and of my answer— I answered M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s Letter immediately; rigorously
							confining myself to the direct object of his enquiries— This is a new
							bursting out of the old and rancorous feud between Crawford and Calhoun,
							both parties to which <pb n="88" type="ms"/>after suspending their
							animosities, and combining together to effect my ruin, are appealing to
							me for testimony to sustain themselves; each against the other. This is
							one of the occasions upon which I shall eminently need the direction of
							a higher power to guide me in every step of my conduct— I see my duty to
							discard all consideration of their treatment of me—to adhere in every
							thing that I shall say or write to the truth— To assert nothing
							positively of which I am not absolutely certain— To deny nothing, upon
							which there remains a scruple of doubt upon my Memory— To conceal
							nothing which it may be lawful to divulge, and which may promote truth
							and Justice between the parties— With these principles, I see further
							the necessity for Caution and Prudence in the course I shall take— The
							bitter enmity of all three of the parties, Jackson, Calhoun and Crawford
							against me, an enmity the more virulent, because kindled by their own
							ingratitude and injustice to me— The interest which every one of them
							and all their partizans have in keeping up that load of obloquy, and
							public odium which their foul calumnies have brought down upon me; and
							the disfavour in which I stand before a majority of the People, excited
							against me by their artifices. Their demerits to me are proportioned to
							the obligations to me—Jackson’s the greatest—Crawford’s the
							next—Calhoun’s the least of positive obligation, but darkened by his
							double faced setting himself up as a Candidate for the Presidency
							against me in 1821. his prevarications between Jackson and me in 1824.
							and his icy-hearted dereliction, of all the decencies of social
							intercourse with me, solely from the terror of Jackson, since the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1829— I walk between burning
							ploughshares— Let me be mindful where I place my foot— I called after
							answering Calhoun upon <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> at his lodgings; where
							he is confined by lameness, from a hurt taken, while going in the Night
							to Baltimore, about a fortnight since— He was called there by the
							extreme illness of his youngest and favourite daughter <persRef
								ref="wirt-agnes">Agnes</persRef>—whom he could not save— She died of
							the Scarlet fever— He returned here as soon after performing the last
							melancholy duties to his child, as possible— Here, he is the leading
							Counsel of <persRef ref="peck-james">Judge Peck</persRef>, District
							Judge of Missouri, under impeachment before the Senate; and whom with
							another young man from Missouri named <persRef ref="u">Grimm</persRef>,
							I found with him— I had a conversation of nearly two hours, with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt; chiefly upon Public Affairs, and the
							prospects of the Country; upon which his anticipations are as gloomy,
							and more desponding than my own— He sees as I do all the dangers
							impending over the Union; but has not the same hope that I indulge of
							the preservation of the Constitution by the effect of new interests and
							passions, and parties to spring from the Revolutions in Europe and their
							influence upon our Affairs— I cling to the last straw of hope, and where
							I see not even that within my grasp—rely upon that over-ruling
							Providence which has so often saved us before— I spoke also to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt of the Letter I had received from
							Calhoun and of my answer— He told me much of what has already passed
							between the parties, and of which I had not heard before. Calhoun
							applied to him and to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe last Spring
							Crawford had written before, the Letter to <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Forsyth</persRef> which had been put into the hands of Jackson, and
							upon which explanations had been called for from Calhoun— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt gave certificates to Calhoun which for the time satisfied Jackson,
							but <pb n="89" type="ms"/>to which, when communicated to Crawford, by a
							Letter, addressed to Calhoun, in nine sheets of paper, he replied in a
							tone of insult and acrimony, for which Wirt said he could account in no
							other manner than by supposing them the result of a deranged intellect.
							But in this Letter from Crawford to Calhoun, Wirt says there are
							extracts from my answer to Crawford’s Letter of last Summer; and also
							(which surprized me exceedingly) a Letter or certificate from <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef>, confirming
							Crawford’s statement about this <persRef ref="rhea-john">Johnny
								Rhea</persRef> Letter, and its effect— I told Wirt that
							Crowninshield had not been present at any one of those Cabinet Meetings;
							but was during the whole time when they were held in Massachusetts— I
							reminded Wirt also that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was the author of the
							Article in the National Intelligencer of 27. July 1818. and reminded him
							of the repeated and earnest discussions between him and me, urging
							alterations in it. This had escaped his Memory, but he recollected it
							when mentioned by me. He also spoke to me of my Election to the next
							Congress, and of my consent to be elected which he approved as correct
							in Republican principle; but he had no doubt that I should be personally
							ill-treated and insulted in the house. I asked him if he thought I could
							assign the fear of this as a reason for declining to serve— He said
							certainly not— I asked him if it was a reason which I could not give,
							whether it was a motive that I ought to feel? This he did not answer— In
							coming home I called at <persRef ref="stone-william">Stone’s</persRef>
							shop, and left the impression of a Seal of the Smith arms, which I
							received yesterday from <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>—
							I wrote to him and looked over my Diary of 1818.</p>

						<p><date>15. V. </date>Saturday. The Snow Storm which began yesterday morning continued all last Night,

								ref="greenleaf-william">William C. Greenleaf</persRef> went this

							difficulty—the drifts of Snow being so deep that almost all passing in

								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">S. L. Southard</persRef>, and part of
							one to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>—and read
							20. Stanzas’s of the fourth Canto of <persRef ref="childeharold">Childe
								Harold</persRef>, and a few pages of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef>. He states in the Memoir that the Boston Port
							Bill, closing that Port on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							<unclear>June</unclear> 1774 was received while the Legislature of Virginia were in
							Session— That he with <persRef ref="henry-patrick">Patrick
								Henry</persRef>, <persRef ref="lee-richard2;lee-francis">R. H. and
								F. L. Lee</persRef> and a few others younger members of the Assembly
							had a private Meeting at which they <hi rend="italic">cooked up</hi>, a
							Resolution for appointing the first of June as a day of fasting,
							humiliation and prayer—a very unusual thing in Virginia, there having
							been no example of it for twenty years before— This they got <persRef
								ref="nicholas-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas</persRef> to move, because his grave and religious
							character was more in unison with the tone of their Resolution—it passed
							without opposition—and the effect of the day, through the whole Colony
							was like a shock of Electricity— Here is a convocation of the whole
							People of a Colony, a solemn religious Assembly, an Appeal to Almighty
							God, and imploring of his aid for relief from deep distress and
							impending calamity, <hi rend="italic">cooked up</hi>, for mere political
							effect, by a man who believes not a word of the Resolution which he
							borrows from <persRef ref="rushworth-john">Rushworth</persRef> and the
							Puritans, and who ashamed for its glaring inconsistency with his known
							opinions to offer it himself prevails upon a grave and religious man to
							offer it, and thereby to secure for it the credit of <hi rend="italic"
								>Sincerity</hi>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson was no
							friend to the <pb n="90" type="ms"/>connection between Church and
							State—but what is this? There is a tone of irreligious levity in the
							narrative contrasted with the character of the measure itself and with
							the effect which it had upon the People, which marks the twofold
							characteristic of the disbeliever in a future state, and of the
							double-dealer in the present. Upon the passage of this Resolution, the
							Governor dissolved the Assembly upon which the same Caucus, which had
							cooked up the pious Resolution for a fast-day, agreed to an association,
							instructed the Committee of Correspondence to propose a Continental
							Congress to be held annually, and recommended a Provincial Convention to
							be held at Williamsburg, part of whose functions should be to appoint
							Delegates to the general Congress— Of this Convention Jefferson himself
							was elected a member and prepared a draught of Instructions for the
							delegates to be chosen to the Congress. He was taken sick on the road,
							and prevented from attending the Convention, but sent on two copies of
							his draught; one to Patrick Henry and the other to <persRef
								ref="randolph-peyton">Peyton Randolph</persRef>— Henry did not
							produce his copy, but Peyton Randolph laid his on the table for perusal
							and announced it to the Convention. The paper was read generally by the
							members, approved by many though thought too bold for the present state
							of things—and printed in pamphlet form under the title of a “Summary
							view of the rights of British America”— The subsequent adventures of
							this pamphlet in England are curious, and it is itself curious— It is in
							the form of an address to the <persRef ref="george-iii">king</persRef>,
							far more insulting in its language than the famous Letter of Junius— It
							asserts that the British Parliament never had any right to Legislate for
							the British Colonies in any case whatever— That the king had no right to
							grant Lands in America; the rightful tenures of all the Lands in the
							Colonies being allodial— That the king had no right to dissolve the
							Colonial Legislatures, and that since the Revolution of 1688 no king of
							England had ever exercised the right of dissolving Parliament— The most
							ludicrous part of this last Assertion is a note by the author in his
								77<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year that on further enquiry he
							has found two instances of Dissolutions of Parliament, before its
							natural death; both by <persRef ref="william-iii">William the
								third</persRef>— He would have been puzzled to find since the
							Revolution of 1688. or at least since the Septennial Act, a single
							instance of a Parliament suffered to run out its whole term— That
							Patrick Henry should have forborne to produce his copy of such a paper,
							may be accounted for, by better reasons than his laziness. That such a
							paper, though thought too bold, should pass for a “summary view of the
								<hi rend="italic">rights</hi> of British America” shews the
							cormorant swallow of heated party times— The argument of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson that the emigration of the first
							colonists from Great-Britain, which came to America, was an
							expatriation, dissolving their allegiance, and constituting them
							Independent Sovereignties, was doubtful in theory, and unfounded in
							fact— The original Colonists came out with Charters from the king, with
							the rights and the duties of British Subjects— They were entitled to the
							Protection of the British king and owed him Allegiance— They had
							submitted to commercial Legislation by Parliament, as a part of the
							Royal authority exercised over them by the king—but never to taxation by
							a Legislature in which they were not represented— They submitted to Acts
							of Parliament as Ordinances of the king not incompatible with their
							Charters. But when Parliament undertook to tax them, for the benefit of
							the People of England, this was a violation of their rights both by
							Charter and by the Common Law; and was resisted— The Instructions
							adopted by the Convention, were in a far more moderate, more rational,
							and therefore more firm and determined Spirit—</p>

						<p>The Snow Storm continued all last Night, and did not entirely subside
							this Morning. Not much Snow fell this day, but the wind blew fresh the
							fallen Snow drifted, and the sky was dark and lowering the whole day— As

							Stars dimly seen as if in strife with the tempest— There was no service
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, nor probably in any

							walked out, as far as the Market at the Tyber. The drifts between our

							difficulty in passing them, but from thence the Middle roads and side
							paths were already so much trampled down, and shovell’d off that the
							passing was altogether easy. Numbers of People were out walking, on
							Horseback in wheel Carriages, and in Sleighs, with one, two, and four
							horses— There are not upon an average five days in a year when a Sleigh
							can run, in this City. I never saw so many in the Street at one time,
							and should not have believed there were so many to bring out. I might
							have extended my walk, round the Capitol Square, but returned as the
							dusk of Evening was coming on— The Southern Mail due on Friday arrived
							this Evening— The Northern did not come—not that of this day even from
							Baltimore— I received a letter from my nephew <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">T. B. Adams j<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> who has returned to Fort Moultrie again. I
							finished my Letter to <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>—
							Read a few pages of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>,
							and finished the Notes appended to his Memoir. There was something so
							strange to me in the assertion contained in his projected instructions
							to the Virginia delegates in the first Congress, that the Kings of
							England since the Revolution of 1688. had never exercised the
							Prerogative of dissolving Parliament, that I spent three hours at least
							of this day in looking to the Law, and the Testimony, upon this
							historical Statement— As to the law—<persRef ref="blackstone-william"
								>Blackstone</persRef>—1. p. 188 is as explicit as language can
							express that the dissolution of Parliament at his pleasure is a
							prerogative of the king; and <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume</persRef> in
							his account of the conviction and execution of <persRef
								ref="tresilian-robert">Tresilian</persRef>, speaks of it as an
							infamous transaction throughout, and particularly alluding to the charge
							that Tresilian had advised the king that he might dissolve Parliament at
							his Pleasure, says that the opinion was justified even upon the
							restricted doctrines of Prerogative in his own times— As to the fact, I
							found in <persRef ref="smollett-tobias">Smollett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="scott-walter">Scott</persRef>, that from the accession of the
							House of Hanover till the year 1774. not one single Parliament had been
							suffered to live out its seven years— All had been dissolved by the
							Royal Prerogative—usually within a few months before the expiration of
							their term; but the Parliament which met on December 1741. was dissolved
							by <persRef ref="george-ii">George 2</persRef> in June 1747. (Smollett
							3. p. 389) The very Parliament which existed when M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson penned this address to the
								<persRef ref="george-iii">King</persRef> instructing him upon the
							exercise of his rights, was dissolved on the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of September 1774 by Royal Proclamation, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s Address had it been adopted by
							Congress, must have been presented to the king, at the happiest of
							moments to make the ignorance historical and Constitutional of the
							Addressers, the scorn and fable of the whole Nation. The gravity of the
							Note on the present republication of this paper, admitting the
							Dissolution of two Parliaments by <persRef ref="william-iii">King
								William</persRef>; as if he had found no other instances, since, is
							diverting. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson was not a member of
							the first Congress— In March 1775 he was elected to the second, as a
							substitute for <persRef ref="randolph-peyton">Peyton Randolph</persRef>
							in the event of his being called away as he was. <pb n="92" type="ms"
								/>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson took his Seat on the
								21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of June 1775— There is an account
							of the second Petition of Congress to the king, drawn principally by
								<persRef ref="dickinson-john2">John Dickinson</persRef>, much to
							Jefferson’s dissatisfaction, and not less so to that of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef> as I have often heard him say.
							During the War of the Revolution he could never speak of it without
							indignation— Dickinson’s Revolutionary Standard was as far below my
							father’s temperate mark as Jefferson’s was above it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jefferson was also the Reporter of the
							answer to <persRef ref="north-frederick">Lord North’s</persRef>
							conciliatory proposition. He adopted principally the answer already
							given by the Virginia Assembly— From this he passes to the notes upon

						<p>Clear and Cold— The Snow continues to drift, and there was no Mail, even
							from Baltimore. <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> went to
							Georgetown, and did not return till Night; but accomplished the business
							which he has been baffled by the weather a full fortnight in effecting—
							The Potowmack is now frozen over—the Mills are frozen up, and the road
							to and from them is impassable. I have taken precisely this moment to
							try the experiment of some business extraordinary, the event of which
							can scarcely be ascertained before the Season for the effective working
							of the Mills will return; about the last of March— I walked between noon
							and 2. P.M. round the Capitol Square— The road was barely passable, down
							the descent of the Capitol Hill on the North side, where the drifts are
							the deepest— The rest of the way was pretty well trampled down. I met
							while out 38 Sleighs of all kinds and constructions. Perhaps an equal
							number of Carriages upon wheels— The hack Sleighs were let yesterday at
							five dollars an hour— I met in my walk an Indian Chief who recognized
							me, and with a look of old acquaintance offered me his hand which I took
							and shook heartily. We could not speak to each other, and I did not
							distinctly remember his person; but believe it was one of the Cherokees
							who were here with the <persRef ref="ross-john">Ross</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="ridge-john">Ridge</persRef> during <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
							administration— I met also <persRef ref="hutchinson-israel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hutchinson</persRef> our Consul at
							Lisbon, whom I did not recognize until he told me his name—nor did I
							immediately recollect that he had called upon me last Summer at Quincy—
							In philosophising upon the decay of my own memory, I remark, that my
							recollection of persons whom I have but casually seen and of their names
							is most imperfect— This I attribute to the great multitudes of persons
							whom I have seen, and who have been introduced to me, but with whom I
							have had no relation of intimate acquaintance— There is always something
							mortifying to the pride of a man who remembers another, not to be
							recognized by him— But there are bounds to the retention of the human
							memory, and the nomenclator of the antient Romans was a useful Officer.
								<persRef ref="smith-gerrit">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gerrit
								Smith</persRef> of the State of New-York called, and delivered to me
							a bundle of English Newspapers from <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph

							for the next Volume of his Annual Register— M<hi rend="superscript"

							Evening to <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieut<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> T. B. Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef>
							at Fort Moultrie S.C.— Read nothing—but Newspapers. There is in the
							Memoir of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> Life a copy of the Declaration of Independence
							as finally adopted by Congress—with marginal Notes, Italics in brackets;
							and of the final declaratory paragraph a concurrent column, shewing the
							paper as reported by the Committee—these he gives because he says the
							Sentiments of man, are known, not <pb n="93" type="ms"/>only by what
							they receive, but by what they reject— There is also at the close of the
							fourth Volume, a fac simile of his original draught with the alterations
							proposed by <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="franklin-benjamin">Doctor Franklin</persRef>— There were in the
							paper reported by the Committee, a good many erasures and considerable
							alterations from the draught— They appear to me to have been all
							improvements upon it. The draught was declamatory, argumentative, and
							overloaded with crudities— A great deal too much of these was left in
							the Report of the Committee— Too much even in the final
							Declaration—which is nevertheless one of the best composed State Papers
							that I ever saw— The Declaration was a novelty in the annals of the
							world— It was founded upon the principles of Natural Right. It was an
							Apology to the world for the revolt of thirteen Colonies united into one
							confederacy, separating themselves from the Nation of which they had
							formed a part, and announcing themselves as a new Nation to the world—
							The reason assigned for this Declaration, is respect for the opinions of
							mankind—the cause alledged is the tyranny of the king, supported by the
							People of Great Britain— The acts of tyranny are specified— The fact of
							previous petitions disregarded is alledged; the concurrence of the
							British People with the <persRef ref="george-iii">king</persRef>
							affirmed, and the necessity for the Separation, is conclusively deduced
							from these facts— There was struck out by Congress from the Report of
							the Committee 1. A frantic paragraph against the Slave trade and negro
							Slavery— 2. A paragraph affirming that the Colonists in constituting
							their forms of government had adopted one common king with
							Great-Britain, but that submission to their Parliament was no part of
							the Colonial Constitution, nor ever in idea— 3. A paragraph quite
							declamatory against the British people— For re-electing members of
							Parliament opposed to the Colonial Cause, and for permitting their chief
							magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood, but
							Scotch and foreign mercenaries to invade and destroy us. 4. About half
							the final declaratory paragraph. These two last alterations appear by
							the fac-simile to have been proposed by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Franklin in the Committee, and are there enclosed in brackets, with a
							marginal entry of the words “a different phraseology inserted.” The
							Solemn and sublime appeal to Heaven, at the beginning and close of the
							declaratory paragraph was added in Congress, and not “cooked up” by the
							Committee. The parts struck out by Congress sound to my ears like
							effusions of frenzy— The paragraph against Slavery indiscreet beyond
							measure, and not a little unjust. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson says that in the ground which he took that the British
							Parliament never had any authority over the Colonies, any more than the
							Danes and Saxons of his own age had over the People of England, he never
							could get any one to agree with him but <persRef ref="wythe-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wythe</persRef>— It was too absurd. In
							truth the question of right as between Parliament and the Colonies, was
							one of those upon which it is much easier to say who was wrong, than who
							was right— The pretension that they had the right to bind the Colonies
							in all cases whatever, and that which denied them the right to bind in
							any case whatever, were the two extremes, equally unfounded—and yet it
							is extremely difficult to draw the line where the authority of
							Parliament commenced, and where it closed— <persRef ref="pitt-william"
								>Lord Chatham’s</persRef> line was taxation— <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund">Burke’s</persRef> was usage, precedent, and wise
							discretion— My father’s is in the Resolutions of the first Congress—
							There is a very remarkable passage in page 39 and 40 of the Memoir,
							shewing that although Jefferson was not inclined in his last days to
							avow his perseverance in his opinions upon Negro-Slavery, he was willing
							to let them loose after his death—the motive for which appears to be to
							secure to himself posthumous fame as a prophet.</p>

								ref="greenleaf-john;greenleaf-william">John and W. C.
								Greenleaf</persRef> at Georgetown—difficulties of purchasing flour—
							Having retrieved the arrears of the last four Months in the Index to my
							Diary, I began with that of near nine years from 10. Sept<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> 1800. I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="walsh-robert">R. Walsh</persRef>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">jun</hi> re-urging me to write upon the late
							Colonial trade arrangement with Great-Britain; and a note from <persRef
								ref="hodgson-william">W. B. Hodgson</persRef>; with some proof
							sheets of the next Volume of the Transactions of the American
							Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, containing his Speculations upon
							the Berber Language. I answered a Letter received last August from
								<persRef ref="lee-richard2">R. H. Lee</persRef>—and had time left to
							read only a few pages of the Correspondence of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>— His continuance in
							Congress after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence was
							short— In October 1776. he was elected by his County a member of the
							Legislature of Virginia; where he took his Seat, after resigning that in
							Congress— From that time till June 1779 he continued a member of the
							Legislature, and was then elected the Governor of the Commonwealth— In
							the interval he was occupied with the revisal of the Legislation of the
							State. Even before the Declaration of Independence, the Organization of
							the State Government had been altered by the Legislature itself; from
							the Royal Charter Government, to what they called a Constitution, but
							which was never submitted to the People— By this anomaly the State of
							Virginia has been governed to this day. They have now however a more
							formal Constitution prepared by a Convention about a year since, and
							adopted by the People, but not yet in operation— In the revision of the
							old System of Laws M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson took an
							active and leading part— He presented Bills for the establishment of
							Courts of Justice—for converting tenancies in tail into fee simple—for
							prohibiting the importation of Negro Slaves—for abolishing the
							establishment of the Episcopal Church; and for asserting the natural
							right of expatriation, and prescribing the mode of exercising it. He
							also proposed and carried through a Bill for a general revision of the
							whole Code of Laws, by which the Colony had been governed; and he was
							appointed with four others to execute the work. One of the Committee
							soon resigned, and one died. The three others divided the work between
							them— Jefferson had the Common Law and Statutes till 4. <persRef
								ref="james-i">James I.</persRef> when the Virginia Legislature was
							first established— <persRef ref="wythe-george">Wythe</persRef> the
							British Statutes from that time to <hi rend="italic">the present
								day</hi> (1776) and <persRef ref="pendleton-edmund"
								>Pendleton</persRef> the Virginia Laws— Now if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s pretension that the British
							Parliament had <hi rend="italic">never</hi> possessed the right of
							enacting Laws for Virginia had been well founded, what would M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wythe have had to do— Every British
							Statute affecting Virginia from 1607. to 1776 was a flagrant usurpation,
							which by the Declaration of Independence alone would have been swept
							away. This thought however never occurred to the Committee— The first
							question they settled was not to abolish the whole existing system of
							Laws and prepare a new and complete Institute, but to preserve the
							general system and only modify it to the present order of things—
							Pendleton was for the former, and Lee—Jefferson, with <persRef
								ref="mason-george">Mason</persRef> and Wythe for the latter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson and Pendleton on this occasion
							both changed sides—Pendleton assuming the character of the bold
							innovator, and Jefferson that of the special pleader and defender of
							antient things— He gives the <pb n="95" type="ms"/>reasons of his own
							opinion; but not those of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pendleton. But
							there were far other reasons than those assigned by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson for not reconstructing the
							edifice of Legislation in Virginia de novo; which he felt and
							understood, though he has had the Prudence not to disclose them— 1. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson was not a Legislator— His Genius
							was <hi rend="italic">de</hi>structive, but not <hi rend="italic"
								>con</hi>structive— He could demolish, deface and cast down— He
							could not build up or preserve— 2. The principle of setting aside the
							whole code of their Legislation, would of itself have emancipated all
							their Slaves— In renovating their Code they must have restored Slavery
							after having abolished it— They must have assumed to themselves all the
							Odium of establishing it as a positive Institution directly in the face
							of all the principles they had proclaimed— They must have abandoned
							their Laws privileging Lands from responsibility for debts—and they must
							have enlarged their elective franchise, confined as it was almost
							exclusively to freeholders— For all this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson was not prepared— It was easier to abolish the Law of
							primogeniture, the establishment of the Episcopal Church—Capitol
							Punishments, except for Treason and Murder, and the Professorships of
							Divinity and the Oriental Languages in William and Mary College— All
							this was accordingly done— But the Lands of the Planters retained their
							exemption from liability for the debts of their owners— The freeholders
							retained their exclusive right of voting at Elections—and the bill on
							the subject of Slaves was a mere digest of the existing laws respecting
							them, without any intimation of a plan for a future and general
							emancipation. This was however agreed upon by the Committee, to be
							proposed by way of amendment, on the passage of the Bill— But it was
							found that the public mind would not bear the proposition—the amendment
							was never offered, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson contents
							himself with a posthumous prophecy that it must soon come or that worse
							will follow— With regard to the criminal Law the Committee substituted
							for some capital punishments the Lex Talionis, which on further
							reflection M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson justly
							disapproves—and he attempted to introduce Juries into the Chancery
							Court, which Pendleton defeated by an Amendment making it optional with
							either of the parties. The Committee after near three years, had
							accomplished their labour of revision of all the Laws in 126 bills,
							making a printed folio of 90 pages only— These bills were brought
							forward, piece meal in the Legislature until 1785 when most of them by
							the exertions of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Madison</persRef> were adopted.</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Duponceau</persRef> upon the Berber

								ref="walsh-robert">Robert Walsh</persRef>— My progress with
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> writings is slow— He was elected Governor of
							Virginia in June 1779. and continued in that Office two years at the end
							of which he resigned it— The period was extremely critical; and this
							resignation was afterwards made <pb n="96" type="ms"/>by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s enemies a frequent subject of
							reproach against him. He appears disinclined to give any detail of the
							Events of that Time in the present Memoir; but refers for them to
								<persRef ref="girardin-louis">Girardin’s</persRef> History of
							Virginia, of which he says the materials for that period were furnished
							by him— The State was invaded by the army of <persRef
								ref="cornwallis-charles">Lord Cornwallis</persRef>, and he says he
							resigned from a belief that the public would have more confidence in a
							Military chief, and that the Military Commander being invested with the
							Civil power also, both might be wielded with more energy, promptitude
							and effect, for the defence of the State— <persRef ref="nelson-thomas"
								>General Nelson</persRef> was appointed his Successor, and
							participated in the glory of the capture of Cornwallis— Perhaps M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s resignation was an expedient
							to save him the mortification of a failure to be re-elected. The English
							Colonel <persRef ref="tarleton-banastre">Tarleton</persRef> says in his
							History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781, that Cornwallis being
							informed of a Meeting of the Governor and Assembly of Virginia at
							Charlottesville, sent him with a detachment to break them up which he
							effected— He took seven members of the Assembly. “The attempt to secure
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson (he says) was ineffectual:
							he discovered the British dragoons from his house, which stands on the
							point of a mountain, before they could approach him, and he provided for
							his personal safety by a precipitate retreat.” This is a mean and
							spiteful manner of relating the incident, but the fact could not but
							affect the popularity of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson at the
							time; and Carter’s Mountain, to which he retired, was the theme of many
							a gibe and jeer upon him, to the last period of his life. <persRef
								ref="frederick-ii">Frederic the second</persRef>, made a precipitate
							retreat from the battle of Molwitz, which after he was gone, his
								<persRef ref="vonschwerin-kurt">General Schwerin</persRef> won for
							him— He neither conceals nor slurs over the incident in his Memoirs of
							his own Times, but says it taught him a lesson for all his after-life—
							Never to despair— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson may have
							learnt the same lesson, but it is evident that he reflected with no
							satisfaction upon that portion of his life when he was Governor of
							Virginia.</p>

						<p>Morning visitors engrossed the morning. <persRef ref="cresson-elliott"
								>Elliot Cresson</persRef> is here as a delegate from the
							Pennsylvania Colonization Society— The general Society here last Evening
							had their annual Meeting which I received from the Managers a written
							invitation to attend. Cresson who is of the Society of Friends is a
							member, and ardent Supporter of the Colonization Society, which I never
							have been—believing their principal objects impracticable, and
							entertaining great doubts of the usefulness of their measures which have
							been successful— I therefore did not attend their meeting, and had in

							Cresson candidly what had been and were my impressions on the subject. I
							said that I did not believe it would diminish the number of Slaves in
							the United States by a single individual— And that so far as it did
							effect the emigration of free People of Colour it was rather a public
							injury than a public benefit— This Society however yearly increasing in

							that in time of Peace the President has by the Constitution no power to
							institute a new Mission in the recess of the Senate—though he has such a
							Power as Commander in Chief in time of War— In this case I instituted
							the Mission during the recess— But no despatch was received by the
							Commissioners until after I was out of Office; and they had not
							concluded the Negotiation. <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> issued another Commission, during the recess; and
							they concluded a Treaty, which he sends to the Senate, without sending
							at the same time a nomination of the Commissioners as he ought to have
							done— Tazewell bristles up his virtue, and swaggers about his
							Independence— Says they have no right to expect that his stomach will
							bear now, what it rejected four years ago— The present servility of the
							other Jackson Senators, would now unite with the honesty of the rest,
							and over-rule Tazewell’s scruples, if Jackson would now nominate the
							Commissioners; and if the secret Article were admissible—but that is
							said to be contrary to my instructions, and incompatible with
							neutrality. This secret Article has already been a subject of keen
							debate and of angry collisions in the House of Representatives— <persRef

							a member elect of the next Congress from the interior of New-York— He

							I was in the Senate, often member of each house of the New-York
							Legislature, Speaker of the House of Assembly, Lieutenant
							Governor—prominent as a member of the Convention which altered the
							Constitution of New-York; and now coming in again as a member of the
							next Congress. His Election and mine having taken place about the same
							Time, the Telegraph Newspaper here named Root as one of the persons, who
							would be well qualified to insult me personally, if I should take my
							Seat in the House— He alluded to this, soon after he came in this
							morning—disclaimed every such intention, and said he was not disposed to
							adapt his course of conduct to the advice of any newspaper— He sat with
							me about half an hour, and conversed freely, upon the State Politics of
							New-York. He told me there was much division in the New-York
							Legislature, and it was doubtful whether <persRef ref="sanford-nathan"
								>Sanford</persRef>, now one of the Senators from that State would be

							perhaps <persRef ref="sudam-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							had, often of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sudam— Was not he one of

							a Set of the Congressional Documents of the last Session which he
							afterwards sent me— A person near <persRef ref="brown-jesse"
								>Brown’s</persRef> tavern, accosted and walked on with me a few
							minutes. Said his name was <persRef ref="u">Hall</persRef>, a native of

								<persRef ref="combs-leslie">Leslie Combs</persRef> whom I had seen

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, which I had
							forgotten; and he told me two anecdotes which whether verities or

							Candidate for re-election; upon which he said—well, if my
							fellow-citizens insist upon my serving them another term, I hope they
							will give me a Vice-President in whom I can have some confidence— The

						<p>The Season is unusually severe— Yesterday as we were at dinner; a sudden
							flurry of Snow came up, with the wind at the North and for some time
							threatened another long Storm; but it soon blew over, and the Evening
							had a sky of bright Moon and Star-light— This morning was also fair, and
							the day clear though cold— <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">Judge
								Baldwin</persRef> called, with four Citizens of Pittsburg, whom he
							named, and who he said were friends of mine— <persRef ref="coale-e">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Coale</persRef> of Baltimore was here;
							to visit <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef> whom he has established
							here, with a Circulating Library, and Stationer’s shop— He told me that
							he had visited <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Watkins</persRef> again, in prison yesterday— Watkins
							was an over active partizan against <pb n="99" type="ms"/><persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> at the last
							Presidential Election: but he was the fourth Auditor of the Treasury and
							being a man of expensive habits and a large family, had misapplied
							several thousand dollars of public money to his own use— This was
							detected soon after General Jackson came into Office, and he seized the
							occasion under an outward flourish of righteous indignation, to glut his
							personal revenge upon Watkins— There had been numerous defalcations of
							the same, and some of a much darker character before. There have already
							been many such under Jackson’s own Administration— He caused Watkins to
							be prosecuted under every form that legal chicanery could devise, and at
							last after two or three months of pertinacity and brow-beating finally
							obtained Juries to convict, and a Court to Sentence Watkins for an
							Offence at Common Law; in the face of many decisions of the Supreme
							Court of the United States, that in their Courts there is no Common Law.
							Watkins was sentenced to a year of imprisonment, and fines amounting to
							two or three thousand dollars— The term of imprisonment expired several
							Months since, because Jackson refuses to remit the fines— But his
							rancour is insatiate— At one time he ordered the Marshal to confine
							Watkins in a solitary Cell; but the Officer pleading that he had no
							authority to do this; he ordered him to have the door of the Apartment
							in which he was kept, label’d “Criminal’s Apartment,” which it
							accordingly has been. That an Officer under my Administration, and
							appointed partly at my recommendation should have embezzled any part of
							the public monies, is a deeper affliction to me, than almost any thing
							else that happened. That he was personally and warmly my friend
							aggravates the Calamity— That the punishment of his Offence should be
							protracted by the vindictive hatred of a political adversary is
							distressing—yet the wrong done to me and my administration by the
							misconduct of Watkins, deserves a severer animadversion from me than
							from Jackson— <persRef ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef>
							paid me also a visit. He told me he was here to promote a Petition to
							Congress from the <persRef ref="pike-clarissa">widow</persRef> of
								<persRef ref="pike-zebulon">General Pike</persRef>. I answered a

							[“]For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart; and
							knoweth all things. 21. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not; then have
							we confidence, toward God.” upon the power of Conscience— There is
							another text of Scripture, warning us that the heart is deceitful above
							all things, and desperately wicked— Another which speaks of Consciences
							seared as with a hot iron; and that upon which <persRef
								ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne</persRef> so beautifully discourses in
							his <persRef ref="shandy-tristram">Tristram Shandy</persRef>—“For we
							trust we have a good Conscience”— The Scriptures do not authorise us to
							rely implicitly upon the Testimony of our own Consciences; they
							encourage us to hope when Conscience testify in our favour— They warn us
							to distrust the self-deception, and even Wickedness of the heart and
							call upon us with awful Solemnity, to propitiate by Repentance and
							Amendment the anger of the deity for sins of which we are conscious. In
							the varieties of human nature there is a difference between the
							consciousness, and the fear of having sinned, and there are those the
							meekness and humility of whose hearts condemn them for that which a just
							and merciful God will not condemn— For otherwise numerous are those who
							have silenced the voice of Conscience, and pursue in reckless security a
							career of unblushing wickedness— These are determin’d infidels, but the
							great mass of sincere Christians are those whose Consciences without
							losing all their power, are pliable, <pb n="100" type="ms"/>and elastic,
							partial in their censures and casuistical in their judgments— Upon such
							consciences it is not safe to rely— I met <persRef ref="story-joseph"
								>Judge Story</persRef> at Meeting, and went with him to the lodgings
							of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United Sates— Saw the <persRef

								>Girardin’s</persRef> History of Virginia— He said perhaps at
							Richmond, but he did not know— Judge Story made some severe remarks upon
							the fourth Volume of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson’s</persRef> Writings, which I thought not more
							extraordinary than the first.— He instanced especially the Letter to
								<persRef ref="cartwright-john">Major Cartwright</persRef>. Vol. 4.
							p. 393. in which he treats the decisions by English judges, that
							Christianity is a part of the Common Law of England, as a Judicial
							forgery— He gives a history of this doctrine from its introduction as he
							says by <persRef ref="finch-henry">Finch</persRef> in 1613. from a
							Mistranslation of a dictum of <persRef ref="prisot-john"
								>Prisot</persRef>, Chief Justice in a Year Book of 1458— Thence he

							than it was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson himself, and not
							the succession of English Lawyers for three hundred years who had
							mistaken the meaning of this dictum of Prisot— Judge Story said that he
							had looked into the case in the Year-book, and found the exposition of
							it by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson so manifestly erroneous,
							that he cannot even consider it as an involuntary mistake— I had some
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Root upon indifferent
							topics, and also with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan whose
							health is yet indifferent— Speaking of the New British Ministry, and
							mentioning <persRef ref="spencer-john2">Lord Althorp</persRef>, the Son
							of <persRef ref="spencer-george">Earl Spencer</persRef>, he mentioned
							this nobleman’s Magnificent Library and his passion for rare books— He

								ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> had been one of the Original founders— That Lord
							Spencer was also a member— And that at one of their dinners he had been
							diverted and astonished at a Toast which came most unexpectedly to his
							Ears—“The lucky possessor of the Mazarin Bible”— He did not know what
							the book was; but Lord Spencer had thought himself extremely fortunate
							in obtaining it for 500 Guineas. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan
							inclines to the opinion that they will get over this year in Europe

							upon certain Articles which have been republished here from the York

								>Cornwallis’s</persRef> invasion, though it greatly affected his

							with <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							of Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1782 which appointment he accepted,
							having on the two previous occasions declined— He was now waiting in
							February 1783. at Baltimore for a passage in a French Frigate to France,
							when news were received of the conclusion of the preliminary Articles of
							Peace of 30. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1782 (the book erroneously
							gives the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of September 1782 as the date)
							upon which he was excused by Congress from further proceeding, and
							returned home— His fourth appointment was on the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of May 1784—with my father and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Franklin to negotiate Treaties of Commerce—and upon this
							Mission arrived at Paris on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							August of that year— Here it was that my first acquaintance with him
							commenced— In the mean time he had on the 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of June 1783 been again elected a Delegate in Congress
							from the State of Virginia— In November Congress which had been sitting
							at Trenton adjourned to Annapolis where on the 13<hi rend="superscript"

							unimportant business could be transacted, assembled— They were another
							Month before nine States were represented and spent it in the “morbid
							rage of debate,” whether seven States were or were not competent to the
							ratification of the definitive Treaty of Peace with Great-Britain, which
							set the final Seal to the Independence of the Country. At length on the
								14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1784 delegates came in
							adding two States more to the Representation and the Treaty was

							years of age— Coale himself had spoken of him as <pb n="102" type="ms"
							/>so accomplished a Shopkeeper, that it had given me a curiosity to see
							him— I ordered two half Reams of Paper, and confined myself the rest of
							the day to the house— Finished my Letter to my Son <persRef

								ref="trebatius-gaius">Trebatius</persRef>—read a few Stanzas of
								<persRef ref="childeharold">Childe Harold</persRef>, and further in
							the Correspondence of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef>, till the Letter of 28 May 1781. to <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>, announcing his
							long declared resolution of retiring from the oppression of his Office
							as Governor of Virginia, to private Life— He says he shall relinquish it
							to abler hands: and from that time there is a gap in the Correspondence
							of nearly 3 years, the next Letter being again to General Washington,
							and dated at Annapolis 16. April 1784— A note of the Editor says that
							during the interval he preserved only Memoranda of the contents of the
							Letters written by him. It is very evident that this period of his life
							brought to him no pleasing recollections. He withdrew from his Office at
							the very agonizing moment of his Country’s struggle— He thought a
							military Governor would be at that Time more useful to the State— Why
							was he not himself a Military Governor— He was ex Officio Commander in
							Chief of the Armies of the State— What was <persRef ref="warren-joseph2"
								>Joseph Warren</persRef>? What was <persRef ref="greene-nathanael"
								>Nathaniel Greene</persRef>? what was <persRef
								ref="lincoln-benjamin">Benjamin Lincoln</persRef>? what was <persRef
								ref="knox-henry2">Henry Knox</persRef>? It is the necessary nature
							of civil Wars to make Military Men out of Lawyers and Farmers,
							Physicians and Booksellers aye, and out of Ministers of the word of God—
							The condition of Virginia at the moment when he abandoned the helm of
							State was such as should have created Soldiers under the ribs of death—
							His correspondence for a year before is languid and desponding. He
							complains of the discovery of extensive disaffection; speaks with terror
							of the enemy’s successes, and broadly intimates that the minds of the
							People may be led to acquiescence under those events which they see no
							human power prepared to ward off— And this is the Moment which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson selects to retire from the
							responsible Office of Governor of the State— And within four Months from
							that day <persRef ref="cornwallis-charles">Cornwallis</persRef>
							surrenders his Arms and his Army at Yorktown— Not a line of
							congratulation upon this great and sudden turn of the tide of success is
							found in his Correspondence. Not one word about it in the Memoir of his
							Life— This silence is expressive— Where was he from June 1781. to the
							close of the War— No mortal can tell, from the Memoir or the
							Correspondence. In that very June 1781. at the moment when he resigned
							his Office as Governor of Virginia, he was appointed one of the
							Ministers for negotiating Peace with Great-Britain, then (he says)
							expected to be effected through the mediation of the Empress of Russia.
							He declined this appointment, he says for the same reasons, for which he
							had declined in 1776—and what were they? take his words—Such was the
							state of my family that I could not leave it, nor could I expose it to
							the dangers of the Sea, and of capture by the British ships then
							covering the Ocean. I saw too, that the laboring oar was really at home,
							where much was to be done, of the most permanent interest, in new
							modeling our Governments, and much to defend our fanes and fire-sides
							from the desolations of an invading enemy, pressing on our Country in
							every point— The first of these reasons are mere private considerations—
							He could not leave his family, and would not expose his family to
							capture by British Ships— <persRef key="adams-john">John Adams</persRef>
							three times exposed himself and <persRef key="adams-charles">two
								boys</persRef> to capture by British Ships during the war— He left
								<pb n="103" type="ms"/><persRef key="adams-abigail">his
								wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-abigail">daughter</persRef> and
								<persRef key="adams-thomas">one infant Son</persRef> to the
							protection of his Country— <persRef ref="jay-john">John Jay’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="jay-sarah">wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jay-peter;jay-susan;jay-maria;jay-ann">children</persRef> went
							with him— <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Franklin</persRef> went safe in 1776. as Jefferson would
							have gone if he had been with him— <persRef ref="laurens-henry">Henry
								Laurens</persRef> was taken and sent to the Tower; and harshly
							treated; but <persRef ref="laurens-john">his Son</persRef> was not even
							imprisoned, and was allowed to visit him, and so might it have been with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson, if he had gone, with or
							without his family and been taken. There are dangers which a high souled
							man, engaged in a sacred cause must encounter, and not flinch from— To
							assign them as reasons for declining the Post of Honour savours more of
							the Sybarite than of the Spartan— They remind one of the certain Lord,
							neat, trimly dressed, who but for these vile guns would himself have
							been a Soldier— As to the other reason of staying at home, to defend our
							fanes and fire-sides, it certainly did not apply to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson either in 1776. when there was
							neither actual nor threatened invasion of Virginia, nor in June 1781.
							when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson had slunk from that very
							defence into the inactive safety of a private citizen— Perhaps M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson was sufficiently punished for
							his dereliction of the cause, by the humiliating necessity under which
							he has been of drawing a veil over this portion of his Life— Pends toi,
							brave Crillon, wrote <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry of Navarre</persRef>
							to one of his Heroic followers—nous avons vaincu et tu n’y etois pas.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s doctrine, that in times
							of public danger a professional Soldier is preferable for the head of
							the Nation to an eminent Statesman is anti-republican— Deliberate valour
							is a quality as necessary to a Statesman as to a Warrior—and if it was
							not an attribute of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson, it is but
							so much detracted from the greatness of his character— His Successor
								<persRef ref="nelson-thomas">General Nelson</persRef>, certainly did
							nothing which he might not have done in his place—and how much more
							illustrious would his name have been, if his Portrait could have
							appeared in <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Trumbull’s</persRef> picture of
							the Surrender of Cornwallis, as conspicuous, as in that of the
							Declaration of independence—</p>

						<p>Finding the air keener this morning than it had felt any time before,
							this Winter, I hung my Thermometer out just before Sunrise in the yard,
							and it fell in a few minutes to 0—and on Réaumur’s Scale—14. which is
							colder than it has been since January 1821— But the weather was calm and
							fair— Using the precaution of wearing my wrapper, I walked round the
							Capitol Square without much suffering. The wind soon came round to the
							South— The Sun began to melt the Snow—and the Thermometer rose to 32.
							There was another light fall of Snow in the Evening— <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef> called upon me this morning and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott</persRef> a Lawyer from
							Baltimore, who told me that he came to make his debut, before the
							Supreme Court of the United States— He spoke of the splendid argument of
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> before the Senate of the United States, and which he
							concluded yesterday in defence of <persRef ref="peck-james">Judge
								Peck</persRef>— Said the Senate Hall was so crowded with Ladies that
							he could not obtain admission—and that there was great expectation of a
							Speech from <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, in assigning his reasons for the decision he may
							give as a Senator. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott said that the
							most eloquent Orator he had ever heard was <persRef
								ref="pinkney-william">William Pinkney</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crowninshield came to make some enquiries
							respecting the incidents at the Cabinet Meetings; in 1818. on the
							transactions of the Seminole War— He shewed me a Letter from <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawford</persRef> to him dated
							the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July last of similar import to
							that which I received from Crawford last Summer, and asking the same <pb
								n="104" type="ms"/>questions though more leadingly circumstancial
							respecting the alledged private Letter from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> to <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>.
							Crowninshield said he had answered this Letter confirming the Statement
							of Crawford as within his recollection, though without specially
							adverting to the time when it happened, which was left unspecified in
							Crawford’s Letter. That Crawford had declared he did not wish his answer
							to make any particular use of it, but that lately <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							had applied to him stating that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							had used extracts of Crowninshield’s answer to him, and asking for a
							copy of it. He said he thought he had kept a copy of his answer to
							Crawford, but that upon writing to <persRef ref="crowninshield-francis">his Son</persRef> at Salem, it did not appear
							that he had— That within these three or four days, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had called upon him, and shewn him
							by references to the National Intelligencer of 1818. that he
							Crowninshield was not here at the time of the Cabinet Meetings in July
							of that year: and there were entered on the back of Crawford’s Letter to
							him minutes of Articles from the National Intelligencer from May to
							October 1818. shewing that Crowninshield had left this City with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe in May; and without returning to it
							had resigned his Office of Secretary of the Navy in October—
							Crowninshield said this was certainly true, and he did not know how it
							happened that his memory had deceived him— That <persRef
								ref="lewis-william3">Major Lewis</persRef> who lives with the
							President had written him a note requesting to see him, and that he had
							been with him this morning— That Lewis asked him if he was apprized that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had evidence that he
							Crowninshield was not present at the Cabinet Meetings on the
							transactions of the Seminole War— That he had told Lewis he was
							perfectly apprized of that fact— And now Crowninshield asked me to
							advise him as a friend what he should do, and whether he should write a
							Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun admitting that he had
							not been present at the Cabinet Meetings— I said I thought he could not
							refuse to acknowledge in writing the fact to M<hi rend="superscript">r
							</hi>Calhoun, who had received information of it, indirectly from me—
							That I had received last Summer from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford a similar Letter to that which he now shewed me, and without
							knowing what was the motive of his enquiries had answered that I had no
							recollection of the production at the time mentioned by him, or any such
							Letter as that mentioned by him: though I did recollect the production
							at another Cabinet Meeting of private Letters which had passed between
							General Jackson and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe upon another
							subject— That I had also received, about a fortnight since, from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun a Letter asking for my
							recollections on the same subject, and for copies of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s Letter to me and of my answer.
							That I had answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s Letter and
							his questions; promising him a copy of my answer to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, as soon as I can obtain it from
							Quincy, but declining to furnish a copy of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford’s Letter without his permission. That I had on the
							same day called upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt who in
							Conversation had told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							had obtained from him Crowninshield a statement like that which he now
							acknowledged; and that I had immediately said that there must be some
							mistake in it, as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crowninshield had not
							been present at any of those Cabinet Meetings, but was in Massachusetts
							when they were held— And I had no doubt M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt had given information of this to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<pb n="105" type="ms"/>Calhoun— That my advice to him was, if he still
							felt confident in the recollection of the production at any time of such
							a Letter from Jackson that he would bethink himself of the Time when it
							might have happened— That it might have been at one of the Cabinet
							Meetings on the Transactions at Amelia Island, at which he was present.
							That I had no recollection of it at any Time; but would look over my
							Diary minutes during the whole period, and if I should find any trace of
							such an incident would give him notice of it— He said Lewis had told him
							the President insisted that his Letter was of a much earlier date— I
							examined my Diary from October 1817 to May 1818. but found no trace of
							the production of any such Letter— I consumed some time in consulting
								<persRef ref="lingard-john">Lingard’s</persRef> History of England,
							of which I have purchased the 12 Volumes yet published of the
							Philadelphia Edition: and whose account of the Execution of <persRef
								ref="tresilian-robert">Tresilian</persRef>, and of the first
							conquest of Ireland by <persRef ref="henry-ii">Henry the

						<p>Weather much moderated and fair. A note with my Son <persRef

							made for a Plate I called at <persRef ref="stone-william">W. J.
								Stone’s</persRef>, and left several Seals with him to mark the
							difference of the Lion Crest, in the Art of the several engravers— He
							had taken, from a Book of Heraldry, a draught of the Smith Arms, with
							three Peacocks instead of doves, which I told him must be of another
							family; and referred him to <persRef ref="woollett-william"
								>Woollett’s</persRef> print of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> at his Villa, and to the English Baronetage— I did
							not go out after Breakfast— Consumed much of the Morning in reviewing my
							Diary from October 1817. to January 1819. upon the Negotiation with
							Spain, the Transactions at Amelia Island, and of the Seminole War in
							Florida— Recurred also to my file of Letters from <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							while I was Secretary of State and to my Letter-Books— My Diary now
							absorbs much time— In the Evening I read a few pages of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> Correspondence— The
							Memoir gives a short account of the composition and publication of his
							Notes on Virginia— Which originated in the practice of committing to
							writing on loose and disconnected sheets, any information of his
							Country, which might be of use to him, in any Station, public or
							private— An excellent habit which cannot be too earnestly recommended to
							every young man— It had been however pursued by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jefferson without premeditated method, till it formed a
							bundle of loose papers, without order, and difficult of recurrence, when
							he had occasion for any particular one— The best of all systems for this
							purpose is to combine and carry on together a Diary, and a Common Place
							Book upon the plan of <persRef ref="locke-john">Locke’s</persRef>— These
							Should be upon paper of one size and stitched in Quires of six or eight
							Sheets each, to be bound in Volumes as the matter sufficiently
							accumulates— In 1781. <persRef ref="barbemarbois-francois">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Marbois</persRef> of the French
							Legation, having been instructed by his Government to obtain statistical
							accounts of the several States of the Union, addressed to Jefferson a
							number of Queries relative to the State of Virginia— This gave him an
							occasion, to embody the substance of his materials, which he did in the
							order of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marbois Queries, <pb n="106"
								type="ms"/>so as to answer his wish, and to arrange them for the
							writer’s own use— Friends to whom they were communicated, wished for
							copies—which their Volume rendering it too laborious by hand— He
							proposed to get a few copies printed— This in America, he found would
							have been too costly an undertaking <hi rend="strikethrough">in
								America</hi>— At Paris, discovering that it could be done, for a
							fourth of what he had been asked at home, he had 200 copies printed
							which he distributed among his friends in Europe and America. A bad
							French Translation but partly corrected by him was published in Paris;
							and a London Bookseller, on seeing the French Translation, requested his
							permission to reprint the original, which he granted— This he says is
							the true History of that publication—and it added very greatly to his
							reputation— The work is still somewhat defective in its arrangement, but
							contains much valuable matter— There is added to the work at its close,
							a draught of what he thought would be a suitable Constitution for
							Virginia, but no part of which was I believe ever adopted— In his
							correspondence at the time when he first printed the Book he appears to
							have been under some alarm, lest the freedom and severity of his remarks
							upon Slavery, and upon the Constitution of Virginia then existing would
							occasion irritation and retard the reformation which he wished to
							promote— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s love of Liberty was
							sincere and ardent— Not confined to himself like that of most of his
							fellow Slave-holders. He was above that execrable sophistry of the
							South-Carolina nullifiers which would make of Slavery the corner stone
							to the temple of Liberty— He saw the gross inconsistency between the
							principles of the Declaration of Independence and the fact of Negro
							Slavery; and he could not, or would not prostitute the faculties of his
							mind to the vindication of that Slavery which from his Soul he abhorred—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson had not the Spirit of
							Martyrdom— He would have introduced a flaming denunciation of Slavery
							into the Declaration of Independence; but the discretion of his
							Colleagues struck it out. He did insert a most eloquent and impassioned
							argument against it in his Notes upon Virginia, but on that very account
							the book was published almost against his will. He projected a plan of
							general emancipation in his revision of the Virginia Laws, but finally
							presented a plan leaving Slavery precisely where it was— And in his
							Memoir he leaves a posthumous warning to the Planters, that they must at
							no distant day emancipate their Slaves, or that worse will follow; but
							he withheld the publication of his prophecy till he should himself be in
							the grave— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							to pass himself off upon me, as a great politician, and active
							canvassing partizan for <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— He did not pretend to
							have any authority from him; but intimated that he had both will and
							power to promote the election of his friends, in more than one County
							and District of Kentucky— He asked me what was my opinion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s prospects in other parts of the
							Union, and finally proposed to me to correspond with him upon the
							subject— Nay more; he gave it as his opinion that if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay should be elected President of the
							United States, it would be his duty to do something for my family, or
							even for myself— Is this man knave or fool? Is he Clayite, Jacksonite,

							used against me hereafter, or is he a mere consequential frequenter of

							That Clay is a man of Talents, but has lost the Confidence of Kentucky

							connected himself with Aristocrats and federalists— That Jackson would

								>Richard M. Johnson</persRef>— Barry told him too that the Globe,
							the new Paper had been set up here, because an <hi rend="italic"
								>Independent</hi> Newspaper had long been wanted— The Telegraph and
								<persRef ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> are dependent upon
							Calhoun. The printing of the Post-Office has therefore been transferred
							to the Globe—and probably the printing of Congress. Duff Green is to
							have a place— The difficulties at Boston are to pay the debts of the
							Statesman Newspaper— The Salaries of <persRef ref="henshaw-david"
								>Henshaw</persRef> the Collector, and of all his Subalterns are laid
							under annual contribution to pay those debts; which Green the Ex-Editor,
							now Postmaster pretended at first were fifteen thousand, and now
							pretends were thirty four thousand dollars. M’Neill says that Green the
							Postmaster is a Rascal— That the debts of the Statesman did not exceed
							7000 dollars, and that he will not contribute to pay them— They had
							taxed his Office 150 dollars a year— M’Neill thinks he has not been
							rewarded sufficiently— He was a Brevet General in the Army, and wanted a
							better Office than he got— They cheated him too by the lure of the Naval
							Office, when <persRef ref="boyd-john3">Boyd</persRef> shoul die; instead
							of which when Boyd died Henshaw got a secret recommendation for one of
							his own kin, and another man, <persRef ref="parker-leonard">Leonard M.
								Parker</persRef> got the Office. M’Neill refused also to sign a
							recommendation of <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Levi Woodbury</persRef>,
							for an appointment as Minister to Russia or elsewhere, which was got up
							by <persRef ref="hill-isaac">Hill</persRef> of New-Hampshire, to pacify
							Woodbury for having supplanted him in the Senate of the United States,
							and which every Custom-house Officer in Boston, from Henshaw, down to
							the lowest tide-waiter was required to sign— M’Neill refused to sign,
							and said he would recommend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury by
							himself— <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>An other fall of Snow, about three inches deep. It detained me at home
							for my usual walking time in the Morning, and I occupied it in replying
							to the Letter which I received yesterday from <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Monroe</persRef>.
								<persRef ref="ruggles-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ruggles</persRef> the Senator from Ohio introduced to me a young man
							from that State, as the <persRef ref="u">brother</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="wright-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John C.
								Wright</persRef>— On returning from my walk between Noon and 2 P.M.
							I was overtaken by <persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gorham</persRef>, the Representative
							from Boston who told me that the Bill reported by the majority of the
							judiciary Committee to repeal the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Section of the judiciary Act, had been rejected at the second reading by
							a majority nearly the same as that which refused yesterday to consider
							the Proposed Resolution of <persRef ref="lecompte-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> LeCompte</persRef>— <pb n="108"
								type="ms"/>This is a momentary respite for the Judicial power of the
							Union; and to the Union itself, both of which are in imminent danger— I
							received an application by Letter from the Philoclean Society of Rutgers
							College at New-Brunswick New-Jersey, to deliver an Oration to them on
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next July which I declined. I
							cannot conveniently leave my family at that Season for so long a time;
							and so great a distance; nor could I deliver to those young men in the
							compass of half an hour, any thing which could profit them in the
							proportion of the time and trouble which it would cost me, nor any thing
							which would answer public expectation as coming with so much apparatus
							from me— I made progress this evening, in the first Volume of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> Correspondence— The
							Commission for concluding Treaties of Commerce, with all or any of the
							Nations of Europe or of Barbary, consisting of <persRef key="adams-john"
								>my father</persRef>, <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson, was opened at Paris in August
							1784 and continued there till May 1785— They made their proposals to the
							Ministers of the several Governments residing there; but succeeded in
							concluding a Treaty only with the <persRef ref="frederick-ii">King of
								Prussia</persRef>— This had been commenced between my father, and
							the <persRef ref="vonthulemeyer-friedrich">Baron de
							Thulemeyer</persRef>, the Prussian Minister at the Hague, and with him,
							and not with the Prussian Minister it was negotiated— In the Spring of
							1785 D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin, then in the 80<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> year of his age, and suffering with gout
							and stone, returned to the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson was appointed his Successor as a Minister at the Court of
							France, and John Adams was commissioned as the first Minister
							Plenipotentiary of the United States at the Court of Great Britain— In
							May my father went to England— In July D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Franklin embarked for America.— The Treaty with Prussia was executed by
							my father in London—by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin at
							Passy—by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson at Paris; and by the
							Baron de Thulemeyer at the Hague— After the departure of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin, the Treaty-making Commission
							still continued in force, and a Treaty with the Emperor of Morocco was
							accomplished by <persRef ref="barclay-thomas2">Thomas Barclay</persRef>,
							then Consul General of the United States in France, and who received his
							Power and Instructions from John Adams and Thomas Jefferson— But the
							European Powers in general received with cool indifference, some of them
							scarcely with the forms of Courtesy the proposals of the United States—
							Early in the year 1786. my father thinking that he perceived in the
							British Government a disposition to treat sent by <persRef key="smith-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> W. S.
								Smith</persRef> a pressing invitation to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jefferson to come to London. He went accordingly and was
							there from the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of March to the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April; but with his Colleague was
							received with most ungracious notice by the <persRef ref="george-iii"
								>King</persRef> and <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> at
							Court, and on the first Conference with the <persRef
								ref="osborne-francis">Marquis of Caermarthen</persRef>, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson was convinced there was nothing
							to be done. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams not so much despairing,
							they delivered their Projet of a Treaty— The Marquis afterwards without
							declining, evaded meeting them again in conference, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson returned to Paris— He had very
							little there to do, and for that little found the <persRef
								ref="gravier-charles">Count de Vergennes</persRef> notwithstanding
							his reputation of being a wary and slippery diplomatist, quite as
							sincere, and as little addicted to double dealing as himself. They had
							the sense to see that neither could gain any thing by deceiving the

							5. July last to me, and of my answer— Also a blank Power of Attorney, to
							receive Dividends of the Suffolk Insurance Company— To be executed by
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas2">T. B. Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef>— I had this morning received a second Letter
							of enquiries from <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice-President
								Calhoun</persRef>, requesting Statements of the conduct of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, in the deliberations of the
							Cabinet upon the Seminole War: and I now received one from <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							saying that he had received a similar Letter, and wished to confer with
							me before he should answer it—but that he was confined to his lodgings
							by indisposition, and expressing the wish that I would call on him
							there. We dined early and I had a short visit from <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Judge Thompson</persRef> of the Supreme Court.
							He is alarmed for the fate of the Judiciary, and of the Bank of the
							United States—and thinks as I do that the leading system of the present
							Administration is to resolve the Government of the Union into the
							National imbecillity of the old Confederation— I went this Evening,
							first to <persRef ref="gibson-unknown">Gibson’s</persRef>; with a view
							to see <persRef ref="storrs-henry">H. R. Storrs</persRef>, and return to
							him the papers belonging to <persRef ref="porter-peter">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> P. B. Porter</persRef>, which he had
							left with me— He was not at home, but I saw <persRef
								ref="storrs-esther">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Storrs</persRef>, to whom I gave the papers, which she promised to
							deliver to her husband— <persRef ref="burges-tristam;burges-mary2">M<hi

								Beekman</persRef>, <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef>, and another

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s lodgings at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mills’s</persRef> on the Capitol Hill—
							He was in bed, and asleep. <persRef ref="peck-james">Judge
								Peck</persRef> his fellow lodger and Client awoke him; he arose, and
							I had a conference with him of about four hours— The Letter which he had
							this morning received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, with
							the exception of a question concerning Crawford’s remarks at a Cabinet
							Meeting upon Porter’s conduct at Foxardo, which was in the Letter to me,
							was totidem verbis the same. He told me that Calhoun had spoken to him
							on the subject in the Senate chamber yesterday, and had said that he
							should address these questions to him and to me— That he had informed
							Calhoun, that he should have objections to answering them— That his,
							Calhoun’s application to him last Spring had been for testimony to his,
							Calhoun’s own conduct—and that in giving it, he had explicitly stated it
							was because it imported no violation of confidence as a member of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s Administration. That now, his
							questions related to the conduct of another person, and although M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford himself had felt at liberty to
							disclose circumstances which had occurred at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe’s Cabinet Meetings, and ridiculed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s scruples, he nevertheless still
							felt their force, <pb n="110" type="ms"/>as they would bear upon what he
							might say even of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford himself. He
							must be consistent with the ground which he had taken last Spring, and
							he thought he could not give testimony in writing to the conduct of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, without his consent, which he
							did not think it his duty to ask— I concurred in these opinions; but
							said there were two contingencies which might release us from the
							obligations of Secrecy, even without the consent of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— One if he should have made use
							of communications received from us contrary to his own obligations— And
							another if he should have made misrepresentations to injure M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, which could be rectified only by
							our testimony— He said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had
							in his possession and had shewn him the original Letter from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> to <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							which had given rise to this controversy— That Crawford’s Letter of nine
							sheets to Calhoun, contained extracts of my answer to his Letter. That
							Calhoun is under a firm persuasion that the author of all this
							combustion is <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>,
							who had used the agency of <persRef ref="hamilton-james">James A.
								Hamilton</persRef>, in producing it. That Hamilton as well as
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> had been a go-between;
							to and from Nashville— That Calhoun knew last Spring that Crowninshield
							had not been present at the Cabinet Meetings in July 1818 and that there
							was a Gentleman here who would testify that <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef> had told him
							so. I read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, the copies of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s Letter of last Summer to me,
							and of my answer, and of all the minutes of my Diary from May to August
							1818. and told him of the opinion of Crawford in January 1819. that the
							places in Florida should be abandoned, even if Spain should send no
							Officer to receive them—to prove most signally that Jackson had violated
							his orders—and in December 1824. at the Meeting upon Porters outrages at
							Foxardo. Wirt said he thought that Calhoun knew this fact, by his own
							recollection and also by a Correspondence with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard— We both agreed that we would furnish no Statement,
							for the private Port Folio of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun,
							which is one of his proposals— Wirt said he would procure a copy of his
							own statement made last Spring; make his present answer conformable to
							it and communicate both of them to me— I said that I owed no favour or
							subscription either to Crawford or to Calhoun— Both of them had treated
							me with base and gratuitous ingratitude. But Calhoun was a drowning man,
							and now stretched forth his arms imploring us to save him— It was in our
							power to save him, and if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford after
							drawing a Letter from me, under a pledge that it was not intended for
							publicity had sent garbled extracts from it to Calhoun, suppressing the
							parts of it which did not suit his purposes I should feel very little
							delicacy of confidential secrecy so far as should concern him. Upon mere
							principles of humanity, I would save M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun; extricate him from the deep into which he is sinking, and let
							him run to live upon his reflections. Wirt concurred entirely with me in
							opinion that this was a snare deliberately spread by Crawford to
							accomplish the utter ruin of Calhoun; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt was not absolutely sure that he should be fully justified in
							disregarding the confidential secrecy of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s Cabinet, even by turning the example of Crawford against
							himself— It was near midnight when I came home—</p>

						<p>Snow again all this morning; and which changed to rain in the

							<persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun’s</persRef> Letter, and at the
							close of the Evening, resumed for an hour the old arrears of my Diary,
							in 1801. The Senate this day by a vote of 22 to 21. acquitted <persRef
								ref="peck-james">Judge Peck</persRef> of the Misdemeanour charged
							against him by the house of Representatives. The vote was nearly but not
							quite a party one—<persRef ref="robbins-asher">Robbins</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="clayton-john">Clayton</persRef> of the
								opposition—<persRef ref="grundy-felix">Grundy</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="tazewell-littleton">Tazewell</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="white-hugh">White</persRef> of the Administration party, went
							with their Antipodes; the former for <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>acquittal</hi> conviction; the latter for acquittal— Grundy and
							White are the two Senators from Tennessee, and their votes afford
							conclusive proof that no personal influence of the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> was exercised against the
							Judge— They indicate still more—that the will of the President was
							favourable to the judge— It is highly probable that Jackson did not wish
							to see an impeachment of a judge, commenced by <persRef
								ref="buchanan-james2">Buchanan</persRef> successfully carried
							through— The same motive contributed to save <persRef ref="chase-samuel"
								>judge Chase</persRef> in 1805— <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef> saw that the conviction of Chase would have
							riveted the power of <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef> over both houses of Congress; and he dreaded the
							consequences to himself and his own Administration— They would have been
							formidable; and mischievous— Jackson’s aversion to Buchanan is more
							immediately personal and vindictive— It arises from the disclosure by
							Buchanan of his dirty intrigue with Jackson in December 1824. to
							authorize him to purchase <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> by
							the promise of sacrificing me—which authority Jackson gave him, and
							Buchanan made an abortive attempt to carry into effect— Buchanan
							afterwards revealed the whole transaction, with an obtuseness of moral
							feeling, seemingly unconscious of moral turpitude in the avowal, and
							with a dulness of intellect equally unconscious of the Javelin he was
							thrusting in the side of Jackson; who never will forgive him nor miss
							any opportunity of inflicting punishment upon him. This I take to be the
							Secret of the votes of Hugh Lawson White and Felix Grundy upon this
							trial— <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">T. Ringgold</persRef> has lost the
							Office of Marshal of the District, and <persRef ref="ashton-henry"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Henry Ashton</persRef> has
							been nominated to take his place— Ashton is a petty Crawfordite Lawyer,
							converted into a Jackson Central Committee man— Ringgold is poor, with
							an expansive family, and has been an excellent Officer. There is
							sympathy with him, but it is a sympathy of fear— Oderint dum metuant, is
							the maxim of the day.</p>
