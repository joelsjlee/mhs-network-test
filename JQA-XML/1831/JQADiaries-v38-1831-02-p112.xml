							Called at <persRef ref="stone-william">Stone</persRef> the engravers,

								ref="burke-john">Burke’s</persRef> Peerage and Baronetage of the
							British Empire, and the first Volume of <persRef ref="mackintosh-james"
								>Sir James Mackintosh’s</persRef> History of England, republished at
							New-York. I left at Stone’s the Volume of Burke which contains a print

								<persRef ref="pyrondumartre-antoine">Porny’s</persRef> Heraldry,
							with some questions as to the quartering of the shields in the

								<persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef>— I read part of a Scene of <persRef ref="julian"
								>Julian</persRef> a Tragedy, by <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C.
								J. Ingersoll</persRef>, a copy of which he has sent me from
							Harrisburg. He is there as a member of the State Legislature from
							Philadelphia.— <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> states in his Memoir that during his
							residence in France he prepared and proposed to the ministers at Paris,
							of the Powers which were annoyed by the habitual depredations of the
							Barbary Pirates. Articles of a special confederation against them: which
							were so favourably received by their Governments, and countenanced by
							the <persRef ref="gravier-charles">Count de Vergennes</persRef>, that
							they would have been carried into effect, but that our own Congress
							declined the engagement to keep one frigate in constant cruize, for our
							portion of the expense of protecting the general commerce of all the
							parties to the compact— To maintain one frigate would have been an
							effort far beyond the Powers of Congress under the Confederation— This
							is another glaring proof of the imbecillity of that instrument— But it
							appears by some of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s subsequent
							correspondence that in his opinion Congress had by the Confederation the
							power of regulating the Commerce of the United States with nations with
							whom they had commercial Treaties and not with any others: so that the
							Constitutional power of the federal Union, was matter of grant and
							concession not by the People of the States, or the States of the Union;
							but by foreign governments— An English, a French, a Spanish, or a
							Russian Monarch, granted powers to the Congress of the United States
							over the Commerce of the United States— This surpasses the absurdity of
							the endless debates, whether seven States could ratify the Treaty of
							Independence— The insatiate rage of debating the question of
							Constitutional power upon every thing, has been inherited from the
							Confederation, and Jefferson more than any other man contributed to
							introduce and make it prevalent.</p>

						<p>Walk before Breakfast— Stop at <persRef ref="u">Coale’s</persRef> shop

								<persRef ref="cresson-elliott">Elliott Cresson</persRef> paid me a

								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>, who had been
							treating him roughly— Elliott is a member, and Delegate of the
							Colonization Society, who wish to have a public vessel stationed to
							Cruize on the Coast of Liberia, to protect our Commerce with that
							flourishing Settlement, and look out for Slavers. But the Colonization
							Society is out of favour with Jackson, as it always has been with me—
							Cresson says that his language was almost abusive— That he charged me
							with having squandered the public money upon this establishment without
							Law— That he said there were not 300 colonists at the place. That almost
							all who went out there, died of Pestilence, and that every word that
								<persRef ref="kendall-amos">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kendall</persRef> had said was true— Cresson was in amazement at his
							ignorance— The public expenditures with which Jackson reproached me,
							were made under a construction of an Act of Congress passed during
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe’s</persRef> Administration; sanctioned by him, by the

								Thompson</persRef>, and by <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">W.
								H. Crawford</persRef>, Secretary of the Treasury, a member and
							Vice-President of the Colonization Society— The language of the act was

							the ensuing Session of Congress, however, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe gave notice to that body by a message of his construction of the
							Act, that they might controul it if they thought proper— They never did
							controul it, and the expenditures under it continued during my
							administration because I did not feel myself at Liberty to reverse the
							decision of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe; and two or three
							eminent lawyers his Secretaries, tacitly supported by Congress itself—
								<persRef ref="heath-asa">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							predetermined not to give him a single sous—but I could not withstand
							his rustic eloquence, and finally gave way, perhaps without being
							entitled to the merit of a cheerful giver— The School unites instruction
							in Literature with mechanical agricultural labour, and has 100 Students—

						<p><date>3. V. </date>Thursday— Snow and Rain—</p>
						<p>The morning lowered, and I took my walk before breakfast— Met <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef> the Adjutant General, and asked him if he had a
							spare copy of the Army Register that he could give me. He promised and
							afterwards sent me both that of the present, and that of the last year—
							Also one of the present year for <persRef key="adams-john2">my
								Son</persRef>, and a report of the <persRef ref="eaton-john"
								>Secretary of War</persRef> to the Senate, with a copy of his,
							Jones’s recent trial by Court-Martial— My wish to see the army Register
							was to ascertain if <persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>
							Son <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas</persRef> was yet a brevetted
							Lieutenant; as there is a Resolution before Congress, for dismissing
							them all from the Army— I found however that he was full commissioned in
							the second Regiment of Artillery, even by the Register of the last year.
							Before I returned from my walk this morning it began to Snow; two or
							three hours afterwards it turned to rain which continued all the
							remainder of the day, and threatened to carry off at once the whole mass
							of Snow upon the ground, and to produce a dangerous flood in the River.—
							I finished reading <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll’s</persRef> Tragedy of <persRef ref="julian"
								>Julian</persRef>, and wrote him a Letter upon it— My occupations
							were somewhat interrupted by a threatened inflammation of the eyes,
							which alarmed me, and abridged my reading to a few Letters of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> in his first volume— They are far less
							interesting than the Memoir, in which after the narrative of his
							abortive attempt to form a confederacy against the <pb n="114" type="ms"
							/>Pirates of Barbary, he gives an account of his acquaintance with
								<persRef ref="ledyard-john">John Ledyard</persRef> the Traveller—to
							whom he suggested the project of discovering the North western passage
							between the two Hemispheres, by proceeding through Siberia to
							Kamschatka, thence over to Nootka Sound and across this Continent to the
							Atlantic— Ledyard undertook the expedition— Jefferson, through the
							Russian Ambassador <persRef ref="simolin-ivan">Simolin</persRef>, and
							through <persRef ref="grimm-friedrich">Grimm</persRef> the correspondent
							of the <persRef ref="catherinethegreat">Empress Catherine</persRef>,
							solicited her permission, without success. In the preface to the account
							of <persRef ref="lewis-meriwether">Lewis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clark-william">Clarke’s</persRef> Expedition to the Pacific he
							had stated that Catherine gave and afterwards retracted that permission—
							He now corrects that error and acquits the Empress of ever having for a
							moment countenanced even by the indulgence of an innocent passage
							through her territories, this interesting enterprize. The prior
							statement was unjust to the Memory of the Empress inasmuch as it charged
							her with an arbitrary violation of her own safe-conduct—with a
							substantial breach of faith. In acknowledging his wrong M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson punishes Catherine for his
							previous injustice to her— His acquittal is a severe sentence of
							condemnation— His apology is an aggravated insult— But Catherine was a
							crowned head, and is unpopular, two descriptions of characters for whom
							Jefferson has no mercy— Ledyard undertook the Journey without
							permission; and had reached within 200 miles of Kamschatka, when he was
							arrested; brought back to Poland, and there dismissed— There was nothing
							in this dishonourable to the Empress Catherine, who certainly acted by
							the advice of her Counsellors; who could have no personal motive for
							opposition to the undertaking of Ledyard, and who was individually as
							ambitious of philosophical fame, and as eager for the progress of
							discovery as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson himself.</p>

						<p><date>4. V— </date>Friday— Sun rose 6:54.</p>
						<p>The rain which was alarming for Mills and wharves, was succeeded before
							Midnight last Evening by a clear Sky and a brisk northwester— In my walk
							this morning I found the road one glare of Ice— I called at <persRef

								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy’s</persRef> Seal,
							which I had received in a Letter yesterday from <persRef

							eye continues and increases, and by threatening to disable me for
							reading and writing, produces indolence and dejection— I partially
							desisted this day from both—but not entirely— I received a third Letter
							from <persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef>, urging me for
							a statement of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">W. H.
								Crawford’s</persRef> conduct and opinions, expressed at the Cabinet
							Consultations of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef> upon the Seminole War in July 1818 and
							afterwards— I had intimated in my answer to this last Letter that I
							could not answer his question, respecting the conduct and opinions of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford without a fuller knowledge
							of the precise point of difference between them—and a perusal of the
							previous Correspondence upon the subject— He replies by giving me a
							second extract of the Letter from Crawford to <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, which marks clearly enough,
							the difference between the parties as to matter of fact: but although he
								<pb n="115" type="ms"/>makes frequent reference to the previous
							correspondence, he neither communicates it, nor notices the observation
							concerning it in my Letter—and he modifies his questions respecting the
							conduct and opinions of Crawford— This withholding of the
							Correspondence, passing over wholly unnoticed my demand for a perusal of
							it—and reurging under a new form the request of a Statement by me of
							Crawford’s opinions and conduct, is characteristic— It satisfied me that
							I ought not to proceed a step further without a sight of the previous
							Correspondence. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford’s Letter to
							Forsyth is accusatory of Calhoun, palliatory for himself, and even if
							true as regards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, a breach of
							confidence, according to my principles. But there must have been some
							cause; possibly some provocation for Crawford’s Letter— <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> says that Crawford’s Letter to
							Calhoun, ridicules the idea that there is any obligation of secrecy
							remaining upon the members of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							Administration, concerning any thing that took place in Cabinet
							Consultations— That he considers it all as belonging to the History of
							the Time, upon which the immediate actors have the right to speak as
							freely as if three centuries had intervened. These principles are so
							vicious that I would not without powerful reasons apply them even to
							himself.</p>

								Lee</persRef> if he should come in the course of the Winter; but
							that I expected myself to return to Quincy early in April, and that
							without the papers it would not be possible for me to write— She doubted
							whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee would come before the Spring,
							and thought it best that he should not be charged with the papers— But
							she said M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart was very desirous that
							in the biography of her brother something should be introduced shewing
							his opinion of her, and she added that an Englishman named <persRef
								ref="fisher-johan">Fisher</persRef> had once published in a Boston
							Newspaper a Latin poem, in honour of <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, of which she herself had made a translation—but
							she did not think that was worth republishing, nor see how it could be

								ref="garrick-david">Garrick</persRef> that he had a niche for him in
							the Life of the <persRef ref="churchill-john">Duke of

							Rio de Janeiro, on his way <pb n="116" type="ms"/>to the Mission—and of
							the kind and hospitable treatment which he received from M<hi

							which no doubt at the request of these Ladies is interwoven, a great
							part of the obituary notice, written by me last Spring and then

							1820. signed Johan. C. Fisher, and published in the Boston Daily

						<p>I have not any one day intermitted the morning reading of the Psalms, and
							am yet unable to read any thing else— But the inflammation of my right
							eye continues gradually to subside, and I may hope to be soon restored
							to the blessing of its use— In the mean time, my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> wrote for me a reply to a Letter
							some days since received from <persRef key="rush-richard">R.
								Rush</persRef>—and an answer to one this day received from <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">S. L. Southard</persRef>— A person by the name
							of <persRef ref="king-john3">John A. King</persRef>, of Georgetown, paid
							me a morning visit. He said he was a native of that place— Son of a
								<persRef ref="u">man</persRef> who had been heretofore an eminent
							merchant there about 35 years of age— That he had been bred a lawyer,
							and practised some time in Maryland, and sometime I think in a Western
							County of Virginia. He had been a warm supporter of mine at the last and
							preceding Presidential Elections, and by verbal and printed addresses to
							the people, had endeavoured to promote the cause, though without
							success— After the Event of the Election, he had returned and settled
							himself at Georgetown, and married a <persRef ref="u">wife</persRef> of
							property sufficient to make him Independent and enable him to live
							comfortably without a profession— Under these circumstances he had been
							desirous of obtaining a Commission as a Magistrate, and went with a
							written recommendation from the whole Corporation of Georgetown to
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>. He
							received him very courteously, and after reading the recommendation
							endorsed upon it an order to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Secretary of State</persRef> to cause a Commission to be made out
							forthwith for his signature: but King said he could not help remarking
							that there was not a line of grammar in the order. He took it to the
							Department of State— The Secretary was not at the Office— He left the
							Recommendation and endorsed order with <persRef ref="king-josias">Josias
								W. King</persRef> the Clerk who still has the charge of making out
							the Commissions— After waiting several weeks without receiving the
							Commission he went again to the Department to enquire why it had not
							been sent to him— The Clerk King told him there had been a counter order
							from the President— He repaired to the President, and enquired what was
							the cause of the revocation of this order— The President told him he had
							been advised by <persRef ref="key-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Francis<space/>Key</persRef> that John A. King had been
							opposed to his Election as President, <pb n="118" type="ms"/>and made
							speeches against him; and was therefore an improper person to be
							appointed as a Magistrate. King said he wished to have his
							recommendation returned to him—and asked me if he had not a right to
							demand it— I told him that the practice while I was in office was to
							return all recommendations, which were unsuccessful, when demanded by
							the person recommended— That I thought he had a right to his, and
							advised him to demand it by a written application to the Secretary of
							State— I did not expect however that he would obtain it— They would
							either refuse it; or answer him that it could not be found— This is one
							of the cleanly operations of the pious informer Frank Key.</p>

						<p>Consolation in Sorrow— The inflammation of my eye has so far abated that
							it was more intolerable to me to wait for daylight in bed, than to take
							the risk of reading a few pages of <persRef ref="jacob-william"
								>Jacob’s</persRef> Report on the Trade in foreign Corn, and on the
							Agriculture of the North of Europe. It was made in 1826. by Instructions
							from the British Board of Trade, and printed by Order of the House of
							Commons— It contains remarkable information upon the Condition of the
							grain growing Prussian Provinces and of Poland. It proves also that from
							the time of the general Peace in Europe of 1815 with the exception of
							the scarcity occasioned by the bad harvest of 1816—which raised the
							prices of that and the next year, the cultivators of Corn had never
							received even the cost of tillage upon their farms— The same thing has
							happened here and with exception of a few months at two different
							periods has continued to this day. This has been the cause of the
							distress which has prevailed to such extent in our grain growing States,
							as the depretiation of Cotton has affected in like manner the States of
							the South. The Report of Jacob and our experience in this Country,
							concur in proving, that under the general comparative value of gold and
							silver in the Commerce of the World, the price of wheat to remunerate
							the husbandman, must be equivalent to a dollar a bushel— It is so in
							Prussia and Poland, it is so here— The national debt of Great-Britain
							compels the Government to keep up the <pb n="119" type="ms"/>price of
							grain at a higher level, and therefore to tax its importation— Foreign
							wheat and flour therefore can be imported into Great Britain for
							consumption only in times of scarcity— Such a state exists at this time,
							and the prices of wheat and flour have risen about thirty per Cent
							within the last three Months— It has fluctuated about 20 per Cent within
							three weeks— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>

							but there was a difference of several minutes between the observers at
							the different Telescopes as to the time of ending. The thermometer,

							to 50. The Barometer remained steady at 30.28. There was no darkness,
							but at the greatest obscuration the light of the Sun was pale and
							sickly— The Planet Venus and the Star Vega, were seen as they are some

							aside, and delivered to me a Letter from Vice-President Calhoun, with a
							bundle of Papers being the Correspondence between him and <persRef

							he had returned to Crawford— Wirt said he had been mistaken with regard

							had seen but a copy: and that Calhoun had also kept a copy of the Letter
							from Crawford which he had returned— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt’s recent communications with Calhoun have been verbal, and not by
							Letter— He has declined giving any statement of Crawford’s sayings and

							Calhoun nevertheless entertains very sanguine hopes— Wirt spoke to me
							also in deep concern and alarm, at the state of <persRef
								ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall’s</persRef> health— He is
							75 years of age; and has until lately enjoyed fine health—exercised
							great bodily activity, and sustained an immense mass of bodily labour—
							His mind remains unimpaired but his body is breaking down— He has been
							30 years Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and has done more to
							establish the Constitution of the United States on sound Construction
							than any other man living— The terror is that if he should be now
							withdrawn, some shallow-pated wild-cat like <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Philip P. Barbour</persRef>, fit for nothing
							but to tear the Union to rags and tatters would be appointed in his
							place— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s anticipations are gloomy,

							invite assistance from me by the delivery of an Address; but supposed
							that I might not be at present inclined to appear so much in public—on
							returning home I found that the Meeting was of the American Sunday
							School Union, with a view to the establishment of Sunday Schools in the

							I suppose this is the Dandy costume at present in Europe—and have been
							expecting it these two years—the beard has been creeping down the cheeks
							from the Ears till the two sides have met at the chin— The same fashion
							prevailed about twenty-five years since; but the tip of the chin was
							then respected— Evening Rain and Thaw.</p>

								<persRef ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> Editor of the

							Editor has become as essential an appendage to a Candidate, as in the

								>r</hi> Huntt is grievously annoyed by the appointment of <persRef
								ref="ashton-henry">H. Ashton</persRef>, as Marshal of the District
							in the place of his father in Law <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">Tench
								Ringgold</persRef>— Ashton is a small lawyer, originally a toaster
							of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> as long as
							there was a prospect of creeping into an Office by puffing him— When
							Crawford was distanced in the field, he like <persRef ref="vanness-john"
								>John P. Van Ness</persRef> now the Mayor of the City crossed over
							into the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> camp, and both
							were members of the central Committee, which took charge of his cause
							and his person at the time of his Election— All the members of this
							Central Committee had already obtained offices, and Ashton had long <pb
								n="122" type="ms"/>given out that this place had been promised to
							him when Ringgold’s term of service should expire. When <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							was here last Winter he dined with President Jackson, who affected to
							treat him with affectionate respect and kindness, and on taking leave of
							him M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe said to him that he might
							probably never see him again— That he would venture to ask of him only
							one favour and that was to recommend Marshal Ringgold to his kindness;
							and then he spoke with much feeling of the causes of his own attachment
							to Ringgold upon which Jackson took Monroe’s hand pressed it between
							both his own, and said—“Say not one word more, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe,” which Ringgold took for an inviolable promise that
							he should be continued in his place—Jackson now denies that he meant it
							as a promise, or even as encouragement to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe to expect that his wish would be gratified. But he told Ringgold
							that it was a poignant mortification to him to pass him over and
							nominate another Marshal most particularly because he knew it would
							displease his two old friends James Monroe, and <persRef
								ref="gibson-george">George Gibson</persRef>— And he promised to give
							him a better place— But this case with many others has afforded
							demonstration of the prevailing influence of Spies and Informers. A
							captious complaint was made against Ringgold to me by two Justices of
							the Levy Court, of the County of Washington, as having misapplied monies
							collected by him for the County expenses, and which they wanted to
							improve the roads to and from their own houses— I made enquiry into the
							facts—satisfied myself that there was no foundation for the complaint,
							which I accordingly dismissed— When Jackson came in the Levy Court
							Justices, returned to the charge—Jackson in his superabundant Zeal for
							Justice, decided against Ringgold—compelled him to pay the money to the
							Justices, and drove him to the recovery of his Money by suit at Law—
							Ringgold instituted the suit, and has just obtained the Judgment of the
							Supreme Court of the United States in his favour— The public have to
							refund with costs and charges, the monies extorted from Ringgold, by the
							Summary Justice of the Bashaw President— Ringgold had been advised by
							Van Buren to shew a popular voice in his favour by obtaining signatures
							recommending him for re-appointment, and accordingly procured about 1800
							of the most respectable names in the district— They had not the weight
							of a feather— In expostulating with Jackson upon his disappointment,
							Ringgold found that Jackson’s Earwigs such as <persRef ref="key-francis"
								>Frank Key</persRef> had whispered to him that Ringgold had made
							some unguarded comment upon the unsullied chastity of <persRef
								ref="jackson-rachel">Jackson’s wife</persRef>— Jackson told him
							however that it had gone in at one Ear and out at the other— But he had
							heard that when the Ex-Presidents <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>Madison</persRef> and Monroe were nominated by my friends in
							Virginia as Electors of President and Vice-President, Ringgold had gone
							express to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe at Loudon to persuade
							him not to decline. Ringgold not only denied the fact, but affirmed that

								>r</hi> Monroe for declining against the opinion of <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>— The denial did not avail him—and such is the
							rancorous and vindictive character of Jackson—that in all probability
							this secret charge was the Seal upon the fate of Ringgold— I walked in
							the middle of the day to the Capitol Square; called at <persRef

						<p>Morning visit from the <persRef ref="torlade-jacob">Portuguese

							who though not accredited till after I was out of Office, calls on me
							more frequently than any other of the foreign <pb n="123" type="ms"

							being yet a much unacknowledged king— He boasts that Portugal is now of
							all Europe the Country which enjoys the greatest portion of tranquility;
							which he insists is owing to the great popularity of the present
							government. A person by the name of <persRef ref="lockwood-ransom"
								>Lockwood</persRef> came to ask my advice what he should do with
							regard to a large quantity of Timber for which he had contracted in
							Florida, to supply to the government; but for which he could not pay
							without an Advance, which the Navy Department refused to make. This man
							had called upon me last Winter or Spring to ask advice upon the same
							subject. He now spoke of petitioning Congress, and asked me if I thought
							he would have any prospect of success, in this— I told him that the
								<persRef ref="branch-john">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> could not
							make him an advance if he would— There was a Law to preclude it— And at
							this period of the Session of Congress, He could not expect to obtain an
							Act to authorize it— I advised him therefore to sell its timber in its
							present condition to any speculator who would purchase and pay for it;
							and if as was probable he should be obliged to make some sacrifice upon
							the Sale, he must consider himself as fortunate in getting rid of the
							whole concern. He said he believed that was the best advice I could
							give, and thought he would endeavour to carry it into effect— <persRef

								<persRef ref="eaton-john">John H Eaton</persRef>, the Secretary of

							in such perfect Union together—and then added that M<hi

						<p>During the time while the inflammation of my eyes, denied me the
							enjoyment of my customary occupations, I have found most irksome those
							hours of the morning before day light, and after awaking from the Nights
							repose, when I could neither remain quiet in bed, nor find any thing to
							do upon rising. My thoughts finding nothing upon which they could
							meditate with pleasure turned inward, and preyed upon my own Spirits—
							Discontented thoughts, and a murmuring Spirit was rising within me. In
							this condition I read the 131<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Psalm, and
							bethought myself of amplifying it in a paraphrase, with reference to the
							temper of my own mind, and to my duties. I am accordingly dictating it
							into several eight-lin’d Stanzas of which I compose one each morning— I
							had a morning visit from <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> of New-Hampshire, who
							spoke of the proceedings in Senate upon the Turkish Treaty. The Senate
							have advised and consented to the ratification of the Treaty with the
							exception of the secret Article; but no provision has yet been made for
							the expenses incident to the Negotiation— The general Appropriation Bill
							being before the Senate, a motion is made to add an item for
							compensation to all the Commissioners who have been employed in the
							Negotiation, and for outfit and Salary for a Minister at Constantinople.
								<persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">Tazewell</persRef> objects to this
							Appropriation, under an old pretence that the President has no right to
							institute a new Mission during the recess; an engine which they wielded
							against me, and to which he now resorts by an affectation of
							consistency— <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> has not
							only repeated all my Sins in this matter, but suffered a whole Session
							of Congress to pass without nominating his Commissioners to the Senate,
							and finally sends a Treaty concluded by them without nominating them at
							all— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell himself thinks this
							unconstitutional, and sustains Tazewell’s objection, though not upon the
							same principle. He asked me some questions respecting the practice of
							the Government heretofore, and I mentioned to him the Negotiation of the
							two Treaties with Algiers—first by <persRef ref="decatur-stephen"
								>Decatur</persRef> and <persRef ref="shaler-william"
								>Shaler</persRef>, and next by <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac"
								>Chauncey</persRef> and Shaler, and as far as I recollect that the
							first had not been submitted to the Senate, till after the second was
							concluded— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell did not perceive from any
							thing that has yet occurred in the Senate, what would be the probable
							effect of the new War of political Elements— <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">J Sergeant</persRef> called and dined with us.
							In the Evening I attended at the Medical College and heard <persRef

								Sewall’s</persRef> Lecture upon the Eye and the functions of vision.
							It was for the benefit of the Orphan Asylum, and the room was crowded

							“Thy Will be done”— Upon obedience to the Will of God— Argumentative and

								>L’Etourno’s</persRef> to <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef> the Delegate from
							Florida. While I was with him <persRef ref="brackenridge-henry">Judge
								Breckenridge</persRef> District Judge of West Florida came in. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White continues to be deeply concerned at
							the determination of the present <persRef ref="branch-john">Secretary of
								the Navy</persRef> to break up the plantation of Live Oaks, which I
							had taken so much pains, and incurred so much public expence to
							commence— The Report of the Secretary of the Navy against it is
							remarkable at once for gross ignorance, and wilful misrepresentation—and
							he has been guilty of a dishonourable suppression, of a Report from the
							Commissioners of the Navy, because it would have refuted and falsified
							his own— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White lent me for perusal a
							Letter dated the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of January last from
							himself to the <persRef ref="hoffman-michael">Chairman</persRef> of the
							Naval Committee of the House of Representatives, denying the facts and

							Letters to him White, from <persRef ref="acken-william">W. D.
								Acken</persRef>, and one from <persRef ref="darby-william">William
								Darby</persRef>, all shewing the importance of my plantation, and
							indeed its indispensable necessity to preserve the existence of live Oak
							for Timber— The malicious pleasure of destroying every thing of which I
							had planted the germ, and the base purpose of representing as wasteful
							prodigality the most useful and most economical expenditures, are the
							motives that act upon the Secretary of the Navy and the present
							Administration— It happened that for the Live Oak Plantation, purchases
							made of about 1600 Acres of Land from White and Brackenridge; and
							although the Timber upon them was worth more than they cost, this
							circumstance was seized upon to represent the transaction as a
							fraudulent job, and squandering of public money. Judge Brackenridge when
							this was suggested, immediately petitioned Congress to be permitted to
							take back his Land at the same price which he had received for it, and
							that petition was rejected. The plantation both of young Trees growing
							when I commenced it, and of those from the Acorn which I had caused to
							be planted is now in a condition as flourishing is possible, and more
							than a hundred thousand live Oaks are growing upon it— All is to be
							abandoned by the stolid ignorance and stupid malignity of John Branch
							and of his filthy subaltern <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos

							particular friends of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi

							gratified at the course I had recently pursued in the controversy now in
							progress between him and the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"

							himself, that he had heard from <persRef ref="coale-e">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Coale</persRef>, that I had expressed
							some sensibility at his neglect of me during the last two years.— That
							he and <persRef ref="calhoun-floride">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> had been under an accidental necessity of
							declining the last invitation to dine that I had given them, and that he
							had concluded I had taken Offence at that incident— That the political
							relations in which we stood at that time had deprived him of an
							opportunity of giving me an explanation upon the subject, and had
							deterred him from visiting me; but that he had always entertained a
							respect for my character; that he was glad to give this assurance to me
							now, and that if it would be agreeable to me he would <pb n="126"
								type="ms"/>visit me before the close of the present Session of

							him to say for me to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maxcy as the friend
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, that it was a pleasing
							circumstance to me to learn, that the friends of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun were satisfied with the course I had observed in the
							recent transactions concerning him, in which it had been my endeavour to
							do him justice as far as was in my power— That as to the incident of his
							and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Calhoun’s declining to dine with me
							the last Winter that I was in the Presidential House, it had been so far
							from making any impression upon my mind that it had even escaped my
							memory. That his total estrangement from me since the expiration of my
							term of service had been deeply felt by me, but that I was perfectly
							disposed to bury it in oblivion. That I should be very happy to receive
							him whenever he should be disposed to call upon me— That whatever of
							unkind thoughts there might have been between us, I wished to be
							entirely forgotten, and that no further notice of it might ever be
							taken— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peters said he would not fail to
							make his report accordingly to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maxcy—
							This Evening <persRef ref="keating-william">professor William

							<persRef ref="bollman-unknown;bollmann-unknown2">daughters</persRef>—who

						<p>Another clear and cold morning— Morning visit from <persRef

							there were great disturbances in the Germantic and Italian possessions

								>Branch</persRef> told some person, that he should despatch a ship

								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun’s</persRef> pamphlet is yet scarcely perceptible in

						<p>Salutes from the Fort at Sunrise at Noon and at Sunset announced the

								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was again confined to her bed by

							from Forsyth to <persRef ref="hamilton-james">James A.

							lastly the Letter from <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> to <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							of 2. October 1830. which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun did not
							communicate to me— A Letter in which Crawford pours out all his
							gall—sometimes with much address; at others with not less
							indiscretion—occasionally with acute reasoning, and then again with
							broad absurdity— His thrusts at Calhoun, are deep and deadly; and many
							of them vulgarly abusive, while he disclaims all resentment— In all this
							Correspondence <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> is not
							seen— But James A. Hamilton, intimately connected with him is a busy
							intermeddler through out— In April 1827. Van Buren and <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>, made a visit to
							Crawford, when he authorised them to announce him on all occasions, as
							in favour of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> election
							against me— In December 1827. he answers a Letter of instigation from
								<persRef ref="balch-alfred">Alfred Balch</persRef> at
							Nashville—declines making a public declaration of his opinions, and
							intrigues against Calhoun, intimating that Calhoun’s Caucus friends at
							Columbia were enemies to Jackson and that he ought to know it. His own
							interposition to inform Jackson, that Calhoun had been against him at
							the Cabinet Meetings on the Seminole War, was gradually brought about—
							He first communicates it to Forsyth; and Forsyth to James A. Hamilton—
							Then somebody, a black mask, informs Jackson that <unclear>Has</unclear> a written
							statement from Crawford of the whole affair— Jackson’s jealousy and
							curiosity are roused—he asks Hamilton if he has this Statement— Hamilton
							affects mystery and modesty— Yes he has the Statement but cannot
							communicate it without Crawford’s consent— So Hamilton applies to
							Forsyth—and he to Crawford, who gives a new edition of his Story revised
							and corrected; authorising Forsyth to communicate it—to whom? to Jackson
							for whom it had been requested?—not at all—no—but to Calhoun— And
							Forsyth; instead of communicating it to Calhoun as so authorised,
							carries it directly to Jackson, whom as had been well foreseen it flings
								<pb n="128" type="ms"/>into a fury—and he sits down—writes a Letter
							to Calhoun, demanding explanations, and encloses not the original of
							Crawford’s letter, but a copy suppressing the name of James A. Hamilton—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth says it was merely out of
							delicacy to him; but why that delicacy, unless there was a consciousness
							that the personage he was performing, was not suited to the character of
							an honest man— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford in this Letter
							does give extracts from mine to him, and does suppress those parts of
							it—which operated against himself— He speaks of me frequently; sometimes
							as if disposed to do me Justice—sometimes without either delicacy or
							truth— He says among other things that the Letter which he wrote me last
							Summer, is the only one which he has written me since he left Washington
							in 1825—which is a mistake— The severest cut which he gives to Calhoun
							is upon his countenancing the nullification doctrines— He appears to
							have discovered that they are losing popularity— <persRef
								ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> the Editor of the Telegraph
							has published the Letter with Notes refutatory as he goes along.</p>

							Psalm, a task which is not very difficult. Perhaps I could thus
							paraphrase the whole Book of Psalms—but to what good purpose? The
							spinning out of Rhymes is but laborious idleness— I began this morning a
							Poem of another character, the conception of which is amusing but
							requiring more continuity of purpose, more poetical imagination, and
							more command of language and power of harmony than belongs to me— I
							answered Letters from <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">Joseph

						<p>I grow weary of paraphrasing the Psalms, which has been done by hundreds
							of others, and this morning undertook a paraphrase of Proverbs 16:24. In
							both these books there is a frequent, almost a continual juxtaposition
							of thoughts which seem to have no natural connection together— To give
							them an appearance of continuity associated ideas must be brought in,
							and the whole composition looks like a mosaic, of which two or three
							Stories here and there from the original are enchased and adapted to
							many others not to be found in the Scriptures— Like a modern restoration
							of an antique Torso or rather as if from a fragment of an old hand or
							foot, a modern Sculptor should undertake to form an <persRef
								ref="apollo">Apollo</persRef> or a <persRef ref="venus"
								>Venus</persRef>. But there is too much presumption in attempting to
							mingle my feeble thoughts with the sublime inspiration of the
							Scriptures, and I have passed to quite another subject which occupies me
							on my morning walks— I went this morning to see the ruin of the Potowmac
							Bridge— The ice in the river is breaking up, and still floating down the
							channel with great rapidity— I walked thence up, and round the Capitol
							Square— There came a man by the name of <persRef ref="taylor-edward">E.
								T. Taylor</persRef> a Methodist preacher from Boston, with a
							subscription book, for a Sailor’s Church— There was with him a person
							named <persRef ref="u">Clark</persRef>, who said he was a Carpenter, a
							Resident in this City, and that he had repeatedly been at the
							President’s House when I was there— Clark told me that he always had
							been in my favour, and regretted the change that has taken place; and
							Taylor said he had <pb n="130" type="ms"/>been on the other side, but
							had changed his opinion since he came here, and was now a great admirer
							of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi

							publishes in the Telegraph this day a Supplement to his pamphlet, with
							an address to <persRef ref="green-duff">General Green</persRef>, the
							Editor— He gives his Correspondence with <persRef ref="hamilton-james"
								>James A. Hamilton</persRef> in February 1828. and charges Hamilton
							with having acted a very dishonourable part— An Editorial Article brings
							the charge directly home to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Secretary
								of State</persRef>— Of these personal altercations between persons
							in the highest Stations of our Government there have been many since its
							establishment; but none have proceeded to such extremes— <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and Calhoun charge
							each other with direct falsehood— <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> charges Calhoun with duplicity— Calhoun charges
							Van-Buren by implication with plotting his destruction, and now he names
							Hamilton as an underling insidiously approaching him to draw from some
							unguarded expression which might betray him— Perhaps one of the most
							remarkable aspects in which the whole affair presents itself is the
							adhesive tenacity of such a gang to each other for the purpose of
							effecting my destruction— Every one of the principals in this
							controversy—Jackson, Calhoun, Van Buren, Crawford was under personal
							obligations to me— Every one of them was indebted to me for acts of
							kindness and favour— Never was political hatred more bitter than that
							which prevailed between Crawford and Calhoun, and their respective
							partizans. They united in heart and Soul against me— They succeeded to
							their hearts content— They divided the spoil— And now Crawford and
							Calhoun are snarling and biting for the Vice-Presidency like two
							famished wolves for the carcass of a Sheep— Huntt told us of a
							Conversation he had the day before yesterday with <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">A. Stevenson</persRef>, Speaker of the House—
							He adheres to Jackson, Crawford and Van Buren, and says Crawford will
							come out of this furnace, pure as the driven Snow— But Huntt says that

								<persRef ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							recalled last Summer, and <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef> of Roanoke was appointed in his place— Randolph
							who turns his diseases to commodity, stipulated before he went that if

							for a few weeks at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg like a

								ref="titania">Queen of the Fairies</persRef> was with the Asses head
							of <persRef ref="nickbottom">Bottom</persRef>, after the drop of juice
							from Love in Idleness had been squeezed upon her eyelids in her sleep.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton told me numerous anecdotes
							of his eccentricities at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg. We
							had also some conversation upon the present condition of Russia, and
							upon the state of Politics here, upon which he said he found himself as
							in a strange Country—so changed is every thing in the course of ten
							years— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurence had been attending <pb

							and Senate— <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">Tazewell</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> the Senators from
							Virginia, with the aid of <persRef ref="kane-elias">Kane</persRef> of
							Illinois and <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> have
							reduced the appropriation from 74000 dollars down to 37000—substituted a
							chargé d’Affaires to be sent to Constantinople, instead of a Minister
							Plenipotentiary, and introduced in the general Appropriation Bill a
							proviso that nothing therein contained is to be construed as an
							approbation of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef>
							appointment during the recess of the Negotiators of the Turkish Treaty,
							and not submitting the Nomination to the Senate, and this is to be sent
							in the general Appropriation Bill to the President to approve, and
							thereby to sanction a censure upon himself, as for a violation of the
							Constitution— The blow is against me, as well as against Jackson, and it
							is struck by those who were my friends; putting themselves under the
							lead of Tazewell, one of the bitterest enemies I have in the world—
							Laurence said it was understood the proviso would be carried by a
							majority of thirty in the House of Representatives; all the friends of
							the last Administration being to join the deserters from the
							Administration ranks— I told Laurence that I did not know what Jackson
							would do with the Bill, but that if such an one had been presented to me
							at the last quarter of an hour of an expiring Congress, I would have
							sent it back with my reasons and refused to sign it. The explosion

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church <persRef ref="palfrey-cazneau">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Palfrey</persRef> from Mark 2.27. “The
							Sabbath was made for man.” upon the Institution, character and
							usefulness of the Sabbath— I expected some allusion to a controversy
							which for the last two or three years has much agitated the public mind
							in this Country, upon the question of prohibiting by Act of Congress the
							transmission of the Mails on Sunday— But whatever reference he intended
							to make to this dispute was remote and indirect— <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef> and <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. J. Pearce</persRef> sat with me— I
							called after the Service at <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
								>Gadsby’s</persRef>: left cards of return visits to <persRef

								ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef>; who shewed me a number of Caricatures, upon the
							recent Events in France and England. Most of the French are against the
							late king <persRef ref="artois-charles">Charles the 10<hi
									rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> and the English against
							the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef>— I
							called also upon <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> White</persRef> of Florida, with whom I found <persRef
								ref="brackenridge-henry">judge Brackenridge</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="pleasants-john">Pleasants</persRef> the Editor of the Richmond
							Whig— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White told me he should publish his
							Letter, against the Report of the <persRef ref="branch-john">Secretary
								of the Navy</persRef> on the Live-Oak Plantations and asked my
							permission to publish with it my Letter in answer to his enquiries,
							which I freely gave, and said that the more extensively it should be
							known that my opinions were those expressed in that Letter, the more
							agreeable it would be to me— On my return home I found <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>,
							with his Son <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas</persRef>— I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye some questions concerning the
							complaints of a man named <persRef ref="hobby-william">William
								Hobby</persRef>—from whom at Boston I have lately received five or
							six Letters and a pamphlet— His complaints are of fraud and corruption
							against a paymaster in the army named <persRef ref="townsend-david2"
								>Townsend</persRef> under whom he served several years as a Clerked
							and who then dismissed him— Since which his complaints of frauds
							committed by Townsend, have been incessant— He says he wrote me while I
							was President several Letters, which I never answered— That <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> decided against <pb
								n="132" type="ms"/>him without hearing him, and that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> says he cannot go
							behind decisions of his Predecessors— The documents shew extravagant
							accounts exhibited by the paymaster and that objections were made to
							them by <persRef ref="parker-daniel">Daniel Parker</persRef> when
							paymaster General— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye whether
							he could inform me what had been done in the case and he mentioned that
							there had been a Court of Enquiry convened of which <persRef
								ref="mcneil-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> M Neill</persRef>
							was president, and which dismissed the complaint uninvestigated because
							the charges were of facts more than two years past. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye took Hobby’s last Letter to me and
							his pamphlet, and said he would let me know more upon the subject—
								<persRef ref="bailey-john">J. Bailey</persRef> B. W. Crowninshield,
								<persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel">E. F. Chambers</persRef> H.
							Middleton D. J. Pearce, <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J

								Silsbee</persRef>, <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose

								ref="burr-aaron">A. Burr</persRef>, <persRef ref="bayard-james"
								>James A. Bayard</persRef>, and antient Times—little of the present.
							I had asked Pearce to come sometime before the hour of dinner which was
							four— He came at 3. and I gave him my opinions and feelings respecting
							the proviso attached in the Senate to the general Appropriation Bill
							which I thought not only ungracious and insulting to me, but in the
							highest degree pernicious as a Precedent— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bailey remained with me after the rest of the company were gone till
							near eleven this Evening; and I made the same Statement to him,
							requesting him to communicate my Sentiments to <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J W. Taylor</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">E Everett</persRef>, and any other of my
							personal friends as he should think proper, which he promised to do— The

						<p>The wind came round to the South west, and I felt the debility of Spring

							my Russian, Swedish and Amsterdam Pounds and my Kilogramme— The latter

							of the new Russian Platina Coins. He said he had none with him left, but
							would send me one on his return to Carolina. He said that the value put
