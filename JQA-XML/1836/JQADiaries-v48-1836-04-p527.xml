                            Bill was long, and Patton said the question of boundary would not be
                            involved in it at all— But it bounded the new Territory, on the

                        <p>At the Presbyterian Church heard a young man by the name of <persRef
                                ref="grundy-robert">Grundy</persRef>, a nephew of the <persRef

                            who was present. The text was John 3.3, “Jesus answered and said unto
                            him, verily, verily, I say unto thee. Except a man be born again, he
                            cannot see the kingdom of God.”— This text is the quintessence of

                            endeavoured to reconcile it with reason— The main inexplicable
                            difficulty in my judgment is, how a strong metaphorical image addressed
                            by Jesus to <persRef ref="nicodemus">Nicodemus</persRef> a Jew, can be

                            preached from 2. Samuel 7.18. [“]Then went <persRef ref="david">king
                                David</persRef> in, and sat before the Lord, and he said, Who am I,

                            19. And this was yet a small thing in thy sight O Lord God: but thou

                            and that the pew holders would be shortly called upon to contribute for

                            concluded finally to go— Petition day; but <persRef ref="hawes-albert"

                            inspected again his Steam engine, the operation of which was more

                        <p>The wound in my leg has been festering and inflaming for nearly three

                            poulticed; the ankle and foot swelling more and more every day, till I
                            can scarcely crowd the foot into my slipper or shoe— Last night on going
                            to bed I had a plaister of soap and sugar spread over the wound which
                            worked like a hatchell of needles the whole Night and kept me without a
                            wink of sleep— This morning, I could not touch the foot to the ground.
                            The necessity became indispensable of laying myself up. <persRef

                            prescribed an ointment plaster covered with a bread and milk poultice

                            equally remarkable, as the prevarication of an honest mind, to palliate

                            been dethroned and expelled as a tyrant, for measures the object of
                            which was the establishment of religious toleration— Mackintosh’s hand

                            yesterday— I this day read several chapters of the continuation, which
                            is far inferior as historical composition, and far less instructive in
                            moral precept, and almost entirely destitute of profound philosophical
                            reflection in which Mackintosh so richly abounds. The continuator writes
                            more as a satyrist than as a historian, selecting for his narrative only
                            incidents which give occasion to censorial remarks; and imputing to all
                            the actors in the Scene none but selfish and sordid motives. If there is

                            which he set the first successful example— Van Buren’s personal
                            character bears however a stronger resemblance to that of <persRef

                            than to Jefferson— They are both remarkable for their extreme caution in

                            for the last step on the ladder of his ambition—<persRef

                            of Representatives— I went accordingly, soon after noon, and found the
                            House, debating, on an amendment made in the House, to the Bill for
                            establishing the Wisconsin territory, reducing the Salary of the
                            Governor as fixed in the Senate’s Bill 2500 dollars as Governor and 1000
                            dollars as Superintendant of Indian Affairs— The amendment of the House
                            had reduced the whole Salary to 2500 dollars— The Senate disagreement—
                            The motion to recede was debating in the House, and <persRef
                                ref="hardin-benjamin">B. Hardin</persRef> was speaking against

                            receding—but the House refused 131 to 55. It was past one O’Clock, and
                            the order of the day, the general Appropriation Bill was taken up, in

                            in the Pension Office of the War Department— Each time making a Speech
                            with heavy charges of wasteful and corrupt expenditures— In one of them
                            he directly alluded to me and related what I had said to him a few days
                            since in a private conversation— It made a sort of necessity for me to
                            answer him, which I did in a very few words, but sufficient to prove to
                            myself, my inability from weakness to address the house in any
                            continuous discourse. Many of the members of all parties came and

                            aged 73. a native of Preston, Connecticut, who lived many years in
                            Worthington, Massachusetts, afterwards at Washington County, New-York,
                            and last in Chautauque County of the same State, now in this City to
                            solicit an appointment as keeper of a Light-House, brought me this
                            morning his budget of Certificates and Recommendations, which I was
                            compelled in civility to read— He wanted a written recommendation from
                            me, but I gave him the name of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            Auditor <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Stephen Pleasonton</persRef>,

                            recommendation to the others— The man is a remarkable exemplification of
                            the Yankee character— He has a pension of 8 dollars a month under the
                            act of Congress of 1832 as a blacksmith in the Corps of Artificers— As
                            the exercise of yesterday had the effect of swelling and inflaming my

                            spent it almost entirely upon my Couch— I read in <persRef

                            can scarcely realize, the influence of personal interests and passions,
                            upon public affairs;—especially in female monarchies— The history of
                            Scotland in Mary’s time is only the account of her amours and marriages,
                            with the murder of one lover by a husband, and the murder of the husband
                            by another Lover.— The character of Mary has been treated by all the
                            historians with a degree of tenderness which I cannot readily extend to
                            her— She was no doubt beautiful, and susceptible of warm affections, but
                            the precipitation and desperation of her can be palliated only by
                            passing it to the account of weakness in the Understanding— I read also

                            to go to the House, which I found in Session, in Committee of the whole,
                                <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> in the Chair, debating a
                            Bill in addition to the Revolutionary Pension Laws; which was reported
                            to the House and passed to a third reading— Just before the order of the
                            day was called, I obtained leave to present two petitions from
                            Inhabitants of Nantucket for a Breakwater—old Petitions taken from the
                            files, and referred to the Committee of Commerce— Other Petitions to the
                            same effect had already been referred to the Committee on the motion of
                                <persRef ref="reed-john">John Reed</persRef>— The Petition of 2673
                            Ladies of Massachusetts, went of course to the Select Committee on the

                                >Edward D. Tippett</persRef> concerning his invention of an
                            unexplodable Steam-Engine, was referred to the Select Committee on
                            certain Patents— These Petitions should have been presented last Monday,
                            when I was detained by my lameness from attendance at the House</p>
                        <p>At one O’Clock the general Appropriation Bill was taken up, as reported
                            yesterday by the Committee of the whole on the Union to the House—
                            Several amendments reported by the Committee were adopted without
                            debate— An Appropriation of 20000 dollars, in the Bill reported by the
                            Committee of Ways and Means, towards fulfilment of a contract with
                                <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Matthew S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

                            out in Committee of the whole; and the question of concurring with the
                            Committee was warmly debated— I made a short, but very feeble Speech in
                            favour of fulfilling the contract, with humbling conviction of my
                            debility— About 4. O’Clock the House adjourned without taking the

                            of this day; but the weather was dull and gloomy, with a North east
                            wind, and rain, and I was dissuaded both by <persRef

                            from going out— I confined myself to the house, and meditated upon the
                            decays of my own faculties of body and mind; too clearly demonstrated by
                            daily accumulating proof to leave me even the comfort of self-delusion—
                                D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt proposes to open an issue in my
                            arm as an outlet to those humours which are breaking out with increasing
                            virulence; and one of which has now crippled me for nearly three weeks—
                            But an issue once opened could never again be closed without fatal
                            consequences and I have not yet brought my mind to so desperate a
                            remedy— The Doctor however gave me a fair warning of my danger in
                            postponing it. I occupied myself as well as I could with the drudgery of
                            assorting papers and addressing Documents; and alternately keeping up
                            the current of this dull diary, and reading in <persRef

                            postponed till that time— Afterwards in the House, M<hi

                            round the notices accordingly— At the House It was petition day; but
                            there were unfinished questions which would have absorbed the day.

                            abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia, which went of course
                            to the select Committee; and a petition from Wareham to be set off as a
                            separate collection District from New-Bedford which was referred to the
                            Committee of Commerce— These were admitted without objection— But

                            every Petition presented, till the vote of the House was reconsidered
                            and the rule was suspended for the reception of Petitions without
                            restriction— Then came up the snarl upon the Petition presented by

                                <persRef ref="calhoun-william">W. B. Calhoun</persRef> took the

                            Bill taken up— The Committee of the whole on the Union had reported an
                            Amendment of 200000 dollars for the custom house at Boston— <persRef
                                ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> proposed as an Amendment
                            a proviso, that the house should cost no more than that sum, but
                            afterwards modified the limitation to 350000, this gave rise to a warm
                            debate. <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">Abbott Lawrence</persRef> made
                            two handsome Speeches in favour of the appropriation— I said a few words

                            82 and the Appropriation adopted without a division— An Amendment

                                >Wise</persRef> with leave of the House, made a statement, denying

                            of the State of Michigan into the Union, was taken up and <persRef

                            offered an amendment to the Amendment, to include the Accounts of the
                            expenditures of the contingent expenses of foreign intercourse—this made
                            another very heated debate upon the amendment to the amendment, and upon
                            the amendment itself— I spoke against them both— The former was modified
                            at the motion of <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> to obviate
                            my objection—and the latter was carried by yeas and nays 131 to 56— The

                            seconded 95 to 74—and the vote for putting the main question was 104 to
                            70— The bill passed to a third reading without a division— I took

                            question was taken whether any modification of the duties upon the
                            brown-tincted linens, should be proposed. Lee, Holsey and Webster voted
                            for it—Granger, Judson and Dickerson against it, and with them I voted,
                            in favour of the manufacturing interest— In the House Sundry resolutions
                            were offered, and some adopted— <persRef ref="hawes-albert"
                                >Hawes</persRef> moved the suspension of the Rules to fix a day for

                            thirds— A Bill was then taken up, which had been made the order of this
                            day from 12 to 1. to raise an additional regiment of Dragoons, and to
                            accept the services of Volunteers, reported by the Military Committee,
                            which sprung a debate which at one O’Clock, was arrested and the

                            and an additional Section to distribute 23 millions of dollars proceeds
                            of the public Lands, among the people of the several States, according
                            to their respective federal population— Mercer supported his motion by a

                            debated till One O’Clock, when the Committee rose, under the limitation
                            of time in the special order of the House. It was a day for private
                            business; but the rules were suspended to go immediately into Committee
                            of the whole, and resume the Bill authorizing the President to accept
                            the services of Volunteers— <persRef ref="ashley-william"
                                >Ashley</persRef> of Missouri moved an Additional Section, to
                            authorize the raising of a second Regiment of Dragoons, upon which a
                            debate followed, in which I took a part— I objected to the insertion of
                            Ashley’s Amendment as incongruous and inconsistent with the Bill itself.
                            The amendment was however carried. I proposed two amendments which were
                            adopted; one to limit the amount of the Appropriation to 300000
                            dollars—and the other a proviso to exempt from the limitation of time to
                            the bill, the rights and privileges secured by it to the volunteers—

                        <p>My grand-child, <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> was
                            taken suddenly ill, and fainted while she was reading to me the 12<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of Nehemiah, but soon recovered.
                            I walked to the Presbyterian Church and heard <persRef
                                ref="butts-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Butts</persRef>,
                            from Numbers 14.21. “But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be
                            filled with the glory of the Lord.” He said that all the earth here
                            meant a very small part of the Earth— That of the whole population of
                            the globe there were six hundred millions sunk in the depths of heathen
                            ignorance and superstition— One hundred and twenty Millions of <persRef
                                ref="mahomet">Mohammedans</persRef> very little elevated above the
                            barbarous pagans— That of one hundred and sixty-five Millions of nominal
                            Christians, one hundred and ten Millions were roman catholics, slaves
                            and dupes to the imposture of Popery; and that of the fifty five
                            Millions of Protestants, not more than five Millions were orthodox
                            believers; and that of those five Millions the proportion of true
                            converted children of God, the number was fearfully small. And yet that
                            very small number were all by whom the glory of the Lord could be said
                            to fill the whole Earth— From his division of Christians into Roman
                            Catholics and Protestants he seemed not to know the existence of a Greek
                            Church— There were other incongruities in the discourse— After Church

                            late Consul of the United States at the island of Teneriffe called me
                            out from my Seat in the Hall, yesterday— Hodgson went out two years
                            since as Dragoman at Constantinople; but could not agree with <persRef
                                ref="porter-david">Commodore Porter</persRef> who is the Chargé
                            d’Affaires to the sublime Porte, and is now Consul perhaps at Morocco—
                            He says the renewal of the Treaty with Morocco is in the process of
                            Negotiation— On my way to the Capitol I stopped at the Bank of the
                            Metropolis, and took a draft on the Manhattan Company, to be endorsed
                            payable to <persRef ref="durand-asher">A. B. Durand</persRef>— At the
                            House the first hour was wasted in trifling—repeated motions to suspend

                            between Hawes and <persRef ref="lane-amos">Lane</persRef> till the order
                            of the day was called; for private business— Two or three Bills were
                            called up contested and postponed— A message from the <persRef

                            a Catalogue of a Library from England. Motions to adjourn were made and
                            repeated till shortly after two O’Clock, when one succeeded— I went to
                            the Chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, and prepared a report of
                            Amendments to the Bill from the Senate N. 99—for reducing the duties of
                            impost on some Articles, and otherwise amending the Tariff Laws— I
                            reviewed and assorted the Papers of the Committee, and thought of
                            proposing to the Committee to prepare a further report—besides that on
                            the Bill from the Senate— At 5 I came home, but left my Chronometer at
