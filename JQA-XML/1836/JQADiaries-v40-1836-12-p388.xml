						<p>Continuing the perusal of <persRef ref="johnson-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s</persRef> Treatise upon
							Language. I find him in Lecture disclaiming with great earnestness any
							intention to unsettle the belief of divine revelation in the holy
							Scriptures. So does <persRef ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin
								Constant</persRef>— So did the <persRef ref="leclerc-george">Count
								de Buffon</persRef> in his correspondence with the Sorbonne— I
							believe Johnson sincere; and he declares emphatically that he never
							would have published his Lectures if he had believed his theory
							incompatible with faith in divine revelation— <persRef
								ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> supposes that <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope</persRef> did not know that his optimism in the Essay on Man
							was fatalism; and Alexander B. in excluding religious faith from the
							conclusions of his own argument assigns no reason for the exception. The
							general tenor of his argument is that words have no signification except
							as reports of the physical senses— That all knowledge consists of
							sights, sounds, feels, tastes and smells—but in his classification he
							admits another class of thoughts which he calls verbal; and in another
							Lecture he allows internal feelings to be also a source of thoughts— The
							words mind, and idea, are totally excluded from his vocabulary— His
							broad Theory is that language is and can be significant of nothing but
							Sensation— And as this doctrine makes of the universe a mass of
							sensuality without Soul, and without reasoning faculty, he runs foul of
							natural religion of theism of mathematics of metaphysics—of all art and
							all Science, protesting all the time that he means no harm to religion—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson is a remarkable instance of
							the misfortune of intense and incessant meditation, destitute of dear
							conception— Morning visit from <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef>, to whom I gave a
							copy of my Eulogy on <persRef ref="madison-james">James
								Madison</persRef>.— <persRef ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pedrich</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todsen</persRef>
							came and I went with them to the old Episcopal church at Georgetown,
							where I saw his groups of statuary, his busts of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, and <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> and his
							designs for Basso Relievo Sculpture in a Church. He was urgent to have
							my opinion of his works, and I could not give it for it was not
							favourable I could not flatter and was unwilling to discourage him.— His
							groups are mere commonplace imitation of the antique— His allegorical
							faces very uncaptivating; and his busts no likenesses— It was
							unfortunate for him that there were in the same building busts of
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodbury</persRef>, the Secretary and of <persRef
								ref="preston-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Preston</persRef> the Senator from South-Carolina by <persRef
								ref="powers-hiram">Hiram Power</persRef> of Kentucky, and superior
							as likenesses and as works of art to the busts by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pedrich— His designs for Bas Relief
							embrace 84 Subjects Half from the old and half from the new Testament—
							They are in the Classical Style of Italian Painting, and represent God
							almighty in the form of an old man with a hooked nose, a bushy beard
							rolled up in thirty or forty yards of blanketing. Then he represents the
							Patriarchs <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="isaac">Isaac</persRef> in precisely the same form, and in the
							same costume— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pedrich has a
							recommendation from his master <persRef ref="thorvaldsen-bertel"
								>Thorwaldsen</persRef> certifying that he has considerable talent,
							which is unquestionable; but he has not that ideal conception of grace
							and beauty which is the perfection of Sculpture and Painting, and
							without which the mere imitation of nature, physical nature, is <pb
								n="389" type="ms"/>fit only for Signposts and Milestones.— On
							returning home after a visit to the Bank of the Metropolis, I found at
							my door a person named <persRef ref="cameron-george">George
								Cameron</persRef>, who exhibited to me drawings of an invention for
							guarding the boilers of Steam engines from explosion; for which he said
							he had a patent; and he had a petition to the <persRef
								ref="dickerson-mahlon">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>; for the sum
							of 300 dollars to make experiments of his invention— He complained that
							the Secretary of the Navy had refused him the money, and as I had
							neither power nor will to redress that grievance, he said he would lay
							his invention, before a Committee of Congress— To this I had no
							objection— The man had as <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> said
							of <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef> a Cognac face. and
							he had burnished it before coming here— Just before dinner I received
							the proof slips from the National Intelligencer Office of that part of
							my Eulogy on Madison which is to be published in the paper to-morrow
							Morning— I had corrected it and took the opportunity to rectify an error
							in the pamphlet, which stated the numbers of Publius at 86—they were 85—
							After dinner it occurred to me to correct another error into which I had
							fallen in enumerating the numbers of the federalist written by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison. I had omitted the numbers 62 and
							63— I wrote a note correcting this error, and enclosed it to the Foreman
							of the National Intelligencer, with a request that it might be subjoined
							to the part of the Eulogy to be published in the daily paper to-morrow—
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> spent the Evening at
								<persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"

							<item>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</item>

						<p><persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Giusta</persRef> was here this morning—
							Part of my Eulogy was published in the National intelligencer of this
							morning; but my note which I had enclosed to the foreman was not
							printed; nor was my correction of the proof reducing the numbers of
							Publius from 86 to 85 substituted for the original error. I called at
							the shop of the <persRef ref="blake-john2">Bookbinder Blake</persRef>,
							with a collection of pamphlets to be bound in a Volume concerning the
							boundary controversy between Michigan and Ohio; and I met there <persRef
								ref="sullivan-john7">John F. Sullivan</persRef>, an Irishman, much
							implicated in the warfare between <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President Jackson</persRef>, and the Bank of the United States— He
							has opened here a Stationer’s shop, and shewed me sundry samples of
							writing paper of various sizes, but none of them of the precise size
							that I wanted— Our manufacturers of paper have gone into the practice of
							making their paper almost entirely of cotton, and the paper has
							consequently no tenacity of texture; it falls to pieces in the mere act
							of folding it up— I stop’d also at <persRef ref="fischer-william"
								>Fischer’s</persRef> shop, and examined many samples of paper but
							found none to suit me— I was twice at the Office of the National
							Intelligencer— I was anxious to correct the error in my Eulogy, with
							regard to the numbers of Publius, and in omitting the numbers 62 and 63.
							in the enumeration of those written by <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>— How it happened
							that my note, sent yesterday to the foreman was not published was
							explained as well as it could be— It was the invincible carelessness of
							the compositors—my corrections of the proof were given to them; and they
							forgot to use them— To make assurance with regard to the facts doubly
							sure, I went to the Capitol, and at the Library, examined all the
							Editions of the Federalist which they have there; and they are three—
							The first edition in which the papers were collected, published at
							New-York in two duodecimo Volumes in 1788— This copy belonged to
								<persRef ref="hamilton-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Elizabeth Hamilton</persRef>, and was by <pb n="390" type="ms"/>her
							given to her Sister, <persRef ref="church-angelica">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Angelica Church</persRef>, from whom
							it passed into the Library of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, and with that was
							purchased by Congress— On a blank page before the title page of the
							first Volume of this copy, there is a minute in the hand-writing of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson as follows.</p>
						<p>N<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 64 by <persRef ref="jay-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay</persRef>.</p>

							48. 49. 50. 51. 52. 53. 54. 55. 56. 57. 58. 62. 63. by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</p>
						<p>The rest of the work by <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander Hamilton.</persRef> </p>
						<p>and immediately under this are certificates dated 13. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1829. signed by <persRef
								ref="harrison-richard">Rich<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
								Harrison</persRef>, and <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">Joseph
								Nourse</persRef> that the above minute is in the hand-writing of
							Thomas Jefferson— The Librarian shewed me also an Article in the
							National Register of 5. April 1817.—to this effect—that in the National
							Intelligencer of the preceding 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							March, there was a statement as from unquestionable authority, with a
							list varying from this one minuted by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson with regard to the number 21. instead of 20— To this there was
							a reply in the New-York Evening Post affirming that Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hamilton, a day or two previous to his
							death stopped into the office of his friend <persRef ref="benson-egbert"
								>judge Benson</persRef>, then absent, and in the presence of his
							clerks left a paper in a book lying there and departed. After his fall,
							this paper was observed, and deposited by judge Benson in the City
							Library with a certificate that it was the hand writing of A. Hamilton—
							The following is a copy. N<hi rend="superscript">os.</hi> 2. 3. 4. 5.
							54. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay. N<hi rend="superscript">os.</hi>
							10. 14. 37 to 48 inclusive. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison N<hi
								rend="superscript">os.</hi> 18. 19. 20. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hamilton and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison
							jointly—all the rest by M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hamilton.— It is
							apparent that this Memorandum made in the agitation of mind which
							tortured Hamilton, from the time of his acceptance of <persRef
								ref="burr-aaron">Burr’s</persRef> challenge, was inaccurate by a
							defect of memory— It claimed for himself the numbers from 48 to 58, with
							the exception of 54. which it assigned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jay, but all of which were certainly written by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Madison— It claimed also the numbers 62. and 63 written by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison, and 64 written by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay—and it is most probable that the
							mistake by which he thought himself the author of the numbers from 48 to
							58. caused the other mistake which ascribed to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jay N. 54. instead of 64 which he really wrote— The minute
							was evidently written from mere memory without recurrence to the book,
							and under the perturbation of an impending fatal duel— The two other
							Editions of the Federalist, in the Library of Congress, are that
							published by <persRef ref="gideon-jacob">Gideon</persRef> in 1818. and
							the republication of it by <persRef ref="thompson-pishey"
								>Thompson</persRef> and <persRef ref="homans-benjamin"
								>Homans</persRef> in 1831— In that of 1818 the papers written by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison, were revised and corrected
							by himself—and it was printed from a copy of a former edition lent by
							him to the publisher, with his own marginal notes— From these it appears
							that the numbers 18. 19. and 20. were the joint composition of Madison
							and Hamilton, and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s minute
							claiming for Madison the number 21. and not claiming the number 20. was
							so far incorrect— I returned to the Office of the National
							Intelligencer, and fixed with <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> the Note to be
							published with the remnant of the Eulogy to-morrow. I then returned home
							to dinner— <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> was here part
							of the afternoon, and we consumed the Evening at whist.</p>

							from his brother, <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Daniel Brent</persRef>;
							Consul at Paris, praying for some addition to his Compensation, which he

							asked me for a copy of my Eulogy on <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> for himself; and one
							for his brother.— I had none left to spare of the copies that I brought
							with me from Quincy; but having written to <persRef ref="eastburn-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eastburn</persRef> for more, I
							promised to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent when I should receive
							the next packet the two copies— I received this morning a note from
								<persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> the Secretary of the Franklin Insurance company,
							inviting me to attend at a Meeting of the Directors of the Company at 4
							O Clock this afternoon, at which the propositions that I had made were
							to be considered— I accordingly attended the Meeting which consisted of
							the President and Secretary and three Directors, <persRef
								ref="elder-william">Elder</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>Coyle</persRef> and another— A desultory conversation was held upon
							my propositions, which I repeated, and which were discussed— <persRef
								ref="grammer-g">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grammer</persRef> the
							President, read the Memorial now before Congress for a continuance and
							modification of the Charter; which unless renewed, will expire in 1838—
							On full reflection I said I thought the reserved fund required by the
							act of incorporation, and which has been raised, could not be converted
							into capital paid in, and distributed as Stock, but by increasing the
							capital itself, and still holding the Notes of the Stockholders to the
							full extent of their present amount— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Elder was opposed to any alteration of the Charter, except as requested
							by the memorial before Congress— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coyle
							moved that the whole subject should be referred to a Committee of three
							of the Directors, whom he named and the vote was adopted accordingly—
							The meeting was adjourned, and I came home between six and seven, and we
							passed the remainder of the Evening at cards.</p>

						<p>Thoroughly chilled this morning before breakfast by sitting and reading
							upwards of two hours in my chamber without a fire—reading <persRef
								ref="johnson-alexander">Alexander B. Johnson’s</persRef> Treatise
							upon Language— At morning worship, I heard <persRef
								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from Matthew 6.10. “Thy kingdom come”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler remarked that in the Lord’s prayer,
							from which his text was taken, there were three petitions, referring to
							God, and three to the supplicant himself, and his fellow creatures of
							the human race— This had never occurred to me, but it is so— There is
							another observation respecting the Lord’s prayer which deserves notice;
							and that is that the petitioner always speaks in the plural number— It
							is a social prayer—in which every individual supplicates for others at
							the same time as for himself—for others indefinitely, for all who pray
							at the same time; or rather for all human kind. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fowler is a young man, exceedingly earnest, but not

							Church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for the second Sunday in
							advent, and preached from Proverbs 24.30. “I went by the field of the
							slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 31. And
							lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face
							thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down”— How forcible is
							this picture of the effects of Sloth— How much more impressive than a
							precept enjoining diligence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s
							Sermon is an old one; but he has a partiality for texts from the Book of
							Proverbs; which I wish was shared by many of his clerical brethren.
							After Church we had visits from <persRef ref="bailey-jeremiah">M<hi

								J. Ingersoll</persRef>, in adverse interests— Ingersoll sends me a
							printed opinion of his, affirming the right of the Legislature of

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle mentions that he has sent to
							the National Gazette a Letter addressed to me, to be followed by
							another— I suppose on the same Subject— He said something of such an
							intention to me, when I last passed through Philadelphia.</p>
