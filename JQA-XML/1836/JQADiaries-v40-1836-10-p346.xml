						<p>The weather was so cold that I could not write in my chamber and yet I

							publication, and sent it to <persRef ref="eastburn-john">M<hi

							named <persRef ref="u">Smith</persRef> in the afternoon. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s object was to invite me to deliver
							an introductory Lecture to the Hanover Lyceum in Boston.— I had already
							declined two such invitations at Boston, and one at Charlestown. I
							declined again though very much pressed by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith, who said they did not wish me to take the trouble of
							writing, but to extemporize a discourse upon any subject I should

						<p>Communion day— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> preached in the morning from Acts 2.23. “Him being
							delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God ye have

							crucifixion— The communion was administered partly by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt and partly by <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney</persRef>— After the hymn was sung, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Whitney announced that a collection would be taken up, for
							the annual expenses of the communion service; of which he had given
							notice on the last communion day. <persRef ref="souther-john">Capt<hi
									rend="superscript">n</hi> John Souther</persRef> then rose in
							his pew, and addressed him— “Reverend Sir.”— Can you inform me what use
							is to be made of the surplus of the collection if there should be any—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney answered indirectly, that he
							should suppose it ought to be applied by a general vote of the Society—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Souther said enquiries upon this
							subject had <pb n="347" type="ms"/>been made by numbers of persons, and
							that the amount of the collection would depend upon the answer— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney said he did not know; repeated his
							opinion that the surplus ought to be disposed of by a vote of the
							congregation; and added that every one would give what he pleased— The
							collection was then taken up. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s
							afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 11. and the verse I do not
							recollect; but the verse I do not recollect— It was however upon the
							character of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef>, and a sequel to a preceding Sermon upon his
							conversion— On returning home I found <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>, with <persRef
										ref="clapp-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clapp</persRef>
							the Editor of the Boston Evening Gazette, and <persRef ref="clapp-william2">his Son</persRef> at our house— They
							took tea with us, and returned to Boston in the Evening. <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> called late in the Evening with a note from
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— I read the
							third Sermon of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, being the second on the
							examples of the Saints, and the third on perseverance— This part which
							is the conclusion of the whole Treatise was to me far more impressive
							than either of the former parts. The enumeration of the sins which most
							easily beset the youth, the manhood, and the old age of men, with the
							addition of those which bear upon all ages were full of instruction, if
							I were capable of receiving it. “Avec la vielless arrivent les
							infirmités, les chagrins, les soucis”— How keenly I feel the truth of
							this, and of the whole passage relating to old age! and how deeply ought
							I to feel the exhortation— [“]Those shaking hands, weighed down by the
							burden of years—raise them towards Heaven. That voice, scarcely capable
							of articulating sounds, turn it up to God—implore of him that after
							having sustained you in the weakness of childhood, in the fire of youth
							in the dissipations of manhood, he would still support you in the
							decrepitude of the hoary head” And I do so pray to the father of all
							mankind.</p>

						<p>This morning one of the men, employed in digging <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> well, had his arm broken,
							by the falling of a stone, from those with which they were stoning it—
							He was at the bottom in search of a Pick axe, which they had left on
							Saturday, and which was stolen yesterday— They had dug fifty-five feet
							down. without coming to water and after going through a bed of clay many
							feet thick, had struck on a rock of flint— The well will therefore never
							have much water in it— There is in Quincy no Well-digger by profession—
							Charles was therefore obliged to engage one at Boston—a man named
								<persRef ref="higgins-uriah">Higgins</persRef> who sent out these
							workmen, but has scarcely been three hours here since the work began— It
							is hard work for the men, and this unfortunate accident indicates that
							it has not been carefully done— <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef> set the mans arm,
							and he was taken this evening to Boston— One of the Stone-cutters named
								<persRef ref="chadwick-john">Chadwick</persRef>, came and contracted
							for a granite ledge, nearly adjoining upon that now occupied by <persRef
								ref="colburn-asa">Colburn</persRef>— Charles went over the hill with
							him to view the quarry, and returning found a woman with an axe, cutting
							down an Apple-tree to carry it away for fuel. She discussed the matter
							with him on the ground of moral principle; and pleaded the great
							scarcity of firewood as her apology for the liberties she was taking
							with her neighbour’s trees— After dinner, <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, went over to
							Hingham and visited <persRef ref="thaxter-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edward Thaxter</persRef>— The day was
							uncommonly fine, and I walked to the Middle and the Druid Pasture—
							Stop’d and enquired for <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Josiah
								Adams</persRef>, but he was gone upon his weekly pilgrimage to
							Boston. I went over the Druid pastures, and found very few acorns— Never
							indeed so few. The two old White Oaks, which I remember from my earliest
							childhood, and which seem to me no larger than when I first saw them,
							appear as flourishing as ever. On one of them there are a few acorns not
							yet ripe. <pb n="348" type="ms"/>Returning home, I came by <persRef
								ref="crane-benjamin">B. L. Crane’s</persRef> lot which he purchased
							of me, and found it surrounded with a fence, and covered with blocks of
							stone, for his cellar— <persRef ref="crane-ebenezer">His
								father</persRef> was buried this afternoon from his house— Home
							about Sunset— Whist part of the Evening— Planted half a fourth row in
							South front of Nursery fence; with Pear Seeds and Acorns, Peach and Plum
							stones—and miscellaneous seed in the Seminary front row.</p>

							which divides the two Towns— We turned off the road at the right hand a

							James Baxter for 100 dollars an acre, and partly in mine— We returned
							shortly before noon, discouraged from staying longer out, by a

						<p>The storm continued through the night, and continued with heavy rain, and
							a Northeastern gale all this morning— The confinement to the house
							diverted my attention from my plantations, seedling trees and seeds, and
							turned it to my correspondence which is in confusion and in arrears— I

							one of exchange to <persRef ref="breed-ebenezer">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>Charles</persRef> took them with him to Boston, where he and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> went, and returned
							to dine— <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> came to
							settle with me for a half year of his rent, but he had made up an
							account against me nearly absorbing it all, to a large part of which I
							objected, and after some discussion with me, he said he would come again
							this Evening, and pay me the rent deducting only the charges which I was
							willing to allow, and leave the rest to be settled hereafter; but he did
							not come— I transplanted 20 seedling Pear trees from the boxes at the
							West end of the Garden to a row in the Bartlett Pear tree bed between
							two willow stakes, and four double Peach Seedlings from one part to
							another of the same bed— I also trimmed several hickory trees in the
							Nursery and in the Garden, and planted in the Seminary a cross row of
							Greenleaf white Apple seeds with Crack wilding pear seeds—Peach and Plum
							[symbols] and [symbols] My design of tracing the varieties of fruits and
							of their trees to their respective seeds would require at least 30 years
							of constant experiments to its full execution— I have ascertained that
							the red, black, white, Chesnut and willow Oaks invariably produce their
							kinds from the Acorn— That the shag bark, white walnut and pignut do the
							same— Upon the Peach, I have neglected to make the same experiments, and
								<pb n="351" type="ms"/>cannot trace the tree to the Stone— I see by
							my seedling Apple and Pear trees that there are great varieties
							especially in the rapidity and slowness of growth, and in the form and
							colour of the leaf, and I would trace them to the maturity of the tree
							and the quality of the fruit, and also back to the seed— But I have not
							the time— Half a century of annual experiments might be necessary for
							the developement of all the useful results— I urged Price Greenleaf this
							morning to repeat and continue the same experiments, and may possibly
							succeed in bringing him to it— He has time enough before him— This
							afternoon I walked round <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> grounds,
							but gathered only one Street crab apple and a few Tupelo berries— Closed
							the Evening between 8 and 9.</p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="young-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Young</persRef>, Minister of the New-South Meeting House at Boston,
							who preached in the morning, from Ecclesiastes 7:10. “Say not thou, What
							is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost
							not inquire wisely concerning this”— A learned and interesting
							discourse— The preacher adhered closely to his text.— He did not deny
							that the former times were better than the present— The text itself
							appears to admit the fact with reference to the time, when it was
							written— The Book of Ecclesiastes is shewn from internal evidence, to
							have been composed by Solomon in his old age— The former days of his
							Life had certainly been better, both for his People and for himself than
							those of his last years, and it might be very desirable to him that his
							subjects should not enquire into the cause of this deterioration.— It is
							not to be denied that there are times better than others, and of course
							that the former days are sometimes better and sometimes worse than
							these— The text of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> applied
							therefore to his own former and latter days and can certainly not apply
							to these days in comparison with those of his age— Perhaps his meaning
							however was only to check the general propensity of old men to think the
							days of their youth better than those of their old age, and if so to be
							understood the precept of the text is instructive to all the generations
							of men, and guards against one of the besetting Sins of human nature— So
							the text was considered by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young, and he
							argued against the folly of enquiring why the former days were better
							than these, by an historical review, to prove that it was not always so—
							He shewed also by analysing some of the times reputed to be the best,
							that they were times of great calamity and distress— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Young dined with us, and I found him of
							pleasant and instructive conversation— His Sermon after dinner was from
							Matthew 12.36. [“]But I say unto you, that every idle word, that men
							shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”
							This has an appearance of harshness, but it must be received with two
							qualifications—first that by idle words are meant only words of
							irreverence to God or injurious to our neighbour— And secondly that we
							are to account to a merciful God, who will forgive or excuse trivial and
							unintentional offences. It is one of those rigorous precepts of
							Christianity in which the language of hyperbole is used to impress the
							mind with an important duty, which the untutored heart is prone to
							neglect or to disregard. It is a precept at once of prudence and of
							Justice— Inconsiderate speech is an infirmity incident to that faculty
							possessed only by man of all the animal creation, and as speech is the
							vehicle of thought, the instruction to curb the exercise of the faculty,
							is in its result a wise and benevolent regulation of the <pb n="352"
								type="ms"/>heart. I read the fourth Sermon of the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon the vanity of the means of resistance
							against God—an excellent discourse, and peculiarly appropriate to the
							Christian Religion which lays the foundation of all morality in the will
							of God.— Thence it follows that all crime and all vice is resistance
							against the Will of God, and to teach men that all resistance against
							the will of God is vain is to teach them the practice of virtue.</p>

						<p>Autumnal East and North-east storm, with a violent gale, and driving

								ref="bass-benjamin">Benjamin Bass</persRef>, for the Policy of
							Insurance upon his house mortgaged to me, and which has been renewed for
							seven years from the first of August last. He had assigned the former
							policy to me— As it had expired I gave it to him to have it renewed— I
							asked him for the new Policy, when he paid me the interest on his
							note—he said it was in the hands of <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">Lemuel
								Brackett</persRef> the agent of the Insurance Company; and I might
							call for it upon him— I did call on him accordingly, but he said Bass
							had taken it away himself, refusing to execute an assignment of it,
							because there would be a charge of 50 cents for recording the Assignment
							on the company’s Books— Bass now said they would charge him a dollar for
							recording the Assignment, and he seemed disinclined to execute it— Said
							that a dollar was a dollar—that he had increased the sum insured upon
							his house, and that when I lent him the money, I had not asked for the
							assignment of his policy, but he had made it of his own accord— I said
							my recollections did not exactly agree with his, but it was true that
							the assignment of the policy had been his own offer, when he borrowed
							the money— That as to the increase of the Sum in the present policy, and
							the charge for recording the assignment, they were for his
							consideration, and if he preferred taking up his note, it would be more
							agreeable to me. He said that would not be convenient to him <pb n="354"

							immediate payment But I would take the Policy to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brackett, and ask him to make the Assignment upon it, which
							I should expect him to execute— He had given me the Policy and I took it
							with me. I came over the quarry hill, and visited the ledges— I examined
							also most of the fruit trees, on the several lots— I found several
							shagbark trees in bearing for the first time, and several new wilding
							Apple trees, under which I gathered a few apples for seed— I have found
							on the farm eight varieties of wilding Apples, and I propose to plant
							seeds of each of them separately, to observe which of them come up, and
							the comparative rapidity of their growth— For this I must rely upon my
							Pots and my Garden boxes— After dinner I transplanted 20 Seedling Apple
							trees from Garden box 1. to Bartlett Pear tree bed. Also six of seven
							Ash trees growing together between the Summer house cellar and the road.
							Four Seedling peach trees which I removed from near the tall Apple
							seedling of 1834. and two of three apple seedlings too near each other,
							Planted also in the Seminary, a cross row of nursery Pippin seeds,

								>Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned to dine— <persRef

								ref="turner-elisha">Elisha</persRef>, upon which the same lot is

							which he sells was because by my plan of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> Savile lot taken by <persRef
								ref="withington-mather">Withington</persRef>, one half of the width
							of his lot was taken away. I still wished to see the Deeds to my uncle
								<persRef ref="adams-peter">Peter Boylston Adams</persRef>, and that
							Josiah Bass jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> whose land borders on the
							lot now sold by Peter Turner should explicitly assent to the boundary
							stake set up by Peter Turner. He said he had sold the adjoining lot of
							ten Acres to <persRef ref="bass-josiah2">Josiah Bass jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef>, who had
							lately asked him to go, and shew him the bounds. He would therefore
							obtain Bass’s assent to the bounds of the lot now surveyed by <persRef
								ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Humphrey</persRef> and which I have agreed to purchase— I was great
							part of the morning on the garden, and trimmed one of the willow trees
							which have grown from Stakes set out by me in 1832 also two Hickories
							and one red Oak, the ruts and acorn of which were planted by me in 1831.
							and which are now about 8 feet high. From this I infer the average
							growth of those trees; the red Oak and the pignut hickory, for five
							years—about 19 inches a year; but in this case as in that of the tall
							apple seedling the growth of the second year is equal to that of any two
							other years— The black and white Oaks and the Shagbark Hickory are of
							much slower growth; but of healthy plants, in a suitable soil, I believe
							the second years growth surpasses all others— I planted in Pot 20. Seeds
							of the farm double-stock apple and 20. of the Brown sugar pear. After
							dinner and towards Sunset I walked over to Charles’s lot which he is
							laying out, where his cellar is partly stoned, and his well has 16 feet
							deep of water. Thence I went to the <persRef ref="colburn-asa"
								>Coburn</persRef> and <persRef ref="dutton-benjamin"
								>Dutton</persRef> ledge, where the workmen were just ceasing from

								Walker</persRef> of Charlestown, this morning from Matthew 6.13.
							“and lead us not into temptation”—and in the afternoon from 2.
							Corinthians 5.4 [“]For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being
							burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that
							mortality might be swallowed up of life.” The discourse of the morning
							was upon temptation—that of the afternoon upon [“]Life, Death and
							immortality.” There is some obscurity in the text of the afternoon, but
							both the discourses were admirable. That upon Temptation especially was
							an impressive treatise of rigorous morality— The explanation of the true
							meaning of the text discarded the difficulty of the construction too
							commonly given to it, and which supposes that the Deity should ever lead
							men into temptation. He said that the excusatory plea of temptation was
							a subterfuge, and that in nine cases of ten the temptation was sought by
							the sinner himself.— The Sermon upon death was in many passages
							pathetic—and the argument that the dead are not dead <pb n="356"
								type="ms"/>either to themselves, or to their relatives and friends
							or their Country was the same with that of <persRef ref="socrates"
								>Socrates</persRef> in the Phaedo.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Walker dined with us, and <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> who came out from
							Boston.— I had only the Evening left for reading the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>,
							upon true Heroism—from Proverbs 16.32. He that ruleth his Spirit, is
							better than he that taketh cities— Saurin has it, he who is master of
							his own heart; and he comments upon the expression of the original
							Hebrew, which signifies the breath— He supposes that the text will be
							taken by critics for extravagant exaggeration, and admits that there is
							in the Scriptures much oriental hyperbolical imagery: but he insists
							that in this case, there is no exaggeration, and that the text is
							literally true— I believe it so— The taking of Cities is seldom an
							atchievement of good men; and to say that the master of his own Passions
							is a better man than a conqueror, is to give him but feeble praise.— The
							Sermon is very good, but did not quite equal my expectations from the
							text— I read also a Chapter of <persRef ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin
								Constant’s</persRef> work upon Religion.</p>

							came, and I went with him over the Hill and shewed him three
							Apple-trees, the old Trunks of which have been torn and split down, and
							left on the ground to be taken away at a convenient time for fuel— The
							lot was formerly an Orchard— The Apple trees are large, and have had
							upon them many heavy boughs and branches fit for fire wood— These
							Trespassers have followed the business of cutting and carrying them away
							as an occupation— All the large and decayed limbs have been lopped off
							heretofore; and now they split down and hack off the body of the tree—
							We found in the hollow of one of the trees an old evacuated bee-hive,
							and a large mass of decayed honey comb— I engaged M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Spear to have the trees all brought over
							to my own yard where use for them for fuel will be found in our own

								ref="dutton-benjamin">Dutton</persRef>, and three other men at work
							upon one of them, and three of <persRef ref="hardwick-john"
								>Hardwick’s</persRef> men upon another— And there was one man,
							stripping off the soil from the rock upon which Dutton proposes to
							begin— I parted from Spear, and called upon <persRef ref="bass-benjamin"
								>Benjamin Bass</persRef>, to hasten him for the execution of the
							assignment upon his Policy, <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brackett</persRef> had sent me word
							that he had notified Bass that the Assignment was ready for execution by

							would do it, but that it was no part of his bargain— I was very
							indignant at his tergiversations, and told him <pb n="358" type="ms"/>I
							was much surprized at his attempt to withdraw the security, he had given
							me, upon the renewal of his policy, and that if he did not execute the
							assignment, I would put the mortgage into the hands of a lawyer to be
							sued. Upon this he waxed valiant; said he was a republican, and was not
							to be frightened, and I might put the mortgage in suit this very day, if
							I wanted to put him to the cost of a few dollars— That perhaps he would
							get the money and take up his Note— I told him I should take it as a
							favour if he would, for that from his conduct now, I wished to have as
							few dealings with him hereafter as possible.— He said my character was
							known throughout the Nation—and that he was not to be frightened— Not
							into honesty? said I—he said he was an honest man, and never wronged any
							man to the value of a cent—and that I had better put his mortgage in
							suit this very day.— I determined to have no further altercation with
							him; and left him— He is not absolutely a dishonest, but a trickish man;
							and as he is wrong in this case he will ultimately come to his sense of
							duty by his own reflections.— Returning home, I gathered some farm
							bitter sweeting Apples, Button Pears, and Split rock Shag barks— I made
							out a Deed to my Son Charles of the land for his house lot; and wrote
							over again the Deed of Saltmarsh land to <persRef ref="hardwick-henry"
								>Henry Hardwick</persRef> which was executed the first of this month
							but not acknowledged— I found on reading it over, that there was a

							for the District— Several of the Resolutions have reference to me, and

							nomination, but with a declaration of their confidence in my judgement
							and integrity— I told them that I received with great satisfaction this
							renewed mark of confidence from the Anti-masons of the District— That
							conscious as I was of deserving no more credit than for the intention of
							doing my duty to my constituents, and how much they had overrated the
							value of my services, I could only say that if re-elected to Congress, I
							should continue to act on the same principles upon which I have served

							Black Oak trees on the side of the road and near where that was,— From
							one of those Oaks I gathered half a dozen Acorns; there were not many

								ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Humphrey</persRef> made the survey; and surrounded with an heap of

							of the boundary line to the Northern Corner; which was N. &amp; by West,
							less than half west and we went to the Northern bound 13. 1/2 rods
							across— Returning we looked at the 3 half Oak tree which is the corner
							of another of my woodland lots— We then came home and I gave Turner a
							check for 391. dollars 25 cents for the Deed of 7. Acres and 132 rods of
							Wood-land according to the Survey— He took the Deed with him to have a
							slight correction made by <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">M<hi

							and the children to visit <persRef ref="tufts-mercy2">M<hi

							of <persRef ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin Constant</persRef> upon
							Religion and approve much of his object, and of his manner of treating
							it with one exception. That almost half the work consists of Notes— I
							hold the opinion that a book intended for duration should never have any
							notes— Every Note is a digression— It destroys the unity which is the
							first law of all literary composition— The substance of every useful
							note should be woven into the body of the work itself— I do not object
							to a mere citation of authorities; but argumentative or illustrative
							matter should not be separated from the general thread of the discourse.
							A Book full of Notes is like a human body covered with excrescences</p>

							29–32 in which the ways of God to the house of Israel; and the ways of

							compass the bearings of the strip of Saltmarsh land, which I have sold
							to <persRef ref="hardwick-henry">Henry Hardwick</persRef>, and which in

							Rods W.N.W— The third seven Rods S.W by W. and the fourth 9. S.E by E
							corresponding very exactly with the first plan I had drawn, and making a
							lot of 49 rods and 66 feet— I gathered a pocket full of white walnuts;
							the intermediate between the Shellbark and the pignut called by <persRef

							the white walnut, and by <persRef ref="michaux-francois"
								>Michaux</persRef> the Mockernut. I could find no good Acorns. We

								Johnson</persRef> from the Railway was here again, and Charles
							agreed with him for the execution of the lease to the Company. <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> dined with us— I

							the seeds of Farm purple spot and blushing crab apples with S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michael Pear seeds and cores; and in each
							plat a shellbark bud in the drupe— Transplanted from Pot 10. four Apple
							seedlings to the front row of the Bartlett pear bed in the Garden, and
							13. Seedling Apple trees and 1. Pear from Garden box 2 to the same bed—
							I trimmed 12 Seedling Pignut trees growing in one row, in the centre
							barren of the Nursery: they are in their third or fourth year and three
							of them are near five feet high— An unusual and remarkable fact of these
							trees is that of the twelve nuts planted in the row, every one has come
							up, and has lived to this time. It proves that the tree may be very
							easily raised— I this day finished reading the notes to the first volume
							of <persRef ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin Constant</persRef> upon
							Religion. The first Book is introductory. The second treats of Religion,
							as its influence operates upon man in the savage State— Our evening was

						<p>Yesterday was as warm as midsummer, and last Evening the weather
							continued as mild— On rising this morning I omitted going out of the

								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> knocked at my door I was altogether unaware of

							unsuspicious of the Northwestern gale; but on ascending the hill from
							the bridge in the valley fronting <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> house met
							the blast of a Counsellor which feelingly persuaded me what I was— I
							hesitated till we had reached the declivity fronting <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Quincy’s</persRef> gate, whether to turn back or proceed. We pushed
							on however, and completed our walk round the railway square, and as we
							returned looked at the two rising Granite houses which <persRef ref="u"
								>Flanders</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Willard</persRef> are
							building just <pb n="362" type="ms"/>this side of the Rail-way church,
							in Milton— The wintry cold continued, though with a clear sky, and
							bright Sun, the whole day— The garden was very repulsive— I planted in
							pot 10. about 30 Farm red wedge Apple seeds and 20 Seeds of Farm wilding
							Pears— This red wedge Apple is a crab; but so peculiar in form and
							colour that I have an earnest curiosity to see what sort of a plant it
							will produce, and how it will grow— I gathered also a number of the
							Shell-bark walnuts, now just ripe, upon the tree in the garden, near the
							Summer house cellar, and after dinner I planted, at each of the four
							Corner’s of my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							house lot 3 of these nuts. 1 central, in the drupe, and one on each side
							of it, about two inches distant from it, and all about 2 inches deep;
							the ground being just broken up by <persRef ref="toohey-john">John
								Toohey</persRef>— I planted 3 of these nuts at each corner with the
							hope that one of the three may come up and grow there—and I chose this
							day for the plantation, because it is the anniversary day of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> marriage in 1764. I began
							reading this morning, the second Volume of <persRef
								ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin Constant</persRef> upon Religion—

						<p>A second January day in October— A clear sky, and brisk gale from the
							N.W. blowing the whole day— It did not wholly confine me to the house;
							but abridged my plantations; and very much curtailed my proposed
							experiments— I planted Farm Russet and Penn’s Hill red bullet
							Apple-seeds and S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michael Pear seeds, with
							garden walnuts Peach Stone and Plum but with utter uncertainty whether
							any of them will come up, or grow— I now first observe the varieties of
							form, between my garden Shellbark; the farm Shellbark and the Mount
							Wollaston white Walnut or Mockernut— They are all perfectly
							distinguishable from one another, and I believe the varieties of the
							pignut might be noted with equal certainty. I have hitherto raised them
							promiscuously, and can as yet discern the different kinds of the trees
							only by the number of the leaflets on each stalk— I have seedlings
							growing <unclear>certainly</unclear> of the three kinds, and the growth
							of some of them of each kind, is rapid beyond expectation— That of
							others exceedingly slow.— Every year now gives occasion to new
							observations on the growth of seedling Oaks, Elms, Walnuts, Buttonwood,
							Ash, and Nettletree; as well as of Apple, Pear, cherry, Peach and Plum
							and I have now to add the Maple.— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> P. Greenleaf</persRef> brought me
							yesterday morning a large Winter Squash, which he has raised from the
							seed that we brought from Nantucket, and which he has very successfully
							cultivated— My Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> has
							taken up to set out on his place, many of my seedling Oaks and Elms, and
							with them, the Stake Button-wood which I planted in 1831. and which is
							now perhaps 12 feet high. It was too near a Shellbark tree planted as a
							nut from the garden walnut, also in 1831. and now about five feet high—
							This I wish to preserve and retain in its place, and have therefore
							removed from it all inconvenient neighbours.— My observations become
							confused as they multiply, and I now see the necessity of methodizing
							them—without yet discovering the method of making them ultimately
							useful.— I am reading the second Volume of <persRef
								ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin Constant’s</persRef> work upon
							Religion— It consists of historical illustrations adduced in proof of
							the Theory set forth in the first Volume— Religion is an essential
							property of man— It is in substance the same in all ages and all
							Countries, but is perpetually diversified in its forms. The Savage
							worships a familiar Spirit— With the dawn of civilization appears the
							worship of the Sun moon and stars, which introduces immediately an order
								<pb n="363" type="ms"/>an order of Priesthood; and thence forward
							religion resolves itself into the dominion of the Priesthood.</p>

							Religion— His third book is upon the causes which favour the growth of

							The plan of the work is obviously borrowed from that of <persRef
								ref="montesquieu-charles">Montesquieu’s</persRef> Spirit of Laws,
							and its great object appears to be to receive or sustain the sentiment

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapters of the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> book, in which he makes the application of his system of
							opinions to the History of the Jews as recorded in the old Testament— He
							does not absolutely reject a divine revelation; but he sees in the
							Jewish History, as in that of other Nations the struggle between the
							Sacerdotal, and the Military power— He passes a high encomium upon the
							institutions of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, and severely
							censures <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>, and the
							philosophical detractors of the Jewish Nation in the 18<hi

							contempt the ridiculous panegyrics of Voltaire upon the Chinese, and
							perhaps indulges excessive prejudices against that Nation— I passed the
							remainder of this day in strenuous idleness.— A man by the name of
								<persRef ref="hatch-hosea">Hosea Hatch</persRef> came to see me; for
							the sake of having to say that he had seen a man, who was once President
							of the United States— He said he was a native of New-Hampshire; but has
							resided several years in Vermont, and for the last few months has been
							living here in Quincy, and working as a Shoemaker. He is about returning
							to New Hampshire— He says that <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Flanders</persRef> one of the <pb n="364" type="ms"

							He asked my opinions upon politics and public men; which I gave him; but
							he did not give his own; though he was very anxious to vote for Electors
							of President and Vice-President— He was strongly prejudiced against the
							Irish and earnest for the enactment of a Law to exclude them, from
							coming into the Country— He kept me in conversation nearly two hours, to
							the great detriment of my plantations— I planted one row of Garden
							walnuts with Apple seeds in front of the Nursery fence, and intended to
							have done much more— A fourth row of transplanted seedling fruit trees
							was set out in the Seminary—Peaches, Cherries and Black Walnuts— In
							taking up one of these we found a white worm, I believe the same that is
							called the Potato worm near three inches long and two in circumference,

							clear one acre of my <persRef ref="verchild-francis">Verchild</persRef>
							Pasture, to make it fit for Tillage— <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi

							progress— I only put seven cross rows of Farm Apple-seeds in Garden box
							one, with a few wild plum stones, cherry stones, and lengthways two
							Garden, one white and one farm walnut— I have marked on slips of willow
							names of six varieties of the Apple-seeds— This Evening I received a

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 32.— Heard <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							this morning from Proverbs 4.7. [“]Wisdom is the principal thing:
							therefore get wisdom.” This was one of the most pleasing discourses that
							I have ever heard delivered by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt—
							After explaining the various senses in which the term Wisdom is used in
							the Scriptures, he gave the definition of its meaning as employed in
							this passage of the Proverbs, by <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>; as the regulating power of human conduct;
							consisting of Prudence, tempered with Piety and benevolence— He analysed
							this property, by comparing it with learning, with philosophy, and with
							knowledge, and shewing its superiority to them all— His doctrine was
							intelligible to all his hearers endowed with a common share of
							understanding, and were addressed to all classes of his people— His
							afternoon Sermon was from Galatians 3.24.—Wherefore the Law was our
							Schoolmaster, to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by
							faith and he gave an exposition of the principles upon which the Mosaic
							law was the Schoolmaster <pb n="365" type="ms"/>introductory, and
							preparatory to the Christian dispensation— The subject was nearly
							identical, with that of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Sermon of
							the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, which I read, and the text of
							which was from Habakkuk 2.4. “The just shall live by his faith.” This
							passage of the prophet is cited and repeated by <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t</hi> Paul</persRef> in several of his
							Epistles, and among the rest in this very chapter of the Epistle to the
							Galatians.— Saurin as if in spite of himself, and apparently against his
							will involves himself in the endless controversy concerning the
							comparative merits of faith and of good works— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt ranged alongside of them, but without discussing them—
							His course is the wisest— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.
								Smith</persRef> dined with us, and I was obliged to write, all the
							evening— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent it on a visit to M<hi

							a note to the <persRef ref="eastburn-john">City Printer
								Eastburn</persRef>, asking him to return my manuscripts, and sending
							him a list of errata, in the printed Eulogy— The most material error is
							the date of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> decease, which is printed the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> instead of the 28<hi rend="superscript"

								Hardwick</persRef> was here, and I executed with him the lease of
							the quarry upon which he is working. Charles had prepared it to be
							executed to-morrow, but Hardwick said he was going out of town this
							afternoon, to be absent to-morrow, and he was anxious to have the lease
							executed now, which was accordingly done— Hardwick inclined to talk
							politics, and to know my opinions and my preferences between the
							Presidential Candidates— I told him I had no preference of my own, and
							that if I should have occasion to vote for either in the house, I should
							vote for him whom I should have reason to believe most acceptable to the
							majority of my Constituents— <persRef ref="turner-elisha">Elisha

								Adams’s</persRef>. I wasted much of the day in assorting seeds of
							Apple and Pear trees to be planted so as to ascertain which of the
							different kinds will, and which will not come up— I planted in the
							Seminary four cross rows of different Apple and Pear seeds, with wild
							plum stones, and Garden, farm, and white walnuts— The seedlings from the
							boxes are all transplanted into the Bartlett Pear tree bed.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day—</hi></date> I still rise between four and
							six O’Clock, and have usually about an hour’s occupation, in making my
							fire for which I have most of the time to bring the wood from the yard
							to my chamber, and not seldom also to saw the wood— This is my
							substitute for the exercise of walking five or six miles before
							breakfast with <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript"

							easily for it— I hear my <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna;adams-mary4">two
								Grand daughters</persRef> children of my ever lamented son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> read every morning in the Bible—
							The eldest Mary Louisa has read through the Old Testament, and now reads

							of the Apocrypha— I have for the last fortnight also read every morning
							several chapters of <persRef ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin
								Constant</persRef> on Religion. From breakfast to dinner my time is
							absorbed by a variety of domestic concerns, and again after dinner till
							dark now a very short interval— In the Evening I can neither read nor
							write with comfort, by the failure of my eye sight of which I am daily
							made more and more sensible— My Diary is therefore insensibly running
							into arrears, and my correspondence much more so— My purposes of
							plantation, I must as usual leave almost wholly unaccomplished.</p>
