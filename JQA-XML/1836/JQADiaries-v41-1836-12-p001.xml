						<p>Twenty-fourth Congress— Second Session—</p>
						<p>Precisely at Noon, <persRef ref="polk-james">James K. Polk</persRef>,
							Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States, took the
							Chair of the House, and announced that this was the day fixed by the
							Constitution of the United States for the annual Meeting of Congress—
							The names of the members were called over alphabetically by State,
							beginning with Maine, and 154 members answered at the first call— There
							was then a second call of the names of those who had not answered at the
							first, twenty-two of whom answered at the second— New members were then
							sworn in at the Speaker’s table— <persRef ref="holt-orrin">Orrin
								Holt</persRef> of Connecticut in place of <persRef
								ref="judson-andrew">Andrew T. Judson</persRef>, appointed judge of
							the U.S. District Court. <persRef ref="miller-rutger">Rutger B.
								Miller</persRef> of New-York, in place of <persRef
									ref="beardsley-samuel">Samuel Beardsley</persRef>, appointed
							Attorney General of that State. <persRef ref="pearson-john">John J.
								Pearson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="black-james">James
								Black</persRef> in place of <persRef ref="banks-john">John
								Banks</persRef>, appointed a judge in Pennsylvania, and of <persRef
								ref="miller-jesse">Jesse Miller</persRef> appointed first auditor of
							the Treasury— <persRef ref="chetwood-william">William Chetwood</persRef>
							of New-Jersey in place of <persRef ref="dickerson-philemon">Philemon
								Dickerson</persRef> elected Governor of the State, and <persRef
								ref="graham-james4">James Graham</persRef> of North-Carolina, whose
							seat was vacated by a decision of the House at the last, but whom the
							People of the District have sent back by a very decisive majority—
								<persRef ref="yell-archibald">Archibald Yell</persRef> took his Seat
							as the first member from the State of Arkansas.</p>
						<p>A Message was received from the Senate, that they had formed a Quorum and
							were ready to proceed to business—and had appointed on their part a
							Committee of Notification to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>— The corresponding Message to the Senate was
							ordered, and a Committee, on the part of the House, to notify the
							President—</p>
						<p><persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elisha Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio,
							moved the immediate appointment of the standing Committee, which I had
							requested him to do. <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> of
							Indiana, moved to postpone the consideration till Thursday— Then debate—
							Whittlesey called for the yeas and nays 33. to 148 against postponement—
							Motion to postpone till to-morrow made and withdrawn— <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> moved an amendment that
							absence should not be considered as disqualification for appointment on
							Committees— <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Abijah Mann</persRef> of New-York
							moved to adjourn—not in order— He then opposed Mercer’s motion: and it
							was agreed to postpone the further consideration till to-morrow. Voted
							that till otherwise ordered the daily adjournment should be till 12.
							O’Clock, Noon and then adjourned— Many cordial greetings from members of
							all parties. I went into the Library, and took a minute from the first
							Edition of the Federalist. <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Georgiana Frances</persRef> went to School to <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p>Walking to the Capitol this morning I overtook and walked with <persRef
								ref="hawkins-micajah">Micajah T. Hawkins</persRef> of North
							Carolina— I spoke to him of the recent election of a <persRef
								ref="strange-robert">Judge Strange</persRef>, as a member of the
							Senate of the United States, for the present Session of Congress in the
							place of <persRef ref="mangum-willie">Willie P. Mangum</persRef> who has
							resigned. Hawkins said that the Legislature of the State were equally
							divided between the parties; and that although judge Strange was elected
							for the remnant of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mangum’s term, which
							was only till the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March next, it was
							very doubtful who would be chosen the Senator for the ensuing term of
							six years. He said he thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mangum
							would be reappointed to a seat on the Bench as a judge— Mangum has
							resigned his Seat in the Senate because his course there has not been
							sustained by the Legislature or People of his State; but they are now
							apparently coming round to his opinions— Hawkins has been among the most
							inveterate on the other side of the question; and the moderation and
							apparent indifference with which he spoke this day, sufficiently
							indicated the revolution of the wheel of political opinions in his
							State— At the Meeting of the House—<persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.
								Pearce</persRef> Chairman of the Committee on the part of the House
							to notify the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> that the
							two Houses were ready to receive any Communication from him said they
							had performed the Service, and that he was requested by the President to
							inform the House that he would make a written communication to both
							Houses at 12 O’Clock this day. The Message was accordingly brought in
							immediately afterwards; and took the <persRef ref="franklin-walter"
								>Clerk</persRef> nearly an hour and a half to read— The message
							repeatedly alludes to the fact of its being the last annual Message that
							will ever be addressed to Congress by him— It teems with glorification
							upon the prosperous condition of the Country; with a considerable spice
							of piety: a hasty and not very satisfactory view of the State of our
							foreign Relations—an unsettled boundary question with Great Britain,
							long-standing claims of indemnity upon the Belgian Government, no
							reference to the quarrel with Buenos Ayres; but a boastful notice of a
							commercial Treaty with Siam— A very lame account of the wanton disregard
							of the rights of Nations, in the invasion of the Mexican Territories.—
							There is excuse, apology, extenuation, and a flimsy argument to justify
							the invasion, a recommendation to pass the act for settling the boundary
							between the United States and Mexico, and earnest caution to preserve a
							strict and faithful neutrality between Texas and Mexico—with expressions
							of much regret that <persRef ref="gorostiza-manuel">Gorostiza</persRef>
							the Mexican Minister had returned home— But three fourths of the Message
							consisted of a Dissertation upon Banks, banking and the currency with a
							new tribuntian invective against the Bank of the U. States. A
							Lamentation over the excesses of money in the Public Treasure— A direct
							thrust at the compromise Tariff; and abundance of verbiage about gold
							and silver <pb n="3" type="ms"/>and the injustice of bank paper to the
							labouring poor— <persRef ref="loyall-george">Loyall</persRef> of
							Virginia moved that 15000 copies of the Message and 5000 of the
							documents should be printed for the use of the house, and <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> moved that the copies of the
							message separate from the documents should be furnished in two days— A
							printed copy of the receipts and expenditures was received with a Letter
							from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, which was ordered to be printed. The annual
							report upon the Finances was also received, and ten thousand copies were
							ordered. <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio
							moved to take up for consideration his motion for the appointment of the
							standing Committees, but <persRef ref="parks-gorham">Gorham
								Parks</persRef> of Maine, moved to adjourn which was carried by a
							vote of 86 to 67. Whittlesey and <persRef ref="gillet-ransom"
								>Gillett</persRef> had given notice that they should move to morrow
							for certain alterations of the rules of the House— <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> spent the Evening at <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S.

						<p>This is the day of the Meeting of the electoral Colleges for the choice
							of a President and Vice-President of the United States for four years
							from the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March next— It is already
							well ascertained that a Majority of the whole number of the votes will
							be for <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef> of
							New-York as President and almost certain that <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Richard M. Johnson</persRef> of Kentucky will
							be the Vice-President— On my way to the Capitol, I stopped at <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> Hotel to see <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott;lawrence-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence</persRef>— He was there, but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Lawrence was gone upon a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon— I
							proposed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence to hold a meeting of
							the members of the Massachusetts delegation, to consult together what
							they shall do upon the petitions for the repeal of the duties upon Coal,
							with which we are charged.— There is no doubt that the repeal would be
							very satisfactory to our Constituents as respects that Article— But as a
							breach of the tariff compromise, it would unsettle the whole system—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence agreed to the meeting, and
							said that he had several petitions for the repeal of the duties upon
							Coal, and breadstuffs, but could not vote for them— At the House
							immediately after the reading of the Journal, <persRef
								ref="claiborne-john">J. F. H. Claiborne</persRef> of Mississippi,
							announced to the House the decease during the recess of his late
							colleague <persRef ref="dickson-david">David Dickson</persRef>, upon
							whom he pronounced a short Eulogy which I could not hear. He adverted
							also to the circumstances of his death which was at a distance from his
							home; and finished by offering a Resolution to wear crape for 30
							days—which was adopted— He was immediately followed by <persRef
								ref="haynes-charles">Charles E. Haynes</persRef> of Georgia, who
							announced the decease of his late Colleague <persRef ref="coffee-john2"
								>John Coffee</persRef>, in whose honour he offered two Resolutions—
							One that the House received with the liveliest sensibility the
							annunciation of the death of the Hon: John Coffee, a Representative from
							the State of Georgia,—and the other that the House tenders to the
							relatives of the deceased the expression of its sympathy on this
							mournful event; and as a testimony of respect, for the memory of the <pb
								n="4" type="ms"/>the deceased, the members will wear crape on the
							left arm for thirty days.— The declaration of lively sensibility, and
							the tender of sympathy to the relatives, were out of the ordinary
							routine of Resolutions on the decease of Members, but no opposition was
							made to either of the Resolutions, and they were both entered on the
							Journals as adopted unanimously— The House then immediately adjourned. I
							called at <persRef ref="hyatt-unknown">Hyatt’s</persRef> to see <persRef
								ref="bailey-jeremiah;bailey-charlotte">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bailey</persRef>,
							but he was not at home, and she was engaged. <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frye</persRef> was here this afternoon, and spoke of a memorial which
							he has, before Congress for a claim to extra compensation for services
							while he performed the duties of paymaster General of the Army— Evening
							at Cards.</p>

							that when the House should adjourn, it should be to next Monday—

							of 35—of a very amiable and respectable character, and whose death was

							a similar Resolution to those of yesterday, that the members of the

							adjourned— <persRef ref="clark-william2">William Clark</persRef> of

						<p>I have hitherto enjoyed since my arrival here an unusual portion of

								ref="hill-ira">Ira Hill</persRef>— I had some recollection of such a

							<pb n="6" type="ms"/><persRef ref="livingston-robert">Robert R.

							Monroe had left to him an injunction to protect his posthumous fame
							against that Hyena <persRef ref="armstrong-john">John

							the Washington library which he said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe had given him, and a fragment of an old Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— Elliot said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had been exceedingly distrustful of
								<persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef>, and
							appeared to think he was communicating to me a momentous secret, by the
							information, that when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe arrived at

								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> by the Telegraph on the

								ref="tallyrand-charles">Talleyrand</persRef> to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Livingston upon the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April— This Elliot supposed was a
							full explanation of what I had mentioned in the Eulogy on Madison as an

							given a similar narrative of that transaction, and had taken care to do

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, and asked me for a copy of it
							which I gave him— He told me that he had a great collection of

						<p>I had a smart fever the whole Night, with a burning sore throat, and
							there was an alarm of fire at Georgetown upon which the Bell of S<hi

							in the middle of the Night— Altogether I had little repose, and rose at

						<p>A restless night, with feverish symptoms was succeeded by a catarrhal
							oppression upon the lungs, a qualmish stomach; pain across the temples,
							and Spirits drooping to despondency— Without altogether indulging them,
							I took <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna;adams-mary4">my two
								grandchildren</persRef> with me to the Presbyterian Church, and
							heard <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from John 3.3. [“]Jesus answered and said unto him,
							Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot
							see the kingdom of God.” A calvanistical discourse upon regeneration—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler is a young man, very earnest,
							and very sincere—but what an immeasurable distance between him and
								<persRef ref="bishop-alexander">Bishop</persRef>— He alluded to the
							figurative language, so commonly used in the Eastern Nations, and so
							constantly practised by Jesus Christ— The new birth and every thing
							relating to it in the gospel is figurative and spiritual, but if Christ
							said to <persRef ref="nicodemus">Nicodemus</persRef> that a Jew or a
							Gentile of his cotemporaries must become a new Man before he could see
							the kingdom of God, which he came to discover and make known, what
							application can that have to Christians born in the present age, brought
							up and educated as subjects of the kingdom of God?— And what is the
							kingdom of God? and what is it to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, the
							kingdom of God?— The whole of this conference between Jesus and
							Nicodemus is profoundly mysterious; but the result of all is that
							Nicodemus, from witnessing the miracles performed by Jesus, believed <hi
								rend="italic">him</hi>
							<pb n="8" type="ms"/>him a teacher sent from God, and came to enquire of
							him, what it was that he came to teach— The answer of Jesus was not
							direct and explicit— He told him that he came to change the whole
							character of Man—and that to believe him he must deny his very nature,
							and be born over again and so in truth it was— Man, the most selfish of
							animals; the only unjust the only perfidious animal upon the globe, was
							to become the most social of animals; and the only benevolent animal—
							Then he told him that God so loved the world that he had given his only
							begotten Son, that whosoever believed in him should not perish, but have
							everlasting life— That is the kingdom of God, was the immortality of the
							Soul— Of all this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler said nothing—
								<persRef ref="dewindt-elizabeth2">Elizabeth De Wint</persRef> dined
							and spent the Evening with us— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Service for
							the third Sunday in advent, and preached from Isaiah 5.4. “What could
							have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?
							wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it
							forth wild grapes?” This again is figurative language—but the
							application of it is not so difficult to make as that of the New
							Testament— <persRef ref="dodge-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							a petition from 22 citizens of Worcester, and moved its reference to the

							which I should move the reference to that Committee— Lincoln refused to
							accept my proposal— I presented then the Memorial of <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">Daniel Brent</persRef>, Consul of the United

							referred to the Committee of Foreign Relations.— Then the Petition of
								<persRef ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer Lobdell</persRef>, taken
							from the files, but against which the Committee of Claims reported at

							I presented the petition of <persRef ref="braynard-s">S.

							the duties upon foreign Coal. <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
							<pb n="9" type="ms"/>I moved its reference to the Committee of

							moved its reference to the Committee of Ways and Means upon the ground

							the Speaker said that if debate arose the consideration of the question
							must be postponed by a rule of the House till to-morrow— The yeas and
							nays were ordered; but debate appeared and the question was postponed—
							The Speaker went through the Call of the States for Petitions; and then
							began the call for Resolutions, multitudes of which were offered some
							wise, some foolish— <persRef ref="fry-jacob">Fry</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, moved that a Bill should be brought in to repeal the
							duties on all grains and bread stuffs, and the reference of his
							Resolution to the Committee of Ways and Means.— A motion was made to

							carried. I then moved to amend the Resolution, by inserting, and on
							“Coal, and Salt, and Iron.”— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina, moved as an amendment to my
							Amendment, and on Sugar; and by this time the House was ready to lay

							moved that the Committee of Ways and Means, be instructed to bring in a
							Bill to release the States from any repayment of the sums to be
							deposited in their Treasuries, under the deposit act of the last

							by giving the election of President and Vice-President of the

							<pb n="10" type="ms"/>At the House, upon the motion of <persRef

							into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, and Loyall moved
							sundry Resolutions parcelling out the Message of the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> to sundry of the standing
							Committees, and proposing a Select Committee to consider the proposal,

							and United States. The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> had
							called me to the Chair, so that I could not enter into any of the
							debates on the Resolutions— There was no proposed reference of any part
							of the Message to the Committee of Manufactures, and the whole subject
							of Finance, of Revenue, of reduction of the duties, and every thing
							connected therewith was referred to the Committee of Ways and Means—
							There was a Resolution, referring whatever related to Indians in the

								ref="lewis-dixon">Dickson H. Lewis</persRef> of Alabama, moved an
							exception, for claims of Citizens of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee,
							for property taken by the Indians, or damages done by our own Troops—the
							reference of which he moved to a select Committee— This gave rise to a
							debate in the result of which the exception moved by Lewis was made; but
							the reference was to the Committee of Claims— On the reference of the
							recommendation for amending the Constitution, <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> of Kentuckey himself a
							Constitution Tinker, moved that certain propositions of his own made at
							the last Session of Congress should be referred to the same Committee—

							negative— A vote by Tellers was called for, and M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="carter-william2">Carter</persRef> of Tennessee moved an
							additional Resolution, upon the reference of the provision for
							Tennesseans called out to fight the Indians and discharged without being
							employed, to a Select Committee— <persRef ref="pearce-dutee"
								>Pearce</persRef> of Rhode-Island moved, the Committee of Military
							Affairs, which Carter accepted. <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave

							Integrity with which the Executive Departments have been conducted,
							should be referred to a Select Committee of Investigation thereon, with
							power to send for Persons and Papers, and to use their discretion with
							respect to Times.— This Resolution he supported by a written Speech of
							about an hour and a half, reviewing the Life of Andrew Jackson, with
							extraordinary tenderness and partiality in his favour, and the whole of
							this last Message, and the Presidents conduct in electioneering for his
							Successor with equal keenness and severity— No answer was made or
							attempted to the Speech, and the Resolution was carried by Tellers, by a
							vote of 87 to 76 many of the Administration members voting for it— The
							Committee then rose and I reported the Resolutions to the House— They

						<p>Almost stiffened with cold this morning; upwards of two hours without
							fire in my chamber, and in suitable temperature to read <persRef
								ref="thacher-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thacher’s</persRef> narrative of the first Settlement of the
							Plymouth Colony. At the House, the business taken up immediately was the
							Resolutions upon the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef>
							Message, reported yesterday by the Committee of the whole on the State
							of the Union— They were adopted as reported, by one vote with the
							exception of the third, twelfth and fifteenth and last which was
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef>— The third was that which
							referred the financial affairs, reduction of duties, currency, and every
							thing connected therewith to the Committee of Ways and Means— I moved as
							an amendment; excepting so much of the Message, as relates to the
							protective duties, and every thing connected therewith; and then, a
							separate Resolution referring that to the Committee of Manufactures, and
							every thing connected therewith— This raised a debate which consumed the
							day— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>, Chairman
							of the Committee of Ways and Means, as his manner is, professed not to
							oppose my amendment, and made a speech against it, followed by sundry
							others, most of whom launched out into a general declamation upon the
							Tariff, the compromise, the currency, the Public Lands, the deposite
							Bill, and the like— <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> of
							Indiana and <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> of Kentuckey
							spurted and babbled, for the sake of personal flings at me—Hardin
							indirectly—Boon directly— I had expressed surprize, that the President’s
							Message, had not so much as named the Manufactures of the Country, and I
							had therefore been compelled to limit my Resolution to the parts of it
							relating to the protective duties, and every thing connected therewith,
							an exceedingly convenient mode of expression, and to which they dared
							not to object, because it was taken from <persRef ref="loyall-george"
								>Loyall’s</persRef> own Resolutions. Boon whose political existence
							hangs to his servility, and whose faculty of Speech is a yelp, sputtered
							at the great services of the present Administration to the manufacturing
							interest of the Country, and charged me with having slighted it when I
							was in power. Hardin let out some of his venom upon New-England, and
							said we should have a little battle, when we should come to debate the
							taking off the duties from grain and the bread stuffs; because the crops
							had not failed in the States West of the Mountains as they had in the
							Atlantic States— He spoke against the repeal of the deposit Bill in
							advance; and said that in five years from this time the proceeds of the
							public Lands would not amount to two Millions of dollars a year.
								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> of South-Carolina,
							spoke of his earnest desire to proceed in this manner in harmony with
							the Gentlemen of the North; and was for adhering with the most
							pertinacious good faith to the compromise— Bouldin of Virginia, who
							never knows his own mind, and talks upon every thing, was also
							exceedingly earnest to preserve unsullied the faith of the compromise,
							but was above all for reducing <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="12" type="ms"/>the duties to the wants of the Government, and
							excessively indignant at the idea, that the States should be pensioners
							on the Bounty of the General Government. At the end of <persRef
								ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin’s</persRef> Speech, no one could tell,
							how he would vote upon the question before the House. <persRef
								ref="mann-abijah">Abijah Mann</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> of New-York were
							vehemently against any reference to the Committee of Manufactures; and
							Vanderpoel wondered that the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and
							Means, should have given any countenance to my proposition— They argued
							from the reference of the Petition for the repeal of the duties on Coal
							presented by <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lincoln</persRef>, to the Committee of Ways and Means, that the
							whole subject belonged to the Committee of Ways and Means—and insisted
							that such had heretofore been the practice of the House— This argument
							put the whole case in my hands—<persRef ref="denny-harmar">Harmar
								Denny</persRef> and <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>
							had spoken in support of my amendment— I read from the Journals of the
							House in December 1831 and 1832 the references to the Committees of Ways
							and Means, and of Manufactures, and called to the recollection of the
							House the proceedings of both those Committees, and the action of the
							Houses upon them, in both those Sessions: and that the final compromise
							was not effected by either of those Committees but by a Treaty between
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,—smuggled into the
							house at the third reading of the Bill reported by the Committee of Ways
							and Means and substituted for it— <persRef ref="toucey-isaac"
								>Toucey</persRef> of Connecticut then moved a division of the
							question upon my motion; first upon the exception in the reference to
							the Committees of Ways and Means, to which he objected, and secondly
							upon the reference to the Committee of Manufactures, for which he would
							vote— I said I would save the House the trouble of voting upon the
							exception, by withdrawing it; if it was understood that the opposition
							to my proposed reference to the Committee of Manufactures was also
							withdrawn— <persRef ref="gillet-ransom">Gillett</persRef> of New-York
							moved to limit the reference to the Committee of Manufactures to so much
							of the protective duties as related to the manufactures— I said there
							was no part of it that related to the manufactures— The message spoke of
							the protective duties generally, without any reference to the

							contracted an affectation of effeminacy in his deportment and of
							dandyism in his dress and manners, not well suited to our atmosphere— At
							the House, <persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, Chairman of the Committee on Post Offices and Post

							the causes of the conflagration of the Post-Office, this morning, and to
							report, whether it has rendered any measure of Legislation expedient or
							necessary— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>, immediately
							before the adjournment moved that this committee should be authorised to
							send for persons and papers—both Resolutions were adopted— Instead of
							the call for Petitions, the unfinished business of yesterday, the
							Resolution offered by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, consumed
							the day. <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> of
							Rhode-Island made a Speech against it, and offered a substitute for it—a
							Committee to investigate any charges which may be made against any of
							the Heads of Departments— <persRef ref="peyton-balie">Balie
								Peyton</persRef>, answered Pearce by a speech of cutting invective
							and sarcasm— He was followed by <persRef ref="glascock-thomas"
								>Glascock</persRef> of Georgia, who extenuated and apologized and
							said he would vote for Pearce’s amendment—and if that should fail, for
							the Resolution as offered by Wise— At the recent election in Georgia,
							Glascock was the only member of the delegation voted for by both
							parties— He defended <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> as well as he could,
							with some weakness of argument, but with good temper and moderation—
								<persRef ref="ripley-eleazer">Ripley</persRef> of Louisiana, came
							out vehemently against both Resolutions— Ripley has had bills for his
							personal profit and emolument pending before Congress, and knows where
							the majority for fingering the Treasury purse is to be found— His
							principle is in his breeches pocket. His voice was so feeble that I
							heard very little of his Speech; but enough to understand that its main
							spring was sycophancy.— Peyton replied with some bitterness— <persRef
								ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef> of New-York, made a short Speech,
							professing to favour the investigation, that it might <hi rend="italic"
								>redound</hi>
							<pb n="14" type="ms"/>redound to the honour of the administration.
								<persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> of Kentucky
							spoke nearly half an hour in support of Wise’s Resolution, and specified
							sundry abuses in the Post-Office Department— The debate continued till
							half past 3. O’Clock when without taking the question, the House
							adjourned— We spent part of the Evening at whist and had a visit from
								<persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							him. <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> of Louisiana,
							asked me if Ripley had once written me a Letter, pretending to be a

							told him that I believed Ripley had written me a Letter; but whether he

						<p>At the House no attempt was made to continue the debate of yesterday.
							Upon the motion of <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elisha
								Whittlesey</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Claims, the House
							immediately went into Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia in the Chair, upon
							private claims— Three bills only passed through the Committee, two with
							little or no debate; the third a Bill for the relief of the legal
							Representatives of a <persRef ref="white-anthony">Colonel Anthony
								White</persRef>, a Virginian Officer of the Revolutionary War. It
							was for a loan of 150000 dollars paper money in the year 1780. worth
							3000 dollars; but the claim is for 56. years interest at 6 per cent,
							making the whole sum now demanded upwards of twelve thousand dollars— It
							was debated nearly 3 hours— Where this claim had been and how after 56
							years it remained yet unsettled was not very clearly shewn, but no
							question was made upon that— Fifty-six years interest, was the claim,
							and being a Virginian Revolutionary claim was irresistible— A few
							stubborn members of the old fashioned stubborn accountants, and stiff
							economists held out, but for the Revolutionary claim, the mere name is
							now all-sufficient—the Bill was carried through the Committee of the
							whole and passed to the third reading, with a faint and timid opposition
							from <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel">Wardwell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="parker-james2">Parker</persRef>. The Committee rose, and the
							House adjourned soon after 3. <persRef ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pettrich</persRef> called me out from
							the House, and I introduced him to <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leonard Jarvis</persRef>, who was
							Chairman of the Committee on the Public Buildings.— I supposed him to be
							so still but it is a casual and not a standing Committee, and has not
							yet been appointed at the present Session— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pettrich expressed the wish to obtain the use of one of the
							chambers in the Capitol, for the exhibition of his works— Jarvis advised
							him to apply to <persRef ref="noland-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Noland</persRef>, the Commissioner of the Public
							buildings. I had spoken to Elisha Whittlesey, and asked his favour to
							the Petition of <persRef ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer
								Lobdell</persRef>: but there was a report of the Committee of Claims
							against it, at the last Session of Congress— The claim has been before
							Congress at every Session <hi rend="italic">since</hi>
							<pb n="15" type="ms"/>since February 1830. a Bill has once or twice
							passed the Senate in its favour, but has never obtained the assent of
							the House.— The Report of the last Session against it was drawn by
								<persRef ref="darlington-edward">Darlington</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, and he has now prepared one referring to and confirming
							it— He brought them to me, and said that his own inclination had been to
							a favourable report; but that a Majority of the Committee had been
							against it, considering it a hard case on the part of the claimant, but
							rigorously within his contract; and from which any relaxation by the
							Government would set a dangerous precedent.— I had trusted to the
							Committee of Claims, upon this case, without giving it a thorough
							examination, which I must now do— I sent to the <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">Secretary of the Senate</persRef> for the
							Report of the Committee of that body at a former Session, in favour of
							the claim, and read part of the papers which were before our Committee
							of Claims— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef> came to
							me with papers relating to a claim of <persRef ref="smith-john">John A.
								Smith</persRef> to two outfits as Chargé d’Affaires; at different
							periods: one in England, and one in France— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing that as M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith was my nephew, I wished to interfere in his case as
							little as possible— I wished only that he might be treated as others in
							like cases had been— And I asked him to refer to the papers in the
							Department of State relating to the decision of <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							and his cabinet, against my opinion, upon the claim of <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">Christopher Hughes</persRef>, to two
							outfits as Chargé d’Affaires in Sweden, while he was Secretary of
							Legation to <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>—
							I warmly recommended to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing, the
							Memorial of <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Daniel Brent</persRef>, Consul
							at Paris, claiming some additional compensation— He said he would call
							it to the attention of the Committee—but <persRef ref="brent-w"
								>William Brent</persRef> told me that Cushing was most adverse to
							the claim of his brother of all the members of the Committee— <persRef

								Madison’s</persRef> Son. The House belongs to her and she had

							that he would introduce him to me, which he did. Williams is a recent

							had done a great deal of good in both. I left a card at <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="dewindt-elizabeth2">Elizabeth De Wint</persRef>, and the

							the name of <persRef ref="u">Jones</persRef>, Secretary to the American
							board of domestic missions preached from 1. John 2.15 “Love not the
							world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the
							world, the love of the Father is not in him 16. For all that is in the
							world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
							life, is not of the father, but is of the world. 17. And the world
							passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God,
							abideth forever.”— How much of the application of this text depends upon
							the definition of the word “world.”— The preacher did define it, in the
							sense which it bears in this passage and gave a well divided and well
							reasoned discourse— Exhortations not to love the world, nor the things
							of the world, are always seasonable, because the love of the world is
							always the predominating passion of the great mass of mankind— But after
							the Sermon was over <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> informed the
							Congregation that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones came to take up a
							collection for the funds of the American board of domestic Missions; and
							would address the auditory upon the condition of that Board and their
							proceedings— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones addressed the audience
							accordingly— He said that their <pb n="17" type="ms"/>their expences the
							present year had exceeded 30,000 dollars, and that they now wanted men
							and money— That the demand for preachers of the gospel in our western
							regions was so great, that if the Board could command the services of
							1500 men they could employ them all— As this address was unexpected and
							had not been announced before hand instead of taking up the collection
							immediately, a card and pencil was left in each pew, for every
							individual, to set down what he would give— I think this device was not
							now successful— It was resorted to last Spring at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, for a contribution to
							repair the Church, and then succeeded— But the custom of levying
							collections in the churches here, for distant objects has become so
							habitual that it has worn out the Charity of the most bountiful
							contributors.— After Church I had visits from <persRef
								ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph M.

							I could give him no sangwine hopes that they would faithfully perform

							paragraph in the Message, in which the protective duties and the Tariff
							are mentioned, and also the paragraph in which he recommends Salt, fuel,
							and provisions, as the Articles upon which to commence the reduction of
							the duties: and then I said the words, and every thing connected
							therewith opened the whole subject of the revenue, and the reduction of
							duties to the consideration of the Committee— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lee said he thought so too.— After a brief and general
							discussion it was agreed that the Committee should meet on Thursday and
							Monday Mornings at eleven O’Clock, till further order and the Committee
							adjourned— The House were already in Session, and the reading of the
							Journal had just commenced— The question upon the reference of the
							petition presented by me, for the reduction of the duties on foreign
							Coal to the Committee of Manufactures or the Committee of Ways and Means
							immediately came up— <persRef ref="davis-john8">J. W. Davis</persRef> of

							the New-York <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> Members,
							voting against it. The reference to the Committee of Ways and Means was
							then made without opposition.— The call by States for Resolutions then

						<p>On my way to the Capitol yesterday morning, I had met my old Long-Island
							home-spun politician <persRef ref="jagger-william">William
								Jagger</persRef>, who came to ask me so many questions last Spring,
							and who has since published a pamphlet against the present
							administration, and especially against <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Martin Van Buren</persRef>— Jagger was coming to my house to see me
							when I met him, and turned round and walked with me— He had sent me a
							copy of his pamphlet, which I had received at Quincy— He told me that he
							had <hi rend="italic">2000</hi>
							<pb n="19" type="ms"/>two thousand copies of it printed, all of which he
							had given away— He had not printed them for sale— That they had produced
							very great effect, but had enraged many of his old friends and
							acquaintance against him, so that it beat all nature— He said he had
							been obliged to leave out all that he had written against the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">old General Jackson</persRef>, for the people
							would not hear one word against him— They verily believed he could do no
							wrong. And as to Van Buren, they concluded that he could do no wrong;
							for otherwise Jackson would not have chosen him for his successor— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jagger sad he intended to publish another
							book; and would prove serious charges against Van Buren— I called also
							yesterday upon <persRef ref="brooks-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Edward Brooks</persRef> at <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
								>Gadsby’s</persRef>— He is here in behalf of the claim of indemnity
							for French Spoliations prior to 1800.— He told me that he should be here
							and at Baltimore, eight or ten days— This morning, my chamber being too
							cold for writing, I read, most of a Report of a Committee of the Senate
							of Pennsylvania, to that body on the Coal Trade; made in March 1834. and
							which was given me yesterday by <persRef ref="white-john5">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef>— It is a pamphlet of
							126. pages, and contains much valuable information concerning the Coal
							mines of Pennsylvania.— The Chairman of the Committee was <persRef
								ref="packer-samuel">S. J. Packer</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor</persRef>
							sent to ask me to call upon her this morning, before going to the House,
							which I did— It was to urge me upon her claim for additional allowances
							on the accounts of her late son <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William
								Tudor</persRef>, as a political agent in Peru— I must though very
							reluctantly charge myself with the support and elucidation of this
							claim. <persRef ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pettrich</persRef> came and took his engravings from the Fresco
							Paintings of <persRef ref="michelangelo">Michael Angelo</persRef>, at
							Rome, and the volume of the Column of <persRef ref="trajan"
								>Trajan</persRef>; and left the volume of the Column of <persRef
								ref="antoninus">Antoninus</persRef>, and the engravings of the works
							of <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello">Raphael</persRef> at the Vatican.
							Among which is the School of Athens— From the conversation of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pettrich, I find him well versed in the
							principles of his art, and enthusiastically devoted to it— At the
							House—the call of the members by the States, for Resolutions was
							completed— A Resolution had been adopted yesterday, that the House would
							this day at 2 O’Clock proceed to the choice of a Chaplain— <persRef
								ref="macomb-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Macomb</persRef> had written me a note to ask my vote for her
							brother <persRef ref="u">Balch</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
								Johnson</persRef> had asked it for his protégé<space/><persRef
								ref="comstock-oliver">Comstock</persRef>, a Methodist. I voted first
							for Balch, but he had only 14 votes— I then voted for Comstock, who at
							the third ballot had 103 of 201. votes and was chosen— At the first
							ballot there were 5 votes for <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">A.
								Vanderpoel</persRef>, and 6. blanks— This is about the number of
							scoffers at all religion in the House— I saw <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor James Barbour</persRef> in the House—
							He told me he was going on a short visit to <persRef
								ref="barbour-frances">his daughter</persRef> at Baltimore. <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> introduced to me the
							new member from South-Carolina <persRef ref="elmore-franklin">Franklin

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef>, the delegate
							from Florida, invited me to dine with him next Saturday. Immediately
							after the choice of a Chaplain, at half past three the House adjourned.
								<persRef ref="dewindt-elizabeth2">Elizabeth DeWint</persRef> spent
							the Evening with us, and <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi

						<p><date>21. V. </date>Wednesday</p>
						<p>There was a warm rain, and heavy gale from the Southeast in the Night and
							this morning; and when <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">the
								children</persRef> came to read it was so dark that I could scarcely
							distinguish the words upon the book— But the temperature of my chamber
							permitted me to write; and I diarized— At the House <persRef
								ref="dunlap-william">Dunlap</persRef> of Tennessee, attempted to get
							up a Bill out of its turn. The States were called through for
							Resolutions and Petitions— There was a Message received from the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> recommending an
							immediate Appropriation to build a fire proof Post-Office— <persRef
								ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> had obtained his long sought
							Committee of investigation of the management of the West-Point Academy—
							On Monday <persRef ref="hannegan-edward">Hannegan</persRef>, of Indiana
							one of the members of the Committee moved that they should have leave to
							go or to send a Sub-committee to West-Point; but the motion was
							unpalatable to the House, and was laid upon the table— Yesterday
								<persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce</persRef> of Rhode-Island moved a
							reconsideration of the vote of the day before, and the motion for
							reconsideration was now taken up,—after some flat debate <persRef
								ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis</persRef> moved to lay on the table the
							motion for Reconsideration— <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef> moved a Call of the House, and for the yeas
							and nays on the question. Both the call, and the yeas and nays were
							refused— Vanderpoel then asked for the yeas and nays on Jarvis’s motion,
							and the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> upon a somewhat
							questionable count announced that they were ordered— The motion to
							reconsider was laid on the table by a vote of 86 to 78— Several Bills
							were reported by standing Committees— One of them by the Committee on
							Indian Affairs, passed through a Committee of the Whole, <persRef
								ref="garland-rice">Garland</persRef> of Virginia in the Chair and
							then passed to a third reading— Then Pearce’s substitute for <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Resolution of Enquiry into the
							ability and integrity with which the Executive Departments have been
							conducted, came up, and the House were much disposed to take the
							question silently upon it—but <persRef ref="lane-amos">Lane</persRef> of
							Indiana was charged with a Speech of an hour upon it, which he
							accordingly delivered— A full glorification of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>— The house then
							adjourned— There had not been a Quorum in the house one third of the
							time while Lane was speaking— There is an apparent listlessness
							prevailing throughout the House, an indifference to what is doing, and
							an unwillingness to debate any thing which indicates subsided
							excitement— <persRef ref="fry-jacob">Jacob Fry jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> A member from Pennsylvania, asked me in
							behalf of one of his Constituents who he said was a friend of mine,
							where he could procure a copy of my Eulogy upon <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>; and I promised to give him one— I had some difficulty
							in returning home— A strong and severely cold gale from the North-west,
							almost took away my breath, and thumb-screwed my fingers— <persRef
								ref="shepard-william">William B Shepard</persRef> of North-Carolina
							made a Speech of half an hour this morning, to be printed; upon a
							memorial from some of his Constituents praying for an extension of the
							deposit Law.</p>

								ref="whittlesey-thomas">T. T. Whittlesey</persRef> absent <persRef
								ref="mccomas-william">M’Comas</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="webster-taylor">Webster</persRef>— After some further general
							discussion, upon the part of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President’s</persRef> Message referred to the Committee, it was
							considered that the reference by the House of the Petitions for the
							repeal of the duties upon Coal, to the Committee of Ways and Means, had
							settled the principle that the reduction of the revenue was to be
							prepared by the action of that Committee, and that it was not the duty
							of the Committee of Manufactures to undertake the same labour— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger said he had considered the
							question upon the reference as a test question, and I said I had viewed
							it in the same light— It was agreed therefore to suspend the semi-weekly
							Meetings of the Committee; to wait for the Report of the Committee of
							Ways and Means; and the Chairman of the Manufactures to call the next
							Meeting of the Committee when he shall think proper— I read to the
							Committee the Letter from <persRef ref="dodge-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dodge</persRef>, the Consul at Bremen,
							to the Collector of the Customs at New-York, concerning the
							authentication of invoices by partners in this Country of foreign
							Merchants, and it was observed that a Bill had been reported to the
							House at the last Session, in which some provision upon this subject was
							made— The Committee adjourned at Noon, and the <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">Clerk of the House</persRef>, when I entered
							it was reading the Journal of Yesterday— The States were called over for
							Petitions— I presented two— One of<space/><persRef ref="u"
								>Hoskins</persRef>, which <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard
								Jarvis</persRef> brought to me, and requested me to present, as he
							had done, with a petition from the same persons at the last Session— I
							moved its reference to the same Committee to which the former Petition
							had been referred— The other Petition was from <persRef
								ref="robbins-joseph">Joseph Robbins Senior</persRef> of Yarmouth in
							the British Province of Nova Scotia, a Soldier of our Revolutionary War,
							for a Pension under our Act of June 1832—referred to the Committee on
							Revolutionary Pensions— A Message was received from the President,
							concerning the new Republic of Texas—the recognition of her
							Independence, and her application to be annexed to the United States—
							This Message, was in a tone and Spirit, quite unexpected to me, and
							certainly to a large portion of the House.— A total reverse of the
							Spirit, which almost universally prevailed at the close of the last
							Session of Congress, and in which the President notoriously shared. This
							Message discourages any precipitate recognition of Texas, and speaks
							with due caution and reserve of its annexation to the United States.
							Motions were made to print ten thousand and twenty thousand copies of
							it, which occasioned some debate. <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha"
								>Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio objected to the largest number, upon
							the principle of economy. But after some discussion withdrew his
							objection— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hoar-samuel">Hoare</persRef>, <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.
								Pearce</persRef> and even <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef>
							of Indiana, the thickest skull, the narrowest mind, and the pettiest
							teazle in the house supported the largest number— The Message itself was
							referred to the Committee on foreign relations, of which <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> of Baltimore is now
							Chairman.</p>
						<pb n="22" type="ms"/>
						<p><persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
							moved to go into Committee of the whole, upon a Bill for the entire
							re-organization of the Mint—objection was made; and he obtained a
							suspension of the rules by a vote of more than two thirds to go into
							Committee of the whole, saying that it was important that the Bill
							should be passed before the first of January.— <persRef
								ref="muhlenberg-henry">Muhlenberg</persRef> of Pennsylvania in the
							Chair— When <persRef ref="johnson-robert2">Johnson</persRef> the Clerk’s
							assistant read the Bill, I found it was in 36 Sections, totally
							subverting the whole system of our coinage of Gold, Silver, and copper,
							changing the weight and standard both of the gold and silver coins;
							reducing the weight of the copper cent, and accomplishing a revolution
							in our whole specie circulating medium— I had never before heard a
							syllable of the Bill— I moved immediately that the Committee should
							rise, and ask leave to sit again, stating my astonishment, that a Bill
							of so much importance should be attempted to be hurried thus through the
							house without previous notice, and objecting most earnestly against the
							debasement of the coins, which I had detected in the reading of the
							Bill— I complained particularly that the House had been thus taken by
							surprize— Cambreleng however was supported by <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Jos. Ingersoll</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="mckim-isaac">M’Kim</persRef>, and even <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">Lawrence</persRef>, members of his Committee,
							and on the question that the Committee should rise, after an abortive
							vote for want of a Quorum, it was taken by tellers 65 and 65 and the
							Chairman decided against rising— So the Bill is to be driven through as
							a party measure— I was now obliged to debate it entirely without
							preparation; and started objections, particularly to the debasement of
							the Coins. I met with no support; but Ingersoll, moved to strike out the
							part of a Section, making the Cent a tender to a certain amount, which
							was carried— I then moved to strike out the whole of the Section— After
							some debate another motion to amend it was made, and when the question
							was taken, no Quorum voted, upon which a motion that the Committee
							should rise succeeded, and the house adjourned— Cambreleng then
							introduced to me <persRef ref="patterson-r">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Patterson</persRef>, the Director of the Mint, who he
							said would explain to me every thing in the Bill, upon which I should
							desire explanation. I told D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson that
							I should be glad to see him at my house, at his convenience— <persRef
								ref="gillet-ransom">Gillet</persRef> came also to me, and spoke of
							his Bill for coining gold dollars which he proposes to engraft upon this
							Bill of Cambreleng— I began to walk homewards with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence; but my Carriage, with the
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary;adams-elizabeth">young Ladies</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">children</persRef> were
							in waiting for me, and I rode home— We consumed the Evening at
							Cards—</p>

							Illinois respecting the location of the National road, which had been
							yesterday presented, when he was absent from indisposition. But
							objection was made, and <persRef ref="ashley-william">Ashley</persRef>
							said he would take another opportunity to make his remarks— After the

							the Committee of Indian affairs to enquire into the expediency of
							appropriating money to hold Treaties for the purchase of Lands of the
							Sacs, Foxes, Sioux and Winebago Indians, within the Wisconsin Territory,
							and removing them West of the Mississippi— This Resolution was rejected

							Chairman of the Committee of Indian Affairs moved a Reconsideration of
							the vote, which was now opposed by <persRef ref="garland-rice"
								>Garland</persRef> of Louisiana, who said we had had enough of
							Treaties for the purchase of Indian Lands, and censured the policy of
							concentrating together all the scattered Indian tribes upon one
							territory upon our South western border— The vote was nevertheless
							reconsidered and the Resolution adopted— The Resolution offered by
								<persRef ref="fry-jacob">Fry</persRef>, to instruct the Committee of
							Agriculture to enquire into the expediency of repealing the duties on
							grain and breadstuffs was taken up, and Fry read a Speech of about 20
							minutes, on the sufferings and necessities of the poor— The question

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry—but immediately after Fry

							did not— Hamilton’s report was published in the Telegraph of last
							Evening— It represents the Texians as a People struggling for their
							Liberty and therefore entitled to our Sympathy— The fact is directly the
							reverse— They are fighting for the establishment and perpetuation of
							Slavery; and that is the cause of the South-Carolinian sympathy with
							them— Can this fact be demonstrated to the understanding, and duly
							exhibited to the Sentiment of my Countrymen? with candour—with calmness
							with moderation, and with a <unclear>pencil</unclear> of phosphoric
							light?— Alas! No!— <persRef ref="smith-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"

							that <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa Anna</persRef> the President

						<p>I was awakened between four and five of the Morning by the Bells for
							Fire— It was a Negro-Hovel, between the settled part of the City and
							Kalorama. At the Presbyterian Church where I went alone, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef> preached in
							the morning, from 1. Corinthians 1.23—“But we preach Christ crucified”—a
							very well written, and not <hi rend="italic">ineloquent</hi>
							<pb n="25" type="ms"/>ineloquent Calvinistic Sermon, though not
							remarkably appropriate to the day— Its argument was that the whole
							Christian system of Religion, was founded solely upon the fact of the
							crucifixion; which may be true, but which I find it hard to believe.—
								<persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="dewindt-elizabeth2">Elizabeth De Wint</persRef> were
							there— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> went to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, with <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>. Elizabeth De Wint, and
								<persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J. Frye</persRef> were here after
							Morning Church— There was no afternoon service at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s— I went again to the Presbyterian
							Church, but was late; and found that <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> had begun his Sermon,
							which was from James 1.15—“and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth
							death.”—another cheerless text, for Christmas day— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler, falls short of the powers of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones. Evening chiefly occupied in the
							cursory perusal of the English annual for 1837.— <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Gales, j<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> had at my request sent me
							the volume of the large compilation of American State Papers, containing
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander Hamilton’s</persRef>
							Report upon the Mint— I read part of it this day, with a view to compare
							the reasoning and opinions embraced in it, with the act of Congress
							adopted upon its recommendations, and with the provisions of the Bill
							now before the House— In this case as in many others, on beginning to
							read I find occasion for reading further, and probing deeper— The
							subject is exceedingly complicated involving much arithmetical
							calculation, political economy, and moral principle— My knowledge upon
							the subject, very imperfect, but probably more extensive than that of
							any other member of the House, lies rusted upon my memory, and in much
							confusion— With many other things to distract my attention—the
							Tariff—the excess of Revenue, the Public Lands, and above all Texas and
							Slavery, I have the further discouragement of a clear perception that
							this demolition and reconstruction of the Mint, and coinage of all the
							monetary metals will be driven through both houses of Congress upon
							party stilts, and probably without the allowance of discussion— I shall
							certainly not be indulged with time to prepare myself with a thorough
							examination of the subject, and am sure of being defeated by the
							previous question or by the yeas and nays, whether in opposition to the
							whole Bill, or to any of its details.</p>

								<persRef ref="coffee-john2">Coffee</persRef>, deceased since the
							close of the last Session was qualified and took his seat. Petitions

							town of Silverlake, Susquehannah County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
							praying for the abolition of Slavery and the Slave trade in the District

								<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> said, it was too

							<pb n="26" type="ms"/>the Session itself. <persRef ref="davis-john8"
								>Davis</persRef> of Indiana called up the Resolution that he had
							offered and which was on the Speaker’s table, that all Petitions which
							may be offered praying for the abolition of Slavery in the District of
							Columbia or in the Territories shall be laid on the table, without
							reading or being printed, and without debate. Davis had not the wit to
							see that his Resolution instigated the very debate that he wanted to
							suppress— I said the Resolution deserved a full and thorough
							consideration, and I hoped would have it— But I suggested to him the
							expediency of moving to postpone, and make it the special order of some
							future day, to avoid interrupting the presentation of petitions— Davis’s
							friends, moved to lay his Resolution, and the whole subject on the Table
							which was done—by yeas and nays 116 to 36. <persRef ref="thompson-waddy"

							extravagance— The Resolution was rejected by a vote of 52 to 84— Sundry

							adopted—but a motion to print 5000 copies of <persRef

								Howard</persRef> the Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations,
							and to <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							at the last Session of Congress M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing
							had been its <hi rend="italic">strongest</hi>
							<pb n="27" type="ms"/>strongest opponent— At the House, <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> from the Committee
							of Ways and Means reported the annual general Appropriation Bill, for
							the civil and diplomatic expenses of the Government. A Message from the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> was received, with
							Documents respecting the State of Michigan— The Convention of the
							People, assembled at Ann Arbor, by an Act of the Legislature of the
							State, conformably to the Act of Congress of the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of June last, declined accepting the
							condition prescribed as a Sine qua non, to the admission of the State
							into the Union— But since that another Convention, assembled without
							authority from the Legislature, but assuming to act for the People have
							given their assent to the condition— The President says that if this had
							happened during the recess of Congress he would have issued his
							proclamation declaring the State admitted; but as Congress are in
							Session, he leaves the decision to them— The Message was without debate
							referred with the documents to the committee on the judiciary. <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce</persRef> of Rhode-Island moved a Call
							upon the President for enquiry concerning the claim of indemnity upon
							the Danish Government for the prizes taken during our Revolutionary War,
							sent into Norway and there delivered up to the British Consul— This
							Resolution is preparatory to the discussion of the claim of <persRef
								ref="taylor-janette">Janette Taylor</persRef>— It lies over one day—
							Among many other Resolutions offered was one by Cambreleng instructing
							the Committee of Commerce to enquire in to the expediency of abolishing
							all Laws authorising protections to be issued to American Seamen— Some
							objection was made to this Resolution— I supported its reference to the
							Committee for enquiry, but expressed my doubts whether the issuing of
							protections ought to be superseded— I thought it might be very proper to
							grant them gratuitously, to relieve the Seaman from the Charge— There
							was some further debate, not against the reference to the Committee, but
							against the proposition to abolish the issuing of Protections
							altogether— Cushing moved an amendment restricting the enquiry to the
							abolition of the tax, and <persRef ref="gillet-ransom">Gillett</persRef>
							moved to enlarge it to the abolition of all fees imposed upon Seamen,
							which Cambreleng accepted as a Modification, and so the Resolution
							passed— The orders of the day, brought up <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise’s</persRef> Resolution reported by the Committee of the whole
							on the Union, for a Committee of enquiry into the ability and integrity
							of the Executive Departments, with the substitute proposed as an
							Amendment by D. J. Pearce—but Wise the mover of the original Resolution
							was absent, and after some remarks by several members the further
							consideration was postponed till next Tuesday— A joint Resolution from
							the Senate concerning the printing of the Annual Report from the
							Treasury of the Commerce and Navigation of the United States was
							referred to the Committee of Commerce, and the Bill for reorganizing the
							Mint establishment was taken up in Committee of the whole on the Union—
								<persRef ref="harper-james2">Harper’s</persRef> motion to fix the
							weight of the cent at 168 grains Troy, as it has been these forty years,
							instead of 140 to which the Bill proposed to reduce it was pending, and
							I supported it very earnestly. The amendment was carried— I moved as a
							further amendment, that the dime, instead of 40 grains as proposed in
							the bill, should be fixed at 41 1/4 grains and the half dime at 20 5/8
							instead of 20. these amendments after some discussion were <hi
								rend="italic">assented</hi>
							<pb n="28" type="ms"/>assented to by Cambreleng and adopted by the
							Committee, and thus the Bill was reported to the House, and passed to a
							third reading— Gillett proposed to restore a proviso that Cents should
							be made a tender at least to the amount of half a dime, but his motion
							was rejected— He did not attempt to introduce his one, two and three
							dollar gold coins— The House adjourned about 3. O’Clock— The <persRef

						<p>The coldest Night and morning of the present Season, and when I rose the
							fire in my chamber was extinct. I was obliged therefore to sit in the
							dining room below, and read some of the documents annexed to <persRef
								ref="packer-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Packer’s</persRef> Report to the Senate of Pennsylvania on the
							subject of the Coal Trade— They are highly interesting, and contain a
							mass of valuable information upon the Pennsylvania Coal Mines— Among
							them I find a Statement by <persRef ref="white-john5">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> John White</persRef> the person who
							gave me the pamphlet; and a paper altogether characteristic from my old
							friend <persRef ref="miner-charles">Charles Miner</persRef>.— There are
							conflicting statements in these papers concerning the expediency and
							usefulness of chartered companies for carrying on the coal trade— There
							is particularly a Lehigh Navigation and company incorporated to remove
							obstructions to the Navigation of the Lehigh river, and invested also
							with mining privileges— They have at immense expense removed the
							obstructions to the Navigation of the Lehigh, but they have become very
							obnoxious to the individual coal-miners by levying a toll, which makes
							competition with them in the trade impracticable— The individual miners,
							are violent adversaries therefore to the company—insisting that the
							river Lehigh is a <hi rend="italic">highway</hi>, and that the
							Legislature had no constitutional right to grant the exclusive
							Navigation of it to a Corporation without a Soul— This is the Charles
							river Bridge question in another form— The doctrine of Mortmain is yet
							not well understood in this Country. At the House, I presented the
							Petition of <persRef ref="ripley-jerusha">Jerusha Ripley</persRef> widow
							successively of <persRef ref="sturtevant-samuel">Sturtevant</persRef>,
								and<space/><persRef ref="ripley-isaiah">Ripley</persRef>, both
							Soldiers of the Revolutionary War; she is of Plympton, blind, poor, and
							upwards of 80. years of age— Referred with two affidavits to support the
							facts stated in the petition to the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions—
							Numerous other Petitions were presented, and numerous reports of
							Committees, among which <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations, reported a Bill for
							carrying into effect the boundary Treaty between the United States and
							Mexico—read twice and referred to the Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union— This Bill ought to have passed at the last Session
							of Congress; but it was set aside by the frenzy for the immediate
							recognition of Texas— Then came the Resolutions, of which I notice only
							those of chiefest interest— <persRef ref="lee-gideon">Gideon
								Lee</persRef> moved an instruction to enquire by the Committee of
							Post Offices and Post-roads into the necessity of procuring a fire proof
							Post-Office building at the City of New York— And Gideon said he knew it
							was <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
							<pb n="29" type="ms"/>not proper in offering such a Resolution to make a
							speech and he made a Speech— His Resolution was adopted— <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> moved an instruction to
							the Committee of Foreign Relations, to inquire into the expediency of
							abolishing the Office of Agents of Claims at Paris and London— And <hi
								rend="italic">he</hi> made an unanswered Speech, and his Resolution
							was adopted— <persRef ref="taylor-william7">Taylor</persRef> of New-York
							moved an instruction to the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions, to
							inquire into the expediency of extending the Pension act of the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July last, in behalf of widows, to
							the widows of all Revolutionary Soldiers who ought to have been
							pensioned, excepting such as were remarried after the War—and Taylor
							made a well written and ornamented, and gallant Speech—and his
							Resolution was adopted— <persRef ref="hard-gideon">Hard</persRef> of
							New-York moved an instruction of enquiry, to grant lands to the officers
							in the last War— But this Resolution after some debate was laid on the
							Table by yeas and nays 121 to 70.— <persRef ref="gillet-ransom"
								>Gillett</persRef> of New-York moved an instruction to the Committee
							on the Judiciary, to inquire into the expediency of establishing a board
							of claims; and Howard moved an inquiry by the Committee of Naval Affairs
							for the establishment of a Naval Academy. A Report from the <persRef
								ref="kendall-amos">Postmaster General</persRef> was received with an
							estimate of the sums required for the service of that Department in the
							year 1837. amounting to four Millions and a half of dollars, three
							millions and two hundred thousand dollars for transportation of the
							Mail, 935000 dollars for compensation of Postmasters and 140000 dollars
							for Clerks— The Mint Bill was read a third time and passed—and two Bills
							of Appropriations—one of two Millions for suppression of Indian
							hostilities, and one for the payment of Pensioners; both passed without
							question or one word of debate— Amendments were made by unanimous
							consent to the mint Bill; rendered necessary by the amendments adopted
							yesterday, but which had not then been attended to; because I suffered
							the question to be taken on the whole remnant of the Bill, after
							obtaining the amendments for which I contended, without insisting that
							it should be read through Section by Section. <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> came to my Seat this
							morning and shewed me that these amendments were necessary— One of them
							was a Section (the 38<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>) requiring the
							<persRef ref="patterson-r">Director of the Mint</persRef> to
							account for the profits made upon the debasement of the dimes— This
							Section was annulled by the amendment restoring the dime and half dime
							to their intrinsic value— Yet the section remained in the Bill till now
							stricken out— The Rules were suspended to resume the Call by States for
							Resolutions— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Garland</persRef> of Virginia
							moved a call upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, for a return of profits and dividends made by
							the Deposit Banks, before and since their having the deposits— Garland
							is a stiff <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Burenite</persRef>; but
							has a Virginian propensity to bait the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Executive</persRef>— The Dutchmen did not dare to oppose his
							Resolution in front— So Gillett moved an amendment to call for a return
							of the increased <hi rend="italic">expenses</hi> of the deposit Banks—
								<persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> of Indiana somewhat
							alarmed talked of moving a postponement, if there was a debate— <persRef
								ref="harlan-james">Harlan</persRef> of Kentucky moved as an
							amendment to Gillett’s amendment, that the Secretary should also return
							whether, a part of a those expenses of the Deposit Banks was for an
							Agent, in connection with the Treasury— The name of such agent, and the
							amount paid <hi rend="italic">him</hi>
							<pb n="30" type="ms"/>him by those Banks respectively— <persRef
								ref="whitney-reuben">Reuben</persRef> was about to be exposed, bare
							to the bone—<persRef ref="hannegan-edward">Hannegan</persRef> of Indiana

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="kent-joseph">D<hi rend="superscript"

							since the decease of <persRef ref="goldsborough-robert">Robert H.
								Goldsborough</persRef>, during the recess of Congress, the only
							one—with <persRef ref="munro-isaac">Isaac Munro</persRef> the editor of
							the Baltimore Patriot; and a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Pettigrew</persRef>, from North-Carolina— This visit belated me,
							full half an hour at the meeting of the Committee of Manufactures— I
							found there <persRef ref="denny-harmar">Denny</persRef>, <persRef

								<persRef ref="whittlesey-thomas">T. T. Whittlesey</persRef>. The
							only member absent was <persRef ref="webster-taylor">Taylor
								Webster</persRef>.— Two subjects had been referred by the House to
							the Committee Since their last Meeting— A Petition from <persRef
								ref="mauri-evariste">Evariste Maury</persRef>, for compensation for
							his services in introducing into the United States the culture of Silk—
							Maury is a Frenchman, and has been nearly twenty years in this country;
							labouring to introduce the culture both of silk and the vine, with
							little success. His petition was in a jargon, half French, half English
							which the members of the Committee could not understand; and they were
							not prepared to admit even his claim of merit, as the first promoter of
							the culture of Silk in the United States— I mentioned the circular of
							enquiries from <persRef ref="judson-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Judson</persRef>, with the answers by <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chew</persRef> of Ohio,
							transmitted to me, by <persRef ref="mclene-jeremiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane</persRef>, a member from that
							State; but I had not the paper with me— So the further consideration of
							the subject was postponed, and I was directed to write to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Judson, for information of his proceedings
							under the authority with which he was charged by the Committee at the
							last Session— The other subject referred to the Committee was a petition
							from sundry Citizens of Philadelphia manufacturers of Starch, for the
							imposition of a duty upon the importation of that Article from
							abroad—which for want of time to discuss was also postponed to the next
							Meeting this day week— At the House, the day was wasted in a debate upon
							a motion made by <persRef ref="galbraith-john">Galbraith</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, to refer to a Select Committee a Memorial from sundry of
							his Constituents, called up from the files of the last Session urging
							upon Congress to propose an Amendment to the Constitution, restricting
							the States from the power of chartering Banks; and also complaining that
							the Bank of the United States, have continued to reissue their old
							Notes, since the expiration of their Charter granted by Congress, and
							calling upon that body to <hi rend="italic">provide</hi>
							<pb n="31" type="ms"/>provide a remedy for this evil— Galbraith moved to
							refer this Memorial to a select Committee; which engaged a very
							gratuitous debate of three hours— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Levi
								Lincoln</persRef>, made a warm, passionate, and not very forcible
							Speech against it, thereby rallying all the administration strength in
							support of Galbraith’s motion, which otherwise might have failed—
							Lincoln moved the reference to the Committee already appointed upon
							other proposed Amendments to the Constitution— <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> moved the reference to the
							Committee of Ways and Means— <persRef ref="hannegan-edward"

							Letters from <persRef ref="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>,
							appointed the Agent under the Act of the last Session to obtain the
							property left by the Testator from the English Court of Chancery— The

							Rush in England—and a first interview with the Chancery Lawyers—in which
							he made no progress whatever— Those Chancery Lawyers are exceedingly
							respectable persons, and I have no doubt will secure to themselves a
							good portion of the bequest. How much we shall ever get of it is
							exceedingly problematical— The States and Territories were called
							through for petitions and memorials, many of which were presented— Among
							the Reports of Committees, was one from <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel"
								>Wardwell</persRef> Chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary
							Pensions, of a Bill, extending the Provisions of the Pension Act of June
							1832. He reported also against a proposed Resolution referred to the
							Committee, for extending the provisions of the act of 4. July last 3<hi

							all widows of revolutionary pensioners. The Resolution was offered on

							by <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>, of Vermont—
								<persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> from the
							Committee of Commerce reported a Bill to change the name of the
							collection District of Dighton, Massachusetts, to Fall river, which was
							read twice and ordered to be engrossed for a third reading to-morrow— I
							proposed to Pearce, to offer an amendment to the Bill, making Wareham, a
							Collection district separate from New-Bedford; which provision is
							already in a Bill reported by the Committee of Commerce, at the last
							Session of Congress; but which I fear will not be reached for
							discussion. Pearce urged me not to offer it now, fearing that it might
							lead to debate upon the Bill this day reported, and perhaps defeat its
							passage; and he promised to call up the other Bill as soon as possible
								<pb n="32" type="ms"/>possible.— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef> by a suspension of the Rules 154 to 38 offered a
							Resolution instructing the Committee of Public Lands to enquire into the
							expediency of prohibiting by Law the purchase of Lands at auction with a
							view to forfeit them, and afterwards obtain them at Government price of
							one dollar and 25 Cents per Acre— <persRef ref="lane-amos"
								>Lane</persRef> moved as an amendment the reference to a select
							Committee, with additional instructions for confining all Sales of
							Public Lands to actual Settlers. Lane’s amendment was ferociously
							resisted by <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> and <persRef

							O’Clock— I then hear <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my two

							the Apocrypha— Both of them two Chapters in the New Testament— Between
							nine and ten we breakfast; after which the children now go to school—

							and dine, and after an hour of relaxation, take hot rice milk at tea
							time and spend the remainder of the Evening at cards, or in my chamber,
							writing— The succession of severe cold days deprives me of my morning
							writing hours and threatens another irretrievable breach in my
							Diary.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Year—</hi> The year 1836. has been a year of some
							vicissitude in my public life, and in my private concerns—strewed with
							roses, and beset with thorns; for the results of which, I bow in

							which I have sustained without sinking, by the aid of a merciful
							protector, but which in the course of Nature I cannot expect to sustain
							me much longer— The year began by a desperate and furious, yet insidious
							and crafty onset upon my character, by <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Daniel Webster</persRef> in the form of a Speech in the Senate on
							the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January—published with great

							of enquiry, and a Speech on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of the

							field, and whip’d him and his party into the rank of file of the Nation,
							in the quarrel with the <persRef ref="louis-philippe">French
								king</persRef>—but it opened upon me the whole pack of the
							Presidential opposition candidates, and their abettors, in and out of
							Congress, who would have sunk me into perdition temporal and eternal, if
							they had had the power— I weathered this storm, and was re-elected to
							the next Congress without formal opposition, but almost without whig
							votes— The delivery of the Eulogy upon <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>President Madison</persRef> was the principal incident of the
							year—and was successful— I have to bless the giver of all good for
							improved health not only my own, but that of my dearest friend.</p>
