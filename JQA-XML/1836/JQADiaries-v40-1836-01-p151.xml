						<dateline>Friday 1. January 1836.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. IV:30. </date>Friday— I resume once more the attempt to
							Journalize in this Volume from which I was disabled by a crippled hand
							last September— I rose after supplication to divine Mercy, at my usual
							early hour, from which I am also too often discouraged— Commenced again
							to hear my Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef>, read two Chapters in the Bible; an exercise which
							has been several days interrupted by her illness; threatened with a
							pleurisy fever. I was writing to <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman</persRef>, some
							observations upon the Tragedy <persRef ref="othello">Othello</persRef>,
							which consumed too much of my time— The day was fine and we had a
							succession of visitors, male and female from Noon till past 3.
							O’Clock—about one hundred in number: among them perhaps 30 members of
							Congress— <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef> was
							very desirous of having his Tragedy of <persRef ref="pontiac"
								>Pontiac</persRef>, performed at the new Theatre in this City—
								<persRef ref="storer-bellamy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bellamy
								Storer</persRef>, who brought with him <persRef ref="u">his
								wife</persRef>, was the only member from the State of Ohio; whence
							in former years there were always several— The number of visitors this
							day was perhaps as numerous as in any former year since 1829. but they
							were not altogether of the same description. Of the Massachusetts
							delegation, Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="borden-nathaniel">Borden</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="calhoun-william">Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="grennell-george">Grennell</persRef>, <persRef ref="hoar-samuel"
								>Hoar</persRef>, <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">Lawrence</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="reed-john">Reed</persRef> came. <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jackson-william2">Jackson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Lincoln</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="phillips-stephen">Phillips</persRef> were not here— Nor either
							of the Senators, <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> or
								<persRef ref="davis-john4">Davis</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cushing said that he wished to have some conversation with
							me respecting the memorials from claimants to indemnity for French
							Spoliations before 1800. I had received one of those Memorials from
								<persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C
								Brooks</persRef> with a request that I would present it. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing said he had also one to present,
							and he promised to call upon me before Monday concerning it— I asked
								<persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seaton</persRef> to undertake the publication of a collection of all
							the Constitutions of all the States in the Union from the commencement
							of the Revolution to this time with all the alterations and amendments
							which have been made to them all— Such a publication is much wanted—
							Among the visitors was <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef>, Vice-President of
							the United States, and with him the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President’s</persRef> private Secretary <persRef
								ref="donelson-andrew">Donelson</persRef>, who had never been here
							before.— I took a walk round by the seven buildings before dinner; and
							in the evening returned to my observations upon Othello.</p>

							much, with rhumatism— <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> was here in the
							morning, and I called before dinner to see her at her house— I returned
							also by Cards the visits of the Secretary of the Navy <persRef
								ref="dickerson-mahlon">Mahlon Dickerson</persRef>— I received
							several Letters, which with Newspapers and pamphlets swallowed up the
							day, so that instead of finishing my observations upon <persRef
								ref="othello">Othello</persRef>, I only got entangled with them
							deeper and deeper. My Letters were from <persRef ref="buchanan-robert"
								>Robert C. Buchanan</persRef> at New-Orleans, pleading for an
							increase of pay for the Officers of the Army—from <persRef
								ref="larrabee-charles">Charles Larrabee</persRef> at New Haven
							complaining of the manner in which the pension laws have been
							administered by me; but I know not what he means—from <persRef
								ref="isham-john">John Isham</persRef>, of Colchester Connecticut,
							concerning the claim of a widow <persRef ref="clark-eunice">Eunice
								Clark</persRef>, for arrears of Pension due to her late husband
								<persRef ref="clark-ezra">Ezra Clark</persRef>—a pensioner under the
							act of March 1818. and struck off the list in 1820—from <persRef
								ref="loud-jacob">Jacob. H. Loud</persRef> in Plymouth, concerning
							the Petition and Bill for a Custom-house at that place— And from
								<persRef ref="channing-henry2">Henry Channing</persRef>, at
							New-York; close upon 76 years of age—very anxious for the welfare of his
							Country, but not very sagacious in the estimate of its wants, and its
							woes. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing mentions that he sends me
							with his Letter, a pamphlet on the imminent dangers to the free
							institutions of the U.S. through foreign immigration and the present
							state of the naturalization Laws—but the pamphlet did not come. There
							was however another pamphlet; of Remarks upon one recently published by
								<persRef ref="channing-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Channing</persRef> of Boston— This Gentleman like his uncle,
							though with a much <pb n="152" type="ms"/>more splendid reputation, has
							for many years united the character of a high-toned party politician
							with those of a popular preacher, and an eminent essayist in Magazines
							and Reviews— Among his other moral and political impulses, he has
							meddled much with the subject of Slavery; and although otherwise
							sagacious enough to keep on the popular side of politics in the region
							where he resided, he has not kept pace with the changes of public
							opinion upon this subject, and now finds himself in a discredited and
							obnoxious minority— In defence of his opinions he has recently published
							a pamphlet, which I have not seen, but to which this is a sharp and
							contentious answer.</p>

						<p><date>3. VI.30. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>My Rhumatism is less threatening than it was yesterday, and I may
							reasonably hope to escape at this time a severe attack— The atmospheric
							dampness of the last two, mild and delusive days came this day down in
							rain— I attended this morning at the Presbyterian Church, and heard
								<persRef ref="bishop-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bishop</persRef>, from 1. Timothy 6.12. [“]Fight the good fight of
							faith.”— The doctrine that the life of the Christian is a warfare was
							well expounded, and eloquently illustrated— The Discourse was not equal
							in power—certainly not in pathos to that of the last Sunday Morning, but
							bore the impress of the same Spirit— <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wardwell</persRef> of New-York was in
							my pew, and said he was much pleased with the Sermon. He thought this
							young man, would almost make good the place of <persRef
								ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>. I
							think he will do more, but he is perhaps not Calvinistic enough for his
							congregation. He gave notice that from this time forward the second
							Service would commence at seven in the Evening— The rainy weather
							prevented me from attending this Evening, and there was no afternoon
							service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— I was not
							without occupation— The Diary— The observations on <persRef
								ref="othello">Othello</persRef>, and the perusal of Letters and
							Newspapers received this Morning, left no time to be wasted in idleness—
							In the second Volume of <persRef ref="maclaine-archibald">Doctor
								Maclaine’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="mosheim-johann">Mosheim</persRef> I read this morning the
							account of the manner in which, in the eleventh Century the Election of
							the Pope was gradually changed by <persRef ref="nicholas-ii">Nicholas
								2.</persRef> and <persRef ref="alexander-iii">Alexander 3.</persRef>
							and exclusively limited to the conclave of Cardinals— I revised and sent
							back to the National Intelligencer the reporter’s minutes of my last
							Speech upon the District Bank investigation question—which they had sent
							me yesterday— Of the Letters received this morning was one from <persRef
								ref="pabodie-albert">Albert Pabodie</persRef> of Millbury in the
							County of Worcester Massachusetts, with a Petition signed by 153
							inhabitants of that place; for the abolition of Slavery and the Slave
							trade in the District of Columbia, which it requests me to present, and
							which may produce another explosion—a printed Circular, with a Memorial
							to Congress from the Mayor and a Committee of the Corporation of the
							City of Washington, setting forth the pecuniary claims of the City upon
							the Government of the United States—and one from my old friend <persRef
								ref="miner-charles">Charles Miner</persRef>, now on a visit to West
							Chester where he formerly resided— It is overwhelming with flattery—not
							intended as such by him, for he is sincere and enthusiastic; but suited
							to turn a wiser head than mine— A Letter from <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-samuel">Samuel Whitcomb</persRef> at Dorchester,
							asking for certain public documents; and one from <persRef
								ref="teackle-littleton">Littleton Dennis Teackle</persRef> at
							Annapolis, requesting me to return certain recommendatory Letters in his
							favour which he transmitted to me when I was President, and he was an
							applicant for an appointment. The Newspapers contain a correspondence
							between <persRef ref="stevens-thaddeus">Thaddeus Stevens</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, and <persRef ref="harrison-william">General William H.
								Harrison</persRef> upon Anti-Masonry and the Presidency, and two
							Letters from <persRef ref="hiester-william">W. Heister</persRef>, the
							member of Congress on the same Subject, and all very strange.</p>

						<p>I attended the house with feelings of no small anxiety. After the reading
							of the Journal, the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> called
							the States for Petitions, beginning with Maine—when he came to
							Massachusetts I presented the Memorial of <persRef ref="gray-francis">F.
								C. Gray</persRef>, and others, praying for an act similar to that
							which passed the Senate at the last Session of Congress to indemnify
							them for French Spoliations prior to the year 1800. The memorial was at
							my motion without reading referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs.—
							I next presented the petition of <persRef ref="pabodie-albert">Albert
								Pabodie</persRef> and 153. inhabitants of Millbury in the County of
							Worcester and Commonwealth of Massachusetts praying for the abolition of
							Slavery and the Slave-trade in the District of Columbia. This Petition
							was couched in the same language, with that which <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> had presented last week, and
							which after it had been referred to the Committee on the District of
							Columbia, was by a reconsidered vote laid on the table together with the
							motion that it should be printed— I therefore now after stating the
							contents of the petition from Millbury, said it was my intention to move
							that without reading it should be laid on the table— I was instantly
							interrupted by my next neighbour <persRef ref="patton-john">John M.
								Patton</persRef>, who inquired whether the Petition had been
							received, to which the Speaker answered that it had not, whereupon
								<persRef ref="glascock-thomas">Thomas Glascock</persRef>, a new
							member from Georgia moved that it be not received, and was proceeding to
							make a Speech, when I called him to order, and appealing to the 45<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule of the House which prescribes that
							there shall be no debate upon Petitions on the day when they are
							presented, I demanded that the debate should now be postponed to a day
							certain, that this day might be free for the receipt of Petitions from
							all the States. The Speaker decided that as the Petition had not been
							received, it was not in possession of the House, and that the 45<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule of the House interdicting debate
							did not apply; from this decision I appealed, and asked for the yeas and
							nays which were ordered, and a debate arose upon the appeal, which
							consumed the day.— I spoke twice; the second time after a clamorous call
							for the question—but after I had spoken <persRef ref="vinton-samuel"
								>Vinton</persRef> of Ohio moved an adjournment which was carried,
							leaving the question undecided— We had a family party to dine, with whom
							I invited this morning <persRef ref="bailey-jeremiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeremiah Bailey</persRef>, a member of
							the House of Representatives from Maine, and the husband of <persRef

								Verplanck</persRef> with the <persRef ref="u;u">three other
								Gentlemen</persRef> called on me this morning— They come as a
							deputation from the sufferers by the late unparalleled fire at New-York,
							to solicit such relief, and assistance in their calamity as Congress is
							competent to afford them. They had some conversation with me as to the
							nature of that relief, and as to their own wishes and expectations from
							the public sympathy. <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng</persRef> Chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means has reported a Bill in two Sections; the
							first giving a credit of three, four and five years upon bonds for
							duties upon goods, destroyed by fire— The second giving an authority to
							the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to
							distribute the surplus revenue at his discretion among the State banks
							for a term of 12 Months— This Section meets with much opposition— These
							gentlemen <pb n="154" type="ms"/>were not desirous that it should be
							adopted, but proposed a general extension of credits upon accrueing
							duties, for six, nine and twelve Months; if there should be no objection
							against it from the manufacturing interest— I told them that if that
							measure should be proposed I would consult the Committee of
							manufactures, and unless they should deem it necessary, should make no
							objection to it myself. At the House, the <persRef ref="stockton-thomas"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Stockton</persRef> made the prayer— The journal of
							yesterday was rectified at a suggestion of mine— The question upon my
							appeal from the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker’s</persRef> decision
							was the first business before <unclear>the</unclear> but Cambreleng,
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, asked a postponement of it
							that he might report certain Bills from that Committee— Other Chairmen
							of Committees were equally urgent for an opportunity to report, and I
							readily consented to postpone the question upon the appeal till next
							Tuesday— Cambreleng reported his Bills; and an Amendment to that for the
							relief of the sufferers by the fire at New-York—a substitute for his
							second Section. The Chairmen of sundry other standing Committees
							reported Bills which were read twice, and referred to Committees of the
							whole, and made the order of the day for to-morrow— <persRef
								ref="beardsley-samuel">Beardsley</persRef> asked leave to present a
							memorial, from the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of
							Michigan—objection was made, and he asked a suspension of the Rule,
							which was lost by yeas and nays 111 to 100. not two thirds— But after
							the Committees had all reported the call for Petitions and Memorials was
							resumed, where it had been arrested yesterday.— I presented the Petition
							of <persRef ref="clark-eunice">Eunice Clark</persRef>, widow of <persRef
								ref="clark-ezra">Ezra Clark</persRef>, for a fragment of
							revolutionary pension, under the act of March 1818—and with it I offered
							my Resolution modified to instruct the Committee on Revolutionary
							Pensions to enquire and report on the expediency of restoring to the
							list of Revolutionary Pensioners, the names struck off the list under
							the act of May 1820. merely for not being paupers— The Petition and
							resolution were referred to that Committee— <persRef ref="lay-george">G.
								W. Lay</persRef> told me the Committee had determined to report
							unfavourably on the petition of the heirs of <persRef
								ref="church-thomas">Thomas Church</persRef>— I asked him not to
							report till the Committee shall have considered this Resolution, and the
							return for which I have called from the Department of War— He promised
							they should not— <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef> of New-York
							made his Report from the Committee on the Rules, which was laid on the
							table and ordered to be printed. <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.
								Pearce</persRef> presented a Memorial for a claim of the Rhode
							Island Brigade; and asked it reference to a select Committee— <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> moved its reference to the
							Committee on Revolutionary claims—a Count was called and the speaker
							announced Hardin’s motion was carried 82 to 81. Pearce called for
							another count by Tellers, and Hardin’s motion was still carried 89 to
							88— <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">Pinckney</persRef> afterwards moved a
							reconsideration which lies over— Beardsley now presented in course his
							Memorial from the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of
							Michigan— <persRef ref="hannegan-edward">Hannegan</persRef> of Indiana
							called for the reading of it; but it was long, and the House grew
							impatient under the reading— Hannegan moved that the memorial should be
							rejected—upon which the Speaker instantly decided that the debate must
							lie over till next Monday; and being reminded of his decision, said that
							was on a motion not to receive a petition, which was therefore not in
							possession of the house; whereas <pb n="155" type="ms"/>yesterday, the
							motion was not to receive the petition, and it was not in possession of

							answer, but the Speaker said it was not in order, and a motion to
							adjourn was made and carried— In the Evening I finished my observations

							commenced by a call of the States for Resolutions— <persRef

							at the request of <persRef ref="owens-george">Owens</persRef> of
							Georgia, a Resolution, declaring that the House will not entertain any

							he said that it was almost the universal opinion at the North that
							Congress have no right to interfere with Slavery— He read Resolutions
							apparently to that effect, adopted at some meeting last Summer in the
							State of Maine— I asked him to consent that the consideration of his
							Resolution should be postponed, to give an opportunity to other members
							to offer Resolutions; but he declined— <persRef ref="huntsman-adam"
								>Huntsman</persRef> of Tennessee came to my Seat and asked me to

							Owens had said last week that he would move the Resolution now offered
							by Jarvis, and would immediately call for the previous question upon it—
							Wise now in offering his substitute said he should like to see who would
							move the previous question upon it— <persRef ref="glascock-thomas"

							I said I hoped there would be no occasion to pass between Tellers to
							settle the question. Ward, <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce</persRef>
							of Rhode-Island, and <persRef ref="toucey-isaac">Toucey</persRef> also
							urged the appointment of a Select Committee, and it was ordered without
							opposition— The House went into Committee of the Whole on the State of
							the Union, <persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> in the Chair,
							and Cambreleng’s Bills were taken up; the appropriation Bills were
							passed through the Committee without opposition— There was an
							appropriation of 80,000 dollars for suppressing the hostilities of the
							Seminole Indians, the authority for which was nothing more than a Letter
							from the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef> to the
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means— I moved an amendment that
							the money should be expended under the direction of the Secretary of
							War, conformably to Law, which Cambreleng accepted and it was added to
							the Bill, which was reported to the House and passed <pb n="156"
								type="ms"/>to a third reading— So did a Bill making Appropriations
							in part for the support of Government for the year 1836. that is for the
							two Houses of Congress, and their members; which I suffered to pass,
							because I knew opposition to it would be vain—but there was a Bill
							reported by the Committee of Foreign Relations, constituting the
								<persRef ref="butler-benjamin">Attorney General</persRef> a sole
							Commissioner, and authorising him to appoint a Secretary, to adjudicate
							claims of indemnity for spoliations under the Neapolitan Treaty an Extra
							service for which the Attorney General is to receive a compensation of
							three thousand dollars, and his clerk 2000 dollars the service to be
							performed in 18 Months. I asked for time to consider this Bill, and
							intimated some objections to it— <persRef ref="mason-john5"
								>Mason</persRef> the Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations,
							agreed to postpone the further consideration of it, at present, and it
							was passed over.— Adjourned at half past 3. and I rode home—weather
							foul, and chilling.</p>

							discussed the proposed remissions of duties and credits upon impost
							bonds for the benefit of the New-York sufferers, without coming to any
							conclusion— It was agreed that the Chairman should call the next Meeting

							the Journal, I asked leave of the House to put a question to the
							Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations— Whether the Committee
							had received from the Department of State any communication respecting
							the present state of our Affairs political or commercial with the

							He said that having seen in a Newspaper yesterday a statement like that
							in the Intelligencer of this morning, he had called at the Department of

							measures represented to have been taken by the Mexican Government, and
							had been assured that no such information had been received— I said I
							had no further enquiry to make of the Chairman of the Committee— I hoped
							there would be on this day or on Monday a communication from the
							Executive to the Committee or to the House; and I gave notice that if
							there should not be, I would on that day submit a proposition to the
							House— <persRef ref="jones-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jones</persRef> the Delegate from the Territory of Michigan, who has

								>Hardin</persRef> moved and <pb n="157" type="ms"/>carried a general

							to a Committee <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> moved a

							refused. <persRef ref="white-john6">White</persRef> moved to suspend the

							anxious for means to suppress the War, and the Georgia Militia must be
							called out— Accordingly the Bill was taken up and passed; and so was the
							Bill making Appropriations for the expenses of the two houses of

						<p>Another cold, comfortless, rainy and stormy day. Anniversary of the

								>President of the United States</persRef>. This is to be done with
							an ostentation of Ceremony; but it is a swindling Speculation of some

							procession was published in the intelligencer this morning; with a
							notice that on account of the foul weather they would be postponed till
							Monday— This Jackson City is to be on the South side of the Potowmack,
							and opposite to the City of Washington.— I received an engraved circular
							invitation to attend from the Committee of the Association, but without
							knowing who they are— No names subscribed— I had visits from <persRef
								ref="manning-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Manning</persRef> a member of the House from South-Carolina, and
							from <persRef ref="palfrey-john">Professor Palfrey</persRef>, who told
							me he was to proceed to-morrow on his journey to New-Orleans, to visit
								<persRef ref="palfrey-john2">his father</persRef> who resides there—
							I rode out and returned the visits of <persRef ref="donelson-andrew"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Donelson</persRef> the
							President’s Secretary, and of nearly twenty members of Congress; but was
							obliged by the storm to return home as soon as I could— I answered a

							Cohasset; and read part of a pamphlet on Slavery, by the <persRef
								ref="channing-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing</persRef> of Boston— He
							treats the subject so smoothly that some of the Southern Slave-holders
							have quoted it with approbation, as favouring their side of the
							question; but it is in fact an inflammatory, if not an incendiary
							publication— There is a chapter containing an exposition of the nature,
							and character of Slavery— Then one upon rights—and then one of
							explanations— These have a very jesuitical complextion. The wrong, or
							crime of Slavery is set forth in all its most odious colours, and then
							the explanations, disclaim all imputation of criminality upon the
							Slave-holders.— There are some remarks certainly just upon the
							relaxation of the moral principle in its application to individual
							obligation necessarily resulting from antient and established
							institutions.— But this is an exceedingly nice and difficult line to
							draw, and belongs at least as much to the Science of casuistry as to
							that of Ethics.</p>

								>President’s</persRef> Message relating to the <persRef
								ref="smithson-james">Smithsonian</persRef> bequest— The members
							present were <persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> of Virginia,
								<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennon</persRef> of <pb n="158"
								type="ms"/>Pennsylvania, <persRef ref="pearce-dutee"
								>Pearce</persRef> of Rhode-Island, <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
								>Thomas</persRef> of Maryland, and <persRef ref="chapin-graham"
								>Chapin</persRef> of New-York— The absent members were <persRef

								ref="hannegan-edward">Hannegan</persRef> of Indiana and <persRef
								ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> of North-Carolina, who is
							still confined by illness— The members now present had got over their
							scruples with regard to the acceptance of the bequest and directed me to
							prepare a Report and a Bill to that effect— A Committee of the Senate
							the Chairman of which was <persRef ref="leigh-benjamin">Benjamin Watkins
								Leigh</persRef> of Virginia have already reported to that effect,
							and presented a joint Resolution authorising the President to obtain the
							funds, and making an appropriation of 5000 dollars to defray the
							expenses which may thereby be occasioned— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Leigh’s report contains a short and satisfactory argument for the
							competency of Congress to accept the bequest, and shewing it to be their
							duty— But as money cannot constitutionally be appropriated by
							Resolution, my direction from the Committee is to prepare a Bill; and to
							make the appropriation 10000 instead of 5000 dollars— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chapin told me that he had written upon
							this subject to <persRef ref="day-jeremiah">President Day</persRef> of
							Yale College, whose pupil he had formerly been— It was mentioned in the
							Committee that <persRef ref="barton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Barton</persRef> the late Charge d’Affaires of the
							United States at the Court of France had arrived. After a visit at the
							Clerk’s Office where I procured the President’s Messages relating to

								ref="verplanck-gulian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. C.
								Verplanck</persRef> and <persRef ref="lee-gideon">Gideon
								Lee</persRef> I called on my way home at the Department of State, at
							the door of which I met <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vanderpoel</persRef>; who told me that
							Barton had arrived at New-York, and that <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward">E Livington</persRef> was here— I saw
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef> and enquired of him whether any further
							information respecting the Smithson bequest had been received besides
							that communicated to Congress— He said he had omitted one passage of
								<persRef ref="vail-aaron2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vail’s</persRef> Letter, intimating from the caption to the will
							some doubt of the family of the Testator— He read me the paragraph which
							I thought extraordinary— He also read me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef> the Consul at London, written in November
							1829—immediately after the decease of the Testator James Smithson, and
							when the bequest to the United States was contingent upon the decease
							without issue of his first devisee, <persRef ref="hungerford-henry"
								>Henry James Hungerford</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Forsyth knew nothing more of the whole concern, and seemed to care
							little about it— He suggested that the appropriation to obtain the funds
							should ultimately be deducted from the bequest itself and thought it
							would be as well not to make any appropriation— He spoke also of the
							accounts from New-Orleans announcing an embargo and an interdict in
							Mexico upon our vessels as exceedingly questionable, and he doubted
							whether there was any foundation for them whatever— As I was coming out
							from the State Department I met <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leonard Jarvis</persRef> going in;
							quite curious for the news from France, but I told him I had heard
							nothing from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth on that subject I
							came home and looked into <persRef ref="burke-john">Burke’s</persRef>
							Peerage, for some information concerning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							James Smithson— I found not his name there, but gathered some facts
							which rather sharpened than gratified my curiosity— It appears that his
							father <persRef ref="percy-hugh2">Sir Hugh Smithson</persRef> having
							married <persRef ref="percy-elizabeth">Lady Elizabeth Seymour</persRef>,
							grand daughter of <persRef ref="seymour-elizabeth">Lady Elizabeth
								Percy</persRef> and of <persRef ref="seymour-charles"
								>Charles</persRef> the proud Duke of Somerset, took by Act of
							Parliament in 1750 the name of Percy and was in 1766 created Duke of
							Northumberland.— His eldest son was the second Duke of Northumberland,
							and was the <persRef ref="percy-hugh">Lord Percy</persRef>, present at
							the Battle of Bunker’s Hill in our Revolutionary War— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> James Smithson appears to have been his
							brother; but how he came to retain the name of Smithson, after his
							father and brother had taken that of Percy, is not yet explained— The
								<persRef ref="percy-hugh3">present Duke <pb n="159" type="ms"/>of
								Northumberland</persRef> must be the nephew of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> James Smithson, who yet made Henry James
							Hungerford his first devisee, referring to him as having heretofore
							borne the name of Dickinson, and being the son of the testator’s brother
							named also <persRef ref="dickinson-henry">Dickinson</persRef>— All this
							is still to be explained— <persRef ref="lay-george;lay-olive">M<hi

								Bishop</persRef> preached from Matthew 5.16. Let your light so shine
							before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father
							which is in heaven— <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wardwell</persRef> was in my pew; but
							the congregation was very thin— This young man preaches good works too
							much for the taste of a Presbyterian Calvinistic Society— His discourses
							are all practical. They rivet the attention of his hearers, and are
							never tedious— He preaches more to my satisfaction than any other person
							whom for many years I have heard in this City— After Church I called
							successively upon <persRef ref="bankhead-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bankhead</persRef>, the Charge
							d’Affaires from Great Britain, and upon <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall</persRef>, who is
							at <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fullers</persRef>, to enquire if either
							of them could give me any further information respecting <persRef
								ref="smithson-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Smithson</persRef>, but they could not— I was desirous of obtaining
							it for the purpose of introducing into the Report of the Committee upon
							his bequest some complimentary notice of the donor— But so little are
							the feelings of others in unison with mine on this occasion, and so
							strange is this donation of half a million of dollars, for the noblest
							of purposes, that no one thinks of attributing it to a benevolent
							motive. <persRef ref="vail-aaron2">Vail</persRef> intimates in his
							Letter that the man was supposed to be insane— Bankhead thinks he must
							have had republican propensities, which is probable— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall conjectures that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smithson was an antenuptial son, of the
								<persRef ref="percy-hugh2;percy-elizabeth">first duke and duchess of
								Northumberland</persRef>; and thus an elder brother of the <persRef
								ref="percy-hugh">late duke</persRef>— But how he came to have a
							nephew named <persRef ref="hungerford-henry">Hungerford</persRef>, son
							of a brother named <persRef ref="dickinson-henry">Dickinson</persRef>
							and why he made this contingent bequest to the United States of America,
							no one can tell— The report if it hazards any reflection upon the
							subject must be very guarded. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bankhead
							thought it was a fine windfall for the city of Washington, and hoped if
							a professor of divinity should be wanted, we should remember his friend
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">Hawley</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="bankhead-maria">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Bankhead</persRef> was in admiration of the splendid edifice that
							might be erected with the money— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Aspinwall said it would be easy to obtain the information which I
							desired in England; but that he had made no enquiries at the time when
							he had procured, and forwarded to the Department of State a copy of the
							Will, because the bequest was then contingent, and it was very uncertain
							whether it would ever take effect.— The will was made in 1826— The year
							before which the Testator’s nephew, the <persRef ref="percy-hugh3"
								>present Duke of Northumberland</persRef>, had been upon a
							magnificent Embassy Extraordinary, at the Coronation of <persRef
								ref="artois-charles">Charles the 10<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi></persRef> of France. There seems to have been a
							determination in the mind of the Testator, that his Estate should in no
							event go to the Duke of Northumberland or to any of his family— But
							certainly in the bequest itself there is a high and honourable sentiment
							of philanthropy, and a glorious testimonial of confidence in the
							Institutions of this Union. A stranger to this Country, knowing it only
							by its history, bearing in his person the blood of the Percy’s and the
							Seymour’s, brother to a nobleman of the highest rank in British
							heraldry; who fought against the Revolution of our Independence at
							Bunker’s Hill, that he should be the man to found at the City of
							Washington for the United States of America an establishment for the
							increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, <pb n="160" type="ms"/>is
							an event in which I see the finger of Providence compassing great
							results by incomprehensible means— May the Congress of the Union, be
							deeply impressed with the solemn duties devolving upon them by this
							trust, and carry it into effect in the fullness of its Spirit, and to
							the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men— After dinner I
							attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley read prayers for the first Sunday
							after the Epiphany—with only the second Lesson of the day, and gave a
							brief discourse upon a text from the Psalms— Heavy Gale of wind, and a
							light snow.</p>

						<p>This was the day on which the corner Stone of the Jackson City was laid

							been informed at the Department of State, that there was reason to
							believe the accounts from New-Orleans of an Embargo and interdict upon
							the vessels of the United States in the Ports of Mexico, were wholly
							unfounded— I should therefore not submit to the House the proposition
							which I had contemplated— I had seen indeed in the newspapers of this
							day statements that eleven citizens of the United States had been shot
							by a summary process of court-martial, for intermeddling with Mexican
							civil dissensions, and that a remonstrance against such intermeddling
							had recently been addressed by the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs
							to our <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of State</persRef>— If
							however any thing further should occur between the two Countries which
							should require the action or notice of Congress, I presumed their
							attention would be called to it by a communication from the Executive—
							This was Petition day— The Speaker announced that the first subject
							before the House was the motion of <persRef ref="hannegan-edward"
								>Hannegan</persRef> to reject the memorial of the Senate and
							Representatives of the State of Michigan, which was debated about three
							hours and finally decided by the previous Question and the Memorial

							who with the aid of <persRef ref="grennell-george">Grennell</persRef>,
							after a debate of nearly two hours, and a call for the previous
							question, which was carried, and an attempt to adjourn lost by a very
							small majority, finally carried only a vote of 18 agains 166— The House
							immediately afterwards, about five O’Clock adjourned— I walked home with

						<p>I made this morning a draught of a Bill to enable the <persRef

							obtain and cause to be remitted to the United States the funds
							bequeathed to them by <persRef ref="smithson-james">James
								Smithson</persRef> for the establishment at Washington of an
							Institution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.— The

							should give bond to the <persRef ref="campbell-john3">Treasurer of the
								United States</persRef> for the faithful performance of his trust,
							and the remittance of all the <pb n="161" type="ms"/>monies and other
							funds that he may receive in fulfilment of the bequest. This labour
							occupied my time so that I had none left to Journalize— At the House, my
							appeal from the decision of the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker</persRef> that the 45<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Rule
							of the House does not apply to a motion that a petition be not received
							was the special order of the day— Before calling the House to order M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk came to my Seat, and spoke somewhat
							doubtingly whether he should first announce it to be taken up, or the
							unfinished business of yesterday— I said I supposed the special order
							would come up of course. He did accordingly announce it— <persRef
								ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef> of New-York moved that it should be
							postponed till next Monday, which gave rise to a short debate— The
							postponement was a <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> or
							majority measure; upon which the division was not sectional but
							political— I opposed the postponement, on the grounds that the question
							to be decided on the appeal was not confined to Petitions upon the
							subject of Slavery, but to all petitions; but that it must be decided
							before the question could be taken whether the petition presented by me,
							should or should not be received— As the Petitioners had thought proper
							to send their Petition to me I wished to be able to inform them what
							disposition of it has been made by the House.— I objected also to the
							postponement to next Monday because that being the day for receiving
							petitions, the debate if renewed would again interfere with the
							performance of that duty— The postponement was however carried. A
							considerable number of Bills were reported by Committees and sundry
							Resolutions were offered by individual members and adopted without
							debate— At last the Bill making Appropriations in part for the support
							of Government for the year 1836, that is, for the expenditures of the
							two houses of Congress and the pay of their Members came up at the third
							reading— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved to
							reduce the amount of the contingencies of both Houses—but no amendment
							can be made to a bill at the third reading, unless by unanimous consent,
							or by recommitment of the Bill— This started a debate, which continued
							till past four O’Clock, and in which I took part, chiefly against the
							Bill itself— Motions to recommit the Bill were made, but no decision of
							the House upon them was had— A Message from the President, with Reports
							from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretaries of State</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">of War</persRef>, concerning the Northern
							Boundary of Ohio, and several Communications from the heads of

								<persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> gave notice
							that whatever business might be before the House to-morrow he should
							move to suspend the rules to take up the Appropriation Bill, and the
							House adjourned— I walked home with <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard"
								>Jarvis</persRef> and with a young man, a new member from the City
							of New-York named <persRef ref="mckeon-john">M’Keon</persRef>— He spoke

						<p>I began the draught of a Report upon the <persRef ref="smithson-james"
								>Smithsonian</persRef> bequest, which absorbed the morning till
							breakfast time and the journal dropped of course in arrears— A person by
							the name of <persRef ref="u">Bartleman</persRef> came with a young man
							deaf and dumb named <persRef ref="smith-ws">Smith</persRef>— He had been
							here some weeks since to ask if I could give or procure employment for
							him which I could not. He now came for a contribution and a subscription
							of my name to enable him to go to New-Orleans where he said he was quite
							sure he could find employment— Bartleman said he had taken upon him a
							disagreeable task to go round with this person and solicit donations.
							That they had been to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>, who complained that he was very poor, but said
							they must go round to other persons and see what they could obtain from
							them; and then return to <pb n="162" type="ms"/>him, and he would see
							what he could give— At the House, several Reports from Committees were
							received, among which, by <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">Stephen C.
								Phillips</persRef>, a Bill, from the Committee of Commerce making
							appropriations for building Custom Houses at Plymouth and Gloucester,
							10000 dollars each— <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis</persRef>
							called up his Resolution declaring that the subject of abolishing
							Slavery in the District of Columbia, ought not to be entertained by
							Congress, and that all petitions that may be presented demanding it
							should be laid on the table without printing This was Jarvis’s
							Resolution, but he had borrowed it from <persRef ref="owens-george"
								>Owens</persRef> of Georgia, who had given notice that he would move
							it and then immediately move the previous question But when Jarvis moved
							his Resolution, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> immediately
							moved as an amendment a declaration that Congress have no power to
							abolish Slavery; and said he would see who would move the previous
							question on that— <persRef ref="glascock-thomas">Glascock</persRef>
							moved as an Amendment to Wise’s Amendment a declaration that any attempt
							to agitate the question of abolishing Slavery in the District of
							Columbia would lead to the danger of a servile War— He meant this as a
							substitute for Wise’s Amendment but Wise disconcerted him by accepting
							the Amendment as part of his own— <persRef ref="allan-chilton">Chilton
								Allan</persRef>, now moved to lay the whole triad of Resolutions
							upon the table—but this was rejected by yeas and nays 58 to 155.—
								<persRef ref="holsey-hopkins">Holsey</persRef> of Georgia then
							claimed the floor— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"

								<persRef ref="parks-gorham">Parks</persRef> moved to postpone till

								ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef> the Chairman of the Committee said
							he proposed to call up the Report at an early day; and in the meantime
							that the old rules would govern the House as usual— Cambreleng called
							for the orders of the day— The Bill for the suppression of the
							hostilities of the Seminole Indians was returned from the Senate with a
							substitute— The House went into Committee of the Whole on the Union,
								<persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> in the Chair— The
							amended Bill from the Senate was agreed to without debate— The Bill of
							partial Appropriation for the support of Government was at Cambreleng’s
							motion postponed; and the Naval Appropriation Bill was taken up; on
							which a very warm debate arose chiefly on a Motion of Cambreleng to
							increase the Appropriation for arming and equipping Ships of War from
							950000 dollars to two Millions. This gave rise to a violent debate in
							which <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> of

							offered a Resolution for the appointment of a select Committee, to
							enquire into abuses at the Academy at West Point, and whether the
							Institution should not be modified or abolished— It was discussed till

							obtained a Committee of 24. one from each State, and had made a Report
							adverse to the Institution, which the House had refused to print—
								<persRef ref="wardwell-daniel">Wardwell</persRef> now moved as an

							There is a Bill in the Senate to continue the Charters to the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1837. and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye wished a clause might be added and
							until Congress shall otherwise direct; but I told him it would be
							impossible to carry that which would be a Charter for an indefinite time
							through the House— At the House after the reports of Committees had been
							received, <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes’s</persRef> Resolution for
							the appointment of a select Committee for the reformation or abolition
							of the Military Academy at West-Point—after speeches against the

								>Thomas</persRef> of Maryland obtained permission to introduce from
							the Select Committee of investigation upon the District Banks, a Bill
							for the continuance of the Charters of them all until the first of next
							October, which gave rise to a skirmishing debate, chiefly between
							Thomas’s select Committee, and the standing Committee on the District of
							Columbia. To put an end to this unprofitable content <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> moved the Previous
							Question, but it was not carried— The most remarkable Speech in this
							debate was that of <persRef ref="huntsman-adam">Adam Huntsman</persRef>
							of Tennessee, the successor of <persRef ref="crockett-david">David
								Crockett</persRef>, and a character much of the same stamp, about as
							illiterate, not quite so eloquent; rather of a graver cast, but equally
							shrewd and biting— Huntsman has a wooden leg, which sounds on the <pb
								n="164" type="ms"/>floor, as he passes by my Seat to go to his own,
							so as to remind me of <persRef ref="trunnion-hawser">Commodore
								Trunnion</persRef>— The Bill was carried through to the third
							reading, which it was voted should be this day—but at the question of
							its passage, a motion to adjourn was made and carried— A motion that the
							adjournment should be till Monday, had after some struggle against it
							previously passed— In the meantime <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> had moved to suspend the rules to take up the
							Bill for the relief of the sufferers by fire at New-York, but could not
							obtain a vote of two thirds.— Private Bills were then taken up, thirty

								ref="pierce-franklin">Pierce</persRef> of New-Hampshire and <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> successively in the Chair,
							reported to the House and passed to be engrossed for a third reading—
							The Bill to make allowances to the Consul at London was passed; and on
							the motion of <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee the
							Committee on Indian Affairs were instructed to enquire into abuses and
							irregularities in that branch of the Public Service— I carried round my
							report on the Message relating to the <persRef ref="smithson-james"
								>Smithsonian</persRef> bequest, to all the members of the Committee,
							excepting <persRef ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> who is yet

							accepting the bequest, and <persRef ref="garland-rice">Garland</persRef>
							of Louisiana thought the Charge d’Affaires or Consul at London should be
							authorised to procure and remit the funds instead of a special Agent—
							The other members of the Committee approved the Bill, as well as the

							and his Son in Law <persRef ref="barton-thomas">Barton</persRef> were in

							occasion is very extraordinary as an incident in the course of
							Legislation. The reference of the Message to a Select Committee was
							made, not without some murmurings from members of the Committee on the
							District of Columbia— The Report of the Committee of the Senate has been
							very favourably received, and pronounced a very able one; but it does
							not touch upon any one of the views, which occupy nearly the whole of
							mine The condition of the Testator, the nature of the trust, the
							character of the Trustee and the practical effect of our political
							Institutions upon the moral feeling of Europe, illustrated by this
							incident, are not even glanced at in the Senatorial Report, written by
								<persRef ref="leigh-benjamin">Benjamin Watkins Leigh</persRef>—mine

							Committee-meetings, gives me some encouragement, but slandered as I now
							am, by hireling Snakes of all parties, and in almost every Newspaper, I
							am sure to be reviled for every thing that I do or say—and can foresee
							nothing but censure— Whether this bequest will ever come to any thing is
							much doubted by almost every one— A spurious bastard claimant of the
							Estate is anticipated, and seems to be threatened from <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Brent’s</persRef> communications about the family of Labattut— The

							whole affair is not an imposture— All this may be; but through all this
							I look at the whole Romance, as officially presented to us, and
							presuming all to be true prepared my Report accordingly— A heavy
							responsibility; but so be it— I had morning visitors—<persRef

						<p>A fall of Snow in the night and this morning sufficient to cover the

							heard <persRef ref="bishop-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bishop</persRef> from Isaiah 9.6. part of the verse “And his name
							shall be called, Wonderful” This sublime prophesy, one of the most
							remarkable, in the volume of the Old Testament, has been presented in
							modern times and languages under various aspects, and with very
							different versions. It is now much questioned among biblical
							commentators and critics whether it has any reference whatever to Jesus
							Christ— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bishop however had no doubt of
							this, and his discourse consisted of an enumeration of the several
							properties in the birth, condition, history, and religion of Jesus,
							which inspired the prophet to say that his name should be called
							Wonderful— There were scarcely fifty persons in the Church, and it was a
							Sermon which might have delighted thousands, and tens of thousands, if
							to such a multitude, a human voice can be heard— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bishop gave notice that if the weather in the Evening should
							be stormy, there would be no service— There was none in the afternoon,
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— I was writing an
							answer to a Letter from <persRef ref="stevens-thaddeus">Thaddeus
								Stevens</persRef>, a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature, in
							which he asked my opinion of <persRef ref="harrison-william">General
								William H. Harrison’s</persRef> Anti-masonry— Stevens is the great
							Antimasonic leader in Pennsylvania at this time— He is also a partizan
							of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> for the succession to the Presidency— He had a
							correspondence with Harrison, upon Masonry, and was not satisfied with
							his answers.— He was a member of a late Antimasonic State Convention,
							where he wished to have Webster nominated, but where Harrison was
							nominated by a vote of more than three to one. <pb n="166" type="ms"
							/>Stevens, with <persRef ref="denny-harmar">Harmar Denny</persRef> and
							seven others seceded from the Convention, and published an angry
							declaration denouncing them;—and now he writes to me enclosing a
							newspaper containing his correspondence with Harrison, and enquiring my
							opinion of Harrison’s AntiMasonry— I have declined giving it, because it
							was asked merely to operate against the nomination of Harrison, and I
							wish to avoid all interference with the election— I saw in a newspaper
							an advertisement of a new Edition of <persRef ref="halleck-fitzgreene"
								>Halleck’s</persRef> Alnwick Castle and other poems, and it occurred
							to me that a notice of Alnwick Castle would be a good addition to the
							Report on the <persRef ref="smithson-james">Smithson</persRef> bequest I
							accordingly slipped it in, between Chevy Chace, <persRef
								ref="addison-joseph">Addison</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>— In this I have the
							intention to attract the notice of the public to Halleck’s merit as a
							lyric Poet—to accredit our national literature, by placing the first of
							our lyric Poets thus in line with Addison and Shakespear—and to add
							another twig to the laurel of the Percys. The additional member of the
							Sentence harmonizes well with the whole tenour of the period, though it
							has the inconvenience of lengthening the paragraph, already perhaps too
							long. My Journal lingers in arrear— I read part of <persRef

							should take the earliest possible opportunity to present them. At the

							extra copies of the Message and Correspondence were ordered to be

								>Hammond</persRef> of South Carolina interrupted me and moved that
							the Petition be not received— He had no right to interrupt me and the
							Speaker said I was entitled to the floor— <persRef ref="pinckney-henry"
								>Pinckney</persRef> of South-Carolina then intreated me to allow a
							motion to postpone the question of the receipt of the Petition, so that
							the reception of other Petitions might have free course this day to
							which I consented, and for which he thanked me. The question of
							reception <pb n="167" type="ms"/>was then postponed, and I presented
							another petition to the same effect of 158 Ladies, Citizens of the
							Commonwealth of Massachusetts for I said I had not yet brought myself to
							doubt whether females were Citizens— The question upon the reception of
							this Petition was also postponed— A great number of other Petitions with
							the same prayer were presented by many members; and all were postponed
							on motions of Hammond that they should not be received and by a new
							motion by <persRef ref="lee-gideon">Gideon Lee</persRef> of New-York
							that the motion not to receive be laid on the table— The Speaker varied
							the manner of putting the question, some time that it should not be, and
							sometimes whether it should be received, and finally put it upon the
							preliminary question; which he has decided is debateable; but that a
							motion to lay it on the table is in order and that is not debatable—
								<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> of Pennsylvania on
							presenting an abolition petition moved its reference to a select
							Committee; and upon the motion to lay that motion on the table, called
							for the yeas and nays— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved a
							call of the House which was refused—the yeas and nays for laying on the
							table were 177 to 37. and I was obliged to vote with the affirmatives,
							by the consent I had given that the petitions presented by me should be
							so disposed of— The States and territories were all called through for
							Petitions, and Resolutions from the Legislature of Indiana were
							presented instructing their Senators and requesting their
							Representatives to vote against the admission of Michigan into the
							Union, unless they agree to the boundary line claimed by Ohio— I wasted
							part of this Evening in reading part of the Dissertation N. upon the
							Congress of Nations, in writing eight lines for <persRef
								ref="seely-harriet">Miss Seely’s</persRef> Album, and in useless
							reflections upon irremediable evils.</p>

						<p>I had notified yesterday morning the members of the Committee of
							Manufactures, to meet at ten O’Clock this morning, and I had left my
							manuscript of the Report from the <persRef ref="smithson-james"
								>Smithson</persRef> bequest Committee with the <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">Clerk of the House</persRef> to have a copy of
							it made. I went to the Capitol before the mail of the morning had been
							delivered at my house, and with it were sent both the original and the
							copy of my Report— At the meeting of the Committee of Manufactures,
							there were present <persRef ref="dickerson-philemon"
							>Dickerson</persRef>, <persRef ref="mccomas-william">M’Comas</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="webster-taylor">Webster</persRef>, <persRef

							<persRef ref="judson-andrew">Judson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="holsey-hopkins">Holsey</persRef>— Absent <persRef
								ref="denny-harmar">Denny</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>— The only reference from the
							House was a petition from a Company in Georgia for permission to import
							two iron boats, free of duty— Upon discussion a majority of the
							Committee were averse to granting the prayer of the Petition— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Judson had a Letter from <persRef
								ref="white-george">George White</persRef>, who is writing a life of
								<persRef ref="slater-samuel">Samuel Slater</persRef> and a history
							of Manufactures in the United States, and who wishes to have the use of
							the Plates engraved for <persRef ref="mease-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mease’s</persRef> report upon the
							silk-manufacture, made in 1828— They belong to the public, but are now
							in the possession of the printer at Philadelphia— This subject not
							having been referred to the Committee by the House, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Judson moved that the Chairman should
							offer to the House a Resolution of reference, which was agreed to— The
							Committee adjourned to meet this day week at ten of the Morning. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Judson brought to my Seat the Resolution
							which he had moved in Committee—and when the Reports from standing
							Committees were called I offered the Resolution and it was adopted— When
							the Reports from select Committees were called, I presented the Report
							and Bill, from the Smithson bequest Message; and moved that the Bill and
							report should be printed; and the Bill twice read by its title, and
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, which
							was done— <persRef ref="chapin-graham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chapin</persRef> moved that five thousand extra copies of the Report
							should be printed for the use of the House— This Resolution by the rules
							of the House was to lie over one day— Chapin asked for its <pb n="168"
								type="ms"/>consideration by unanimous consent now—objection was
							made. Chapin asked the suspension of the rules, but the vote was not
							quite of two thirds to sustain him— The order of the day was called and
								<persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis’s</persRef> Resolution with its
