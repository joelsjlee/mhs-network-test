						<p>Memorial of F. C. Gray and others, praying a Bill like that which passed
							the Senate at the last Session of Congress, of indemnity for French
							spoliations prior to 1800.— Referred to the Committee of Foreign
							Relations and printed.</p>
						<p>Petition of Albert Pabodie, and 153 citizens of Millbury in the County of
							Worcester, for the abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade in the
							District of Columbia.</p>
						<p>I presented this Petition, and after stating its contents declared my
							intention to move that it should without reading be laid upon the table—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Glascock, interrupting me, moved that
							the Petition be not received, and proceeded to debate the question— I
							called him to order, and appealed to the 45<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> rule of the House, interdicting debate on petitions, on
							the day of their presentation— The Speaker decided that the rule did not
							apply to petitions not received by the House, and that the motion was
							debateable—from this decision I appealed and asked for the yeas and
							nays, which were ordered—and a debate followed which consumed the
							remainder of the day.</p>

						<p>Snow great part of the day— Fell about six inches deep. Heard at the
							Presbyterian Church <persRef ref="bishop-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bishop</persRef>, from Daniel
							5.5—[“]In the same hour came forth a finger of a man’s hand, and wrote
							over against the candlestick, upon the plaister of the Wall, of the
								<persRef ref="belshazzar">king’s</persRef> palace: and the king saw
							the part of the hand that wrote— 6. Then the king’s countenance was
							changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins
							were loosened and his knees smote one against another.”— The Sermon was
							upon the power of Conscience; and in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bishops usual style of eloquence— Somewhat declamatory but full of
							thought, of imagery and of Sentiments— This is one of all the passages
							of Scripture most impressive upon the imagination— There is something
							awful and terrific in the fact— Nothing in Romance is so appaling— The
							hand coming out of the Wall in the midst of a joyous and dissolute
							banquet, loosens ones loins and makes one’s knees shake almost like
							those of Belshazz<unclear>ar.</unclear> The description of the effect of
							the incident upon the loins and knees of the king is admirable— The
							application of the whole story to illustrate the power of Conscience
							upon the actions and sentiments of man was ingenious and instructive—
							There was no afternoon Service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church. <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
