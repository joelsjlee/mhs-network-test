						<p><persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> came for me at ten
							O’Clock this morning, and I went with him to the Railway-House, and
							thence walked to the Stone quarries. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leeds</persRef> had agreed with my Son
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to come out from
							Boston, and look at them, with a view to ascertain what price I should
							ask for my quarry lands—we went to the ledges now hired by <persRef
								ref="u">Dudley</persRef> and by <persRef ref="winkley-jh"
								>Winkley</persRef>, the former of which have been successful, but
							the latter have at least the prospect of failing— I found the rock on
							the top of which was drilled last Summer the hole marking the boundary
							between my ground and the wigwam ledge—but so much of the rock has since
							been taken away that the aspect of the whole region has changed— The
							Tower too which was heretofore a land mark was last February taken away—
							The quantities, of rocks removed from day to day rapidly change the face
							of the Country itself, and a village of houses is growing up in the
							wilderness— I expect they will soon seek incorporation as a Town to be
							set off from Quincy— As we were returning home after noon, we met
							opposite to <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> T. Greenleaf’s</persRef> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Leeds and <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> in a Carryall, who had
							just come out from Boston and called at my house— He said he had been
							belated by sickness in his family. We turned back again and went to the
							ledge, North and east of the wigwam quarry— This he viewed, and we
							pointed out to him the direction of the Borland and Savile joint lot. He
							said <pb n="307" type="ms"/>he had a <persRef ref="u">brother</persRef>
							at New-York, who wished to form a company, for working some of the
							Stone-quarries here, and it was for him that he was making the
							enquiries, respecting the price at which the Lands might be obtained— He
							asked me therefore to fix a price, which I would take, for one or for
							the three lots— I told him I should ask for the Field lot containing
							about sixteen Acres, ten thousand dollars— He asked if I would not take
							for it 500 dollars an Acre— I said no—but for the three lots containing
							in all from 47 to 50 Acres, I would take in cash 500 dollars an acre. I
							said that speaking from recollection, I might not be accurate as to the
							quantity of Land in each of the Lots—but I believed the plans of them
							all were at my Sons office in Boston, where he said he would call
							to-morrow and inspect them— I promised also to allow 30 days for the
							consideration of the demand of 500 dollars an acre for the 50 acres, and
							60 days for the offer of the sixteen Acres for 10000 dollars— We then
							parted and I got home just before two o’Clock— After dinner we had a
							visit from <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel;frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> who took tea with us. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frothingham mentioned an incident which had occurred this
							day in Boston, and produced much excitement— Two coloured women from
							Baltimore claimed as Slaves—brought by Habeas Corpus, before <persRef
								ref="shaw-lemuel">Chief Justice Shaw</persRef>—declared by him not
							to be detainable; and before his Sentence was declared, hurried out of
							the Courthouse, by a number of coloured people upon a threat from the
							agent of the claimant, that he would at all events detain them— The
							women were conveyed out of the Jurisdiction of the County and were not
							brought back into the Court.</p>

						<p>I discovered this morning at the edge of my seminary next to the gate a
							plumelet about one inch out of the ground, up since yesterday morning
							and parted at the top; a hickory walnut, the growth of which I propose
							to observe— About ten days since I first observed another at the corner
							of the bed, which is now four inches high, and has opened one collateral
							stalk with three oval leaves, another just over it with one leaf and a
							stalk diverging from the top with three oval leaves, all dark brown— I
							discovered also at the eastern end of the bed, three leaves of a currant
							bush—the only one from the multitude of currant seeds which I planted
							last Summer. <persRef ref="hardwick-henry">Henry Hardwick</persRef> was
							here, and agreed to give fifty dollars for the small strip of Salt-marsh
							land about which he has been in treaty with me several years, and which
							I viewed with him last Summer— He wants the Deed which I promised to
							draw, and deliver to him in the course of a few days— <persRef
								ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> also called upon me, and
							spoke of several Subjects of interest to the town of Quincy to himself,
							and to my personal and private affairs— He is now for the second year a
							member of the Legislature of the State, and has succeeded in obtaining a
							Charter for a Bank in this Town, by the name of the Quincy Stone Bank,
							with a Capital of one hundred thousand dollars, of which he is one of
							the directors— The bank commenced its operations on the first of June
							last with half its capital paid in, and notice is already given for the
							payment of the second instalment of fifty per Cent, on or before the
								15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month— My Son <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> took twenty shares of the
							Stock of this Bank for me, and ten shares for himself— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Field said they were using some temporary
							plates for their Bills—but that in about two months they would have
							their new plates with the head of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> engraved on one side, and that of <persRef
								ref="hancock-john">John Hancock</persRef> on the other— As they were
							both natives of Quincy, I thought they would form a very suitable devise
							for the Bills.— Field is a very enterprizing man, and engages perhaps in
							too many venturous Speculations at once— He has purchased of <persRef
								ref="fowle-john">John Fowle</persRef>, the House and Land that was
							<persRef ref="brackett-james">James Bracketts</persRef> at the Corner of the road opposite the episcopal church.
							Fowle had bought them of Brackett or his legal Representatives.— Rather
							Field purchased <pb n="308" type="ms"/>of the Brackett’s and sold to
							Fowle for 3425 dollars—of which Fowle paid in cash 1425 dollars, and
							gave a note and mortgage for 2000 dollars with a Policy of Insurance
							upon the buildings— Field wishes to raise money upon the mortgage and
							proposed to assign it to me. I promised him an answer in a few days— His
							father <persRef ref="field-joseph">Joseph Field</persRef> died last
							Winter, at the age of eighty-four— My Son Charles came out from Boston,
							with his wife, and their infant Son <persRef ref="adams-charles7"

							to spend with us a few weeks of the Summer— <persRef

						<p>I found another hickory seedling in my Seminary with a stem four inches
							high, opening in a triangle of three stalks with leaves yet unformed. It

							one in the seminary; the other in the garden of the last year and a
							different plum— I watered the box next to the road in front of the
							South-east corner of the house— The seedling Plants in the boxes and
							Pots perish unless sheltered from the Sun and watered— The patches also
							succeed extremely well, but require sheltering and watering the first
							Season— Charles went to Boston this morning and returned to dinner—
								<persRef ref="lincoln-solomon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Solomon Lincoln</persRef> from Hingham was here this afternoon, and
							paid me three dollars for the recording at the Patent Office the
							assignment of <persRef ref="lane-charles">Charles Lane’s</persRef>

							with me upon present politics which are not very satisfactory. The
							object of chief concernment is the Presidential Election, which I deem
							of very inferior importance to others concerning which the public mind
							is neither animated nor sound— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln is
							of those who incline to adhere to <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef> without indulging a particle of hope of his
							success— They are to have a whig Convention at Worcester in September to
							settle their definitive whig policy— <persRef ref="porter-royal">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> R. L. Porter</persRef> the Editor of
							the American Traveller a weekly Boston Newspaper was also here, but I
							did not see him— I read much in the Journals of the old Congress, to
							recover the memory of their proceedings upon subjects of France— I
							perplexed and entangled myself, but wrote very little— The public debt,
							the public Lands the regulation of Commerce, and the intercourse with
							Indians were the gordian knots of the confederacy— In the solution of
							them all, <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef> took a
							conspicuous and leading part; but how his agency is to be set forth in
							the form of an Eulogy, doing entire justice to him and no injustice to

							magnitude—absorbs my time weighs down my Spirits—banishes all other
							subjects of importance to myself and my family from my thoughts and
							leaves me nothing to trifle about but my seedling trees. This day it
							disqualified me by weakness and indisposition— <persRef

							his contributions to the Federalist— 4. by his Speeches and influence in
							the Virginia State Convention which adopted the Constitution— His share
							in organizing the Government of the United States under the
							Constitution— Then his alienation from the administration of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, his associations with
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>, his variances
							with <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef>— His favouring

							years as Secretary of State under M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson— His first and second Presidential terms and his Policy of War
							and Peace— Lastly his retirement of twenty years diversified by his
							occasional correspondence; by his agricultural pursuits; by his Offices
							as a Trustee and Rector of the University of Virginia, and his

							flourishing at the Northern end of the Nursery, but which he
							transplanted thence is dead. Several of the large Elms are alive and
							promising— My three boxes at the West end of the Garden, and the one
							next the road, are stocked with rows of apple and pear seedlings, but
							they are perishing for want of rain— I therefore determine to water them
							once or twice a week, as well as the Pots in one of which Strawberries
							sown by me last Summer have come up, and apple and Pear seedlings in
							others, but from what seeds I have lost all my indications.— I perceived
							this day the difference in the first appearance of vegetation between
							the Shagbark and Pignut Hickory— The Pignut puts up a shorter stem, and
							opens two single leaves nearly round, which as they increase in size
							take the shape of a spade— The Shagbark stem shoots up a stem from three
							to four inches long and then opens two or three short stalks with three
							leaves hanging to each— They are all at first of a dark brown colour,
							which gradually changes to a pea-green— I have found one more seedling

						<p>Long morning in my garden, nursery and Seminary. I have been ten summers
							sowing the Seeds of fruit and forest trees; and have a great variety of
							seedlings of many kinds— Some at every stage of growth, from 1827 to the
							shoots of this Season— I cannot distinctly remember the age of the
							several trees which have survived the first and second winters and there
							is so great a diversity in the rapidity and slowness of growth of
							different trees, even of the same kind, that I have Pear and especially
							Apple trees six or seven years old, shorter than other shoots even of
							the present Season— Among the difficulties of raising trees I find that
							of giving them strait stems quite prominent—especially of all those
							which have little growth the first Season— The winter frost followed by
							the vernal thaw heaves up the roots and the winter snows bend down their
							stems, which if not straitened in the Spring become irretrievably bent
							and twisted— I attempted this morning to redress several crooked and
							twisted stems of peach and pear trees three or four years old— A
							seedling Pear tree in the Seminary, which last year grew more and with
							better promise than any other, and which this Season put forth leaves
							abundantly has been turning for weeks to a dark brown, and is now just
							dead— Almost every one of my seedling Pears of this year, are wholly
							blighted— While I was in my Garden <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey
								Field</persRef> came with the mortgage of the <persRef
								ref="brackett-james">Brackett</persRef> house, and <persRef
								ref="fowle-john">Fowles</persRef> note, which he proposed to assign
							to me but I was obliged to decline— He spoke to me again about
							purchasing the Birch wood standing upon my <persRef
								ref="verchild-francis">Verchild</persRef> pasture, and proposed to
							me to plant it over with Mulberry trees, which I am to take into
							consideration— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> paid the
							second Instalment of my twenty shares in the Quincy Stone bank, and
							brought me the receipt of <persRef ref="bartlett-ibrahim">Ibrahim

								Whitney</persRef> preached the morning discourse from Proverbs 9.12
							“If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest,
							thou alone shalt bear it”— I had heard the Sermon once, if not twice
							before. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney understands Wisdom, as
							used in the Proverbs of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> to mean
							Religion— A preceding verse says that the fear of the Lord is the
							beginning of wisdom, and the text teaches wisdom upon selfish
							considerations— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney administered the
							communion, and gave notice, that at the next performance of the same
							rite, the first Sunday in October a collection would be made to defray
							the expenses for the year. In the afternoon <persRef ref="lunt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached from 2.
							Peter 1.5 And beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue;
							and to virtue knowledge: 6. And to knowledge, temperance; and to
							temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 7 And to godliness
							brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity— The doctrine
							was, that to the formation of the Christian character the assemblage of
							all the virtues is necessary and the failure <pb n="311" type="ms"/>of
							Christians to attain the perfection peculiar to the system was
							attributed to the practice of giving a disproportionate influence to
							some one of the virtues to the disparagement or the neglect of others—
							Notice was given that there would be a temperance meeting and Lecture
							next Tuesday Evening— I read the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon
							of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, against hasty judgments
							concerning the ways of God— The subject would have been more interesting
							if it had been more generalized— All hasty judgments are vicious, and
							they are almost universal— Hasty judgments on the Providence of God can
							scarcely be formed by sincere believers in Christianity, or in
							Providence itself— There is then much argument in this Discourse to
							prove that which no reasonable man would deny— In the Evening I attended
							at the Universalist Meeting and heard a young man address the youthful
							part of his auditory from 1. John 2.14. “I have written unto you, young
							men, because ye are strong”— The comment of the preacher upon these
							words was not destitute of ingenuity liveliness or fluency, and the
							discourse was well adapted to the auditory— The besetting sins of youth
							were rebuked in terms sufficiently severe, without being offensive, and
							with due brevity to avoid tediousness— There was good attendance in

						<p>Morning in my Garden Nursery and Seminary. My Seedling trees of this, and
							some even of the last year are suffering by the drought, and the Sun of
							this day, has I fear killed no small number of them— I gathered in the
							garden several fully ripe Strawberries, and currants from the seedling
							bush at the garden gate, and sowed them in Pot 3. filled with fresh
							earth; together with one old peach Stone, and six or seven cherry
							stones. I crushed the currants and Strawberries, to put their seeds in
							immediate contact with the Earth— The Jenneton Pears are ripe a week
							later than the last year, and are much smaller— My two Southern Oaks are
							just forming their leaves of the year— <persRef ref="everett-edward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett</persRef>, now

							gave me a Volume of his Orations and Speeches, recently published— They
							are among the best ever delivered in this Country, and I think will
							stand the test of time.— The custom of delivering Orations, on public
							occasions was introduced into this Country by the Boston Massacre of 5.
							March 1770. of which there were thirteen delivered successively till
							1783. in Boston Town meeting— The 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							July was then substituted for the yearly town Oration, and these have
							been continued till the present time. Other towns and cities have
							followed the example, and other occasions have been taken for the
							delivery of similar discourses till they have multiplied so that they
							now outnumber the days of the year— Of the thousands and tens of
							thousands of these Orations which teem in every part of this Country,
							there are perhaps not one hundred that will be remembered, alteri
							Seculo; and of them, at least one half have been or will be furnished by
							Edward Everett— He has largely contributed to raise the Standard of this
							Class of compositions, and his eloquence has been the basement story of
							his political fortune; as yet one of the most brilliant ever made in

						<p>Heavy and unexpected rain in the Night and this morning, which I hope

								Greenwood</persRef> of Boston, preached for us this morning from
							Romans 11.36. “For of him, and through him, and to him are all things:
							to whom be glory for ever. Amen.” The doctrine which he deduced from the
							text was that the foundation of all morality was the will of God, and
							that <pb n="315" type="ms"/>utility could be assumed as the basis of
							morals only so far as it was conformable to the Will of God— This was
							undoubtedly the Law and the Prophets of the Hebrews, and it is the
							genuine Law of Christianity— These Metaphysics are at this day applied
							more frequently to discussions of Politics than of religion—but for
							Government and for religion the foundation of duty, is one and the
							same—and it can be no other than the Will of God— This follows
							necessarily from two previous assumptions—first that there is a God the
							creator and ruler of the Universe—and secondly that man is accountable
							to him— If you admit a plurality of primary causes, or, more than one
							God, then the phenomena of the Universe proceed from more than one will,
							and morals must seek for another basis; the beauty of virtue, the
							fitness of things, utility, the moral sense, or the greatest good of the
							greatest number— You have the Stoic, the Epicurean and the Platonic
							theories.— The Christian theory is far more elevated— Under that
							dispensation the end of human existence is not the pursuit of happiness,
							but the performance of duty— The pursuit of happiness is in its nature a
							principle essentially selfish— The obligation of duty is essentially
							social— Now the fair and the good the καλον και αγαθον of <persRef
								ref="plato">Plato</persRef> admits this, and it runs through all the
							discourses of <persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef>— But all the
							Greek Philosophers including Socrates sought for the sources of human
							happiness in man himself— It was reserved to the Mosaic and Christian
							philosophy to trace them all to the sense of responsibility to the
							Creator— I invited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenwood to dine with
							us, but he was engaged to <persRef ref="miller-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Miller</persRef>. The afternoon
							Sermon was from Job 14.14. “If a man die, shall he live again?” upon the
							immortality of the Soul— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenwood’s turn
							of mind is argumentative, and his reasoning forcible; but his delivery
							is cold and sluggish— There was a light thunder shower, which overtook
							us before we reached home this afternoon. I read the ninth Sermon of the
								8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>; upon Pleasure; or as it is in
							the French idiom the Pleasures— The text is from Ecclesiastes 9.7.8.9.
							and the preacher considers them as ironical. This appears to me
							questionable to say the least— He declines giving his reason for his
							construction of the text, but assuming it as a severe censure upon the
							pursuit of Pleasure, enlarges upon it with a corresponding commentary—
							He complains that he is restrained from the application of his censure
							upon vice, to individuals by respect for persons and says that the
							ministers of the gospel dare not speak of the criminals among their
							auditories, and that he himself is afraid to charge sundry persons then
							present at his discourse— He disclaims all austerity of principle, and
							says that he does not pronounce the theatre, other public amusements or
							even play, evils in themselves; but blames them only for their
							enticements and tendencies to corruption. This Sermon is less edifying
							than others precisely because the Orator could not speake his whole
							mind. We had an evening visit from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi

								Curtis</persRef> came over this morning from Roxbury, and left with
							me a large file of papers relating to the Estate, and the Execution of
							the Will of the late <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas
								Boylston</persRef>. I read to him the Letter I have received from
								<persRef ref="elmsley-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Elmsley</persRef> enquiring about the legacy to <persRef
								ref="elmsley-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Elmsley</persRef>
							in her brother’s Will— This is of 150 pounds sterling to be paid from
							the proceeds of Lands in the Province of Nova-Scotia— A person named
								<persRef ref="cutler-robert">R M. Cutler</persRef> Postmaster at
							Guysborough in that Province has been the agent of the Executors for the
							sale of the Estate. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis had a Letter
							from him dated 18. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1834, complaining of
							numerous intrusive settlers upon the Lands, and requiring to enable him
							to prosecute for the recovery of the Lands the original grant of them
							from <persRef ref="george-iii">the king</persRef>, and the instruments
							of conveyance of them to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston— The
							Lands were <pb n="316" type="ms"/>granted by George the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> to <persRef ref="hallowell-benjamin"
								>Benjamin Hallowell</persRef>, and by his Will, made at Boston in
							November 1796 were bequeathed to his three children, <persRef
								ref="carew-benjamin">Admiral Hallowell</persRef>, W. N. Boylston and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Elmsley, as Tenants in Common— In
							1826. Admiral Hallowell released his portion of the Lands, which are in
							the Township of Manchester and County of Sidney, to W. N. Boylston, as
								<persRef ref="elmsley-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Elmsley</persRef> had released theirs
							in April 1801. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis had the deeds of
							Release; but neither the original grant nor Benj<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi> Hallowells Will— Cutler’s Letter says he can in case of need
							obtain a copy of the grant from the Registry in the Province, and as the
							Will was made at Boston and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hallowell had
							real Estate there I presume it must be recorded in the registry of Wills
							at the Probate Office there. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis said
							he would enquire and if the record of the Will is there would obtain an
							authenticated extract of that part of it containing the bequest of the
							Nova Scotia Lands. He also left with me the Letters received since last
							Summer from <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef>, one of
							which announces a dividend of three shillings and six pence on the pound
							of <persRef ref="vaughan-william">William Vaughan’s</persRef> Estate— He
							mentioned that <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Nicholas
								Boylston</persRef> was now of age, studying physic with <persRef
								ref="shattuck-george">Doctor Shattuck</persRef>, and desirous of
							having a yearly allowance from <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">his
								grandmother</persRef> who thought of allowing him 450 dollars a
							year— <persRef ref="boylston-thomas">The other brother</persRef> is in a
							merchant’s store at Boston— Ward came of age last Wednesday— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis shewed me a plan of new Streets to
							be laid out in Charlestown, including the Boylston lands, which are
							increasing in value, and he proposes to build upon one of the vacant
							houselots in Boston— I promised to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Curtis again, after examining the papers that he left— This afternoon we
							were visited by <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> M’Kenney</persRef> of Philadelphia, with <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Baldwin</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickson</persRef>
							Ladies from New-Orleans each with a daughter— They went also to the
							burying ground, before which they are now building a solid wall— I gave

								<persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef> and of the Eulogy upon
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef>— At dusk I walked

						<p><persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> and <persRef

							here this morning— Field to request me to draught a Petition of sundry

							Quarries to what is called the Captains Bridge: the principal object
							being to prevent by anticipation the opening of another road by order of
							the County Commissioners, and which it is apprehended would divert the
							travel away from Quincy and towards Randolph— Copeland brought the
							draught of a Petition made by <persRef ref="jackson-francis2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Jackson</persRef> which he
							wished me to take, and draught another in its stead. But his main
							purpose was to obtain my signature to head the petition— I saw no
							occasion for another draught, and after striking out some sentences
							which I thought superfluous I signed the Petition— After an early dinner
							I went with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and took
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Ann
								Adams</persRef> with whom we went to Hingham and attended the

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Loring was married I think in 1777. and
							was then about twenty years old— She died last Saturday at the age of
							79. We reached the House at 3. O’Clock the time which we had heard was
							fixed for the funeral but it was an hour later— We went therefore to the
							house of the <persRef ref="brooks-charles">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Brooks</persRef>
							and saw him and <persRef ref="brooks-cecilia">his wife</persRef>— She is

							cannot live many weeks longer. She nevertheless came down to receive
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="greenleaf-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John

							to the house to tea, where M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams said we
							should be expected, and where <persRef ref="whittemore-sophia">M<hi

							her brother <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph</persRef> afterwards
							came, and accompanied her home.</p>

						<p>I am obliged to use the long room below for my writing and reading, which
							is some discomposure to my arrangements— I gave <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> a check on the Quincy Stone
							Bank for 625 dollars payable to <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth
								C. Adams</persRef>, and he took up my two Notes to her of 1. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1831. and 7 April 1832—the amount of both
							being 3625 dollars, and returned them to me— A man by the name of
								<persRef ref="kendall-benjamin">Benjamin Kendall</persRef>, who told
							me that he was born in the West-riding of Yorkshire in England, came to
							me upon a very strange errand— He had an old tattered English Newspaper
							of July 1822 containing an advertisement from a person named <persRef
								ref="u">Leighton</persRef>, that considerable property in America
							had been left to the right heirs of <persRef ref="kendall-francis"
								>Francis Kendall</persRef>, and urging them to report themselves to
							him— And now after fourteen years from the date of the advertisement he
							comes and declares himself one of those heirs, and applies for advice
							how to find the property and ascertain what it is— He told a long and
							incongruous story, in English such as I never heard before and had
							difficulty to understand; but finally said he had received a Letter from
							one of his family who informed him that the property was in Boston, and
							that the British Consul had the subject in charge— I advised him to
							apply to the British Consul at Boston, and if he should find that he
							knew nothing of the matter, then to the British Consul at New-York— He
							said he had applied to the Registry of Wills, at Boston, and at
							Cambridge to get a copy of the Will of Francis Kendall— That were two
							Wills executed by persons of that name at Boston, and thirteen at
							Cambridge— And of the latter, one will corresponded with that from which
							his expectations <pb n="319" type="ms"/>and of this he had a copy, but
							not with him— He came to me as a member of Congress, supposing that body
							had some agency in the concern, which I assured him they had not.— A
							black woman also calling herself by the name of <persRef
								ref="adams-emma">Emma Adams</persRef>, came complaining of having
							been ill used, at the Boston house, in South-Boston; and said she had
							been referred to me to obtain redress.— After some explanation she found
							she was mistaken, and it was the <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Governor</persRef> to whom she had been directed— I made small
							progress in my writing, but found it necessary to read the debates in
							the Virginia Convention upon the federal Constitution; and I answered an
							invitation from the <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Mayor</persRef> and
							aldermen of Boston to attend the examination of the Public Schools next
							Tuesday and Wednesday and the dinner at Faneuil Hall, on Wednesday— I
							declined—</p>

							I trample on many of them inconsiderately— This was certainly a great
							bearing year for the trees, as the last autumn was of Ashseeds— They

								Lunt’s</persRef> discourse of this morning was from Revelation 5.1.
							[“]And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
							written within and on the back side, sealed with seven Seals 2 And I saw
							a strong Angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the
							book; and to loose the Seals thereof?” this he said was the book of
							Fate— There is something mystical and mysterious in every part of the
							Book of Revelation, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt said was
							to be considered as the prophetical history of the Church of Christ,
							from the time when it was written to the end of the world. Of this I
							cannot help entertaining doubts— That it is prophetic I believe because
							it professes to be so; but after eighteen centuries of fulfilment no
							commentator has ever yet discovered its meaning, and it may be doubted
							whether it has contributed to promote the universal prevalence of
							Christianity, <pb n="320" type="ms"/>or the reverse— In the afternoon
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s text was from Psalm 16.11.
							“Thou wilt shew me the path of Life: in thy presence is fulness of joy;
							at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore.” The enjoyments of
							Religion, are a favourite topic with him, and he dwells upon them with
							an earnestness evincive of sincerity. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> came out from Boston
							and dined with us— He brought intelligence that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> in a Letter to
								<persRef ref="cannon-newton">Newton Cannon</persRef>, Governor of
							Tennessee has countermanded the call of <persRef ref="gaines-edmund"
								>General Gaines</persRef> for a thousand men from that State for a
							fraudulent and treacherous invasion of the Territory of Mexico— Degrand
							went to Meeting with me after dinner, and in the Evening took <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale’s</persRef>
							son <persRef ref="beale-george2">George</persRef> with him back to
							Boston. The <persRef

								>Charles</persRef> this Evening visited at <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Quincy’s</persRef>; and I walked to <persRef ref="miller-edward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Miller’s</persRef>— There
							I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale and <persRef
								ref="beale-ann;beale-caroline;beale-frances">his
							daughters</persRef>— <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi

								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>, and afterwards
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Ann
								Adams</persRef>.— I came home after the Evening bell— I read the
							tenth Sermon of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>; upon the observance of the
							solemn festivals, and particularly of the day of rest—(the Sabbath) The
							celebration of all festivals was abolished by the English Independents
							from whom our congregational churches are descended, and by the
							Presbyterian Church of Scotland. We have none of them the Episcopal
							English Church has retained many of them and the Lutheran Church
							several. The French Hugonots I believe celebrated Christmas, Easter and
							perhaps Whitsunday—but Saurin makes only a general reference to the
							festivals without specifying any one of them, and saying very little of
							the duty to observe them— But he complains with great severity of the
							disregard of the Sabbath by his own people and insists that they are
							more guilty in that respect than any other Christians of any age or
							denomination— In this as in almost all his discourses Saurin censures
							and rebukes his auditory with no sparing voice, and if they were as
							vicious as he represents them, the infidelity of the present age
							scarcely surpasses that of those days— A comparison of Saurin’s Sermons,
							with those of <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="bourdaloue-louis">Bourdaloue</persRef>, and those of
								<persRef ref="tillotson-john">Tillotson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="south-robert">South</persRef> and <persRef ref="barrow-isaac"
								>Barrow</persRef>, will give much insight into the politics of the
							age in which they lived, as well as into the prevailing prejudices and
							passions of the conflicting nations of Europe at that time.</p>

						<p>The Nights are so cold that we have fires almost every morning and last
							night there was a light frost— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned to dine— He brought
							me out a volume, which <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P
								Davis</persRef> found at the Athenaeum containing a pamphlet of
							nullification papers, among which is <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madisons</persRef> report to the
							Legislature of Virginia in 1799: which was published by <persRef
								ref="elliot-jonathan">Jonathan Elliot</persRef> in 1832— I was
							called from my garden to <persRef ref="evans-i">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> I Evans</persRef> who gave me tickets for my Son, and
							myself to his introductory Lecture, this Evening to a course of seven
							which he proposes to deliver during the next fortnight at the town Hall—
							He sat and conversed with me nearly two hours upon English Literature,
							and English Eloquence and Orators— At four O Clock this afternoon
								<persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> came— We went
							down to the mount Wollaston farm—and met <persRef ref="hardwick-henry"
								>Henry Hardwick</persRef> at the spot where I had agreed to convey
							to him a small strip of Salt marsh land— We measured it both within and
							without the fence, and found the first about 40 and the whole about 55
							rods. We took the bearings by estimate, and I made minutes of the
							several measures, from which in the Evening I drew a plat of the land.
							Returning we stopped at the house now building which is to be completed
							in the course of the next month— I walked with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Greenleaf, round the orchard and seedling forest lot. The
								<pb n="321" type="ms"/>appearance of the Orchard is discouraging,
							many of the Apple-trees set out in 1830 being dead, and none of those
							that survive being in a flourishing condition. But on three sides of the
							border there are at least five hundred Oak, Chesnut, and Shag bark
							walnut trees, from the Acorns and nuts which I sowed in October 1830.
							and which promise to make in twenty years from this time a thick grove
							of forest trees: On the Eastern side of the border, where the plantation
							of 1830. totally failed, but where <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>Kirke</persRef> last October sowed a large quantity of Shagbark
							Nuts, and Ash-seeds, great numbers, of both kinds of the trees are up
							and looking well, but not much grown because they are shaded by a thick
							growth of coarse and rank weeds from four to five feet high— The Earth
							was ploughed up there last fall, but has not been weeded this Summer— On
							the other sides of the border; and round the Apple-trees of the Orchard
							the ground is hard; and for the further growth of the trees the
							loosening of the soil is all that seems to be required. My Son Charles
							was with us, and I took his son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John
								Quincy</persRef> with me in the Carry all— But he became impatient
							while we were examining my Orchard forest, and I sent him home with
							Spear. We returned after Sunset, and found <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Ann Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C Smith</persRef> here— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> had dined with us. In the
							Evening I went with Charles to the Town Hall, and attended M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Evans’s gratuitous introductory Lecture,
							upon sacred geography, and sundry and various other subjects. The next
							Lecture is to be to-morrow— The Hall was excessively crowded and the
							heat was intense— The Lecture occupied about an hour, and with the
							evening bell we came home— The company was gone.</p>

							which I intend to open over the Hill, and which Bass wishes to carry
							through to the other Street.— A person by the name of <persRef

							enquire of me what were the duties of a Chaplain on board our Ships of
							War. I informed him as far as I was able; but advised him to apply to

							Charlestown, for further information— I asked him if he wished to obtain
							an appointment as Chaplain himself. He said he had not such a
							determinate design, but that the thought had occurred to him— I enquired
							if he was a clergyman; or had studied divinity— He said no; he had not
							received a learned education; but had lately applied himself to
							theological studies— He asked if there was not a teacher of Mathematics
							attached to our Vessels of War— I thought there was, to some of them and
							enquired whether he thought himself qualified for that office; he said
							he did not; but that he might become so— These visitors occupied part of
							the morning, and <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> E Price Greenleaf</persRef> came and
							looked at the buds which he inserted in my cherry trees the 28<hi

							but he advises to keep the cotton yarn bandages round them through the
							winter— The second bud of the Wollaston Apple inserted in July 1834.
							continues to shew an appearance of vegetation, and the bud which came
							out about this time last year continues to shoot up and promises to form
							a sound stem— The hazel-bush patch contains almost all my seedlings of

							icy-cold. I had the hearth in our dining room repaired and prepared for
							autumnal fires. I should have written much, and wrote but little—but
							found at the Office,—<persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirts</persRef> Life of
								<persRef ref="henry-patrick">Patrick Henry</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="yates-robert">Yatess</persRef> minutes of the debates in the

							garden is a perpetual temptation to me to stray; and although I intend
							to allow to it no more time than is necessary for bodily exercise, three
							and four hours of every morning are absorbed insensibly to myself in
							mere inspection and observation of seedling trees from nine years to one
							week old. Those of the first season, require the most constant
							attendance; but those of former years are now susceptible of much
							remark— Among the most interesting are the maples of which I brought the
							seed from Philadelphia in May 1835 and of which I have now one in my
							Seminary, four feet high— I headed down this morning an English Oak in
							the seminary transplanted from the Nursery last October— It died down to
							the ground in the winter, and has thrown up several thrifty shoots— The
							English white Oak is of exceedingly rapid growth but is repugnant to
							transplantation— I find similar difficulties with the chesnut. The Horse
							chesnut the Willow, and the Button are more difficult to extirpate than
							to raise— The phenomena of the pear are perplexing.</p>

							by ants, for I remember not to have seen this destruction but in the
							vicinity of a subterraneous Ants nest— I replanted the Ash with its half
							inch of root, but without hope of saving it— My Bartlett pear tree bed
							was weeded, and is now covered with seedlings of this year from the last
							Fall plantation, with many self sown Elms. But of the six or seven rows
							first sown, that is in August and September, scarcely any have come up—
							Of those planted in October, and the beginning of November few have
							failed. The corner seminary Shagbark has been bitten by a frost, and its
							vegetation is totally stopped— A second leaf fully developed <pb n="324"
								type="ms"/>from the plumelet of the seedling up in Pot 2. proves to
							be a seed from a brown bury pear sown the 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of last October.— A discovery!— I appropriated a vacant
							round patch in the Seminary to <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef>, and she sowed there, Peach and Plum Stones— Apple
							and grape seeds.— Almost every one of the round patches in the garden
							and seminary now have seedling trees in them— Most of them several, and
							of various kinds of trees— That in front of my Library window, has a
							fine seedling Apple sown in 1833 and now<space/>inches high— It has also
							two dubious Peach trees, 6 or 7. puny pears, and two wild cherries all
							of which must be taken up— </p>

								Newell</persRef> of Cambridge preached this morning from Hebrews
							12.1. “Wherefore, seeing we who are compassed about, with so great a
							cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which
							doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is
							set before us.”— His afternoon Sermon was from 2. Corinthians 13.5.
							“Examine yourselves”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell is a young
							man Minister of the Congregation at Cambridge, where <persRef
								ref="holmes-abiel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef>
							and before him <persRef ref="hilliard-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hilliard</persRef> were settled.— He was on the
							Committee for the examination of the Library with me, on the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month— His discourses are
							sensible and moral, but neither brilliant nor profound. The theological
							school at Cambridge, is yearly producing several such clergymen, and
							they are introducing a uniformity of composition and delivery, superior
							to those of their predecessors of the last age, but which leaves a
							desire for more variety at least of manner— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Newell dined with us, and is a person of modest, unassuming
							and gentle manners— The weather was at Summer heat, for the first time
							since I arrived from Philadelphia— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit</persRef> in the middle of the day about 90— I read the
								11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon the dispositions suitable to attendance on
							public worship the first of three—but by a blunder of the book binder,
							the pages 437. 438 and 441. 442. of the Volume are missing, and the
							corresponding pages of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume, are
							bound up in the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and occupy their place.
							The pages of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume are not missing
							from their own place, but those missing from the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> volume are not there— The missing 437<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> page of the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> volume is the close of the first Sermon upon the
							dispositions for attendance on public worship; and the 438<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is the beginning of the second on the
							same subject. these therefore I lose, as also the part of the second
							Discourse contained in pages 441. and 442. The third of the same Sermons
							is also a fragment in the book, with a note that the closing part of it
							had not been found among the author’s papers— They are very good
							Sermons, and very proper to be carefully read by attendants upon public
							worship at this day— They are like most of this preacher’s discourses
							severely reproachful to his own auditory, though towards the close, he
							sooths them by acknowledgements that it had been thought to have been
							observed, and assurances had been given, that within the last preceding
							ten years there had been a considerable improvement in their morals, and
							in their opinions—particularly in their charity towards the doctrines of
							their preachers— He says that they complain, perhaps with reason if a
							Sermon exceeds an hour in length—but that they do tolerate the doctrine
							that good works are essential to Salvation, and do not absolutely charge
							a Minister with inclining to Popery and auricular confession, even if he
							is anxious in his particular attendance upon the dying, and specific
							rather than general in his exhortations to them— <persRef

							Greenleaf brought me a message from <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong</persRef> the Mayor,
							requesting me to fix a day for the delivery of the Eulogy on <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>— This is rather embarrassing, as I do not see the end
							of my work and have yet much to write, and more to revise— I have come
							now to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s course of conduct
							relating to the alien and Sedition acts; a subject of extreme difficulty
							to manage, inasmuch as it forms in the opinion of his party friends,
							perhaps the greatest of his merits and services; while I myself believe
							him to have been in error throughout the whole of those transactions.—
							To refresh my memory on these subjects and to retrace the history of
							those controversies more accurately I read over the portion of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> correspondence during
							that period published by his <persRef ref="randolph-thomas2"
								>Grandson</persRef>— It shews his craft and duplicity in very
							glaring colours— I incline to the opinion that he was not altogether
							conscious of his own insincerity, and deceived himself as well as
							others— His success through a long life, and especially from his
							entrance upon the Office of Secretary of State under <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, until he reached the
							Presidential chair, seems to my imperfect vision a slur upon the moral
							government of the world— His rivalry with <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef> was unprincipled on both
							sides— His treatment of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							was double dealing, treacherous and false beyond all toleration— His
							Letter to <persRef ref="mazzei-phillip">Mazzei</persRef> and his
							subsequent explanations of it and apologies for it, shew that he treated
							Washington, as far as he dared no better than he did my father—but it
							was Washington’s popularity that he never dared to encounter— His
							correspondence now published proves how he dreaded and detested it— His
							letter to my father at the first competition between them for the
							Presidency— The fawning, dissimulation of his first address as
							Vice-President to the Senate, with his secret machinations against him
							from that day forth, shew a character in no wise amiable or fair; but
							his attachment to those of his friends whom he could make useful to
							himself was thorough-going and exemplary— Madison moderated some of his
							excesses, and refrained from following him into others— He was in truth
							a greater, and a far more estimable man.</p>

						<p>There was some rain, in the night and this morning, but not enough to
							moisten the earth which is exceedingly dry— I do not yet tire of
							visiting my seedling trees, and this day found two pignut hickories just
							out of the ground— I emptied a Pot in which I had last Summer sown,
							several Cores of the Jenneton Pear. I found several of them almost
							falling into dust; but without sign of vegetation— The trees that bear
							the Jargonelles and the Catherine Pears are hollow, and it is useless to
							sow seeds from them— The Plumelet of the brown bury, puts out the
							promise of a third leaf, and my potted seedling Strawberry sown last
							year puts out a creeper. I found palmer worms and hairy caterpillers
							upon a black walnut and upon an Apple seedling— The Jargonelles are all
							gathered, and the Catherines over ripe— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned to dine— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>, and <persRef

									>r.</hi></persRef> dined with us, and <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef> came for his Sister
							this Evening. The weather <pb n="326" type="ms"/>cleared away in the
							course of the day—the atmosphere cool and at night cold I wrote little,
							and continued reading the Letters of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef>, from 1793 till August 1803. published by
								<persRef ref="randolph-thomas2">his Grandson</persRef>— His
							duplicity sinks deeper and deeper into my mind— His hatred of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef> was unbounded— Of
								<persRef ref="marshall-john">John Marshall</persRef> most intense—of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, tempered with
							compunctious visitings, always controuled by his ambition— They had been
							cordial friends, and co-operators in the great cause of Independence;
							and as joint Commissioners abroad after the Peace of 1783. there had
							then been a warm and confidential intimacy between them, which he never
							entirely shook off, but which he sacrificed always to his ambition, and
							at the last stage of his life to his envy and his poverty—for he died
							insolvent, and on the very day of his death received eleemosinary
							donations from the charity of some of those whom he had most deeply
							injured— This circumstance is not creditable to his Country— She ought
							not to have suffered a man who had served her as he had to die, with his
							household wanting the necessaries of life— But it was the natural
							consequence of the niggardly doctrines which his political system had
							imposed upon him, and which he had passed off upon the Country for
							Patriotism— Among his slanders upon the administration of my father was
							the charge of extravagance in diplomatic expenditure; and when he sent
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> on the Louisiana mission to France, he wrote to him
							that he could not have an outfit; and that the refusal of outfits was
							one of his reforms upon extraordinary missions— The end of all which was
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe obtained not only the outfit,
							but gratuities and allowances more than any other minister abroad has
							ever had, and died leaving still unsatisfied claims— I am compelled to
							draw many other harsh conclusions against this great man, from his now
							published Letters</p>

								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef> there alone— We called at <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Greenleaf’s</persRef>, but the house was dark and we could rouse no
							part of the family to receive us— There was a cry of fire at Milton, and
							the tocsin sounded to which our bell answered with an echo— The engines
							went part of the way, but learning that the fire was extinguished,
							returned without reaching the place— I set apart two seedling circles in
							the Seminary for my Granddaughters <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Georgiana Frances</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa
								Catherine</persRef>, each with a Stake and stone bearing their
							respective names and in which they planted peach and plumstones; and
							apple and grape seeds— They take a fancy to this themselves, and I wish
							to encourage them in it— Simple and innocent pleasures, are not only
							enjoyments but virtues— An interest in the Life of Plants is more
							rational than in that of cats, dogs, Parrots or monkies and by its
							capability of being made useful deserves to be cherished, and
							cultivated— I had the natural taste for raising plants from the seed
							even <pb n="327" type="ms"/>in my childhood, but the course of my life
							has not indulged me with its gratification— The shagbark walnut tree
							close to the Summerhouse cellar in the garden, the nut of which was
							planted by me in October 1804. is the earliest of my seedling plants— It
							is a large tree upwards of thirty feet high, and is now well loaded with
							fruit— But it requires twenty years for a result in plantation— It
							cannot therefore be assumed at too early a period of life, nor pursued
							withe effect unless by persevering continuance— For profit or for
							pleasure there appears to me to be no species of agriculture so
							commendable for a young man to devote himself, as the raising of trees,
							forest and fruit, from the seed— It is doubtless not equally suitable
							for females; yet the taste for planting if formed in childhood may
							contribute much to their comfort in life, and I wish to foster its first
							appearance in these children.—</p>
