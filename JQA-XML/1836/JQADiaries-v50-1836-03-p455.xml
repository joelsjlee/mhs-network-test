								>Midshipman Joseph H. Adams</persRef> at Norfolk, and <persRef
								ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef> Philadelphia At the
							House; found <persRef ref="peyton-balie">Balie Peyton</persRef> moving
							an Amendment of the Journal on the record of the vote of the House
							yesterday on the question whether <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> should be permitted to proceed—the Journal added,
								<hi rend="italic">in his Speech</hi> Peyton had moved to add the
							words “in order.” After an hour’s debate, he varied his motion,
							withdrawing the words in order and moving to strike out the words “in
							his Speech”—which was agreed to.— <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> moved the suspension of the Rules to receive
							Petition and Memorials; excluding the Motion yesterday offered by
								<persRef ref="patton-john">J. M Patton</persRef>—which was agreed
							to— The call began with Virginia— Wise presented a memorial from an
							individual citizen of the District of Columbia, against the Power of
							Congress in the District of Columbia to abolish Slavery— Wise moved its
							reference to <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">Pinckney’s</persRef> Select
							Committee with instructions to report that Congress have no power to
							abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia, or the Territories. The
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> decided that the motion
							was not in order from which Wise appealed—the previous question was
							called carried, and the decision was confirmed— I voted against the
							decision— Wise’s motion being to refer the memorial to the Select
							Committee with Instructions— Patton’s Motion yesterday was to refer the
							Resolutions to the Committee on the District of Columbia, with
							Instructions— I voted to sustain the decision of the Speaker that this
							was not in order. I asked permission of the House to give the reason of
							my different votes yesterday and this day, but objection was made, and I
							acquiesced— Wise then read with vehemence a Letter from the <persRef
								ref="tazewell-littleton">Governor of Virginia</persRef>, enclosing
							the Resolutions of <pb n="456" type="ms"/>the Legislature of Virginia,
							eight in number, concerning Slavery—the same yesterday offered by
							Patton— He was twice interrupted, by <persRef ref="brown-john7">John W.
								Brown</persRef>, and by <persRef ref="parks-gorham">Gorham
								Parks</persRef>, on points of order, which the Speaker decided in
							his favour. Wise after reading emphatically the Resolutions, said he
							would not present them, and turned off from his seat and went out of the
							house— The remainder of the day was consumed in receiving Petitions and
							Memorials— The States and Territories were gone through— <persRef
								ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis</persRef> told me the Story of what took
							place yesterday out of the House between Wise and the Speaker— He said
							the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="dorsey-roderick">Serjeant at Arms</persRef> were with the
							Speaker, and that Wise’s words were, <hi rend="italic">damn’d
								tyrant</hi>—as I heard them the word was <hi rend="italic"
								>coward</hi> but I may have misheard— Jarvis rode home with me.</p>

						<p>At the house, immediately after the reading of the Journal the <persRef

							that he be heard by himself on his Counsel— They were debated between
								<persRef ref="hard-gideon">Hard</persRef> of New-York, <persRef

							<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> and others—till the

							continue the discussion which was rejected by yeas and nays 66 to 133—
								<persRef ref="thomas-francis">F. Thomas</persRef> from the Committee
							on the Judiciary moved to suspend the rules, to offer reports, fixing
							the Northern boundary of the State of Ohio, and a Bill to admit the
							State of Michigan into the Union upon certain Conditions— This was
							carried and the Bill was read, and ordered to be printed— Then the
							New-York fire bill was resumed, and <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.
								Pearce</persRef> finished in an hour and a half against it—
							Altogether a very powerful Speech— He was followed by <persRef
								ref="lane-amos">Amos Lane</persRef> of Indiana, who after a Speech
							of 15 minutes moved the previous Question. There <pb n="457" type="ms"
							/>was a call of the House, which after going through about half the
							names, was suspended— There was a second to the putting of the Previous
							Question, counted by Tellers, but on the question whether the main
							question should now be put the vote was 90 to 110. and this put off the
							consideration of the bill for this day— Then the House went into

								Miller</persRef> in the Chair upon the Navy Appropriation Bill—
								<persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> of South

						<p><persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> called upon me
							this morning, and said there was a <persRef ref="schermerhorn-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Schermerhorn</persRef>, a Clergyman of
							New-York, who had been employed in some of the Negotiations with the
							Indians, and was quite intimate and confidential with <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>, and who had
							mentioned to him the wish that there should be some reconciliation
							between him and me— Everett did not understand that the President had
							spoken of it to Schermerhorn, but that he would speak of it to the
							President, if I was willing— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Everett to thank M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schermerhorn for his
							kind intentions but very explicitly to decline giving any authority from
							me to make an advance of any kind towards the President— That if ever
							any personal intercourse between him and me is to take place, which I
							neither expect nor desire, but would certainly not repel, it must come
							from him— He placed himself deliberately and wantonly in that position,
							when far from having ever given occasion for it, I had rendered him
							important service which he had personally acknowledged; and if he has
							any disposition to change it, he must change it himself.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Schermerhorn is an entire Stranger to me;
							and I cannot accept the intervention of any Stranger, while there are
							four heads of Departments with all of whom I am upon terms of social
							acquaintance, and through whom, if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> desires a
							reconciliation with me, he can make his wish known— I told him of the
							overture by <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef> in April 1832 and of that by
								<persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> in 1833—and of my
							reasons for declining both; which were that he had in the first place
							omitted to visit me, when he came here in February 1829. and while I was
							President; and secondly that he had in his inaugural address, made
							charges before the world against my administration of interfering with
							the freedom of Elections, and of wasteful extravagance requiring the
							searching process of reform <pb n="462" type="ms"/>which he could not
							then know to be true, and which he must now know to be false— He has
							done me wrong in the face of the world— Richard M. Johnson told me that
							his reason for not visiting me in February 1829 was because he had been
							made to believe that I had caused or countenanced the libellous
							newspaper publication about <persRef ref="jackson-rachel">his
								wife</persRef>— Johnson told me that the President <hi rend="italic"
								>then</hi>, in April 1832. was satisfied that he had been
							misinformed at the time when he had entertained those suspicions of me,
							and that I never had countenanced those publications He proposed to me
							that the President should give me an invitation to dinner, as a member
							of Congress— I said that would be a civility but no reparation— He asked
							if I would accept an invitation to a private and select party— I said
							there was the same objection to that— Johnson then asked me what I would
							wish— I said nothing— If the President was convinced he had wronged me,
							it was for him to make reparation as he thought fit— I asked nothing— If
							he was not so convinced, there was no basis for a restoration of social
							intercourse between us</p>

							Patent, for <persRef ref="patterson-william5">his brother</persRef> an
							Irishman belonging to Dublin— It is an invention for dying hides without

							Sterling has taken out Patents for all the British Dominions. I told him
							he must prepare a memorial to Congress setting forth the reasons which
							should induce them to grant a patent to a foreigner residing in a
							foreign country— Also from <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H.

							whether, a Bill had been reported for the admission of Arkansas into the

							the Western Boundary, as in the Bill to be reported, that it may not

						<p>I found the house taking the yeas and nays upon a question for a call of
							the house, I was too late in for my name to be taken. A quorum answered,
							and the vote against the call prevailed. The questions upon the

						<p>I rose between three and four O’Clock partly relieved from the

						<p>Cambreleng offered a Letter to be read, from Boston, purporting that the

								<persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> asked what question was

							for the reading of the Letters— I said if the Letter should be read it
							would be debatable and I should have some observations on it to make.

						<p>Precisely as the Hands of the Clock in the House of Representatives, were

								<persRef ref="calhoon-john">Calhoun</persRef> who was speaking
							enquired as a question of order; whether the House would continue in
							Session, on the Sabbath, there being no urgent necessity requiring it—
							The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef>, referring to two or
							three prior precedents of Sunday Morning Sessions—the first of which was
							at the Session of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress, decided
							that it was in order to continue in Session from which decision Lawler
							appealed and made a few remarks in support of his appeal— I immediately
							rose and said that approving entirely the appeal, but foreseeing that it
							might itself defeat the purpose of the mover by exciting a debate till
							the morning dawn, I should close the few remarks that I had to make,
							with a motion to adjourn. I then stated that in a case of urgent
							necessity, the house had frequently continued in Session, until the
							morning of the Sabbath; and that on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							of March 1805 both Houses of Congress had sitten the whole day, as
							numerous Statutes enacted and dated on that day would prove— But the
							rule was to adjourn from Saturday till Monday—the exception was to sit
							in cases of urgent necessity— This was not the present case, and if any
							motion to adjourn should fail I should ask the member from Alabama to
							reduce his appeal to writing, with the express negation of a necessity
							for sitting. My motion to adjourn failed by a vote of 83 to 95—upon
							which Lawler reduced his appeal to writing as I had desired. He was
							proceeding to speak on his appeal, when <persRef ref="hawes-albert"
								>Hawes</persRef> moved to lay the Appeal on the table; but the
							Speaker said Lawler had the floor— As soon as he finished I objected to

							that it being Sunday I should hold myself bound, by none of the rules of
							the House unless and until there should be a positive vote of a majority
							of the House of the necessity for a Sunday Session; and that I hoped
							there would be a sufficient number of the minority of my opinion to
							leave the majority without a Quorum— The hint was taken, and on the
							second for the previous Question, by <pb n="486" type="ms"/>Tellers
							there were 93 in favour and only 19. against taking the main question— A
							motion was then made to adjourn and the yeas and nays were called. My
							name was twice called and I did not answer— Several of the subsequent
							names were called and answered: when <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> rose and stated that I was in my Seat, and had not
							answered— The Speaker read the rule requiring every member present to
							vote upon every question unless excused by the House, but said that the
							time for requiring my vote was when my name was called, and that others
							having been called since, the time for making the question had passed
							away— Wise renewed his remark when his own name was called— Hawes moved
							that I should be excused from voting; but I said I did not ask to be
							excused—that it being the Sabbath day, and there being no urgent
							necessity for the Session of the House, I did not hold myself bound by
							the rules of the House, the rule of usage being that unless for business
							of urgent necessity the House do not sit on Sunday’s. Hawes withdrew his
							motion— Wise insisted upon his objection— <persRef
								ref="beardsley-samuel">Beardsley</persRef> renewed the motion that I
							should be excused on the ground of consciencious scruples— I disclaimed
							this motive and said I would sit and vote till another midnight, if by
							an explicit vote of the house it should be declared a necessity for
							sitting on Sunday— Beardsley finally withdrew his motion. <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> moved that I should not be
							required to vote— Wise moved that I should be compelled to vote—
								<persRef ref="peyton-balie">Balie Peyton</persRef>, Wise and
								<persRef ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> made fiery Speeches and
							it came to a furious personal quarrel, and shaking of fists and d—d
							rascals and scoundrels, and puppies passed between them— Then Mercer
							commenced his part as Peacemaker, and after much coaxing and intreaty
							Bynum and Wise with not absolute good grace pledged themselves not to
							pursue the quarrel further— It was finally agreed to resume the Subject
							Monday and Tuesday, and the House at half past four A.M. adjourned.
								<persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis</persRef> and <persRef
