                            One of his purposes is to visit his native Country of Piedmont— At the

                            presented a Memorial from numerous inhabitants of parts of Alabama,
                            calling for a Legislative investigation of land jobbing frauds which
                            they alledge to be cause of the Indian War, with which they are
                            desolated— It gave rise to a warm and sharp debate— Lewis first proposed
                            to refer the memorial to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"

                            reference to the President, which I strenuously opposed and had a keen

                            said that all Legislative investigations were humbugs— I spoke till the
                            recess. In the evening, after much manoeuvering Ripley’s Amendment
                            referring the whole subject was carried by a vote of 95 to 91. Wise and
                                <persRef ref="peyton-balie">Peyton</persRef> made long and very
                            teizing Speeches. Private Bills were taken up about 9 in the Evening,
                            and about half past one of the morning between 50 and 60 of them were
                            carried through—less than 60 members being in the House. <persRef

                                Madison</persRef> a mistake had been made in her name— But the
                            mistake was only in the newspaper report and not in the Bill— I called
                            at the Bank of the Metropolis, and received the Speakers check for 588
                            dollars in 1/2 Eagles and 6 half dollars— Settled Bills at <persRef

                            of Members of Congress made a report in part—much suspicion, but no
                            proof—and above all no names mentioned— The Committee asked an increase
                            of their numbers to nine—and leave to sit during the recess— Hunt made a
                            short Speech, but a motion to lay the Report on the table was carried by
                            a vote of 98 to 71. but the report was ordered to be printed— The House
                            went into Committee of the whole <persRef ref="mason-john5">John Y.

                            Department building, the unfinished business of the Committee of the
                            whole at the adjournment on Thursday— But the Chairman, said as no new
                            Bill could be sent to the Senate on the last three days of the Session,
                            that Bill had lost its place in the orders of the day— The Bill from the
                            Senate for reorganizing the general Land-Office was taken up and debated
                            till the recess.</p>
                        <p>The Evening was occupied much as usual on the last Night of a Session— A
                            multitude of Bills were passed as fast as they could be muttered over by
                            the Clerks— The Senate Bills were hurried through the Committee of the
                            whole, engrossment and passage, with extreme impatience of the House at
                            any proposal of amendment—the Treasury building Bill, the reorganization
                            of the Land Office and Patent Office, and several other Bills which it
                            had been impossible to get up separately were now crowded down as
                            amendments to a supplementary general Appropriation Bill— I made a
                            question upon a manifestly erroneous decision of John Y. Mason as
                            chairman of the Committee of the whole, but was voted down
                            unanimously.</p>

                            morning— About two O’Clock, <persRef ref="sutherland-joel"
                                >Sutherland</persRef> being Chairman of the Committee of the whole
                            on the state of the Union, and a Bill to increase the number of the
                            Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States forced into Committee
                            upon two successive counts by Tellers there was found no Quorum—
                                <persRef ref="everett-horace">H. Everett</persRef> moved that the

                            Parliamentary rule— But Sutherland persisted in attempting to count the
                            members present; upon which <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
                                Williams</persRef> of Kentucky said he called the chairman to order—
                            Sutherland ordered him to take his Seat, which he refused and ordered
                            the Chairman to take his Seat— Upon this loud to deafening cries of
                            order rung through the Hall, and Williams in fury howled defiance to the
                            Chairman and to the House.— Sutherland immediately sent for the <persRef
                                ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef>, who took the Chair, and
                            Sutherland reported the fact that Williams upon being called to order by
                            him had set him at defiance, upon which he had of course left the Chair—
                            Polk the Speaker, whimpered about the novelty, the delicacy and the
                            difficulty of the case, and asked Sutherland to resume the Chair which
                            he peremptorily refused unless Williams should apologize— After much
                            negotiation with Williams to get an explanation from him; he persisting
                            in his offence <persRef ref="pearce-james">Pearce</persRef> of Maryland
                            offered a Resolution of direct censure upon Williams which passed by a
                            vote almost unanimous— Sutherland then resumed the Chair—several Bills
                            passed in Committee and through the House, which at 40 minutes past 4.
                            adjourned till 8. O’Clock to-morrow Morning— <persRef

                        <p>Independence day.</p>
                        <p>The House met at 8 O’Clock. A.M. A large Quorum<space/>Members present. I
                            found the House in Session— Motions to suspend the 17<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> joint Rule, that no Bill shall be sent
                            to the President for his signature on the last day of the Session— There
                            were four Bills which passed the House yesterday morning; after the
                            Senate had adjourned— Suspension moved for those 4 Bills— Then <persRef
                                ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> moved to add three or four
                            others, not finally acted upon by the House—among the rest the Bill for
                            increasing the number of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United
                            States. This gave rise to debate which continued till near Noon I asked
                            twice for a division of the Question, which the <persRef
                                ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> decided against me, and the House
                            sustained him He cited a Precedent of 1830. though a more recent
                            decision of the House had reversed the decision to which he referred—
                            The Senate however concurred only with the Resolution upon the Bills
                            which had passed both Houses— <persRef ref="mason-john5">John Y.
                                Mason</persRef> from the Committee of Foreign Relations made a
                            Report on the Affairs of Texas, concluding with two Resolutions like
                            those of the Senate— I moved to lay them on the Table; stating that I
                            had many objections against them which there was now no time for me to
                            detail. The house refused to lay the Resolutions on the Table— <persRef
                                ref="peyton-balie">Balie Peyton</persRef> moved the previous
                            question upon the Resolutions and it was carried— I asked a division,

                            Resolution separately— They were carried by votes of 136 to 20 and 22.

                                >Sutherland</persRef> however declared himself satisfied— Soon after
                            2. O’Clock the Speaker adjourned the House to the first Monday in
                            December I spent half an hour in the chamber of the Committee of
                            Manufactures—near an hour in the Library, and came home worn out and
                            exhausted about 4. P.M— In the afternoon, and Evening, I had a visit to

                        <p>At 6. O’Clock this morning we embarked in the Steamer George Washington,
                            Captain<space/>My Umbrella was left behind at <persRef

                            it— Our baggage was under his charge, and had been laden with other
                            baggage in a horse waggon at the Hotel— The Steamer was crowded with
                            upwards of 400 passengers— When Grimes came down to the wharf the
                            baggage waggon was partly unladen, and deposited in the large common
                            waggon Car in the Steamer. <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef>
                            with the Horses was on the wharf but the boat was so crowded that he
                            could not get with them on board— The day was one of the hottest of the
                            Summer, with a clear bright burning Sun—it was past 11. when we reached
                            Frenchtown— The cars there were delayed more than half an hour, in
                            stowing the excessive quantity of baggage— At half past twelve we
                            reached Newcastle and embarked in the Steamer Ohio <persRef ref="u"

                            was missing— We drove first to the Marshall Hotel in Chesnut Street— All
                            full— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>recommended to us a <persRef

                            States Hotel— Not a square inch of space for lodgings any where— M<hi

                            Baltimore, to have search made for my trunk— There were several fellow

                            my order, and thus not liable to be lost in the conveyance. And this
                            incident, the loss of my trunk has painfully proved how excessively
                            dangerous it is to carry any thing of much value with you in this

                        <p>The four persons first named came this morning as Committees— 1. Of the
                            Pennsylvania Society for promoting the abolition of Slavery. 2. Of the
                            Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society with votes of thanks to me and to the
                            other members of Congress who at the late Session of Congress opposed
                            the influence of the Slavery predominant party in that body. I desired
                            them to return my thanks to the respective Societies for the honour they
                            had done me by these Resolutions and to assure them of the grateful
                            sentiments with which I received them— One of the Resolutions contained
                            also an invitation of attendance at a public meeting, which I declined;
                            and I gave them a full and candid exposition of my own principles and
                            views with regard to the Institution of Domestic Slavery differing from
                            theirs under a sense of the compact and compromise in the Constitution
                            of the United States— I declined attendance at any public meeting of the
                            Societies, and said I believed the cause itself would be more benefited
                            by such Service as I could render to it, in the discharge of my duty in
                            Congress than by giving notoriety to any action on my part in support of
                            the Societies, or in connection with them— They acquiesced in these
                            determinations, and declared themselves well satisfied with the result

                        <p><date>10. V:30. </date>Sunday— Return to Philadelphia.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after rising this morning I bathed, and swam about five
                            minutes in the Delaware river fronting the House— The tide was out and
                            the water low— There was a bathing House, but no water under it— After
                            breakfast I walked with <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle</persRef> round his grounds— He
                            has recently enlarged the House, and given it a front looking upon the
                            river, with a Piazza, supported by columns, a fac-simile of the Temple
                            of <persRef ref="theseus">Theseus</persRef>— There is a front parlour
                            and drawing room opening to each other, and a dining room at the back of
                            them on the ground floor, and the floor above is laid out in eight or
                            ten bed-chambers, two fronting on the river, and with a common entry to
                            them all— A choice library of English, French and classical Literature
                            is in the Parlour on the ground floor— The grounds round the house, are
                            chiefly covered with a forest of Oak and Ash, and Beech and Pine and
                            other antient trees; but at about a furlong’s distance from the
                            house—two green-houses each 200 feet long have just been built, for the
                            cultivation of grapes, and are already stocked with three rows of
                            Vines—Black-Hamburg, Muscat-Lunel Sweet waters and many others— There is
                            also a small vineyard of one or two acres in the open air— The remnant
                            of an antient dwelling house is yet to be removed—and other fruits than
                            the grape are yet to be raised and cultivated. There is a Summer house,
                            and billiard room close upon the border of the river; but no fruit or
                            flower garden yet inviting observation— After the morning excursion and
                            visiting the children at <unclear>dump?</unclear>-castle, I amused the
                            leisure of the day with <persRef ref="woodfall-henry"
                                >Woodfall’s</persRef> Junius, and the volume identifying Junius with

                            dinner time; after which I returned with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Biddle to Philadelphia— At the Inn at Frankford where we stop’d to water
                            the Horse there was a notice posted up inviting the inhabitants of
                            Frankford to a public meeting, for the purpose of forming a
                            philosophical Society, and requesting a general attendance— It was dated
                            8. April 1836. and gave rise to reflections between M<hi

                            heretofore the Editor of the Genius of Universal emancipation; and has
                            now the intention of commencing the publication of a Newspaper devoted
                            like that to the extinguishment of Slavery— A cause which within the
                            last two or three years has fallen into great discouragement— He
                            solicited assistance from me, for the matter of his proposed publication
                            but I thought best not to give him any expectation of it— <persRef

                            which the only exceptionable part was the undue proportion of the

                                Biddle</persRef> walked with me to the Chesnut Street wharf, where I
                            embarked in the Steamer New-Philadelphia, in which there were from three
                            to four hundred passengers, with not one of whom I was personally
                            acquainted. We found there <persRef ref="lundy-benjamin">Benjamin
                                Lundy</persRef> of whom and of my friend Biddle I soon took leave—
                            At five minutes after six we departed from the wharf and after
                                <unclear>an</unclear> solitary navigation of nearly three hours I
                            landed and took the Rail-road car at Bordentown— I marked the Castle of
                            Andalusia, as we glided by it upon the river— In the Car from Bordentown
                            to Amboy, there was a man apparently from the Eastern shore of Maryland
                            with three women who called him uncle— Middle-aged women; but they
                            reminded me of the weird Sisters, and I could not muster courage to
                            speak to either of them There were two other men in the same compartment
                            of the Car, but silence was the order of the day till shortly before
                            noon when we reached Amboy, and entered once more a Steamer. Here I
                            found <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> with my horses— He
                            came down the Delaware yesterday morning; but from Bordentown to Amboy
                            came on with the horses themselves and not upon the Rail-way Cars. With
                            them he could not keep pace—and was therefore obliged to wait at Amboy
                            for this days boat— We landed at New-York soon after two-O’Clock, and
                            after finding the Steamer Boston high up the North river at the foot of
                            Chambers-Street and that she was to depart at five for Providence, I
                            strolled into the City and viewed the Astor House now finished, and the
                            quarter of the city destroyed last Winter by fire, one half of which is
                            nearly rebuilt I returned to the Boat— One of the <persRef ref="u"

                                Sullivan</persRef> accosted me in the Street, and said his father
                            wished to know where I lodged to call upon me— I told him it would give
                            me great pleasure to see him, but that I was proceeding immediately home
                            without stopping at New-York at all— On my return to the boat after a
                            shower I found that Wilson could not get the horses taken on board and
                            must wait to go on to-morrow. <persRef

                        <p><date>13. V. </date>Wednesday— From Watch-Hill Light to Providence,
                            Boston— Quincy—</p>
                        <p>The Steamer Boston, <persRef ref="u">Captain Toucey</persRef> is the
                            smallest of those on the line between New-York and Providence— There was
                            through the Night a fresh eastern breeze, but the Sea was smooth, and I
                            slept till near five O’Clock, when the Ocean swell of the Eastern side
                            of Fisher’s Island awoke me, and on rising I found the boat, with the
                            Watch hill light in view a fresh Eastern wind calling for a cloak and a
                            thickening fog— Most of the Passengers Sea-sick— With some delay and
                            repeatedly laying to, we came round Point Judith between 7 and 8
                            O’Clock—landed several passengers and took in others at Newport about 9.
                            Among those who landed was <persRef ref="amory-jonathan2">M<hi

                            his father in Law, and his family— I saw upon the wharf <persRef

                                Apthorp</persRef> and marked the contrast of 25 and 70.— We landed
                            at Providence just before Noon, and immediately entered the Railway Cars
                            for Boston— There we alighted at twenty minutes past two; traveling
                            steadily at the rate of twenty-four miles an hour; or two minutes and a
                            half to a mile— The distance marked by mile-posts is forty-one miles,
                            and they stop the train twice at 11 and 13 miles distance, about five
                            minutes <hi rend="strikethrough">distance</hi> each time. I marked the
                            last run of 14 miles by my watch, and they were traversed in 35 minutes—
                            I had my baggage taken immediately taken to the Quincy Stage-house in
                            Elm-Street; went to my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
                                >Charles’s</persRef> House, and saw his three children, <persRef

                            and <persRef ref="catherine2">Catherine</persRef>— My Son Charles and

                            excursion to Niagara Falls— I returned at half-past four O’Clock to
                                <unclear>Elm</unclear> Street, and with <persRef ref="gillet-simon"
                                >Gillett’s</persRef> Stage came out to Quincy, and alighted before
                            six O’Clock at my own house; finding all <persRef

                            and well, and my Cousin <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa-Catherine

                            the dining room— The family reached home all safe on Saturday.— I
                            visited my Garden, and Nursery before dark, and found them in tolerable

                        <p>I received on my arrival last Evening a letter of notification from
                                <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> that there
                            would be to morrow a meeting of the Committee of the Overseers of the

                            received a Letter from <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Samuel T.

                                >children</persRef>, and returned home before dinner— I visited
                            again my garden and Nursery, and found my seedling trees in very
                            unpromising condition— Not a single peach on any one tree— Not one
                            Apricot or Nectarine. Not a cherry—Plums only upon one tree in the
                            Garden— Two of the finest young Apple-trees which I had planted,
                            procured in 1830 at Medford, are completely girdled about a foot above
                            ground, by field mice under the Snow, in the winter. They are in full
                            leaf now, flourishing apparently as if nothing had happened to them; but
                                <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price Greenleaf</persRef> says they
                            will never bear another leaf after this year— The maple seedlings of
                            which I brought the seeds from Philadelphia last year are looking well,
                            the most thrifty of them being however strip’d of its growth of leaves
                            of this Season by the beetle bug— Of my last year’s plantation of Seeds
                            and Stones a very small part have come up, and the Season has been very
                            unfavourable to their growth— My plantation dream is over, and I have
                            learnt nothing, but the disappointments in which all such dreams must
                                terminate—<persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi

                            manner which deeply affected me— Miss Quincy had also a copy of my

                            with half the paraphrase of the ode to <persRef

                            thought proper to call upon me I would readily undertake it— He said he
                            would propose it to the City Government next week; and would see me
                            again concerning it— I came home about 7. O’Clock <persRef

                        <p>My daily occupations here are altogether different from those which
                            consume the time at Washington— They are here to a considerable extent
                            voluntary, and in some former years I have allowed too much of the day
                            to be wasted in frivolous employment— To the Garden and Nursery I must
                            devote fewer hours than heretofore; satisfied as I am that I can
                            discover nothing new in the Science of plantation, and that I have
                            seedlings enough, of which to observe the growth and decay for the
                            remainder of my days. I visited my garden and Nursery, morning and
                            afternoon, and pruned some of my trees; observing the rapid growth of my
                            seedling elms, and the slow growth of all but the English Oaks; and
                            especially that of all transplanted trees. Morning visit from <persRef

                                >President Quincy</persRef>, and his Son, <persRef

                            Armstrong gave me a pamphlet upon the introduction of soft water into
                            Boston; and I gave him copies of my Oration upon the 4<hi

                            upon <persRef ref="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef>— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong said he had mentioned to several
                            persons the proposal for an Oration in honour of <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>, which
                            all had approved— That he would propose it to the board of Aldermen next
                            Monday, and that there would be a Meeting of the Common Council, the
                            next or succeeding day— He supposed a Committee would be appointed to
                            come in person, and invite me to deliver this Oration; which I think it
                            advisable to await— I brought up these minutes of my diary, and read a
                            few pages of the History of Texas— In the evening, I went to <persRef

                            15.46. “Howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which
                            is natural; and afterwards that which is spiritual.”— This 15<hi

                            Corinthians is a deep study for a sincere and reflecting Christian—
                                <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>
                            answers the enquirer how the dead shall be raised, and with what bodies
                            they shall come, first by calling him a fool—why does he call him a
                            fool? Was it not because he could not answer it? He then however
                            attempts to answer it by marking the distinction between matter and
                            Spirit, and by the analogy of vegetation from the seed— But if matter
                            and Spirit are existences distinct and independent of each other what
                            analogy can there be between them; and if the resurrection of the body
                            is analogous to the growth of the plant from the seed, where is the
                            seminal principle in the dead body, which shall rise incorruptible and
                            immortal? The analogy between vegetable and animal nature is in the
                            power of reproduction, and not of regeneration— The plant produced from
                            the seed is not immortal; nor is it more glorious than the seed itself—
                            It bears within itself the seed of reproduction; and thus perpetuates
                            the race, while the individual is perishable— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lunt’s text says that the spiritual comes after the
                            natural—and this starts another perplexing question which perhaps it
                            were equally foolish to ask, since inspiration itself has not thought
                            proper to answer it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon
                            discourse was from Matthew 26:11. [“]For ye have the poor always with

                                >Saurin</persRef>, upon the ministry of the Angels— The text is from
                            Hebrews 1.7. which is a quotation from Psalm 104.4. Saurin gives the
                            text, he makes the winds his angels, and that flame of fire his
                            ministers— The English Translation has it who maketh his angels Spirits,
                            and his ministers a flame of fire— Cherubim therefore are only
                            personifications of Wind; and Seraphim of fire—and these are the Angels
                            or Ministers of God— Saurin says there are two Classes of Spirits—Angels
                            and Demons, and two corresponding classes of men, all belonging to the
                            one or the other.— I went this Evening to visit <persRef

                            several days before we left there to endeavour to obtain a
                            re-instatement there. He did not let me know that he was there, but went

                            from his post, being then under censure, for a similar violation of the

                        <p>And how my way of life is changed! <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E.
                                Price Greenleaf</persRef> came this morning and I walked with him to
                            the Mount Wollaston farm— The Orchard, planted in November 1830. makes
                            but a poor appearance— The border of forest trees round it, Oaks,
                            Chesnuts and Shag-bark Walnuts is far more promising— The nuts and
                            acorns were all planted by myself or in my presence— Nothing has been
                            done to favour their growth or for their preservation since, and from
                            those nuts and acorns there are not less than six hundred trees growing,
                            with roots which have been six years piercing and taking hold of the
                            soil— Most of them however have year after year died down to the surface
                            of the earth in winter, and then thrown up several shoots; without
                            forming one durable stem— The fourth side of the border, where none of
                            my former seedlings had survived was replanted last Autumn, with
                            Shag-bark nuts and Ash seeds, many of which have come up— A number of
                            Elms, transplanted from my Nursery have taken root, and put forth
                            leaves; but every one of the English Oaks, has died down to the ground—
                            Three or four of them have thrown out new shoots which may yet live.—
                            The greater part of the Baldwin Apple-trees are dying, or make no
                            progress— After viewing the whole border round, I returned home to
                            dinner— <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>
                            dined with us— <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"

                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hallett</persRef> came out from
                            Boston after dinner and took tea here— We had some conversation upon
                            political affairs, but there is a flat calm in the political world at
                            this moment— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C Smith</persRef>, and
                                <persRef ref="greenleaf-mary2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary
                                Dawes</persRef> were here after tea, and <persRef

                                Miller</persRef> in the Evening— And thus the whole day was absorbed
                            by my visit to Mount Wollaston, and by company leaving me scarcely an
                            hour for reading or writing— I however heard the <persRef
                                ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">children</persRef> read, and after nine in the
                            Evening wrote the Journal of yesterday— My library presents me perpetual
                            temptations to desultory reading, a few pages in one book, and a few
                            pages in another, of which memory can now retain little or nothing. I
                            have taken for the moment to the Journal of the first Congress of our
                            Revolution in September 1774. where I find matter for meditation.</p>

                        <p>A man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Le Brun</persRef> came with a
                            Letter of introduction dated at Portland, Maine, from <persRef
                                ref="smith-francis">F. O. J. Smith</persRef>, the member of the
                            House of Representatives of the U.S. from that District— The Letter
                            spelt his name Le Bron, and he told me he was so called because the
                            Americans could not pronounce his name with the French sound of Le Brun.
                            But his object was to tell me that he had invented a composition
                            material for building dwelling Houses, incomparably superior to Wood,
                            Brick or Stone; much cheaper, and durable to the end of Time— And that
                            he had petitioned Congress at their last Session, to purchase of him the
                            secret of this invention— That his Petition, M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Smith told him had been referred to a Committee of which I
                            was chairman, and which had not reported— I told him this was a mistake—
                            That I had never heard of his Petition, and that if referred to a
                            Committee it might have been to the one of which <persRef

                                Parks</persRef> was Chairman— But that Congress never purchased
                            inventions, and his best way to make his invention profitable to himself
                            would be to take out a patent for it. This he said he would not do, but
                            he argued the duty of Congress to purchase an invention of such
                            unparalleled usefulness— I did not reply to his argument, but assured
                            him that it would not avail in Congress, and he took his leave— <persRef

                            plantations they still bear no fruit— There are this year neither

                            out with him, but they are both much delighted with their tour— After

                            Felt especially has very much changed. Towards Evening <persRef

                            which I experience every hour of the day. I went again in search of the
                            trial of <persRef ref="zenger-john">John Peter Zenger</persRef> for a
                            libel in 1738. and found an account of it in the continuation of

                            presented to me two years ago, part of the five volumes of transactions
                            of the New-York Historical Society— I think this was the first occasion
                            of a trial for libel, in which the principle was maintained as a point
                            of defence that the truth could be shewn in justification of the
                            libellous charge— I fell also in search of facts relating to the life of

                            commandments.”— There was some explanation of the sense, in which God is
                            said to be a jealous God; and also of the visitation of the iniquity of
                            the fathers upon the children—an opposite promise being contained the
