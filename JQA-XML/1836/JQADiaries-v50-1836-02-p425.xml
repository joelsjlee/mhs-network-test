                        <p>Call at the Hall of the Senate, and requested the Papers in the Case of
                                <persRef ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer Lobdell</persRef>— <persRef

                            promised to have them taken from the files of the Senate, and sent to
                            the House, which he afterwards did. At the House, immediately after the
                            reading of the Journal, <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">H. L.
                                Pinckney</persRef> asked the consent of the House to offer his
                            Slavery Committee for the abolition of Petitions— Objection made—
                            Pinckney moved the suspension of the Rule; carried<space/>He made a
                            short speech, in support of his Resolution, and complained of a violent
                            attack upon him in the Telegraph— He was answered vehemently by <persRef
                                ref="hammond-james">Hammond</persRef> of South-Carolina— Then came a
                            motion for the previous question, seconded, then a motion for a Call of
                            the House, not sustained—and the previous question carried— After which
                                <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> of Ohio moved that the
                            Resolution should be divided into three questions which gave rise to
                            much debate on points of order—and two appeals from decisions of the
                            Chair both of which were confirmed— Four questions were taken by yeas
                            and nays on parcels of the Resolution, all carried by large Majorities—
                                <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> refused to vote upon one

                            was excused— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef>, asked
                            leave to enter a Protest against part of the Resolution but he was not
                            permitted.</p>
                        <p>A Message from the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>
                            informed the House that the Government of Great Britain had offered its
                            Mediation, in the dispute with France, and that it had been
                            accepted—referred to the Committee of Foreign Relations— Adjourned after
                            5. O’Clock— Weather moderated—</p>

                        <p>There was rain in the night, and then a brisk Northwester which spread a
                            sheet of glass on the ground and made it impossible almost to walk— I
                            attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church where <persRef

                            read Prayers for Quinquagesima Sunday and preached from Proverbs 1.22.
                            “How long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity? and the scorners
                            delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge.” As I was coming
                            out of Church, <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> told me that a Messenger had this
                            morning arrived with despatches, and information that the dispute with
                            France was settled— That the Government of France, without waiting for
                            the result of the Mediation had given notice that they would at once pay
                            the money— <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.

                            be doubted. I received a second singular Letter from <persRef

                            which I had promised him, and which I gave him— At the House several
                            motions were made to dispense with the reading of the Journal, but
                            without success— After the reading of the Journal, <persRef

                            asked the permission of the House, to make a statement; upon which
                            objection being made, he moved and carried the suspension; and made his
                            Statement, which was an attack upon him in a New-Hampshire Newspaper,
                            for an assertion made by him at an early day of the Session that not one
                            person in 500 in New-Hampshire was in favour of the abolition of
                            Slavery—which had been read by <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi

                            that the question was debatable—upon which Wise commenced a furious

                                Pinckney’s</persRef> Resolution, said he hissed him as a Deserter

                            called to order and a snarling debate of two hours followed— It was
                            finally decided by yeas and nays— That he was out of order—and then a
                            motion was made that he should have permission to proceed which was
                            granted 111. to 92. Then <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef>
                            made a point of order; whether after the adoption of the Resolution of

                            order— This started a new debate which continued till 4. O’Clock, when
                            the house adjourned— I took <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard"

                            should stand as the sense of the house, and decided that it should— I
                            voted against it 159 to 42. Then Hawes declared his acquiesced in the

                        <p>At the House, immediately after the reading of the Journal, two Messages
                            were received from the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
                            >President</persRef>— The first was announcing the settlement of the
                            controversy with France, with the Correspondence containing the
                            Mediation of Great Britain, and recommending large Appropriations for
                            placing the Country in a state of defence, closing with a quotation from
                                <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington’s</persRef> farewell
                            Address— Motion was made to lay the Message on the table—and print— I
                            moved a reconsideration of the vote to lay on the table which passed,
                            and that it should be referred to the Committee of foreign Relations,
                            which was agreed to— Then motion to print 10,000 and 25000 copies—the
                                <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> decided that this motion
                            must lay over a day— Motion to suspend the rules, to take the question
                            this day—carried— Objection made— I supported the motion to print an
                            extra number of the Message. <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef>
                            moved 40000—not carried—25000 was carried— The other Message was an
                            answer to a call for French Documents laid on the table— The Speaker
                            then called for Reports from Standing Committees— I enquired whether it
                            was not Petition day— The Speaker said Monday was Petition day— I
                            appealed to the Rule that Petitions should be received on the first day
                            of the Meeting of the House in each week. He found on referring to the
                            rule that it was so and acquiesce<unclear>d.</unclear> Petitions were
                            called— Several Petitions from Massachuset<unclear>ts</unclear> Members
                            were received— I presented one from <persRef ref="callender-william">W.

                                Michillimakin<unclear>ac</unclear> referred to the same Committee—
                            Then a Petition from Cayuga County New-York, for the abolition of
                            Slavery in the District of Columbia, which started again the Slavery
                            debate which occupied the remainder of the day—</p>

                            The Speaker decided in favour of acting— Patton made a Speech in favour

                            stooped down and looked into his face, holding up his right hand and
                            pointing his finger to him, and said “I want to say to you that you are
                            a damn’d coward—now take that insult, and pocket it.” I think he added—

                            on to the Speaker’s Chamber, without noticing Wise, or turning to the
                            right hand; or the left— There were several persons within hearing but I

                            made a furious one, till he was ordered to sit down by the Speaker—
