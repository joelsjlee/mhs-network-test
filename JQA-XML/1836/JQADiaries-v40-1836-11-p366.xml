						<p>I executed with <persRef ref="carr-john2">John J. Carr</persRef>, the
							lease of my homestead farm for five years from the first of April next;
							but he is to quit the farm house, and is now building a house for him
							self, at the corner of the road leading to the Meeting House— My Son

								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="adams-john17;adams-louisa3;adams-charles7">his three
								children</persRef>, and the Nursery maid <persRef ref="catherine2"
								>Catherine</persRef><space/>left us this morning and returned to
							Boston— They have been residing with us from the first of August, and
							have made our house so lively and pleasant that it seems as scarcely a
							week since they came— The summer has flown away as by enchantment; not I
							hope without my deep gratitude— Morning visit to take leave, from
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef>— The Weather continues clear and dry, but cold as
							December, and I find myself constantly baffled with my plantations—
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> went this afternoon to fish for smelts,
							and took the <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna;adams-mary4">two
								children</persRef> with her, but had no success. The coloured man
							servant who came with us from Washington, <persRef ref="u"
								>Graymes</persRef> has been several times very ill, and confined to
							his bed within the last fortnight; he was taken this Evening suddenly
							with so violent a pain in the foot, that we sent for <persRef
								ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef>, who came at nearly ten O’Clock— He thinks the
							disease inflammatory rhumatism— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef> was here this Evening.
								<persRef ref="beale-george2">His Son</persRef> and his daughter
								<persRef ref="beale-ann">Ann</persRef> are both quite ill— A young
							man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Ridout</persRef> came and asked my
							permission to take away the Stumps from my Pine Hill woodland, for fuel—
							I at first refused him the permission; but he said that when the house
							was on fire in 1821. he and <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> had
							both assisted to extinguish it, and had stood a long time in the water
							at the pond,—that he had now <persRef ref="u">a wife</persRef> and
							children to support and had been afflicted with sickness in his family—
							That the price of wood was distressingly high and he knew not how to get
							it, I told him he might take the Stumps on condition that he should take
							nothing else, which he faithfully promised. He promised also to notify
								<persRef ref="spear-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Spear</persRef> when he should take the Stumps away and of the
							quantity that he takes— <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi></persRef> was here too this evening; about a settlement
							of his account for building the House at Mount Wollaston; but I was not
							ready for him— I paid however <persRef ref="whiting-edwin"
								>Whiting</persRef> the Mason’s bill for work done at this house.</p>

							Pinehill sold some days since by <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter

							sold first the wood standing on the lot, and then the lot itself, which
							was boughten by Copland for 26. dollars and a half an Acre— Copland
							offers it now to me at that price, and I told Spear I would take it, if
							Copland would take my note, payable the first of next May, without
							interest in payment— <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef>
							was here yesterday and paid me 118 dollars 75 Cents, for one fourth part
							of the contract for the standing wood on the <persRef
								ref="verchild-francis">Verchild</persRef> and <persRef

								<persRef ref="thayer-gideon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gideon
								Thayer</persRef> of Braintree wished for permission to split a rock
							there, experimentally— I told him that I should refer M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer and all other persons proposing to
							split rocks upon my lands to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>, for all agreements on that subject.— Field told me
							that he and <persRef ref="adams-thomas8">Thomas Adams jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> had made each 900 dollars,
							by their speculation in <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel"
								>Bracketts</persRef> Estate along the line of the Canal, which they
							have laid out in House-lots, and lots for wharfage— I went to the Bank,
							and made there a <pb n="367" type="ms"/>a deposit, and an exchange of
							large for small bills.— I next went in to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bracketts, and he witnessed the execution, and took the acknowledgment
							of the Assignment of my pew N. 61. in the Stone Temple to my Son
							Charles. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brackett had a Barometer and
							Thermometer hanging in his parlour— He told me the Barometer had fallen
							nearly a quarter of an inch since Sunrise, which portended a
							considerable change of the weather— It was already clouding up, after
							about ten days of a crystal clear sky and nightly severe frosts.—
							Returning home, I came round, by the quarries at which <persRef
								ref="hardwick-john">John Hardwick’s</persRef> men, and <persRef
								ref="colburn-asa">Colburn</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dutton-benjamin">Dutton</persRef> were at work. I gathered a
							few farm walnuts; none of which however have ripened; and a few red
							wedge, and Russet Apples, yet hanging on the trees, and upon which I
							intend to make the experiment of planting from the seed— Both crabs; but
							sound fruit, almost entirely free from worms; and stocked with very good
							looking seeds— After dinner I planted in plat 1. of the Seminary new
							row, several red wedge Apple and farm wilding Pear seeds; wild plum
							Stones and farm walnuts— The storm came on in the Evening—Wind—rain and
							Sleet.— I packed up with <persRef ref="wilson-john8">John
								Wilson</persRef>, a trunk full of old documents to be sent to
							Washington.</p>

						<p>Storm all night and the whole of this day with alternation of Sleet, rain

							all day to the house; and yet idled away my time, chiefly in directing
							copies of the Eulogy on <persRef ref="madison-james">James

							received a Letter from <persRef ref="southworth-sylvester">S. S.

							best representatives of the class of political writers for hire in this
							Country. He has been one of the most virulent lampooners upon me of the
							whole tribe, and has written me many Letters full of kindness and
							veneration— From his Letter now, I conclude that he is going to
							Washington to correspond with the Publishers of Newspapers throughout

							disinterested man in the market— Webster probably cannot afford to pay
							for his lucubrations now. </p>

								>Charles</persRef> came out from Boston, dined with us, and returned
							immediately after dinner— Our departure for Washington is now so near at

							correspondence and the regular record of my Diary; and there are
							circumstances which are peculiarly disturbing to me at this time—
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> had at first fixed upon this day for
							our departure, which I would gladly have postponed three weeks longer—
							The weather for the last fortnight has been so continuously cold and
							wintery, that it has allowed me no plea for protracting the Journey, and
							our household Servant man, <persRef ref="u">Graymes</persRef> disabled
							by inflammatory rhumatism, has been much more burdensome than helpful to
							us.— Our departure is now projected for next Monday— The morning was so
							frosty that after making my fire, I could not Journalize, and I read a
							chapter of <persRef ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin
								Constant’s</persRef> third Volume on Religion. I was the whole
							Morning, planting, brown sugar Pear Cores—Sundry Apple seeds, and <pb
								n="368" type="ms"/>wild plums, and walnuts on the plats surrounding
							eight young seedling fruit-trees, transplanted from my garden and
							Nursery into the Seminary— In the last three years I have laid out four
							of those rows; each of 8 transplanted seedling fruit trees— In the plats
							round the trees I sow seeds and plant nuts and stones with the ultimate
							view of having on each plat a transplanted Seedling, and a tree from the
							seed, growing at the same time— I have done this heretofore without
							regularity, and with partial success— I now undertake it more
							extensively.— After dinner I sowed several rows of farm apple seeds in
							the Garden box N. 2.— In the Evening I received 100 copies of the Eulogy
							on <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>; 50 of them with
							strips of brown cartridge paper over them, which <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> directed to sundry persons of my

							seen and spoken to <persRef ref="bass-benjamin">Benjamin Bass</persRef>
							who refused to sign the Assignment of the Policy; but said he would pay

							on account of his own Bill, and the remainder, for <persRef

							wait for the settlement of the rest of his account for the new House at
							Mount Wollaston, and for his new Entry and passage way at the homestead,

							this Evening to Medford. This afternoon my Grand daughters Mary Louisa
							and Georgiana Frances planted each in her plat in the Seminary sundry
							Apple and Pear Seeds, Plums, Peach Stones and Walnuts, and I trust some
							one or more of them will come up in each plat— I would have each of them
							interested in the growth of a tree from a seed sown by herself—
							Mary-Louisa is already much interested in her vine, which survived the
							last Winter, and has flourished well this Season; but it cannot live
							long, and there should be something more hardy to take its place— I
							planted—Apple and Pear seeds, round 8. of the young transplanted fruit
							trees in the Seminary, and marked them all upon Stakes— Planted also 4
							rows of Pear seeds in garden box 3. but forgot the Stakes— They were the
							farm wilding, farm button, and two of the garden Endicott—a thorough
							winter Pear. I have not been able to carry through my whole plan, but I
							mark especially the two wilding Pears, the Garden Endicott, the farm red

							returned home before Evening. We were engaged almost the whole day in

							fronting the Nursery fence. I planted also Apple and Pear-seeds in the
							Pot N. 11. and had all the Pots removed into the cellar. I reserved some
							of the Farm red wedge, and russet Apples and Endicott Pears and wild
							Plums, to be kept till after my return here in the spring, with the
							intention of planting some of their seeds then. But I am again obliged
							to leave all my plantations in a confused state, and my experiments in
							most equivocal embryo— <persRef ref="herring-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James Herring</persRef> was here— He
							is the compiler of a Work called the American Portrait Gallery
							containing engraved Portraits of sundry distinguished persons of this
							Country; all Post-revolutionary characters—with the Portraits are
							published biographical notices of the persons. Three Volumes of the work
							are published— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Herring has made repeated

								ref="adams-john;adams-abigail">my father and mother</persRef>, of
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and of
							myself— I have offered him the use of the Portraits, painted by <persRef
								ref="copley-john">Copley</persRef>, <persRef ref="stuart-gilbert"
								>Stuart</persRef>, and <persRef ref="leslie-charles"
								>Leslie</persRef>, but I believe none of them have yet been

							wife, and of my father, and proposed that <persRef ref="stone-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William L. Stone</persRef> of
							New-York should prepare the Memoir of me; to which I readily assented—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Herrings Applications to me have been
							frequent, but as yet little has been effected, and I strongly apprehend
							that nothing will be done, except what I shall do, or cause to be done
							myself— About a Month since I received a Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Herring, dated at Plymouth, where he said
							he was copying <pb n="370" type="ms"/>the large Picture, by <persRef
								ref="sargent-henry">Henry Sargent</persRef> of the landing of the
							Pilgrims; and he then informed me that in about three weeks from that
							time he would come on here, and proposed to pass a Night at Quincy— He
							now informed me that a few days after writing that Letter, he had been
							obliged by the sudden illness and death of <persRef ref="u">his
								mother</persRef> at New-York to leave Plymouth, and had reached
							New-York, only to attend the funeral of his mother— He said they must
							finish the Gallery of Portraits with the fourth Volume, three being
							already completed, and for the Memoir of my mother he must depend
							entirely upon me— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone was willing
							to write the memoir of me, but had said that he did not know whether I
							should <hi rend="italic">now</hi> be willing that he should— I told him
							I could have no possible objection— I had lately differed from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone, upon some points of Politics, but
							was willing he should say of me just what he thought right— He said
								<persRef ref="durand-asher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Durand</persRef> was now engraving his own portrait of me; that he
							himself was to copy Copley’s full length portrait of my father, and
								<persRef ref="cheney-john2">Cheney</persRef> was to copy Stuart’s
							portrait of my mother, and one of those of my wife, by Leslie or Stuart.
							I told him she would prefer to have that of Leslie engraved, rather than

							breeze— The transition from Boston to Providence was so rapid, that
							there was time for observing nothing except the ground spotted with Snow

						<p>After a quiet Night, though nearly sleepless, rising at half past five, I
							found the boat in the East river, and at a quarter past six, we landed
							at the wharf below Chambers Street in the North river; whence we walked
							to the wharf adjoining the North end of the Battery, whence the
							Steam-boats for Amboy depart— The six O’Clock boat had been gone about
							half an hour, and we were obliged to wait for the Swan which was to
							depart at ten O’Clock— We breakfasted at the Philadelphia House a Tavern
							at the corner adjoining the Battery. I made up a packet of the
							Dissertations upon a Congress of Nations; directed it to <persRef
								ref="kent-james">Chancellor Kent</persRef>, and sent it to the
							Post-Office— I then strolled about the city for about an hour—there was
							very little apparent agitation, although it was the third and last day
							of an election for Governor, Senators and House of Assembly; for four
							members of the House of Representatives of the United States and for
							forty two Electors of President and Vice President of the United States—
							There was not the slightest appearance of riot or disorder.— Twenty two
							thousand votes had been taken in the two preceding days, and about
							twelve thousand were to be taken this day— I returned in time for the
							departure of the Steamboat the Swan, at ten O’Clock. Met several persons
							of transient acquaintance, among whom, <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi

							of the second Presbyterian Church at Washington, <persRef
								ref="coolidge-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas

							I could not ascertain, but who told me that he was with me, on the Cars
							of this same railway, this day three years ago, when we met with that
							Melancholy accident by which two men were killed and several others men
							women and children were maimed and crippled— This Officer then was
							accompanying the <persRef ref="bartlett-harriet">wife</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">child</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Sister in

							to Amboy; thence one of two hours in the cars to Bordentown, and then
							another of three hours in the Steamboat Trenton we landed at 6. O’Clock
							in the Evening at the Chesnut Street wharf— We walked to Congress Hall,
							corner of Chesnut and third Streets, and there found lodgings for the
							Night.— The house is now kept by a man named <persRef ref="u"

						<p>The Boat from Philadelphia to New-York starts at six in the Morning— That

								ref="u">Captain Jeffreys</persRef> for Newcastle—arrived there at
							ten— Took the Railway Cars; fine new vehicles each holding about 120

							I took Seats for Washington and waited till half past 4. when I walked
							leisurely to Barnum’s, where I expected to find my family; but they were
							all gone from the room where I had left them, and neither the Bar keeper
							nor any of the Servants knew what had become of them— I concluded that
							without waiting for me they had gone to the Railway Offices, by another
							Street than those through which I had passed— I returned to the railway
							Office; but they were not there. The Clock had struck five— The Cars
							were to depart at precisely a quarter after 5— <persRef ref="u"
								>Graymes</persRef> was at the Office with all the baggage— I told
							him if I should not be back in time, before the Cars should start, to go
							on with them and upon arriving at Washington to have the baggage
							carefully taken to our house— I raced back again to Barnum’s Hotel, and
							there was told that my family had just gone, escorted by <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Laughlin</persRef> the bar
							keeper, and that when I had been at the house for them before they were
							still in the house, but had left the room where I had first left them
							and gone to a more private chamber where they had waited for me till
							notified that they were in danger of losing their passage in the Cars— I
							flew back and reached the Cars an instant before their departure, just
							in time to take my Seat. My family had got there not five minutes before
							and were already seated. I was in a steam-bath of perspiration, of
							exhausted breath, of half-flayed feet, and of pungent reflections on the
							policy of going to Barnum’s Hotel to wait an hour and a half for the
							starting of the Railway Cars.— They proceeded with moderate speed, and I
							had time gradually to grow cool in body and mind, with two loquacious
							fellow travellers, one named <persRef ref="u">M’Cormick</persRef>, a
							brother of the Clergyman whom I placed in the Department of State—the
							other an Englishman settled in this Country named <persRef ref="u"
								>Maynard</persRef>, who told me that he came to this Country from
							England when I was Minister there; and that I had furnished him with a
							Passport, <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef> being an American— The
							Cars landed us about half past eight in the Evening, at the foot of the
							Capitol Hill in Washington, where <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Michel
								Antoine Giusta</persRef> was waiting to meet <persRef
								ref="newell-mary">his wife</persRef>. The family and Graymes with

								>Elizabeth</persRef> accompanied by <persRef ref="macomb-edward"
								>Major Macomb</persRef>, who had been a fellow traveller with us
							from New-York. I walked home with Giusta who entertained me on the way
							with the adventures of his expedition of the last Summer to the Western
							Country—as we came by the public buildings the Treasury Clock struck
							nine, and immediately after I entered our house, with silent
							gratulations that this journey of 500 miles had been performed in three

						<p>The weather had been beautifully clear, with cold nights and warm days
							from the hour of our departure from Boston, till last Evening when it
							clouded up with a prospect of rain— It came on in the Night, and rained
							steadily almost the whole of this day. It confined me accordingly all
							the morning to the House— I was resuming my customary winter occupations
							preparatory to the meeting of Congress— A young man named <persRef
								ref="gore-watson">Watson Gore</persRef>, of Roxbury who had been a
							fellow Traveller with us from New-York <pb n="373" type="ms"/>and to
							whom the children had taken, with much attachment came to see them— He

							I heard the <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna"
								>children</persRef> read again—Mary Louisa in the Apocrypha, and
							both of them in the new Testament— As the rain held up towards Evening,
							I walked to see <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi

							where she is very comfortably situated— <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> is absent on a visit to New-York— The excitement of
							the Presidential Election is here as we have found it all along on the
							road— The remarkable character of this election is that all the
							candidates are at most third rate men, whose pretensions rest neither
							upon high attainments, nor upon eminent services, but upon intrigue and
							political speculation. The Presidency has fallen into a joint stock
							company— <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> came in upon
							the trumpet-tongue of military achievement— His Presidency has been the
							reign of subaltern knaves, fattening upon land jobs and money jobs, who
							have made him believe that it was a heroic conception of his own to
							destroy the Bank of the United States, and who under colour of this have
							got into their own hands the <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of the public
							monies at a time when there is a surplus of forty Millions of Dollars in
							the Treasury— Two political Swindlers <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos
								Kendall</persRef>, and <persRef ref="whitney-reuben">Reuben M.
								Whitney</persRef>, are the <persRef ref="empson-richard"
								>Empson</persRef> and <persRef ref="dudley-edmund">Dudley</persRef>
							of our <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, and by playing upon his
							Vanity, and his thirst of petty revenge have got into their own hands
							the overflowing revenue of the Country; with the temporary and illegal
								<hi rend="italic">use</hi> of which they are replenishing their own
							Coffers and making princely fortunes.— Jackson has wearied out the
							sordid subserviency of his Supporters, and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> has had the address to
							persuade him that he is the only man who can preserve and perpetuate the
							principles of his administration,—And as his term of eight years has run
							through, and his gang are weary of his sway, he has set his heart upon
							bringing in Van Buren as his Successor, and has successfully exercise
							all his influence to promote that result. The opposition divided between
							three talented aspirants to the Presidency, neither of whom would yield
							subordination to either of the others, have been driven in mere
							desperation to set up men of straw in their places, and they have taken
							up <persRef ref="white-hugh">Hugh Lawson White</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">William Henry Harrison</persRef> as the
							Israelites set up a calf, and as the Egyptians worshipped oxen and
							monkies. White and Harrison are men of moderate capacity, but of varied
							public service, and of long experience in the affairs of the Nation—
							They are as competent for the Presidency at least as Jackson, and like
							him, if elected to his Station, would rule by the proxy of subalterns—
							By party management and political love potions, White and Harrison are
							now the golden calves of the People, and their dull saying are repeated
							for wit, and their grave inanity is passed off for wisdom.— This
							bolstering up of mediocrity would seem not suited to sustain much
							enthusiasm; but a practice, has crept in of betting largely upon the
							issue of elections, and that adds a spar of private personal and
							pecuniary interest to the impulse of patriotism— This is the exciting
							cause of all the ardour which we have met with throughout this Journey—
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith says that Van Buren is so
							generally odious here, that if the report of Harrison’s having carried
							the State of Pennsylvania had been confirmed, the city would have been
							illuminated— When I came home, I found here <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							who spent part of the Evening with us.— He gave me in general terms an

							not quite so desperate as it was; but its prospects have not much
							improved.</p>

						<p><date>12. IV:15. </date>Saturday.— The day was fair, and the temperature
							of the atmosphere so mild that I had no occasion for fire in my chamber,
							and had none— Nor was there any made in our Bed chamber— The first thing
							to which I found it necessary to attend was to recruit my funds, for I
							had imprudently left home with a charge of nine persons and two horses,
							with less than 200 dollars for the expenses of a journey of 500 Miles. I
							came therefore under a perpetual uneasiness with the fear of finding my
							resources exhausted on the way, and of being obliged to borrow some
							paltry sum of fifty dollars to complete my journey. I finally got
							through, with the help of ten dollars of the Money of <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C Adams</persRef> which she had in
							Bills of Boston Banks, and found some difficulty in passing away— In the
							Steamboats they take the Bills of all the solvent Banks, and took
							without hesitation those which she had given me to exchange— These and
							one of three half-Eagles, which I had reserved to keep as curiosities
							landed me here, and paid for the marketing of this Morning. I went to
							the Bank of the Metropolis, and drew a small balance which I had left in
							deposit there— My next visit was to the Franklin Insurance Company,
							where I found the <persRef ref="bradley-abraham">Secretary M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Abraham Bradley</persRef>. The
							Directors have just declared a dividend of 8 per Cent on the Capital for
							a half year, retaining 4 per Cent for the reserved fund; but they passed
							a Resolution requiring a new endorser upon ten of my notes, and another
							to refuse payment of the dividend to any Stockholder who should refuse
							to renew his notes, with a new endorser— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bradley had written me a Letter notifying me of these Resolutions, and
							that he was ready to pay me the Dividend upon my renewal of my Notes—
							There were twelve of these Notes including one for thirty shares which
							had belonged to my Son John and upon which I was the endorser— He was
							one of the endorsers on all the rest— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bradley that I still doubted the legal right of the
							directors to require new Notes— But I was very unwilling to have a
							lawsuit with them; and as <persRef ref="adams-john2">my Son
								John’s</persRef> property was bound by his name on the twelve Notes,
							I would take them all up, and offer <persRef ref="hellen-mary">his
								widow’s</persRef> name as endorser upon one note including the
							amount of them all. He said that would satisfy the requisition of the
							directors, and drew a note for 19540 dollars, being the amount of the
							twelve Notes to be taken up, leaving the name of the payee in blank,
							which I filled up with the name of Mary C. Adams, and she endorsed it—
							There are still two Notes signed by me, one endorsed by <persRef
								ref="bradley-phineas">Phineas Bradley</persRef> for<space/>dollars
							and one by <persRef ref="nicholls-jesse2">Jesse B. Nicholls</persRef>
							for<space/>dollars of which the Directors have not required the renewal:
							those endorsers being neither dead nor insolvent— I called also at the

							should be sent to my house. It has during my absence, been sent to
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>A cold steady rain with a heavy gale of wind commenced last Night, and
							continuing through the whole of this day confined me wholly to the
							house— I should have recovered arrears, but suffered this day to be
							added to them.— I wrote one short Letter to the Clerk of the Jefferson

							but <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> was now confined to her

								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, for the
							copy of my Letter.— This was for the present an effective check upon my

							wholly neglected— But having occasion to refer to a Letter written since
							March 1834. when I began the present volume of my Letters, I had some
							embarrasment to find it and perceived that it wanted an index, and
							almost the whole of it paging— I determined then to make an index to the
							volume, and began minuting down the names of the persons to whom the
							Letters were written, in the order as they stand in the book— I wished

						<p>I rose first before three O’Clock, and finding how time went, returned to
							bed, and lay awake nearly two hours before rising for the day— There are
							two particulars affecting my Sleep, which I scarcely know whether to
							charge to the body or to the mind— One that after my first sleep on
							going to bed, I awake very irregularly at different hours; almost always
							without knowing the immediate cause of my waking, and scarcely ever
							being able even to guess how long I have slept or what hour before or
							after midnight it is— The other, that when once thus waked I scarcely
							ever can sleep again the same night, and if I am roused at one or two
							O’Clock in the morning, I return to bed, but get no more Sleep— This
							time is often, but not always lost to me— It is occupied sometimes with
							useful and sometimes with idle meditation; and sometimes, as this
							morning with mere vacuity of mind— The storm of yesterday cleared up
							with a heavy gale in the Night, and this morning there was a Northwest
							wind, and a sharp frost— I pursued the preparation of the Index to my
							volume of Letters, and minuted the names about half through the book— I
							called at the War Department with <persRef ref="vinson-thomas">Thomas
								Vinson’s</persRef> papers; but the acting <persRef
								ref="butler-benjamin">Secretary M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Benjamin Franklin Butler</persRef>, was attending a Cabinet Meeting
							at the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Presidents</persRef> I went to the
							Franklin Insurance Office, took up the twelve notes which the directors
							had required should be exchanged, and gave the <unclear>new</unclear>
							one including the amount of them all, and endorsed by <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary C. Adams</persRef> my Son <persRef

								ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> then gave me two checks for the dividends due on
							the shares; and I asked him for a new certificate of the 30 Shares which
							had stood in the name of my Son John— He observed that the former
							certificate must be delivered up, and I had not thought of taking it
							with me— I went to the Patent Office, and paid the bill which had been
							sent to me for fees of recording papers; and to the Office of the
							National Intelligencer, where <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> gave me some of the

						<p>Instead of retrieving the arrears of my Diary, or of my correspondence, I
							am making an Index of my Letter Book, and hunting up and assorting old
							pamphlets— This morning I finished the minute of the names and the
							paging of the Book— It now remains to arrange the names in alphabetical

							confined to her chamber with a cough and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"

								<persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> was here, and <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Giusta</persRef>, whom I asked to purchase for me some articles of

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Butler</persRef> the Attorney
							General, and acting Secretary of War, since the appointment and

								ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickerson</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy came in while I was
							there— He has been very much indisposed, and said he was not able to

							the <pb n="377" type="ms"/>temper, sympathetic with that of the body;
							and it is said that the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef> treats him very harshly. I called at the
							Franklin Insurance Office with the Certificate of 30 Shares of the Stock
							in the name of my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> made out a new one in my name, but <persRef
								ref="grammer-g">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grammer</persRef> the
							President was not there to sign it—so I am to call for it again. Their
							reserved fund amounts now to more than 25000 dollars—and I urged M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley to propose to the Directors to
							declare an extra dividend of 20 per Cent, and at the same time to call
							for a second instalment of five dollars a share from the Stockholders—
							The dividend would thus pay the instalment The amount of Capital paid
							in, and the Stock of every Stockholder would be doubled, and the
							Directors might continue to reserve one third of the half yearly profits
							for a new reserved fund; additional to that required by the Charter— The
							payment of the instalment would also release the Stockholders from one
							fourth of the amount of their contingent notes. New Notes reduced to
							three fifths of the payable capital might be given, and the reserves in
							a few years might prepare a payment of a third instalment after which a
							pledge of the Stock might be taken instead of any indorser of the
							contingent notes for the two remaining instalments. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley said the extra dividend and call
							for a second instalment had been proposed at the board of Directors; but
							it had been suggested that it might not be consistent with the eighth
							Section of the Charter— I read the act, and found there was nothing in
							the eighth or any other Section, which my proposal would contravene— He
							said he would mention it to the President and Directors— I went to the
							Capitol and visited the Library, and the Office of the Clerk of the
							House of Representatives— I found some women at work in the house,
							laying the Carpets in preparation for the commencement of the Session. I
							applied for Copies of the Documents of the last Session of the Acts of
							Congress and of the Journals of both Houses.— At the Office of the
							National Intelligencer I saw both the Editors, <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"

								Lovell’s</persRef> house had been struck off to <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby</persRef> for 7800. dollars which is a fair

								<persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> there—but <persRef ref="grammer-g">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grammer</persRef> was not, nor had he
							signed my certificate. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley said he
							had spoken to him of my proposal to declare an extra dividend, and to
							call for a second instalment of five dollars upon each share, and that
							he approved it. But suggested another plan; to double the capital, by
							calling for another instalment, and giving notes for four times the
							amount of that instalment; there by making the whole capital 250000
							dollars, and the sum paid in 20 per Cent of that amount— My objection to
							that is, that instead of reducing it doubles the amount of the
							contingent notes.— I called at the Intelligencer Office, and looked over
							the election returns in the Boston Newspapers of Tuesday and Wednesday
							last— The election was held on Monday; for Governor, Lieutenant
							Governor, Senators and Representatives, for the State Legislature, and
							for an electoral ticket for the election of a President and Vice
							President of the United States; and for members of the House of
							Representatives of the United States in the 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congress— The returns are marked by some extraordinary
							peculiarities. The whigs as they now call themselves have succeeded in
							Boston, by a majority of about 2000. and will have throughout the State
							a majority of about ten thousand but the Antimasons who all voted last
							year for <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> as
							Governor, have this year divided, and the larger part of them voted for
								<persRef ref="morton-marcus">Morton</persRef>. This is
							counterbalanced by a great increase of the whig party vote— In the ninth
							District <persRef ref="hastings-william">Hastings</persRef> has carried
							the Election against <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef> by a majority of more than six hundred votes; but
							in the<space/><persRef ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef> has
							carried it against <persRef ref="hoar-samuel">Hoare</persRef>— In the 24
							Towns of my own District, the returns shew a small majority for Morton
							as Governor, and for the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren</persRef> electoral ticket But there are published returns
							from only two towns, of the votes for member of Congress— Abington,
							where the <pb n="379" type="ms"/>vote stated is of 252. for me, and 6
							scattering; and Rochester, where it is 140 for me, and 222 for <persRef
								ref="thomas-john6">J. Thomas</persRef> of Plymouth— In all the whig
							Papers there is no more notice of the election to Congress for the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> District, than if no such election had
							taken place— I was nominated by an Antimasonic Meeting— The whigs, and
							the democrats, had meetings for the other elections, but made no
							nomination of me, or of any other person— Whether the movement in
							Rochester was in concert with other Towns, does not yet appear— I
							received this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="kent-james">Chancellor

						<p>At the Presbyterian Church and at Morning service I heard <persRef
								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from 2. Timothy 3.7. “Ever learning, and never able
							to come to the knowledge of the truth”— The Epistles to <persRef
								ref="timothy">Timothy</persRef> are Letters of Instructions from
								<persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> his teacher, to him as a Minister
							of the Gospel— The text of this morning is part of an admonition to the
							disciple to avoid communication, and especially controversy with a
							certain class of persons, having the form of godliness, and professing
							to be Christians, but grossly vicious and immoral, inculcating false and
							pernicious doctrines, yet with plausible manners, creeping into houses,
							deceived themselves and deceiving others—perverting silly women, of such
							as are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
							truth— Such a class of persons he warns him will arise in the last
							days,—by which he must have meant some time during the life and Ministry
							of Timothy, whom he charges to avoid them— It is evident indeed from the
							context that this class of persons had arisen already and that they were
							mischievously perverting both the Christian Doctrines, and the morals of
							the <pb n="380" type="ms"/>Christians— He reminds Timothy, that <hi
								rend="italic">his</hi> gospel consists in preaching the Resurrection
							of Christ from the dead; and he specifies as one of the heresies already
							held forth by false Doctors was that the Resurrection had already past—
							It is not very clear what this opinion was; but it seems by implication
							to deny a future resurrection, and thereby to unsettle the essential
							part of the gospel preached by Paul; namely that the resurrection of
							Christ from the dead was the demonstration of the immortality of the
							Soul; and that as he had risen, so all his disciples should rise from
							the dead— The Class of Persons however described by S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul in this text and context did not
							originate after the writing of his Epistle, nor have they been
							extinguished to this day— They have formed and still form a part of the
							family of man— Vicious morals, beclouded intellects, plausible and
							fallacious doctrines, combining to creep into houses and seduce silly
							woman, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
							truth, belong to all the ages of Christianity, and the text is drawn
							deep from the nature of man, rather than from any thing peculiar to the
							age of Paul, or from the duties of Timothy— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read part of the Evening Service for the 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity—but omitted the Psalms and the Lesson
							from the old Testament— He read the second Lesson, which was the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of the first Epistle of <persRef
								ref="john">John</persRef>, and instead of a Sermon, extemporized
							about five minutes of comment upon that chapter— There were about twenty
							persons present, one of whom was <persRef ref="macomb-edward">Major
								Macomb</persRef>, who gave me the aid of his umbrella to come— It
							rained heavily all the afternoon and Evening none of the <persRef

							Month was again drooping in health, and has since been very ill— Her
							health and Spirits have been among the most precious enjoyments of my
							life; and they have been the exquisite happiness of my Son. Let me not
							distrust a merciful Providence by foreboding a reverse.— I called again
							at the Franklin Insurance Office, and found there both the President,
								<persRef ref="grammer-g">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grammer</persRef>, and <persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley</persRef> the Secretary— I
							signed as Administrator on the Estate of my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> the transfer of the thirty Shares
							of Stock, standing in his name, and received the new certificate for
							them in my own— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grammer shewed me the
							Memorial of the President and Directors to Congress for the renewal and
							modification of their Charter, which expires in 1838. The memorial was
							presented, but not acted upon at the last Session— I approved most of
							the modifications of the Charter requested in the memorial, and upon
							conversing with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grammer and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley, became very doubtful of the
							practicability of my own proposal to convert the reserved fund into the
							permanent capital Stock of the Company— The difficulty is that by
							dividing it, as Stock, of the Stockholders it would cease to be a <hi
								rend="italic">reserved</hi> fund as prescribed by the <pb n="381"
								type="ms"/>act of incorporation—and although the amount would remain
							equally responsible for all the obligations of the company, the
							Stockholders would cease to be responsible upon their contingent notes,
							for one fourth of their present obligations. The security of the assured
							by the Policies of the company would therefore be diminished to the same
							amount as the contingent notes of the Stockholders would be reduced, and
							the reserved fund, though raised to the full extent required by the
							charter would be diverted from its purpose, by being made the separate
							property of the Stockholders— My plan is practicable only by reserving
							the 20000 dollars required by Law, and continuing a semi-annual reserve
							till it shall amount to 25000 dollars more; and that could undoubtedly
							be converted, by an extra dividend into permanent capital— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grammer mentioned his own project of
							doubling the amount of capital, and of the contingent notes; but to that
							I have a great aversion. At the National Intelligencer Office, I saw
							both the partners, <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>, but they had this
							day, no newspapers by the mail from Boston.</p>

						<p>By the uncomfortable, and now to me very difficult process of writing by
							Lamplight morn and Evening several successive days, I have at length
							brought up the arrears of my Diary within reaching distance, that is
							three days, and now begin to write daily one or two very short answers
							to Letters— I walked to the Capitol and saw <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin</persRef> the Clerk of the House of Representatives, but
							could not procure either the Documents of the last Session, or the
							Journals of the Senate— They have not come from the Book binders.— At
							the Office of the National Intelligencer I saw <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph;seaton-william">both the Editors</persRef>, and
							the Newspapers containing the returns of elections in all parts of the
							Union— From my own District there is in the Boston Advocate of Saturday
							a return from the town of Weymouth in the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts, which with those
							from Abington and Rochester, are all that I have yet found— The District
							is not even named in any other Boston Newspaper, except the National
							Advocate— From the three returns published it would seem that in
							Abington, the three parties all voted for me; that in Rochester, where
							the whigs have a large majority, they voted for <persRef
								ref="thomas-john6">J. Thomas</persRef>—and that in Weymouth, where
							they are in a small minority they did not vote at all.— The vote for me
							is only of the antimasons, and portions of the two other parties,
							neither of which ventured a nomination against me, but each of which was
							ready to support one if it had been made. This was a perilous passage
							through a narrow strait; and will certainly not be repeated— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton gave me an autograph Letter from
							the former <persRef ref="monroe-james">President James Monroe</persRef>,
							to <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">Tench Ringgold</persRef>, written in
							December 1829. at Richmond, where he was then President of the

							Seaton asked me to send this autograph, to <persRef ref="sparks-jared"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jared Sparks</persRef> at
							Cambridge, who had written to him to procure one for the royal
							collection at Dresden— I had received just before I left Quincy a Letter
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks containing the same request,
							at the suggestion of <persRef ref="ticknor-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Ticknor</persRef>, now
							travelling in Europe, and a Sojourner at Dresden— He wrote to M<hi

							States excepting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe; a vacancy which

								type="ms"/>an autograph of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe
							addressed to me, which I could send for the Dresden collection— This

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="thomas-james2">Col<hi rend="superscript"

							obtained an Act for the Settlement of his accounts according to the
							principles of equity, which in the practice of our Government is
							equivalent to the discretion of the accounting Officers— They
							accordingly take their own Time for auditing such accounts, and if they
							do not make them a source of profit to themselves, they make the
							claimant sufficiently sensible of their power— Thomas, who understands
							his own interest, works to obtain his Settlement by influence, and as
								<persRef ref="parris-albion">Albion K. Parris</persRef> of Maine, is
							now second Comptroller of the Treasury, Thomas has employed <persRef
								ref="smith-francis">F. O. J. Smith</persRef> the member from

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris to discern the equity of his

							Time— Smith is a member of Congress with political influence— Thomas
							employs and pays him as his Agent and Attorney— Parris, Comptroller of
							the Treasury, indebted perhaps to the influence of Smith for his place,
							has a discretionary power to admit or reject the items of Thomas’s
							Accounts— And all this is in the regular course of business— Thomas told
							me also that it was rumoured that some great fraud had been discovered
							in the returns of the electoral College of Pennsylvania; and that there
							was some question whether the Governor would issue his proclamation
							declaring who were the persons elected— He had much more political
							gossiping scarcely worthy of being recollected.— In my walk before
							dinner, I viewed the foundation of the new building which they are
							erecting for the Patent Office; on which they are employing the granite,
							found in Maryland, about 18 Miles distant from Baltimore, and which
							closely resembles the Quincy Stone— <persRef

							upon <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>— I walked out

								<pb n="383" type="ms"/>Louisville and Cincinnati, by which 13

							scalded that their recovery was desperate. Gales was somewhat comforted

								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowrie’s</persRef> house, and viewed his furniture which is to be
							sold at auction to-morrow— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie was

						<p>My Time is slipping away, and I am doing nothing— I rose this morning two
							hours later than my regular time, because I had spent the last Evening
							abroad, and because the morning was so cold, that I could not write
							before breakfast— This is an incurable infirmity of the Winter, which
							has begun this Season earlier than usual— The consequence is that I must
							write between breakfast and dinner, a time when numberless unforeseen,
							and for the most part trivial calls dissipate the day till it is
							imperceptibly and irretrievably gone— This morning <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">M. A. Giusta</persRef> was here, consulting me,
							about the purchase of a dinner set of Liverpool Crockery ware; a grave
							concern which has absorbed several hours of time since our arrival here—
							The Servants break up a set, in about 2 years; and for economy’s sake we
							have been desirous of purchasing a set at auction— This has failed, but
							Giusta has negotiated with <persRef ref="dyer-robert">Dyer</persRef> the
							auctioneer for a second hand, and of course incomplete set, for which I
							have agreed to pay 25 dollars or about half price— This was the business
							of the morning, till near two O’Clock, when I walked out and encountered
							a blustering Northwester, that I was driven back into the House, within
							an hour, the fingers of both my hands pinched as if with thumb-screws.
							We spent the Evening at whist.— I wrote a few lines to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Governor Edward Everett</persRef>, and to
								<persRef ref="eastburn-john">John H. Eastburn</persRef>, of whom I
							have asked another hundred copies of the Eulogy on <persRef
								ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>— This is occasioned by a
							number of applications which I have received, from various persons
							Strangers to me, and who have just curiosity enough to see the work,
							without being at the cost of a quarter of a dollar to pay for it— There
							are in the eastern central and western parts of the Country, multitudes
							of collectors of pamphlets of this description, who bedaub me with
							flattery, for gratuitous copies of my Speeches and Orations; while
							others do them about equal honour, by malicious and caustic reviews—
							There is in the Boston Courier which <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Gales</persRef> this day sent me, such a Review of the Eulogy on
							Madison by a blue-light federalist of the Hartford Convention
							School—while in the Telegraph Newspaper of this day, there is a deadly
							onset upon me, from the clanking Chains of a Southern Slave-holder, for
							my Speech upon the Texian Imposture, last June— The idea this Evening
							occurred to me, of making a collection of as many of my writings which
							have been published in pamphlets, to have two or three sets of them,
							bound up in Volumes, for gifts to my <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna;adams-louisa3;adams-john17;adams-charles7"
								>grand-children</persRef>— The three Eulogies may be literary and
							political curiosities, <pb n="384" type="ms"/>in a century from this
							day; but of most, perhaps all my other writings, no trace will remain,
							unless in some such collection made by myself. I have already had two
							Volumes of Miscellanies chiefly of my composing, bound, and have here
							and at Quincy the materials for one or two Volumes more— It may be worth
							my while however to proceed more methodically, and to collect as far as
							possible, all that has been printed, of my writing— It must always be
							very incomplete, as there are many articles of newspapers, magazines,
							and Reviews, long since forgotten by myself; and much official
							correspondence in Public Documents, mingled with other papers, and not
							worthy of being selected among them— The public documents among which
							there are Letters and Memoirs of mine are so numerous and so various,
							that it would not be possible for me to indicate them all.</p>

						<p>Cold morning so that I could not write. I made out however a very

							be hereafter enlarged, and brought into form, and I read part of two
							Lectures of <persRef ref="johnson-alexander">Alexander B.
								Johnson</persRef> of Utica, forming part of his Treatise upon
							language. It is a work of an extraordinary character; and deserving of
							much consideration at least from me— It assumes the merit of a profound
							discovery, undetected by all the writers upon metaphysics of former
							ages— There is something of the <persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">Jeremy
								Bentham</persRef> character about it— A free use of neologies—words
							of the authors invention, but deficient both in euphony and precision— A
							style, deeply studied; affecting originality—antithetic—highly
							figurative, and often stranded upon the commonest rules of Grammar. He
							quotes <persRef ref="berkeley-george">Berkley</persRef>, <persRef

								>Hume</persRef>, <persRef ref="descartes-rene">Descartes</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="reid-thomas">Reid</persRef>, as mere Schoolboys,
							utterly ignorant of his great discovery, and consequently committing
							egregious blunders, which it has been reserved to him to expose— But
							instead of quoting them in their own words, he gives his own version or
							paraphrase of particular passages in their writings, and then shews the
							absurdity of his own conceptions which he imputes to them— He has long
							and perseveringly and painfully meditated his subject into a system,
							which has unity and consistency and some ingenuity of invention— But I
							find it very difficult to understand him, and am doubtful whether he has
							really presented some new views of language, or whether his book is a
							mere bundle of common truisms mystified into an appearance of
							metaphysical refinement— <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Giusta</persRef>

								<persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from John 5.40. “And ye will not come to me, that
							ye might have life.”— This was a thorough-going Calvinistic declamation,
							charging the whole auditory and indeed almost all christendom with this
							stubborn wilful refusal to go to Christ, or to submit to his Laws, to
							enjoy eternal Life— The reproach which Christ in the text applies to a
							few of the Jews of his own time, the preacher cast upon the whole mass
							of Christians of the present age— It is not to be denied that there are
							great multitudes of nominal Christians in the present age who refuse to
							go to Christ; but they are not generally such as frequent any Christian
							Church— For myself, I repel the charge, and do not believe it true, of
							most of those to whom it is addressed— I liked this Sermon as little as
							any one that I have heard for several years.— <persRef

							has very much smoothed down— On returning home from Church I found
								<persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"

							representations of things, while in reality things are the
							representatives of words, and he stoutly maintains that nothing exists
							that is not perceptible to the human senses— Whether he is aware of the
							consequences of his own argument is something doubtful— His system if it
							means any thing is materialism— He limits for example the divisibility
							of matter to the perception of it by the sense and considers all words
							indicative of existence not perceptible to one of the five senses, as
							representatives without a constituent—words without meaning.— He puzzles
							himself much; and puzzles me not a little— The great part of his book
							seems to be very trivial truth worked up into mystery, and the rest
							metaphysical skirmishing in search of unintelligible axioms.— Perhaps
							what I deem defect in the work is my own— <pb n="386" type="ms"

						<p>Digging deeper into the Treatise of <persRef ref="johnson-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander B. Johnson</persRef> upon
							language, without understanding it any better. As I proceed it appears
							to me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson either has no distinct
							idea of what he himself means by the word language or that he views it
							in a partial, and indefinite light.— The great property of language is
							to be an instrument for the communication of thought— Words are the
							elements of language; but they must be carefully distinguished from the
							idea which they represent from property to which they refer, and for the
							form in which they are used.— A word spoken is an articulate sound,
							conveying an idea from one mind to another of men both speaking the same
							language— A word written is a picture of the same articulate sound
							conveying through the eye to the mind the same idea as is conveyed by
							the Articulate sound through the ear— The word has wings—it flies from
							the mouth of the Speaker to the ear of the hearer— Written or printed it
							flies from the paper to the reader; but no man in his senses takes it
							either for the object which it represents, or for the sensation of the
							Speaker or writer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson seems to think
							that all mankind are constantly making one or the other of those
							mistakes— The young man from the Office of the Clerk of the House of
							Representatives brought me some paper, and <persRef
								ref="mccormick-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cormick</persRef> the Postmaster at the Post-Office of the House
							sent me some other Stationery— I walked round the Capitol before dinner,
							and journalized in the Evening— <persRef ref="dewindt-elizabeth2"
								>Elizabeth De Wint</persRef> dined and spent the Evening here, and
							we had a party at whist—</p>

						<p>I met <persRef ref="freeman-russell">Russel Freeman</persRef> yesterday
							in my walk— He has come on here again from Sandwich to make interest for
							an Office—to recover that which was taken from him of Collector at New
							Bedford or some other— Any other that will give him a comfortable
							subsistence— He told me that he had seen <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury</persRef> the Secretary
							of the Treasury this morning; and that his discourse was encouraging— He
							shewed me also a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury to
							him written last May, and which was flattering to his hopes— He says
							that <persRef ref="williams-lemuel2">Lemuel Williams</persRef> the
							present Collector of New-Bedford has made one of these land jobbing
							fortunes, and does not expect to be reappointed, at the expiration of
							his present term which has about one year more to run. <pb n="387"
								type="ms"/>That he neither needs nor wants the office, and might as
							well be dismissed from it at once— I told him he must not expect that—
							And must be satisfied, if he can be restored to his Office when
							Williams’s term shall expire— He said he could live until that time—
							That he had about 3000 dollars, which would last him for a year; and
							that his motto instead, of the trivial one dum spiro spero, was with the
							words inverted—dum spero spiro— He enquired, if I had seen the returns
							of the Congressional Election for the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							District of Massachusetts— I said I had the returns from the Towns in
							Plymouth County; and mentioned the peculiarity of the returns from
							Rochester, Wareham and Plymouth. He said that the votes in Rochester and
							Wareham, were given by the influence of <persRef ref="holmes-charles2"
								>Charles J. Holmes</persRef>, a cunning man without principle; a
							factory agent of <persRef ref="hedge-barnabas">Barnabas Hedge</persRef>
							who procures votes for <persRef ref="thomas-john6">John Thomas</persRef>
							of Plymouth, because Thomas married a <persRef ref="thomas-hannah"
								>daughter</persRef> of Hedge— Charles J. Holmes is the member from
							the old Colony on the available ticket of Electors of President and
							Vice-President— As to the small number of votes given in Plymouth, he
							said the Hedge party not daring to vote for Thomas would not vote at
							all—and <persRef ref="sampson-schuyler">Schuyler Sampson</persRef> was
							not inclined to give a large vote of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Van-Buren</persRef> party, on the <persRef ref="henshaw-john2"
								>Henshaw</persRef> policy of keeping the party itself as small as
							possible— I received a Letter from Schuyler Sampson himself containing a
							draft on the Bank of the Metropolis, for which I obtained a draught on
							the Commonwealth’s Bank at Boston, which by endorsement I made payable
							to his order, and forwarded to him. I received also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">Thomas L. M’Kenney</persRef>, at
							Philadelphia; with an enclosure for <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"
							>Seaton</persRef>—enquiring for a report of a Talk between the Winebago
							chiefs and me in 1828. I took this note to the Office of the National
							Intelligencer, and saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales— There is
							notice in the paper that they will publish my Eulogy upon <persRef
								ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef> entire.— I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales to send me the proof slips, for
							revisal, to correct some errors of the press, which he accordingly
							promised.— We had a whist party this Evening.</p>
