						<p><persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef>, went to Boston, and
							returned to dine— After dinner <persRef ref="ayer-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ayer</persRef> a Carpenter whom he has
							employed for building his house, came from Boston, and examined the
							ground— <persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> came, and I
							went with him to <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field’s</persRef>
							and with him to the <persRef ref="verchild-francis">Verchild</persRef>
							pasture— There M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Field, explained to me his
							wishes and made his proposals, which were to purchase the wood standing
							upon it, and to clear up about five Acres of it for a plantation of
							mulberry trees— He supposes the land clearing may cost 100 dollars, and
							will undertake it for that, and then offers 6 dollars a year additional
							rent for the land so cleared, if I should not choose to plant mulberry
							trees. We then went to the ground which he and <persRef
								ref="curtis-adam">Adam Curtis</persRef> purchased of <persRef
								ref="brackett-james">James Brackett</persRef>; which they laid out
							in house lots, upon which three houses are already built, and he is
							building a fourth— He proposes to me, to continue the road which they
							have opened, to pay fifty dollars to them for the benefit that I shall
							derive from their road, and from a bridge which they are building over
							the Country road, to drain the winter’s water from the grounds round
							their new houses; and he offers to contract to build for me four houses
							for 600 dollars each, and which he warrants will rent for 48 dollars a
							year each; and he advises me to open another cross road on the West-side
							of <persRef ref="curtis-samuel">Samuel Curtis’s</persRef> house lot, and
							a road to meet it from the County road— All these improvements he thinks
							will raise the value of my estate far more than they will cost— I agreed
							to name two persons to appraise the wood; and was inclined to agree to
							have the five acres cleared, and planted with white mulberry trees or
							seed— Of the other proposals that I should give lands and money to open
							new roads, and build houses upon speculation, I desired time for
							consideration— After Spear had taken me home in his waggon, I walked
							over the hill, and saw the lot staked out for Charles’s house— And I
							went to the granite ledge opened by <persRef ref="colburn-asa"
								>Colburn</persRef>, upon <pb n="328" type="ms"/>the hill opposite my
							house, and saw the breaches already made by his workmen upon the rock—
							It was dark when I returned and found my family at tea. <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H Adams</persRef> was here, but went home
							immediately afterwards— In my garde, nursery and seminary observations
							on this first day of the month, I find my tallest Philadelphia maple,
							and the shoot from the Wollaston Apple-bud each 44 inches long.— The
							maple is taller than a transplanted red maple; plucked from my lower
							meadow, and set out in the garden in 1831. October; and yet that is
							flourishing— To obey my <persRef ref="toohey-john">Gardener</persRef>
							transplanted my seedling Strawberry from Pot<space/>to the Netarine
							Strawberry bed in the garden— I filled the Pot with fresh Earth, and
							sowed in it 30 seed of the Apples from the Dwarf tree; just now ripe— I
							have in the cleared hazel bed 25 Seedling peach-trees and 25 hickory
							walnuts of the present year. Of Apples, Pears Cherry ash, and elm I take
							no account— My progress in the Eulogy is slow</p>

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef>— Charles went for

							Plantation and my Eulogy; <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my
								two Granddaughters</persRef> and my Diary divide and consume my
							time. I looked this day into <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s</persRef> Life of <persRef
								ref="henry-patrick">Patrick Henry</persRef>, to see his account of
							the debates in the Virginia Convention upon the Constitution of the
							United-States, and of Henry’s opinion and conduct on the occasion of the
							alien and Sedition Laws— It seems difficult to reconcile them together—
							His opposition to the Constitution was founded perhaps on the
							peculiarity of his situation.— His opinions then were in the highest
							tone of republican doctrine, and his aversion to the consolidation of
							the union deeply rooted— This makes his approbation of the Alien and
							Sedition Laws the more extraordinary— But in truth the opposition to
							those Laws was merely factious— The main argument of <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> report against the alien Law was that it applied
							to alien friends, when such measures should be applied only to alien
							enemies— But there was a fallacy in it.— The foreign emissaries against
							whom the alien act was pointed were in no wise <hi rend="italic"
								>friends</hi> of this Country— They were chiefly Frenchmen— <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> in his correspondence
							says its principal object was <persRef ref="volney-constantin"
								>Volney</persRef>— The relative situation <pb n="329" type="ms"/>of
							the United States and France, at that time not a state of amity, but of
							hostility, though not of declared war— It was such that measures of
							defence against French secret emissaries were more necessary than they
							would have been in avowed and open War— The Sedition act was an
							ineffectual attempt to extinguish the fire of defamation—but it operated
							like oil upon the flame. Patrick Henry was elected a member of the
							Legislature of Virginia in 1799. but he died in June of that year, and
							before their meeting.</p>

								<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale</persRef> came this Evening to remind me that the annual
							meeting and dinner at Squantum of the proprietors of the Neponset Bridge
							would be next Tuesday, at one or two O’Clock— This being the Anniversary
							of the signature at Paris of the definitive Treaty of Peace which
							recognized and consummated the Independence of the United States of
							America, and also of my Son Charles’s Marriage, I gave him the Seal
							which by <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> direction, I
							had engraved at London, in 1815. with his device of the Deer, the Pine
							tree and the Fish, surrounded by the thirteen Stars, by which in 1783.
							he commemorated the rights of the Fisheries and of the boundary, secured
							by the Treaty of Peace with Great-Britain— My father gave the original
							Seal to my late dear and lamented son <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef>—and it remains one of the relics left by him— It has
							on the other side of the stone the Adams arms, but has not the motto
							“Piscemur, Venemur ut olim.”— He gave this which is a single Seal and
							has the motto, to me; and I have given it to Charles, with the request
							that he would at his own time give it to his Son <persRef
								ref="adams-charles7">Charles Francis</persRef>, if by the blessing
							of Providence he should live and prove worthy of his great Grandfather
							who invented the Seal, and of whose life it commemorates a most eventful
							period— I had already on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October
							1833. committed in trust to Charles, for the remainder of my life, the
							Lion created Seal at arms of the Boylston family, with which my father
							sealed the Treaties of 30. November 1782 and 1783. to be retained as his
							property after my decease, and ultimately to be given to his Son—John
							Quincy, if worthy of it, or to any other Son that he might have— I
							received this day a Letter from <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong</persRef> the Mayor of
							Boston, a Letter requesting me to fix a day for the delivery of the
							Eulogy upon <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef>, and proposing Friday the 16<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this Month—but I fear I shall not then be ready; having
							barely yet got through with the discussion of the Alien and Sedition
							Laws— I am endeavouring once more to ascertain the particular Apples and
							Pears from which the Seeds that I sow vegetate— I emptied Pot 12. in
							which on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of November last I had sown
							one whole Button garden Pear, 8 Seeds and 10. Office-Apple Seeds— Not
							one of them has come up— Of the whole pear, nothing but a fragment of
							the skin remains and the core with the seeds in it all dried up— I sowed
							the seeds of a small white pippin between the two peach trees in the
							seminary, and between two stakes to mark where they are— I transplanted
							also four seedling elms, of this year growing too close to a fifth and
							to each other— I found a pignut hickory in the row between the Summer
							house cellar and the road, scarcely perceptible and just out of the
							ground— This is the cause of the difficulty of raising the walnut— It
							comes up so late in the Season, that the stem has not time to harden
							before it is nipped by the frost— I took from a black walnut leaf, two
							worms about half ground of the kind that I have found occasionally in
							clusters on the leaves of the black oak, voracious villains with a
							bright red head and just after the neck a hump with a shell upon it of
							the same red colour, and a short thick black hair like the bristle
							issuing from its centre; four or five other such hairs about its neck,
							and the rest of the body of a dun brown colour, thinly covered with
							brown downy hair— I had already taken two <pb n="330" type="ms"
							/>clusters of the same kind of worm, not half so much grown from the
							same black walnut—the growth of which they have arrested for the Season—
							I took a yellow caterpillar worm also, from a leaf of the best grown
							seedling white Ash of this Season that I had— The leaf was half consumed
							and the growth of the plant arrested for this year— My Son’s child
								<persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> was taken quite
							unwell this Evening with symptoms of fever— He had got a hurt by
							striking his head against the edge of a door.</p>

								ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef> was sent for and directed medicines to be
							administered to him— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached this
							morning, from 2. Peter 1.4. “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great
							and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
							nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through
							lust.” An exposition of the inestimable privilege, and the irreversible
							duty of Christians to be partakers of the divine nature, and of the
							properties in which that consists.— In the afternoon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt’s discourse was from Galatians 1.23.
							[“]But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past,
							now preacheth the faith, which once he destroyed. 24. And they glorified
							God in me.” An argument for Christianity from the conversion of <persRef
								ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>—ingenious
							and forcible, but not original— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> occupied his pew N. 61. which I have given him— I
							read the fragments of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermons of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin’s</persRef> 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume—on the
							dispositions suitable for attendance on Public worship— Pages 441 and
							442. missing with the beginning of Sermon 12. and the part of Sermon 13
							in the book, being apparently less than half the discourse— I regret the
							mutilation of them all, and still more my own incapacity to profit by
							what is profitable— The author divides his theme into dispositions
							suitable for attendance 1. on preaching. 2. on prayer 3. on Self
							improvement, or <hi rend="italic">vows</hi>. It would seem as if in his
							age and time, it was usual for Christians by way of improvement, at the
							close of public worship, to bind themselves tacitly by vows, or engage
							their consciences to do some particular thing— His observations upon
							this practice, which he rather discourages, are sensible and
							instructive— But at this time and in this country I believe no such
							practice exists— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The inflammation of my eye still painful and increasing disables me for
							all the occupations of duty and of pleasure which give wings to time,
							excepting the busy idleness of my Garden. I sowed in Pot 6. one Green
							gage Plum stone 2. Horse Plum stones and 9 Seeds from a large and fine
							flavoured red Apple which I brought yesterday from Squantum— My
							curiosity to trace the plant to its identical seed, increases with its
							disappointments; and the best chance that I have for gratifying it is by
							transplanting them, to the Garden, after raising them in numbered Pots,
							entering yearly upon my record the seed sown, and the plant proceeding
							from it, a system which after ten years of experience, I have not yet
							brought to practical maturity— The disappointment is that many of the

							Season for sowing seeds and planting Stones of fruit trees has come and
							I renew my attempts to sow varieties and to preserve the connection

							Early wild pears—and one small red wedge wild Apple for seed. I incline
							to the opinion that of the Apple, Pear, Plum and Cherry, wilding seed is
							the best especially for Stocks, and the extreme difference in the
							rapidity of growth from seeds of the same kind of fruit has sharpened my
							curiosity while it mortifies me at my ineffective devices to preserve
							the genealogy between the seed and the plant— I gathered also two or
							three wild button pears, but they do not ripen till the last of October—
							Dutton has not yet begun upon his ledge— Colburn is industriously
							working upon his and well satisfied with it— My grand child <persRef

								ref="porter-eliphalet">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Porter</persRef>— The morning Sermon was from Luke 16.10— “He that
							is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much:”— An
							excellent practical discourse, exhorting to the constant and punctual
							discharge of small duties—considering the text itself as commanding
							them, by placing them in parallel with greater things— The afternoon
							text was from 1. John 4.16. “God is love: and he that dwelleth in love,
							dwelleth in God, and God in him.” The favourite system of preaching of
							almost all the young men from the theological school at Cambridge is the
							cultivation of the benevolent affections— Perhaps this is the most
							useful end of preaching; and its tendency to civilize and mollify the
							manners of man is obvious—“emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.” but it
							forms a manner somewhat dry and apt to become tedious by uniformity.—
							These discourses are all didactic— Few of them are logical—fewer still
							imaginative; and very seldom learned; or even historical— M<hi

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>; on the insufficiency of external worship— His
							text is from Isaiah 66.3—and the discourse is well adapted to the text—
							He gives as is usual with him two explanations of the meaning of the
							prophet in this passage, and remarks that the Mosaic Law was filled with
							ceremonials to excess, because it was necessary to wean the People from
							Egyptian idolatries— But that the prophets in the time of the Captivity
							all <unclear>press</unclear> the superior efficacy of moral principles
							to ritual observances, and that the ceremonial part of the Law was
							wholly discarded by Jesus Christ. He alludes to the French Protestant
							refugees as having been exceedingly attached to their forms of worship,
							and contrasts their afflictions under the necessity of renouncing their
							country to preserve their protestant faith, with the happiness of the
							Hollanders whom he addresses and who enjoyed the freedom of Conscience
							without molestation.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> and <persRef

								>Atherton</persRef> and <persRef ref="verchild-francis"
								>Verchild</persRef> pastures, with the strip bordering upon the

							fourth is to be paid on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							November, and the remainder without interest on the first of May next;
							all the wood to be taken off by the first of April— I agreed also to
							allow him 100 dollars to clear up five Acres, of ground to put in a
							condition for the planting of white mulberry seeds or trees— I am to
							draw up an agreement in writing for the purpose and he is to go to work
							immediately. Sixteen Apple trees upon the place, and not to be cut down—
							The other project of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Field, that he
							should build four houses for me, I told him I could not agree to for
							want of the means— <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef> was
							afterwards here, with plans of an Estate <pb n="335" type="ms"/>near
							Faneuil Hall Market, in Boston, which belonged to the late <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boylston</persRef>, and which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis
							thinks it will be advisable to sell— There are two lots containing about
							7500 feet in all, and they are wanted with other Estates bordering on
							them for a Custom House— They have been appraised by <persRef
								ref="robbins-eh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. H.
								Robbins</persRef>, for something over forty-three thousand dollars,
							at which price M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis proposes to sell
							them. I concurred in the opinion, but thought it might be proper to fix
							it at the round some of 45000 dollars— The other plan was of Lands in
							Charlestown, which we are to exchange, lot for lot, foot for foot
							upwards of 3600 feet, with <persRef ref="breed-ebenezer">Ebenezer
								Breed</persRef> and others Trustees for a company— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Curtis had two drafts of Deeds, one from
							Breed to us as Trustees of the Estate of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Boylston, and the other from us to Breed; but we found upon examination
							that there must be alterations made to both of them, and they were put
							into my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> hands to
							draft the deeds for execution— I went and made a deposit at the Quincy
							Stone Bank, and then walked over the Hill to <persRef ref="colburn-asa"
								>Colburn</persRef> and <persRef ref="dutton-benjamin"
								>Dutton’s</persRef> ledges— Dutton has not yet begun upon his, but
							it seems that Colburn and he are to work the two jointly— I examined
							most of the apple and about half a dozen pear trees, with a view to try
							the seeds of the best of them. None of them are ripe, and they are all
							small— I gathered samples of three Apples finely flavoured mild acid and
							one of them curiously shaped—wedge like and looking like a small beet— I
							call it the red wedge wilding; but it will not be ripe within six weeks
							from this time— The other two I call the rose-bud, and the rock ruby,
							from their colours, and from the position of the last near an enormous
							rock in the Cranch lot— The Pears I call the crack the early wilding and
							the button— I proposed if possible to sow seeds of them all, with such
							care as to know if any of them come up, from what seeds they come, for I
							suspect that the breed of fruit trees, is according to their nature, as
							procreative of virtues and vices as the pedigree of horses. In pursuance
							of my plan I sowed a core and several seeds of the early wilding pear,
							and the seeds of one Office Apple in Pot 17. and 2 horse Plum stones,
							and mingled apple and Pear seeds in Garden square South of Nursery and
							East of the gate—in a row close to the fence— <persRef

							several of the Stone quarries upon which many of the Stone-cutters are
							at work— We visited three of those that are upon <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">his father’s</persRef> land— The Granite
							quarries are composed of hornblend which is black—of Quartz which is
							black—of Feldspar which is<space/>and of mica, which has an appearance
							like Isinglass, and seems to be Metallic— As the proportions of these
							ingredients differ the Stone is dark or light coloured, and the
							composition the general effect of which upon the eye, gives it a
							darkling blue tinge, is preferred above all others for the Walls of an
							house— So much so that much of the other Stone is unsaleable and will
							not pay for the expense of removing it— This is a mere fashion, and the
							public taste fluctuates from year to year so much with regard to the
							colour of the Stone, that the chances are a hundred to one that in the
							course of a very few years the Quincy Syenite, will be abandoned, and
							some other favourite material will take its place— The art of splitting
							and taking out the Stone is not yet fully understood.— In the third
							Chapter of the second Book of <persRef ref="goguet-antony">President
								Goguet’s</persRef> Origin of the Laws Arts and Sciences, and of
							their progress among the antient Nations there is a very exact
							description of the manner in which they split up the rocks of Granite—
							He says it is practised in lower Normandy and he conjectures that it was
							used in antient Egypt. Goguet’s work was published in 1758—and he cites
							for authority the Memoirs of the Academy <pb n="336" type="ms"/>of
							Sciences in 1751. Yet this art of splitting the granite was not
							practised or known here till about the year 1790 when the Quarries began
							to be worked—and the stone to be hammered. The granite from Chelmsford
							was for many years preferred to that from Quincy, and the latter was
							never much used till the railway was constructed in 1825 and 1826— It is
							now transported for building at New-York, New-Orleans, and the Havanna,
							and the workmen at the Quarries have nearly doubled in numbers within
							the last two years— Returning from the ledges we looked at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Price Greenleaf’s Nursery where many of
							his seedling trees are flourishing— He has several sorts of them which I
							have not—particularly the mountain ash, and the Tulip-tree, the seeds of

							made with <persRef ref="hall-james">James Hall</persRef>, whose rocks
							adjoin upon mine— He has failed in the performance of his engagements
							with me, but promises better for the future— My curiosity respecting the

							gathered a number of the worms which infest my trees with the intention
							to describe them in their various transformations, but the time fails
							me. Their varieties of form and appearance are wonderful— The two worms
							which I found a few days since upon the elm leaves, and which I would
							call the black Oak leaf worm, have gone into Chrysalis suspending
							themselves to the fibres of the leaves and to the side of the tumbler.
							The form of the grub is more like a crucified body than any thing else—
							The skin of the old caterpillar shrivelled up remains cast off at the
							side of the new one, and in the place of the former legs are 3 small
								s<unclear>hin</unclear>ing particles like drops of silver or other
							metal— I planted 6 whole Office Apples in the Seminary front row,
							between two sickly seedling plum trees— The Gardener <persRef
								ref="toohey-john">John Toohey</persRef> gathered the dwarf tree
							Apples, to save them from being gathered by some one else; as the
							Bartlett Pears have been twice gathered— I planted also in Pot 13. 1.
							Bartlett Pear Core, and two Seeds. 15. Office Apple seeds and 2. Horse
							Plum Stones— I received this evening a Letter from the Mayor of Boston,
								<persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							went to <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.

							there, nor in the City— Second disappointment— I went to the Apartment
							of the Historical Society having <pb n="337" type="ms"/>procured the key
							at the Savings Bank below— I examined the Library to see if I could find
							the debates of the Virginia Convention upon the revisal of their State
							Constitution; but it was not to be found— I did find however a Memorial
							and Remonstrance presented to the general Assembly of Virginia in 1785,
							in consequence of a Bill, brought into that Assembly for the
							Establishment of Religion by Law— This paper was written by <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef>, and some notice was taken it
							in <persRef ref="barbour-john">John S. Barbour’s</persRef> Eulogy— I was
							very desirous of seeing it and found it unexpectedly here— I borrowed it

							and conversed with <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin">M<hi

							District in the place of <persRef ref="jackson-william2">William

						<p>I returned to the composition of the Eulogy upon <persRef

							morning I prepared a new exordium which will enable me to abridge the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef> the present agent of
							the Railway company was here, and showed me the plan of a new rail, for
							which they wish to purchase or to hire a small strip of my land— I told

							any thing in my power for the accommodation of the company, though I had

							taken, and that which they wanted belonging to me; and that I should
							refer them for any arrangement which they might desire, to my Son
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, for the adjustment

							had a fine fruit garden, especially well stocked with Plums; and said if
							it was not too late he would send me some white Gages from a tree so
							prolific that he had once received 49 dollars for the plums produced
							from it, sold at Boston market, besides a plentiful supply for the use
							of his own family. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson has heard of
							my humours about fruit trees— I planted 1. <unclear>Eperne</unclear>
							Core 5 Porter Apple-seeds 3. Peach Stones 2. Horse Plum Stones, and some
							dry white currants in the Seminary front row, from the seedling Plum
							tree to the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Elm— <persRef
								ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> is repairing the Seminary fence,

								Greenleaf’s</persRef> ground— Of the Oak trees of which he has a

							the berries of the horn beam; and I found only of the Apple-trees one
							the seeds of which were presently ripe and the fruit of that was bitter.
							I gathered <pb n="338" type="ms"/>some of the seeds to sow, and call it

						<p>The Sun rose clear, and in about ten minutes went into a dark cloud; a
							symptom which I hold infallible of foul weather— This time however it
							portended not much of a storm— There was rain about the middle of the
							day; but not much— I resumed the attempt to finish the Eulogy of
							<persRef ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef>, but without success— After changing the exordium I would adapt
							the concluding sentences to the introduction, and this is a task of no
							easy execution— I sowed 3. Porter Apple seeds, and 3. white sugar Pear
							seeds in Pot 4—where there are already one Nursery seedling Strawberry,
							and 2 Ash seeds— And wishing to make more accurately the experiment of
							planting whole Apples, I planted 7. whole Office Apples in a cross row,
							between two small seedling elms in the bed next the fence South and East
							of the Garden gate. The Apples at the two ends and that at the centre
							being entire, and two on each side of the centre cut into quarters— With
							several Porter Apple seeds 2 unripe horn beam seeds, and one Plum stone.
							None of which I expect will come up— Three Strawberry-Plants have come
							up from seeds sown by me last Summer in the Seminary, adjoining the
							gate— They thrive rapidly and have thrown out runners in all directions—
							I had the ground this day broken up, and the derivative plants fixed in
							radiated points from the centres to make them cover the whole bed— The

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> this morning, from John 20.29. “Jesus saith unto him,
								<persRef ref="thomas2">Thomas</persRef>, because thou hast seen me,
							thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
							believed.” The discourse was upon the unreasonableness of disbelieving
							credible testimony, and the necessity of Faith— A doctrine to which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt frequently returns— He said the words
							of the text were of a severe rebuke to Thomas upon his incredulity, and
							were deserved— He related the whole transaction recorded in the Chapter,
							and reviewed all the Circumstances, which should have induced implicit
							faith on the part of Thomas in the averment of his, associate
							Apostles—that they had seen Jesus— The whole Sermon was then a copious
							and ingenious argument for belief without seeing—or faith— <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> dined with us.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon discourse, was from
							James 1.19. [“]Wherefore my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
							hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath”— A dissuasion from anger— The
							antithesis of swift and slow, as applied to hearing and speaking is
							impressive— The swiftness to hear implies not only an attentive ear, but
							an ardent impulse to go and seek the Speaker, and the transition from
							slowness of Speech to slowness of wrath, is an indirect admonition that
							wrath is the natural offspring of hasty speech— I read the first Sermon
							of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon Perseverance; by which
							he means what is commonly called the Perseverance of the Saints— The
							text is from Hebrews 12.1. and there seemed to be something of the
							School Divinity in his treatment of the Subject— I should have preferred
							a Dissertation upon Perseverance, as a property of the human character,
							and a duty of Christian morality— He analyzes the text, and finds it
							divisible into three parts, exhibiting imperious duties,—bright
							examples, and wise precautions— But the composition is too artificial,
							and the transcendant importance of perseverance as a moral obligation,
							and its overruling influence to promote the success of all high
							enterprize <pb n="339" type="ms"/>is not set forth in this discourse—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave notice that the <persRef
								ref="taylor-edward">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef> of Boston, would
							deliver a Lecture on Temperance this Evening at 7. O’Clock at the
							Episcopal Church— I went with my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to hear it— The Lecture was a Sermon from Titus
							2.11. For the grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all
							men, 12. Teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
							should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world— The
							discourse was delivered without notes, nearly two hours long, and full
							of repetitions; but well adapted to produce effect upon a teachable
							auditory, occasionally eloquent and sometimes pathetic— The Style was
							methodistical, and the creed trinitarian— The <persRef

								>William Spear</persRef>, and my Tenant <persRef ref="carr-john2"

							38 feet square. While I was there <persRef ref="johnson-benjamin2">M<hi

							seedling opposite the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michael Pear tree
							adjoining the Summer house cellar— Seed Sown October 1833— Growth of
							1834. 18 inches—of 1835 38 inches; of this Season 21 inches. The tree is
							now 6 feet 5 inches high— This to me is a phenomenon— I have sown many
							thousands of Apple Seeds, and have observed many hundreds of Seedlings—
							Never one to compare with this— I have at least 100 Seedlings of this
							year— The tallest is not more than 5 inches high— I filled Pot 18 with
							4. Amory Pear Seeds 4. Porter Apple-seeds a Holland Peach Stone, and
							Flushing Plum Stone. And sowed mingled Office and red wormwood Apple
							seeds, 2 Peach Stones and 2. Flushing Plum Stones, in front Seminary
							row, from first Elm to young fir tree—with four white sugar Pear Cores—
							I put down Stakes in the Pots inscribed with the Seeds sown in them.</p>

							its capacity— I had undertaken this task with a most painful anxiety and
							fear that I might be disabled from performing it altogether— An anxiety
							much sharpened by the illness which for the last three days had almost
							extinguished my voice— I did get through, but with extreme difficulty;
							with frequent imperfections of delivery; without being able to raise my

						<p>I indulged myself this morning with a longer term of repose than is my
							usual custom, and after the tension and anxiety of preparation for the
							last two months gave myself a holiday for idleness. The day was so cold
							that I could write but little in my cham- and I spent part of the time
							before dinner in my garden, and after dinner in my Seminary, digging for
							exercise and sowing seeds for future vegetation alteri seculo although
							these places have lost the attraction of Spring and Summer— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston and returned
							to dine— I planted a row of dwarf Apple seeds from the young Baldwin
							Apple-tree next the road to the Summer house cellar, and a row of Dexter
							Apple Seeds in front of the Seminary fence, from the fir tree to the
							second elm. My purpose is if life be allowed me to observe for two or
							three Summers the difference of growth of the seedlings from these and
							other varieties of the Apple-tree— I have several seedlings of this
							year, I believe from the seeds of the dwarf tree— They are living and
							appear to be healthy, but are not one inch high; while the stem of the
							tall seedling opposite the Summer house cellar has grown 21 inches this
							Session: one of the shoots from a bud inserted in August 1834 and which
							first opened a year afterwards has grown full three feet this Season—
							This difference of growth in a Season, from one inch to three feet, in
							varieties of the same fruit is the most remarkable phenomenon that has
							struck my observation— I would gladly continue and give precision and
							variety to my experiments till they should end in some useful result;
							but I have not the time— Two young men from Boston were here this
							afternoon; one of them named <persRef ref="u">Glover</persRef> who
							enquired, if I would sell my Estate at the Corner of Tremont and
							Boylston Streets, which I said I would, but that having no particular
							desire to sell I should ask a high price for it. He enquired what price;
							and I said I should be glad to enquire what it would be thought worth by
							others— That I had given twenty-thousand dollars for it more than thirty
							years ago, and I asked what he would estimate as its value himself—he
							was not willing to say— I told him I would in the course of two or three
							days fix a price which I would take for it, and send him word by my Son;
							at whose office he said he would call— I asked Charles what he thought
							would be a reasonable price to fix upon it; he said thirty thousand
							dollars, and I <pb n="345" type="ms"/>authorised him to name that to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Glover as my price— <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 32— The weather
							cleared up in the Night, and the Sun rose majestically— It was too cold
							for me to be able to write in my chamber without a fire; and I had
							various reasons for abstaining from making it— I walked before breakfast
							round, by the meeting house, and the Scotch pond; and over the hills
							back to my house— After breakfast <persRef ref="spear-william">deacon
								Spear</persRef> came with his horse and waggon— I went with him and
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and we took up
								<persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef>, to the lot of
							woodland adjoining upon mine and upon <persRef ref="u">Owen’s</persRef>
							field—the lot which Peter Turner had to sell— We examined it, as far as
							I thought necessary, and I agreed to give him for it at the rate of
							fifty dollars an acre— He promised to send for <persRef
								ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Humphrey</persRef> very shortly to have it surveyed and a plan of it
							made, and to furnish me a perfect title— This afternoon <persRef
								ref="waters-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac
								Waters</persRef>, a member of the Common Council of Boston, and
								<persRef ref="eastburn-john">John H. Eastburn</persRef> the City
							Printer came out and brought a Letter from <persRef
								ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Armstrong</persRef> the Mayor, enclosing the concurrent vote of the
							board of Alderman, and the Common Council, requesting a copy of my
							Eulogy, for the press— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eastburn,
							that as in the case of the Eulogy upon <persRef ref="monroe-james">James
								Monroe</persRef>, I should probably print much more than was
							delivered; and would revise the manuscripts so as to send them to him
							to-morrow morning. He promised to send me out by the mail a proof sheet
							every morning; and that he would print the work in a Style, equal to
							that of the Eulogy upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— He also
							promised to apply to <persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell</persRef>, for a copy of his
							prayer—and for copies of the Ode and Hymn that were performed— <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> returned this Evening
							to <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams’s</persRef>—and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, went there to
							an evening party— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> was here a few minutes, and went <pb n="346"
								type="ms"/>hence also to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
							Adams’s— I was engaged all the Evening in revising my manuscripts for
							the Press— I extract about 20 pages of my first manuscript, and yet omit
							nearly as much as I retain— The Eulogy as printed will be shorter than
							that upon <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>; and even than
							that upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— I did not finish my
							revisal.</p>

							grows later, and the darkness of the morning, and the chills of autumn
							increase, my rising hour falls into arrears, and I can no longer write
							with comfort before breakfast— I am greatly relieved from the labour of
							writing for the Eulogy, and feel like a Schoolboy released from
							recitation— But I have great arrears of correspondence to redeem—and
							must soon think of departure with my family for the winter at
							Washington.</p>
