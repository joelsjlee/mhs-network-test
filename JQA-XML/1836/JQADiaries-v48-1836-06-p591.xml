								<persRef ref="hunt-hiram">Hiram P. Hunt</persRef> asked leave to
							make a statement of personal concern to himself—objected to. but the
							rule was suspended 126 to 36— Hunt’s complaint was that a pamphlet

							Slavery committee had been published by the printers of the Globe in
							which the yeas and nays on the first Resolution of the Slavery

								>Claiborne</persRef> of Mississippi and other members asked leave
							also to make Statements; but were refused— The Bill for the

						<p>I was detained at home this morning so that it was close upon 11. O’Clock
							when I reached the House— They were engaged upon a Bill just received
							from the Senate changing the time of the annual meeting of Congress—to
							the first Monday of November, and providing that the first Session of
							each Congress shall close on the first Monday of May— After some debate
							the previous question was carried on the passage of the Bill to a third
							reading, for which I voted— And I then moved that the Bill should be
							referred to a select Committee with Instructions to strike out that part
							of it which relates to the time of closing the Sessions in May— This
							introduced a debate during which I went with the Conferees of the House
							to meet the conferees of the Senate upon the disagreeing votes of the
							two Houses, on the Bill for carrying into execution the Convention with
							Spain. We met in the Committee Room, of the Judiciary Committee of the
							Senate— The conferees of the Senate were <persRef ref="clay-henry">H.
								Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="porter-alexander">Alexander
								Porter</persRef> and <persRef ref="king-william2">William R.
								King</persRef>— Those of the House, were <persRef ref="mason-john5"

								>Judson</persRef>, <persRef ref="cramer-john">John Cramer</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin">Benjamin Hardin</persRef>, with
							myself as Chairman— After a short conversation, the two Committees
							agreed, that there should be one Commissioner instead of three; but not
							the <persRef ref="butler-benjamin">Attorney General</persRef>. one or
							two other slight modifications of the Bill were also agreed upon— The
							Papers being with the Senate, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							promised to draw up the report, according to the agreement, and to
							communicate it to me. In a quarter of an hour we were agreed, and Hardin
							came in just as we were separating— On returning to the House I found
							the joint resolution fixing the annual Meeting of Congress on the first
							Monday in November had passed as it came from the Senate, by the
							Previous Question— The Indian annuity Bill, with the amendments of the
							Senate, was debated by <persRef ref="bell-john">J. Bell</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>—<persRef

						<p>At the House the first subject taken up was the Resolutions of the

							the Sales of the public Lands among the States, and of expunging the
							Resolutions of the Senate against the <unclear>. . .</unclear>, upon
							which <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> of Maryland claimed
							the floor— I asked him to suspend his remarks to give an opportunity for

							about an hour in answer to the Attack upon him by Jenifer, on the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month; and <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> replied—this was a second
							edition of their former altercation— Near noon the Maryland Resolutions
							were laid on the table, and the States and Territories were called over
							for Petitions and Memorials— I presented twenty-two Memorials and
							Remonstrances against the admission of Arkansas into the Union as a
							Slave State, and against the Article in the Constitution of that State
							respecting Slavery—they were all laid on the table, by the Resolution of
							the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May— I presented also two other
							Petitions, which were referred one to the Committee on Revolutionary
							Pensions, and the other to the Committee on the judiciary— There were a
							multitude of other Petitions, against the Slavery Article in the
							Constitution of Arkansas—all laid on the table without debate— <persRef
								ref="sevier-ambrose">Sevier</persRef> offered a Resolution to make
							the Bill to fix the Northern boundary of Ohio, and the Bills for the

							enclosing a Letter to the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker

							an order to bring him bodily before them to state his claims upon the
							public Treasury. In his Letter to me he asked my advice, and expressed a
							wish that I would visit him in prison— I accordingly went this morning
							to the Prison, and had a conversation with him. I told him that his
							petition requested what neither house had power to grant—and described
							to him the kind of petition suited to his case, and promised if he would
							prepare such a petition to present it for him— At the House— Reports
							from Committees were received— <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef>
							of New-York renewed his motion to suspend the rules, to offer a
							Resolution to fix a day for considering the Resolution from the Senate
							to adjourn Congress on the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of May— I
							voted this time in favour of the motion; but there were not quite two
							thirds to support it— The question whether the Land Bill from the Senate
								(<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay’s</persRef>) should be referred to the Committee of the whole
							on the Union recurred. Yeas 97. nays 96. The Speaker voted in the
							negative 97 to 97. and the vote was not carried and therefore lost.— The
							next question of reference was to the Committee of Ways and
							Means—debated till one, when the order of the day was called— The
							fortification Bill— The question was upon striking out 150000 and
							inserting 200000 for the fortification of Charleston— <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> made a Speech of an
							hour and a half in answer to a printed Speech of <persRef

								<persRef ref="hunt-hiram">Hiram P. Hunt</persRef> of New-York in a

							Altercation between Townes and Thompson. Then <persRef
								ref="storer-bellamy">Storer</persRef>, moved to reduce the

						<p>At the House, the Bills for the fixing the Northern Boundary of Ohio and
							the Bills for the admission of Michigan and Arkansas into the Union as
							States,—the first Bill was that for fixing the Northern Boundary of the
							State of Ohio— <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> from the
							Committee on the Judiciary moved to lay the Bill on the table, upon the
							ground that by the Bill for the admission of Michigan into the Union,
							the same provision was inserted, whereby the special Bill to fix the
							Northern boundary of Ohio, became superfluous. This gave rise to a sharp
							short debate in which the Ohio members and especially <persRef
								ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> took a very heated part—
								<persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> of Indiana sprung the
							previous question, before the Bill had even been read— The vote for
							seconding the previous question was 69 to 103.— Then further hot debate
							till the question upon laying the Bill upon the table was carried 103 to
							103 and decided by the casting vote of the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker</persRef> to the great annoyance of the Ohio members— The
							next Bill in order was the Michigan Bill, which <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved to postpone till next Monday,
							to take up first the Arkansas Bill; to make it sure that the Slave State
							shall first come in— Another fiery debate, Wise expressed a fear that a
							restriction upon Slavery would be proposed, and if adopted by the House,
							he said he would propose a section to introduce Slavery into Michigan.
								<persRef ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> gave a sort of promise
							that the proposition concerning Slavery, should be made in the debate on
							the Arkansas Bill— I said if no other member would offer such a proposal
							I would. A question then arose whether both Bills <hi rend="italic"
								>must</hi> be referred to the Committee of the whole, or not, as
							indirectly making a charge upon the People— The Speaker after much
							decided upon a precedent of 1832. decided that they <hi rend="italic"

								Grandchildren</persRef> rode with me to the Capitol. At the House
							sundry reports from Committees were received, and one or two Bills were
							passed— <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> moved to take up
							the Bill fixing the Northern Boundary of Ohio, which was yesterday laid
							on the table— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> decided
							that the unfinished business of yesterday was the Bill for fixing the
							boundary of Ohio and admitting Michigan as a State in the Union, and
							that the order of business by the rule of the House could be changed
							only by a vote of two thirds— <persRef ref="storer-bellamy"
								>Storer</persRef> appealed from this decision, and argued that the
							unfinished business of the House was the three Bills which had been all
							made the special order of the day yesterday and that although the House
							laid one of the Bills on the table, and referred the two others to the
							Committee of the whole on the Union, yet what was done in Committee was
							not unfinished business of the House, and a mere majority might this day
							take up the Bill laid on the table yesterday, instead of that upon which
							the Committee debated yesterday— Storer finally withdrew his appeal, and
							the House went again into Committee of the whole on the Union, <persRef
								ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> in the Chair on the Bill
							fixing the northern Boundary of Ohio and for the admission of Michigan
							into the Union— <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> read a

								<persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> and he by <persRef
								ref="love-thomas">Love</persRef> of New-York, who offered an
							Amendment which he intended to offer— I then spoke upon the amendment

							and <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> (<persRef

						<p>about one O’Clock in the morning, twice successively, the Committee found
							itself without a Quorum— The first time, after sending for all the
							members in and about the capitol, a bare quorum was restored—and the
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> left the Chair and
								<persRef ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> resumed it, without
							waiting for a vote of the House— The second time they could not make a
							quorum and were obliged to resort to a Call of the House which absorbed
							nearly four hours in its various stages till the absentees were brought
							in, in Custody of the <persRef ref="dorsey-roderick">Serjeant at
								Arms</persRef>, and required to offer their excuses for absence— The
							first was <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> one of
							the oldest and most laborious members of the House, whose excuses were
							an indignant rebuke of the House itself— <persRef ref="johnson-joseph"
								>Joseph Johnson</persRef> of Virginia was the second and <persRef
								ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> of Kentucky the third. On being
							asked by the Speaker what excuse he had to offer he said he did not know
							that he had any good excuse to give— The house voted to excuse him, and
							then to excuse all the rest— There were 81 absentees returned without
							excuse, and from twenty to thirty brought in under custody— Then the
							House resumed business, and the Speaker again left the Chair without
							motion or vote of the House, and Speight resumed it— I then at 5. In the
							morning offered my amendment to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							Section of the Bill for the admission of Arkansas; it was very short and
							I said very little in presenting it—but it kindled a fiery debate, of
							three hours in which <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, <persRef

								>Briggs</persRef>, <persRef ref="hoar-samuel">Hoare</persRef>,

							Slavery used insulting language, which I demanded should be taken down
							by the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef>, but which Speight
							the chairman would not notice— My amendment was rejected by tellers 32
							to 90. About 8 O’Clock <persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> came
							in and offered a much stronger Amendment which was rejected— <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> offered an amendment to

								<persRef ref="chambers-john">Chambers</persRef> of Kentucky made a
							point of order whether the Speaker was not bound to take the Chair for
							this day— He would not. Wise spoke another hour— Then the Committee rose
							and reported the two Bills; and the house adjourned at 11. O’Clock— I
							rode home with <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">S. C. Phillips</persRef>—

								Abbott Lawrence’s</persRef> lodgings and left there 100 copies of
							the Pamphlet on the Texas Insurrection which he had requested me to

							the House while the Journal of Thursday was reading the Reporter for the

							assailed with an iron, sharp pointed cane, the <persRef
								ref="codd-robert">reporter for the Southern Patriot</persRef> and
							struck at him as he sat in his Seat three times. Wheeler stood at the
							entrance of the Seat; and stepped up as he gave the strokes of the cane—
							Codd, the Southern Patriot Reporter, was cooped up in his Seat, from
							which he arose and held up his arm to guard his head. The <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> instantly ordered the <persRef
								ref="dorsey-roderick">Serjeant at Arms</persRef> to turn Wheeler out
							of the Hall, and to take him into custody, and a confused and desultory
							debate arose and a resolution was adopted directing that the two persons
							(without naming them) should be kept in custody of the Serjeant at arms,
							till further order— The debate was continued, and sundry proposals were
							made, till a Committee of five were appointed to consider and report to
							the House on the case— The remainder of the Journal was then read and I
							moved an amendment which after a paltering and equivocating debate was
							rejected by yeas and nays 32 to 133. The amendment was a rectification
							of a false Statement, that <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef>
							had been yesterday morning excused for reasons given by him, when in
							fact he declared that he had no good reason to give— The special order
							of this day was a multitude of Pension Bills, which were considered in
							Committee of the whole— <persRef ref="craig-robert">Craig</persRef> in
							the Chair a large number of them were reported to the house and passed
							to a third reading—several were however laid aside for discussion
							hereafter— Near five O’Clock the Committees appointed to examine the two
							men between whom the affray of the morning had passed, reported in part
							that Codd, the assaulted party should be forthwith discharged which was,
							unanimously agreed to—and <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef> of
							New-York offered a Resolution that the Speaker do issue his warrant to
							the Serjeant at arms to arrest and detain Wheeler, and at my suggestion
							added the cause of the arrest—which Resolution was also adopted without
							opposition— House adjourned after 5. and I walked home, with rain.</p>

							was substituted for it and carried, and my amendment was rejected by

							moved the suspension of the rules to take up a Resolution for supplying
							the new Members of the present Congress with certain books which have
							been received by the members of former Congresses— The Rules were

							driven through by the previous question; and after it was passed they
							began to think that some of the Books were out of print, and could not
							be distributed, without the expense of a reprint. exceptions were
							moved.— I moved a reconsideration of the vote that the question should
							be now put— The hour for which the rules were suspended passed away—an
							attempt to suspend them again failed for want of the two thirds— The
							Supplementary Michigan and Arkansas Bills were passed; and the Bill for
							establishing a judicial district in Michigan was at the third reading,
							when it was discovered that the Salary in the engrossed Bill remained at
							2000 dollars, though by an amendment yesterday adopted it had been
							reduced to 1500—of which amendment there was no notice on the Journal— I
							suggested that while they were making this amendment they might consider
							whether another might not be expedient—a proviso that the Bill should
							not take effect until Michigan should be admitted into the Union—
								<persRef ref="bond-william2">Bond</persRef> said he had thought of

							the assault by <persRef ref="wheeler-henry">H. G. Wheeler</persRef> on

							by the assault upon <persRef ref="codd-robert">Codd</persRef>, in the
							Hall while the House was in Session had been guilty of a contempt and
							violation of the privileges of the House— 2. That he should be excluded

							3. That he should be imprisoned in custody of the <persRef
								ref="dorsey-roderick">Serjeant at Arms</persRef>, for the remainder
							of the Session. The House were beginning to discuss the Resolutions,
							when at the motion of <persRef ref="hiester-william">Heister</persRef>,
							the Serjeant at arms was ordered to bring Wheeler to the Bar of the
							House which he did— After several proposals of Amendments were rejected,
							the first Resolution of the Committee was adopted— The second with a
							qualification till the end of the present Session, and instead of the
							third a Resolution to discharge him from custody which was forthwith
							done— <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Abijah Mann</persRef>, was alone to
							insist upon his imprisonment for the remainder of the Session— But his
							argument was hooted out of the House— The Bill for distributing the
							proceeds of the Sales of the Public Lands, was first in order with an
							unsettled question to what Committee it should be referred. Ways and
							Means, Public Lands, or a Select Committee with instructions to report
							the Bill without amendment, a wrangling disputation of amendments then
							succeeded; and <persRef ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> moved as a
							test question to lay the Bill on the table. Call of the House 206
							members answered to their names— The vote to lay the Bill on the table
							was lost 96 to 110— Then the amendment process recommenced, till one

							the item for the fortification in Charleston Harbour South Carolina <pb
								n="607" type="ms"/>from 150000 to 200000 was lost on the yeas and
							nays, by a vote of 95 to 98— Then a reconsideration was moved by

								<persRef ref="pinckney-henry">H. L. Pinckney</persRef>, and lost
							by<space/>to<space/>A subsequent item of the Appropriation Bill was then
							taken up, and Speight moved a Resolution to take a recess from half past
							two till four O’Clock this and every other day till the end of the
							Session— Objection made, he moved a suspension of the Rule, and carried
							it, and the Resolution— Accordingly there was a recess from half-past
							two till four, which I passed, writing in the Chamber of the Committee
							of Manufactures— On returning to the Hall two minutes after four I found
							the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> in the Chair and the

							amendment reported by the Committee of the whole of 200000 dollars was
							at the motion of <persRef ref="hard-gideon">Hard</persRef> of New-York

						<p>This was one of those days of intense heat, which disqualify me for all
							active exertion. I attended alone the morning and afternoon service at
							the Presbyterian Church— There was none at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Elliot’s</persRef> morning text was from Numbers 10–29. [“]And
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> said unto <persRef ref="hobab"
								>Hobab</persRef>, the son of <persRef ref="reuel">Raguel</persRef>
							the Midianite, Moses father in Law, We are journeying unto the place of
							which the Lord said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will
							do thee good; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel”— There
							was something out of the line of Presbyterian commonplaces in this text—
							The account of Hobab’s connection with Moses and the Israelites is one
							of the episodical details of the Exodus from Egypt— It is one of those
							minute occurrences which accredit that most wonderful event one of the
							numerous internal evidences of the truth of the History, which after all
							so heavily taxes human belief— The afternoon text was from Matthew 5.14.
							“Ye are the light of the world.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot
							composes and reads his Sermons; which are accordingly sensible and
							rational discourses, without enthusiasm, and without movements of fervid
							eloquence— From the tenour of his morning prayer, it appeared that the
							church was yet upon the lookout for a pastor— There was a light thunder
							shower this afternoon, while we were at Church, and the air of the
							Evening was fresher, though still oppressively sultry— I have agreed to
							give <persRef ref="wilson-john8">John Wilson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wilson-mary">his wife</persRef> 25 dollars a month from this
							day forward— Their wages have been hitherto 20— I have been some days
							occupied in preparing my Report of the proceedings in Committee of the

							admitting the State of Arkansas into the Union— My correspondence
							consequently falls into arrears again. My Speech on the rations, comes
							back with echoes of thundering vituperation from the South and West, and
							with one universal shout of applause from the North and East— This is a
							cause upon which I am entering at the last Stage of Life, and with the
							certainty that I cannot advance in it far— My Career must close leaving
							the cause at the threshold— To open the way for others, is all that I
							can do. The cause is good and great.</p>

								<persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel, where I left a
							card and a note for <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Pope</persRef>—and lastly at <persRef
								ref="peyton-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peyton’s</persRef>
							where were <persRef ref="loud-jacob;loud-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Jacob H. Loud</persRef> of Plymouth— At half past ten I found the
							house in Session in Committee of the whole. <persRef ref="loyall-george"
								>G. Loyall</persRef> in the Chair, upon Bills relating to the
							District of Columbia. Several of these were passed with little
							discussion, but with some light skirmishing on the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> Monument Bill— The
							joint-Resolution from the Senate concerning the Smithsonian bequest had
							been referred to this Committee, and made part of this order this
							morning at the motion of <persRef ref="thomas-francis">F.
								Thomas</persRef>— When it was taken up, I moved the Bill from our
							select Committee as an amendment; and it was adopted, reported passed to
							a third reading, and passed without opposition. <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> asked the reason for the
							large bond required of the agent by the Bill which I gave him, and he
							acquiesced. <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> shewed signs of
							opposition, but made none. <persRef ref="hamer-thomas">Hamer</persRef>
							of Ohio asked for the yeas and nays to record his name against the Bill,
							but the House refused them and passed the Bill with less than ten
							negative votes— I went into the Senate and explained to <persRef
								ref="leigh-benjamin">B. W. Leigh</persRef>, the Chairman of the
							Senatorial Committee, the reason of the change from a joint Resolution
							to a Bill; and for requiring a bond of the agent. He approved the change
							to the Bill, but expressed doubts as to the expediency of requiring the
							Bond— At one O’Clock the House went again into Committee of the whole on
							the Harbour Bill, <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">L. Lincoln</persRef> in
							the Chair—recess at 1/2 past 2. I passed the time in the Chamber of the
							Committee of Manufactures and the Library— Resumed the Harbour Bill
							followed by the Light-House Bill— Committee rose for want of a Quorum
							before 9. Adjourned— Walk home with <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard"

						<p>I was unwell in the Night and forced to leap from my bed, for the cramp
							in my left leg, which however I escaped— Copious rain almost all night
							and with little intermission throughout this day— Fire in our dining
							room— S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church was opened after an
							interval of five weeks for making repairs— I went over, and found there
							only <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> with five men, apparently of the workmen. I then
							went to the Presbyterian Church, and found <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot</persRef> making a short
							prayer, with four men for his whole auditory— There was no other
							service, and I came home— <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Pope</persRef>, late Governor of
							the Territory of Arkansas, and before and since a Citizen of Kentucky,
							dined with us, together with <persRef

								Frye</persRef> were also invited to come, but were deterred probably
							by the heavy-rain M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope remained with us
							till past nine in the Evening— In the years 1807 and 8. I sat with him
							in the Senate of the United States. He was then from Kentucky in the
							prime of life, and the full tide of popularity; though he had then lost
							his right arm— In 1810, while we were in Russia, he married <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef> Sister <persRef
								ref="pope-eliza">Eliza Johnson</persRef>, by whom he had <persRef
								ref="u;cocke-elizabeth">two beautiful daughters</persRef>— They are
							all dead— The youngest daughter was married, and died within a year or
							two leaving an <persRef ref="pope-john2">infant Son</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="cocke-mary">daughter</persRef>— Pope was long the
							rival and competitor of <persRef ref="clay-henry">H. Clay</persRef> in
							Kentucky, and finally overshadowed by his superior influence and talents
							Pope then betook himself to Jacksonism; contributed much to secure to
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> the electoral vote
							of that State in 1828. He was scantily rewarded by the Government of the
							Territory of Arkansas, from which about two years since he was extruded,
							and returned to Kentucky— He is now almost broken-hearted with political
							disappointment, and private calamity in the loss of his children;—and
							talks of going to settle in Texas.— He struggled however to be and was
							cheerful.</p>
