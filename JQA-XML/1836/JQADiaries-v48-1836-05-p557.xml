							read prayers for the fourth Sunday after Easter and preached from 1.
							Peter 1.25. [“]But the word of the Lord endureth forever. And this is

							Hawley requested the person in the pew to write his name and mark the

							[“]And he spake to them a parable— Behold the fig tree and all the trees
							30. When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that
							summer is now nigh at hand. 31. So likewise ye, when ye see these things
							come to pass, know ye, that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.” A brief
							and seasonable discourse; for the Peach and cherry trees are just now in
							full blossom; about three weeks later than the usual Season— <persRef

							from Plymouth signed by 100 females— Its appearance was somewhat

							wrote also—to <persRef ref="walsh-robert">R. Walsh</persRef>, and read

						<p>On reaching the House this morning I was informed that <persRef

							Bill N. 99— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee inclined to the opinion
							that it would not be expedient to make any reduction of duties at the

							the meeting of the House, immediately after the reading of the Journals,
								<persRef ref="pinckney-henry">Henry L. Pinckney</persRef> announced
							the decease of his late Colleague Richard I. Manning, upon whom with
							much sensibility he pronounced an obituary panegyric— A Resolution to

								>Burch’s</persRef> office where I examined the Constitutions of
							Alabama, and of Missouri—and finally into the Library, where I looked
							for documents respecting the first enactment of the English Navigation
							Act— There is in the Statutes at Large, and in the Statutes of the Realm
							a chasm from 1640 to 1660. not a single Act of that period is in the

								>Strickland</persRef> as Ambassadors to the Netherlands— The

						<p>The House met at ten O’Clock— The Resolution for watering the

							yeas and nays there was found no Quorum— Then was moved a call of the
							House, and the yeas and nays taken upon it 79 to 37. but as several
							other members came in while the yeas and nays were taking the further
							proceedings upon the call was suspended— The Resolution for watering the
							avenue was resumed, and after an hour’s debate was laid on the table by
							yeas and nays 88 to 84— Several Bills from the Senate were twice read
							and referred to Committees— At Noon the House went into Committee of the
							whole on the Union; <persRef ref="mason-john5">John Y Mason</persRef> in
							the Chair, upon the Bill making appropriations for the support of the
							army for the year 1836— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> then withdrew his proposed amendment of
							increasing by more than a Million the appropriation for arming the
							fortifications, and introduce it into another Bill— Among the
							Appropriations was one of 725 dollars to pay taxes for 1835 assessed by
							the State of Pennsylvania, on the United States Arsenal on the
							Schuylkill river, which after some debate was struck out.— There was a
							long debate on a motion of <persRef ref="sevier-ambrose"
								>Sevier</persRef> of Arkansas to strike out the appropriation for
							Fort Gibson, and to substitute the same sum for another fort to which
							the troops at Fort Gibson should be removed— Sevier’s amendment was

							together with the amendments of the Senate to the Navy Appropriation
							Bill, amended— <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> objected to
							the Sections proposed by the Senate for authorizing a surveying and

							of the House, and reported by the Committee of the whole, and moved to

								>Mercer</persRef> said he could not vote for the Bill without the

							Cities of Washington, Georgetown and Alexandria was debated in Committee

							opposed in a two hours speech by <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin">B.

								ref="u">his eldest son</persRef>, a youth of 15 or
								<unclear>16</unclear> years of age, and his Sermon was obvious
							written under the sorrows of this bereavement— He was more pathetic than
							usual; but the Psalms of the day were yet more impressive— His afternoon
							text was from 1. Timothy 4.9. [“]This is a faithful saying, and worthy
							of all acceptation”— Rather a singular text, without reference to the
							saying itself; which in the Epistle is a declaration of the superior
							profitableness of godliness, to bodily exercise— The <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> was at the morning service—
							Notice was given that the repairs of the Church would be commenced
							to-morrow week; and afternoon there was a prayer for a person at the

							hopeless— The last Night was not to me a night of repose—nor of much
							refreshing sleep. I shall henceforth speak in the House of

							to the Military or other Officer of the United States, or the States
							relative to the defence of the Western frontier and all correspondence
							between them and the government respecting the same. The resolution was
							received and lies over one day— The Resolutions of the Legislature of

							Lands, were taken up, and <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
								Williams</persRef> made a party Speech against <persRef
								ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef>— Then half an hour was wasted in

							the Bill prepared for incorporating the Manufacturing company at
							Georgetown—which after adopting a proviso reserving the right of
							Congress to alter, or repeal the act at their discretion, I was directed
							to report to the House— Denny alone voted against reporting the Bill,
							but proposed two proviso’s one forbidding the company to issue notes in
							the nature of Bank Bills—and the other requiring some provision for the
							education of the children employed in the factory— But they failed— In
							the House the Resolution offered yesterday by <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>, was adopted without
							opposition— I read an Article published in the Globe this morning,
							stating that the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United
								States</persRef> had declared that he had no recollection of having
							been consulted concerning the boundary in the Florida Treaty of 1819— I
							reasserted the fact in the most explicit manner— Reports of Committees
							were then called, and after them Bills from the Senate. A question
							whether the Bill for distributing the proceeds of the Public Lands,
							should be referred to the Committee of the whole on the Union, to the
							Committee of Ways and Means, <hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi> or to the
							Committee on the Public Lands—was ardently debated till one O’Clock—
							Then three Bills reported by the Chairman of the Military Committee,
							were debated till two in Committee of the whole and reported to the
							House. Some discussion of a bill to make a military road of 1000 miles
							through the territory, West of Missouri and Arkansas— Then at two
							O’Clock, the House went into Committee of the whole on the Union,
								<persRef ref="mann-abijah">Abijah Mann</persRef> in the Chair upon
							the Army Bill; and M’Comas made a Speech of 2 hours to about 50
							members—the rest being all at the races— The Committee rose, and in the
							House an amendment by the Senate to the exploring expedition section of
							the Navy Appropriation Bill was sharply debated, by <persRef
								ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> of Kentucky—and me— The
							amendment was finally agreed to by yeas and nays 80 to 65— I met
								<persRef ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> and told him the

						<p>I went to the House soon after 9. O’Clock—and gave the Bill to

							<hi rend="strikethrough">Lan</hi> Manufactures, the Bill from the Senate

							>Briggs</persRef>. <persRef ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> of

							of Virginia upon the <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi> Appropriation Bill—for
							it is becoming a common practice to make long Speeches upon one Bill in

								Clay</persRef>, and <persRef ref="white-hugh">Hugh L.
								White</persRef> to prove their inconsistency—and he replied with

							proscriptions from Office, Townes charged me with having when Secretary
							of State dismissed a printer of the Laws, who was in favour of General
							Jackson, and appointed in his place one friendly to me— I interrupted

							Tennessee that I ever made was at the request of General Jackson,
							(whether he recollects it or not I could not tell) and of his colleague
								<persRef ref="eaton-john">John H. Eaton</persRef>— I further said
							that I had never removed any person from Office, for political
							opposition to me— Townes finished soon after 3. the Committee rose and
							the House adjourned— I went into the Library and consulted <persRef

						<p>On coming to the House, I found there was an Article in the Globe,

							from the Department of State to prove that <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef> was not at Washington on the day of the
							signature of the Florida Treaty—and from this Statement to infer the
							falsehood of my averment that General Jackson had been consulted upon
							the Florida Treaty, before it was signed— Immediately after the Journal
							of the House was read, I asked permission to make another explanation—
							Objection was made, and <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>
							moved a suspension of the rules, to enable me to make the explanation;
							which was carried by an almost unanimous vote; I made the explanation
							accordingly; upon which <persRef ref="huntsman-adam">Adam
								Huntsman</persRef> of Tennessee, asked permission to make a Speech—
							There was objection also to this, but the rule was again suspended; and
							he made his Speech; which was a mixture of archness, buffoonery and
							ignorance, with Spirit and good humour, as all his Speeches are— His
							great annoyance was that I had charged the President with keeping the

								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee came afterwards to my
							table, and said that what I had spoken of the Globe was not one particle

								<persRef ref="harris-relief">Relief Harris</persRef>—both of which

								>Abbott Lawrence</persRef> of the Massachusetts delegation, and to

							all the documents and gave me some account of them. Several attempts
							were made in the House to suspend the Rules, to make certain Bills the
							special order of the day—to have preference over all other business, but

								<persRef ref="plantou-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							I introduced them to the Library— At the House, <persRef

							information concerning our Affairs with Mexico, which I moved last week,
							and I asked the permission of the House to assign my reasons for

						<p>I had a very indifferent Night, and little sleep— At the House the first
							subject was the question upon <persRef ref="glascock-thomas"
								>Glascock’s</persRef>, assigning the reasons for his asking to be
							excused from voting on the Slavery Report Resolutions— The <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> announced that he had recurred to
							the only precedent on the Journals of the House, which was in my own
							case; and that the House then determined to proceed in the call of yeas
							and nays, and announce the decision without waiting first to decide any
							question on the refusal of the member to vote— But that such question
							would remain to be afterwards decided by the House— I rose and began to
							prove that the case was totally different from that of 1832 which could
							not therefore apply as a precedent; but I was called with great
							vociferation to order and not permitted to proceed. The Speaker went on
							and announced the result of the vote on the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> Resolution— On the call of yeas and nays upon the second
							Resolution, I asked to be excused from voting, and the call was
							continued passing me by.— Others declined voting and they were also
							passed by. On my name’s being called on the third resolution I answered
							I hold the Resolution to be a direct violation of the Constitution of
							the United States—of the Rules of this House and of the rights of my
							Constituents— They passed on— <persRef ref="granger-francis"
								>Granger</persRef> asked to be excused from voting on the second
							Resolution, because the Resolution is different from that which the
							Committee was instructed to report— He was passed over and not allowed
							to offer his reasons. A Scene of great disorder ensued— Glascock claimed
							the floor to assign his reasons— The Speaker gave him the floor, and
							then took it away from him by arbitrary, absurd and inconsistent
							decisions, all of which were sustained by the House by large majorities
							by yeas and nays; as were the three Resolutions reported by the
							Committee— The Bill for the re-organization of the Post-Office was then
							debated till about 5. O’Clock when it was made the special order of the

							adjourned— I walked home, the first time for nearly two months— <persRef

						<p>At the House this morning, upon the reading the Journal, I saw that the
							proceedings of yesterday were not truly stated, and moved amendments,
							only the first of which was adopted— The Journal stated the decision
							against <persRef ref="glascock-thomas">Glascock’s</persRef> tendered
							reasons for asking to be excused from voting’s being received before the
							decision of the Houses’s Resolution, being announced, without stating
							that Glascock had tendered his reasons, so that the Journal gave the
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker’s</persRef> decision, without
							shewing what the subject was upon which the decision was made<unclear>.
								A</unclear>fter long discussion all my other amendments were
							rejected some with and some without taking the yeas and nays, and the
							decisions of the Speaker were all sustained— <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>, Glascock, <persRef
								ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> all moved amendments which were also
							rejected— <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> however
							obtained an entry upon the Journal of his reasons for asking to be
							excused— This debate consumed four hours, before the Journal was read
							through— Then the order of the day, special, was called—the Bill for the
							reorganization of the Post-Office— The Amendments, reported from the
							Committee of the whole were coldly, mumbled over, till <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> moved an amendment to
							the new tariff of postages proposed by the Committee, and objected to
							any increase of the existing rates of postage— This opened a wide
							debate, to a multitude of speakers— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> moved an amendment to the new tariff of
							postage proposed by the Committee, and withdrew it— <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							by yeas and nays 88 to 85— <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef> of
							the Committee <unclear>th</unclear>en moved that the amended Section
							itself should be rejected. The debate now assured a party complexion,
							and became heated, till past six when the Bill was made the special

							finished, and the House adjourned— <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi

								<persRef ref="hamer-thomas">Hamer</persRef> of Ohio, asked
							permission to present a memorial and Resolutions from a meeting at
							Toledo, which he said he did not wish to be read, but merely to be laid
							upon the Table— I asked that they should be read; and it was a bitter
							complaint that the memorialists were oppressed by the conflicting
							authorities of two State Governments at once— I asked if the member from
							Ohio would state whether the Memorial and Resolutions were from Citizens
							of Ohio, or of Michigan— He said that the Memorialists and he considered
							them as Citizens of Ohio; but that I and the People of Michigan
							considered them as Citizens of Michigan— The <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker</persRef> then said that he had received a Memorial and the
							proceedings of a Meeting in the County of Monroe upon the subject of the
							boundary of Ohio and Michigan which he had been requested to present to
							the House— I asked that the Resolutions and Memorial should be read,
							which the Speaker with evident signs of reluctance ordered— They were
							ardent remonstrances against the Bill for the admission of Michigan now
							before the House— There was a motion immediately made to lay them on the
							table. I moved that they should together with the Bills from the Senate
							fixing the Northern boundary of Ohio, and for admitting the State of
							Michigan into the Union, be referred to a select Committee—the Speaker
							referred to the rule that Petitions shall not be debated on the day when
							they are presented—and said these motions must lie over one day.— The
							House soon got to the order of the day for private business— The Bill
							for the relief of the legal representatives of <persRef ref="gale-henry"

							they were all refuted by <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.

								Stockton</persRef> the Chaplain of the House of Representatives
							preach from John 3.16. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his

							he sincerely believed not only his text, but all his own inferences from
							it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stockton passes for an eloquent

							congregation— I never saw the hall so thin at the performance of public

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Farrar</persRef> a young
							Clergyman from Albany— His Sermon was from 2. Timothy 2.12. “If we
							suffer, we shall also reign with him.” There was nothing remarkable in
							the discourse; but the lines as the top of this page are the closing
							verse of one of the hymns which he gave out to be sung— There is
							scarcely a Sunday passes over my head, but in attendance upon divine
							service, I hear something of which a pointed application to my own
							situation and circumstances occurs to my thoughts— It is often
							consolation; support—encouragement.— Sometimes warning and admonition.
							Sometimes keen and trying remembrance of deep distress. The lines above
							cited are of the cheering kind— I was occupied all the leisure of the
							day and evening in writing out for publication my Speech made last
							Wednesday in the House of Representatives, one of the most hazardous
							that I ever made, and the reception of which even by the People of my
							own district and State is altogether uncertain.</p>
