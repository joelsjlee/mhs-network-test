						<p>I return to this Book, after an interval of more than six Months; finding
							it impossible to write in it from day to day during the Session of
							Congress—when travelling, or with a crippled hand; and having wasted
							much of the last Summer with imperfect success in the attempt to
							retrieve by copying the arrears of my last Volume.— This morning
								<persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> was here; and I
							had much conversation with him respecting my private affairs here, which
							are very irksome to me— I promised to go with him to Mount Wollaston,
							Wednesday afternoon— <persRef ref="sampson-schuyler">Schuyler
								Sampson</persRef> the Collector of the Customs at Plymouth called
							here with his niece, on their way to Boston whence they are to return
							to-morrow. He told me that there had been a design to set up <persRef
								ref="lincoln-solomon">Solomon Lincoln</persRef>, in opposition to my
							re-election to Congress for the twelfth Congressional district; but he
							believed that project was relinquished; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lincoln being a Royal Arch Mason— But he said the election of Governor
							would be very warmly contested next November— <persRef
								ref="quincy-mary2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Quincy jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> with her mother <persRef
								ref="miller-sr">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Miller</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="quincy-abigail">Miss Abby Quincy</persRef> visited
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">our
								Ladies</persRef>— My Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> came out from Boston this afternoon. <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">His wife</persRef> is yet somewhat indisposed—
								<persRef ref="cummings-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cummings</persRef> came towards Evening, to make enquiries
							concerning his claim to certain Lands in the State of Ohio— I referred
							him to <persRef ref="jackson-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Jackson</persRef>, who during the last Session of Congress
							took charge of that business at the desire of the prior claimant,
								<persRef ref="cummings-stephen">Cummings’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="cummings-stephen2">father</persRef>— My Son returned to
							Boston this Evening— I paid a visit to my next door neighbour <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W.
								Beale</persRef>— Found there, <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> E Price Greenleaf</persRef> who said
							that an offer of twenty thousand dollars had been made to <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">his father</persRef>, for about twenty Acres
							of his rocks— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale said an offer had
							been made to him last year of twenty thousand dollars for his Squantum
							farm containing about 190 acres— The value of Land has much increased
							within the last two years, but as yet without benefit to me— I received
							a second Letter from <persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Tudor</persRef>, and from the Commissioner of the
							Patent Office <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">Henry L.
								Ellsworth</persRef> the Indenture of assignment of <persRef
								ref="lane-charles">Charles Lanes</persRef> patent, recorded in the
							Office, and I wrote to Solomon Lincoln, to enclose it to him. I looked
							up in my garden, my seedlings of the present year which are numerous. I
							write every day; but as yet very unsatisfactorily.</p>

						<p>This day commences the fortieth year since I was married in London— And
							this day last year I began teaching my <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Grand-daughter Mary Louisa</persRef> to read the Bible— She began
							reading one chapter every day, then two—then five of the Book of Psalms,
							and since then three chapters each day— I read alternately with her,
							verse and verse, and we read this day at the commencement of the second
							year the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 28<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> and 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapters of Isaiah—
							I read in the same manner with her and her younger Sister <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Georgiana Frances</persRef>, the Psalms in
							the Book of Common Prayer— I adopt this manner of teaching, that they
							may learn to read by example as well as by precept— There was a gentle
							moderate rain, which continued nearly throughout the day, with the
							exception of short excursions to my eastern seminary, my garden and
							Nursery— I found, on the single seedling black walnut towards the North
							end of the Nursery, forty or fifty of the same black and striped worm
							which I have heretofore found, on the black Oaks, Elms and willows. They
							had strip’d the tree of about half its leaves—eating the whole leaf, but
							leaving the naked fibre untouched— The tip ends of almost all of my
							seedling Apples were also covered with aphides, or green lice, which
							turn into a small black fly, and which upon being rubbed off with the
							thumb, and finger stain them with a yellowish colour which it takes
							several successive ablutions <pb n="302" type="ms"/>to wash out.— To
							account for the very slow growth of some of my seedlings, <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> says it is because they are in the neighbourhood
							of Peach trees, which endure no neighbourhood— I received two days since
							a Letter from <persRef ref="warrenn-george2">George W. Warren</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="sleeper-john">John S. Sleeper</persRef>, a Committee
							of the Directors of the Charlestown Lyceum, inviting me to deliver the
							introductory Lecture of their course for the next Season—sometime in
							October— I this day answered the Letter, and declined the task— The rest
							of the day was occupied chiefly in writing. <persRef ref="adams-josiah2"
								>Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> was here
							in the evening, and brought a partial estimate of the cost, of a
							considerable alteration to be made in our dwelling house— That is for
							the timber and boards: the stone work and labour to be estimated
							hereafter</p>

						<p>I strolled after breakfast this morning into my seminary garden and
							nursery, and inspected my seedling trees with my new gardener— I care
							about nothing but my trees— My Nursery although much thinned the last
							autumn is yet so full that I can plant nothing new there— In one of my
							Pots I found Strawberry leaves just up in a pot in which I had planted
							seeds last July— I found also at the gate corner of my eastern seminary
							a hickory walnut just out of the ground— The proportion of cherry stones
							which come up is very small— That of ash leaves, also quite scanty—
							Seeds come best up in boxes or Pots— I had scarcely returned to my
							Library, when I had a visit from <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Lee</persRef> who now resides
							at Roxbury, and who told me that <persRef ref="lowell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Lowell</persRef> had written him
							yesterday, informing him that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bethune
							had written from Paris, that she had seen in London, Lee’s son in Law
								<persRef ref="maltitz-friedrich">Baron Maltitz</persRef>, as Russian
							Minister— He also told me that Maltitz had written a German Tragedy,
							which had a run of 48 nights of performance at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Petersburg—and of which he had sent him a copy for me— He
							likewise mentioned that <persRef ref="bethune-george;bethune-mary"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Bethune</persRef> had been received with great
							distinction, by king <persRef ref="louis-philippe"
								>Louis-Philippe</persRef> at Paris—owing to two circumstances. First
							that when Louis Philippe and his brother were in this Country in exile,
							and with disguised names, <persRef ref="amory-john3">John
								Amory</persRef>, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bethune’s eldest
							brother, had by information from a French Baker, at whose house they
							boarded, discovered who they were, and tendered them good offices of
							kindness, and particularly, any pecuniary assistance they might need—
							This offer they had declined in a Letter expressive of deep and grateful
							sensibility, and when the Bethune’s went last Spring to Europe, Lee
							persuaded M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bethune, the youngest Sister
							of John Amory now deceased to take that Letter with her, and gave her an
							introduction to the <persRef ref="bernard-maria">wife</persRef> of
								<persRef ref="bernard-simon">General Bernard</persRef>, through whom
							they obtained the means of reproducing to king Louis-Philippe his old
							Letter— The second circumstance was the name of Bethune, and his lineal
							descent from <persRef ref="bethune-maximilien">Maximilian</persRef>, the
							memorable duke of Sully, the minister of <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry
								of Bourbon</persRef>—a fact hitherto unknown to me— Lee says that a
							descendent from Sully <unclear>being</unclear> a Protestant emigrated
							from France to Scotland; and a descendent from him came from Scotland to
							this Country. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee who is growing old, and
							is desoeuvré, proposed to escort the Ladies to Nahant, or elsewhere in
							the course of the Summer— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> came out and dined with us, and after dinner,
								<persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> took us down to
							Mount Wollaston, and to Germantown This last place is still the Scene of
							hazardous and doubtful speculation—Fish-flakes—Salt works by
							evaporation, and a thousand white mulberry trees and of the Chinese
							murus multicaulis, are the evidences of these undertakings, while a
							large, wharf for the use of the Stone-cutting business is building at
							Bents point on the South side of the junction between the river and
							creek.— On our return we stopped at the <pb n="303" type="ms"/>new house
							which <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> is building for me at Mount
							Wollaston. A young man named <persRef ref="u">Whiting</persRef>, who
							settled in the town last Summer, was at work, and putting up a Stack of
							chimneys—almost entirely from those of the old house, which have been
							taken down— The cellar is a very good one, under the whole house, and
							eight feet deep— After returning I found a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leeds</persRef> had been here to make
							enquiries about Stone-quarries, and that <persRef ref="davis-john4"
								>judge Davis</persRef>, and the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							<persRef ref="greenwood-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenwood</persRef> had paid us an afternoon visit— <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Ann Adams</persRef>,
							with her daughter <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>,
							her two Sons, <persRef ref="adams-isaac;adams-joseph">Isaac and
								Joseph</persRef>, her sister <persRef ref="harrod-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stebbins</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> were here at tea and
							spent the Evening with us—part of us at a rubber of whist.</p>

						<p>I went into Boston this morning, with <persRef ref="gillet-simon"
								>Gillett’s</persRef> Stage; surrounded by seven women, and two young
							girls as fellow passengers— The women were coming in, all the way
							through Milton, Dorchester and Roxbury. One of them had a young robin,
							in a basket, covered over with a towel, and which she said she would
							keep in Boston— I alighted at the foot of Winter Street, and went to my
							Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">His wife</persRef> came down to me, and said
							she was perfectly well; but complained of a singing in her ears which
							she said had been constant since her return from her late excursion—
							After sitting with me in conversation about a quarter of an hour, she
							said suddenly she feared she should faint, and asked me to call one of
							her maids— Two of them came and helped her up to her bed-chamber— The
							man Servant was sent for <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>, and I went
							immediately to Charles’s Office where I found him, and advised him of
							his wife’s indisposition, upon which he immediately went home. I went to
							the Minister <persRef ref="parkman-francis">Francis Parkman’s</persRef>;
							but he was not at home— I then called again at my Son’s house— Charles
							was there. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow had not been found,
							but another physician was with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and
							had administered an emetic— Before I left the House, Charles told me
							that it had operated, and his wife was relieved. I then called at
								<persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
								Foster’s</persRef>, and saw <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Foster</persRef> and her three
								<persRef ref="foster-elizabeth2;foster-louisa;foster-mary"
								>daughters</persRef>. Mary’s health is yet feeble, but improved
							since last Summer— My next call was at <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hallett’s</persRef> house; and
							then at his office; where I had conversation with him on the law of
							libel; the trial of <persRef ref="zenger-john">John P. Zenger</persRef>,
							and upon his articles in the Daily Advocate, against the decision of
							<persRef ref="thatcher-peter">Judge Thacher</persRef> upon a case of
							libel which is to be retried upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the
							Commonwealth, next November. Hallett read me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>, enclosing one from the
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of State Forsyth</persRef> to
							him, urging him to accept the appointment of Agent to recover the
							Smithsonian bequest— Rush’s Letter manifests much anxiety to have it
							represented in the Boston Advocate that this was no exception to a
							sturdy resolution to accept no political office under <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>— I told Hallett
							that I was very glad M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had received
							this appointment, believing that he needed it; and that he would
							faithfully perform its duties— That I differed very widely from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s present politics, and had no
							sympathy with his fastidious delicacy about accepting Office, under
							President Jackson— This is the third Office which he has already
							accepted as appendages to this administration, and I see no distinction
							of principle between them and others, more permanent and more important—
							The Meeting of the Historical Society was notified for 12 O’Clock at
							Noon—and that of the Overseers of Harvard Colleg at half-past twelve— It
							was near that when I reached the Historical Society Meeting— They were
							about ballotting for the Election of Members— They voted according to
							the primitive practice of New-England, with kernels of maize for
							affirmative, and small white beans for negative votes— I voted for
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="allen-william4">President Allen</persRef> of Brunswick College,
							and <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Levi Woodbury</persRef>, as
							corresponding members, all of whom were elected. I spoke to <persRef
								ref="sparks-jared">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jared
								Sparks</persRef>, and enquired if he had any documentary information
							of the early life of the late <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>; but he said he had
							none— The President of the Society <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">Thomas
								L. Winthrop</persRef> invited me to dine, with him at half past two,
							which I <pb n="304" type="ms"/>accepted— I was soon after called out by
								<persRef ref="hall-joseph">judge Joseph Hall</persRef>, who also
							invited me to dine with him, which I was obliged to decline— I then went
							to attend the Meeting of the Board of Overseers, but at the gate of the
							State House met <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
							Quincy</persRef>, <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pearce</persRef> the Secretary of the Board, <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef>, <persRef ref="gray-thomas2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Gray</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="parkman-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis
								Parkman</persRef>. The Meeting was over and had confirmed all the
							honorary Doctorates proposed by the Corporation; among them was N. L.
							Frothingham as Doctor of Divinity and Levi Woodbury as Doctor of Laws— I
							spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman about the record of
								<persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Tudor’s</persRef> marriage, and promised to call upon him between 4
							and 5 in the afternoon— I returned to Charles’s House— <persRef
								ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> was there; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham to whom I had mentioned <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles’s</persRef> sudden illness—
								<persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.
								Brooks</persRef> came in soon after— She was much relieved— At half
							past two I went and dined with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop—
							His <persRef ref="winthrop-george;winthrop-grenville;winthrop-robert"
								>two Sons</persRef>; his <persRef ref="winthrop-anna">unmarried
								daughter</persRef>, <persRef ref="shaw-lemuel">Chief Justice

								Charles Lowell</persRef>, and <persRef ref="bradford-gamaliel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gamaliel Bradford</persRef> were the
							company I talked more than my share, and not very wisely— Between four
							and five I went again to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis
							Parkman’s, and received from him the extract from the record of his
							Church, of the marriage of <persRef ref="tudor-william">William
								Tudor</persRef> with Delia Jarvis on the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of March 1778. by <persRef ref="eliot-andrew">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew Eliot</persRef> then the Pastor
							of the New North Church— I returned once more to my Son Charles’s House,
							and then waited for <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> who had
							gone in after dinner with the Carriage— I came out alone and got home at
							the dusk of Evening— The sudden illness of M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>A long morning wasted upon my Seminary, Nursery, and Garden Seedlings. I
							found several hickory seedlings just now coming up, in the border from
							the Summer house cellar to the road— The vegetation of this plant is
							three months later than that of most of the other seeds. Is not this the
							reason of its suffering so much from the winter’s frost and when it does
							not wholly perish, dying down for many years successively to the ground?
							Might not cracking the nut before planting it cause it to come up
							earlier in the Spring? an experiment to be made— My other remark this
							day, is upon the multitude of seedling elms coming up, which must have
							been self sown, last Spring, and there is one coming up from a remnant
							of root left from one of those transplanted from the North-end of the
							Nursery last fall— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> was here
							yesterday and budded for me<space/>cherry trees.— Three only of those
							which he budded last year have succeeded; one of which was transplanted
							and is now in the seminary lot— The patches which I opened before the
							embankment, in the border, and between the old Pear trees, to take their
							places, as they decay, are now all stocked with seedlings of the last or
							the present year, and those in front of my library window, seedling
							apples, pears and peaches of 1834. and 1835 are as thrifty as I could
							expect— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> was here
							before dinner and <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef>,
							who said he had been at my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house last Evening and was told that <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> had been very sick and was
							no better. This made us so uneasy that <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> went into Boston this
							afternoon, and returned with the Evening Bell; she found M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles much recovered, but not well
							enough to come out to Quincy to-morrow— Charles was gone to Medford to
							dine at <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.
								Brooks’s</persRef>. My remnant of morning was absorbed by this
							diary; after dinner I wrote a page and a half, but the rest of the time
							escaped in a search to follow the Articles of Confederation in their
							progress through Congress from June 1776 to 1. March 1781. which search
							was left unfinished at the dusk. <persRef ref="newell-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Giusta</persRef> arrived here from

						<p>The <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Midshipman</persRef> was here this
							morning to enquire for Letters. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Quincy’s</persRef> Son, <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah4">Josiah</persRef>, brought me a note, inviting
							me to tea, at his house this Evening. There is a fascination at this
							Season of the year in my garden, nursery and seminary which I am seldom
							able to resist—and which absorbs hour after hour of precious time in
							mere useless gazing at seedling trees. I mark my seedling plums, which
							are one in the Seminary, of this year, two of 1835, and two of 1834. in
							the garden; and at the root of one of the last I found an Ant’s nest—
							The leaves of my maple trees, are much devoured by insects, which checks
							very much their growth. There is matter for observation upon the variety
							of the manner in which the trees present themselves as they first come
							out of the ground— The Oak and the Walnut open their leaves in no
							uniform manner— The Apple and cherry sometimes put up their seed leaves
							above the surface; and sometimes do not— When the seed leaves come out,
							the tree is more liable to be destroyed— There is a mass of observations
							upon the vegetation of plants, which accumulate from year to year, but
							which remain barren upon my mind, for want of an active reasoning
							faculty, to be applied to them—every natural phenomenon has its cause
							and its effect. The phenomenon is first to be observed. Then traced to
							its cause—then followed to its effect; all of which requires continuance
							of observation, and then the combining faculty of reason— I have
							curiosity to observe; but not facility to combine, nor ingenuity to
							devise— Of the remnant of this day I squandered much in tracing through
							the Journals of the Revolutionary Congress, the progress of the Articles
							of the Confederation—till I found the whole History of them in the
							compilation of the Secret Journals of the Old Congress.— I pored and
							plodded much, and wrote very little— Towards Sunset, I walked to Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Quincy’s, and there met <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">his father</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="quincy-eliza">mother</persRef> and <persRef

								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>,

							the Evening— <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Savage</persRef> was also one of the Company— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hale told me that <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef> had called out four
							thousand men of the Militia, of four South and western States, upon
							allegation of some indian outrage, and with manifestation of a
							disposition to cross the Sabine river, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Savage talked of the man of the Iron Mask, and of Junius: and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy of <persRef ref="mather-cotton"
								>Cotton Mather</persRef> and the centennial celebration— I walked
							home, in company, to the parting of the roads, with M<hi

								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>

							this morning into Boston and brought out this Evening their two elder

								<persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>— At meeting
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> performed the morning service and preached from 1.
							Timothy 5.22—“neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself
							pure.” This text opens a wide field for commentary; but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney considered the subject only as
							bearing upon the characters of men in private and domestic life— It was
							however a sensible and edifying discourse. <pb n="306" type="ms"/>After
							meeting, <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> walked home with me, and looked into my
							Garden, at two of the Apple trees which were girdled last winter by the
							field mice— One of them was the most thrifty one of the whole number
							that I had planted in November 1830. It is now eleven or twelve years
							old, and for the first time bears fruit— The mice have so completely
							girdled it, that he thought the tree must die next winter— There are
							however two new shoots above, and two below the bud, which he thinks may
							still save it; an experiment of which I can hardly expect to witness the
							issue if it should succeed— <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C.
								Adams</persRef> dined with us— <persRef ref="cunningham-francis"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham</persRef> of Roxbury
							was the afternoon preacher, from Luke 23.34. “Then said Jesus, father,
							forgive them, for they know not what they do.”— The discourse was very
							impressive, and full of excellent moral instruction, but delivered in a
							lisping manner, much subject to the censure of affectation— I read the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sermons of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon Ephesians 5.16.
							“Redeeming the time”— These are upon the whole the most instructive
							discourses of the whole collection—and perhaps if I had read them forty
							years ago, I might have derived some benefit from them— It is now too
							late— My memory retains nothing that I read; and little of any thing
							that happens— Saurin’s application of his own doctrine, to the aged,
							encourages no hope, and freely acknowledges and comments upon the utter
							impossibility for old men to redeem the time— I felt intensely many
							parts of these Discourses, but am conscious that without the mercy from
							above which I invoke they will yet be lost upon me, and that instead of
							setting my house in order, I shall still not be duly prepared to meet
							the summons when it comes. I wrote this day very little.</p>
