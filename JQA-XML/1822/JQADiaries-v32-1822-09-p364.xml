						<p><date>1. VI:</date> For some weeks past, there has been a small
							association of Episcopalians who have had the Church Service performed
							for them every Sunday Morning at the City Hall. I attended there this
							Morning and heard a <persRef ref="weller-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Weller</persRef> preach from Galatians
							3.22 “But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
							of faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.” This is a
							text for Calvinistic doctrine; and accordingly the preacher dwelt with
							earnestly upon the universality of Sin, and upon the efficacy of Faith—
							The Sermon was in a style of cold mediocrity both with regard w to
							composition and delivery. There were not more than forty persons present
							more than half of whom were women. I called this Evening at <persRef
								ref="strother-john">Strother’s</persRef> Hotel, where I saw <persRef
								ref="dana-francis2">Francis Dana</persRef>— He is on his return from
							a wandering excursion to the Arkansas territory— I did not even know
							that he was in this Country. He has made himself a hard life, and when I
							reflected upon <persRef ref="dana-francis">his father</persRef> and
							family I felt a melancholy compassion at the sight of <pb type="ms"
								n="365"/>him. His countenance bears the stamp of something more than
							care. He says he is now going to Boston with a view to make arrangements
							for remaining and settling in the Arkansas territory. I spent part of
							the Evening at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>
							where I met <persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>3. V:30.</date> Received from <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi

							of the Treasury, a certified copy of the final Settlement of my Account
							as Minister in Europe, from 1809 to 1817. Five years after my return to
							this Country. When I returned in 1801. from a Mission of seven years, I
							was nearly three years in obtaining a Settlement; and in both instances,
							these delays arose from difficulties, against which it was impossible to
							guard. From the imperfect manner in which the Accounts of Ministers
							abroad were at that time kept and adjusted at the Treasury. My own
							Accounts were kept and transmitted with regularity; but no notice of
							them was ever taken, and when I returned all the Accounts of three or
							four successive Missions, through periods of seven and eight years, were
							to be settled at once. The system has since been improved and is perhaps
							susceptible of further improvement: to which it will be proper for me to
							attend— Received despatches from <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg and from <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>
							at Madrid. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton gives the substance
							of a Convention which he has concluded with <persRef key="bagot-charles"
								>Sir Charles Bagot</persRef> under the Mediation of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>, for carrying into
							Execution his decision upon the Construction of the first Article of the
							Treaty of Ghent relating to Slaves— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Forsyth’s Letters relate chiefly to the troubles in Spain— I received
							also a Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> in which she mentions
							a conversation somewhat curious that she has had with <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Her brother</persRef> is recovering.
							Evening at the Play— Macbeth and the Rendezvous. The part of <persRef
								ref="macbeth">Macbeth</persRef> by <persRef ref="cooper-thomas2"
								>Cooper</persRef>— I was much pleased with the performance— I had
							seen Cooper only once before, which was at Boston in the part of
								<persRef ref="othello">Othello</persRef>, on the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of October 1805. I did not then much
							admire him: though he had already a high reputation. I think him now one
							of the most pleasing actors I have ever seen— His conception of the
							character of Macbeth is good, and he knows how to speak the fine
							passages of <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>. An
							instructive and amusing parallel might be drawn, between the characters
							of <persRef ref="richardthe3rd">Richard the 3<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi></persRef> and Macbeth— Both murderers from ambition;
							but of Natures, otherwise as different as possible— Richard crafty,
							ferocious, unrelenting, incapable of any social affection, and yet of
							fascinating manners; a fiend incarnate, whose very remorse operates upon
							him only when asleep and then in mere selfish terror— Macbeth, brave,
							affectionate to <persRef ref="ladymacbeth">his wife</persRef>, who is
							his evil Angel, weak, instigated directly by her; and indirectly by the
							witches, irresolute, visited by continual compunctions, committing crime
							upon crime, and always racked with the consciousness of his own guilt.
							His character is more common in life, than that of Richard. Macbeth is
							one of the most moral of Shakespear’s plays— It shews the danger and
							guilt of resort to fortune-telling; as well as the weakness of
							instigated ambition. Richard’s punishment commences only at the last
							Scene of the <pb type="ms" n="366"/>Play— Macbeth is suffering incessant
							torture from the moment when his guilt begins. Lady Macbeth, is the
							terrible sublime of an ambitious woman— Yet her ambition is modified by
							her sex. She has all the social affections— She loves her husband, while
							instigating him to the most horrid crimes. She is deterred from stabbing
								<persRef ref="duncan">Duncan</persRef>, herself, because in his
							sleep he looked like her father— She has given suck, and enjoyed all the
							sweets of maternal tenderness— She sacrifices all these sympathies to
							her Ambition. She retains a perfect command of herself while awake— But
							she walks in her Sleep, and then the agonies of her Soul, are harrowing—
							Her life sinks under them— The part was performed this Evening by
								<persRef ref="lefolle-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lefolle</persRef>, who reminded me not advantageously of <persRef
								ref="siddons-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Siddons</persRef>—I had seen her twice in this part—23. Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1795 was once. Cooper is growing old, but
							has a fine person and good voice— Walks the Stage with grace and
							dignity, and has a correct pronunciation.</p>

							wished to borrow a file of the New York National Advocate, from the
							Month of May till this time— He afterwards wrote me a note, repeating
							the request, and asking also the loan of a Report made by <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> in January 1817. I had not the latter, but sent

							Newspaper, forms an epocha in the History of <persRef key="monroe-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
							Administration. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s party was
							organized before the close of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s</persRef>— He was a Caucus
							Candidate in 1816. against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, and
							had then the address ostensibly to decline opposing M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, seeming to sacrifice his own
							pretensions in his favour, so as to secure a seat in the administration
							under him, during which he has been incessantly engaged in preparing the
							way to succeed him. Among the most powerful of his agents have been the
							Editors of the leading Newspapers;— The National Intelligencer is
							secured to him by the belief of the Editors <pb type="ms" n="369"/>that
							he will be the successful candidate, and by their dependence upon the
							printing of Congress. The Richmond Enquirer, because he is a Virginian,
							and a Slave-holder— The National Advocate of New-York, through <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>—the Boston Statesman, and
							Portland Argus, through <persRef ref="king-william">William
								King</persRef>. the Democratic Press of Philadelphia, because I
							transferred the printing of the Laws from that paper to the Franklin
							Gazette, and several other presses in various parts of the Union, upon
							principles alike selfish and sordid. Most of these papers have signals
							by which they understand one another; and the signal at Washington is
							given by the City Gazette, which has been resurrected since <persRef
								ref="irvine-baptis">Irvine</persRef> ceased to be its joint Editor,
							and which from time to time gives notice of the newspapers which are
							successively induced to join in the train— All this has been going on
							successfully for some Months past, with little counteraction of any
							kind, till the Establishment of the Washington Republican. That paper
							began by a succession of seven numbers addressed to the People of the
							United States, in which the course of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s management is very distinctly laid open, and its character
							vigorously exposed. It has already manifestly disordered the composure
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s Editorial Phalanx— The
							Intelligencer has ventured a slight skirmish in his favour— The
							Advocate, the Boston Statesman, and the Richmond Enquirer, have attacked
							M’Kenney with personalities, and menaces; the City Gazette has said
							nothing of him till this day— On Saturday, <persRef
								ref="elliot-jonathan">Elliot</persRef> acknowledged the receipt of
							an anonymous communication, styled Instructions to Office Hunters, and
							refused to print it, without having the name of the author— This day it
							appeared under the title of Extracts from Instructions to political
							beginners; headed by the words Help! Help! Help! and then reprinting as
							“From the Washington Republican of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
								inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Edited by Calhoun and M’Kenney,”
							a notice in that paper calling for payment of subscriptions— The
							Instructions profess to be after the manner of <persRef

							only of his vulgarity and venom without any of his wit. They are
							infamously scurrilous and abusive, not only upon M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun, but upon his Mother in Law— This is M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s mode of defensive warfare— The
							Article I suppose was written by <persRef ref="richard-g"
								>Richards</persRef>— <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi

								<persRef ref="meigs-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Meigs</persRef> had a small landed Estate in Georgia which there is

							He advised her to wait for the return of <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>; with which I
							concurred— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell is a Georgian employed
							in the Land-office. <persRef ref="forsyth-clara2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Forsyth</persRef> is daughter of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Meigs. I received a Note from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> calling a Meeting of
							the members of the Administration, at one O’Clock this day, with Letters
							from <persRef ref="gregory-francis">Lieutenant Gregory</persRef>,
							commander of the U.S. Schooner Grampus, to the <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>; containing an
							account of the capture by him of the Spanish privateer Panchita or
							Palmyra, from Porto-Rico. 21 [symbols][October] I attended at the
							President’s accordingly. <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							were also there, being the only other members of the Administration in
							the City. The Letters of Lieutenant Gregory had been read by us all; and
							the President proposed the question whether any measure of the
							administration would be necessary in consequence of this capture. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun said he thought that from
							Lieutenant Gregory’s Letter, the justification for the capture of the
							Spanish privateer was rather slender; but I observed that according to
							my recollection of the Law, it had been strictly legal— I then recurred
							to the Act of Congress of 3. March 1819 “to protect the Commerce of the
							United States and punish the Crime of Piracy”; continued by the Act of
							15 May 1820. I read the second and third Sections of the Act— The
							capture was made under instructions given by virtue of the second
							Section— It authorizes the President to issue Instructions to our Naval
							Officers to capture and send in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> armed vessel
							which shall have attempted, or <pb type="ms" n="374"/>committed any <hi
								rend="italic">piratical</hi> aggression, upon any vessel of the
							United States, or any other vessel— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun enquired whether any aggression by a vessel bearing a lawful
							commission, could be denominated piratical. I thought there was no doubt
							it could; and the third Section of the Act under Consideration, which
							authorizes merchant vessels to defend themselves against aggressions of
							any vessel other than public armed vessels, taken in connection with the
							second, which makes no such distinction, shews that the Act itself
							considers piratical aggressions, as liable to be committed by public
							armed vessels as well as others. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							understood them in the same manner— The President sent to the Navy
							Department for a copy of the Instructions given under the Act of 3.
							March 1819: and when they were procured, it was found that although they
							fell rather short of the authority given by the act, they yet fully
							justified the capture of the Panchita, by Lieutenant Gregory— I
							mentioned the discussions at the Cabinet Meeting when these Instructions
							were to be prepared, which were recollected both by the President and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun (see this Diary Vol. 6. for
							16 and <unclear>18.</unclear> March 1819.)— I gave M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, the Letter from <persRef
								ref="pederson-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pedersen</persRef> the Danish Minister claiming the delivery of the
							fugitive slave from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Croix requesting his
							written opinion upon two points—first whether the President has
							Constitutional authority to deliver up the Slave, and secondly, if he
							has in what manner it can be legally carried into effect— Evening at the
							Theatre, after calling on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, who
							went with me. It was <persRef ref="jefferson-joseph;jefferson-unknown"

								<persRef ref="inchbald-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Inchbald’s</persRef> Comedy of Every one has his fault and the

							between the two a Song, called Sammy Sugar Plumb and Polly Chitterlings,
							which was <unclear>encor</unclear>ed and repeated. I saw the Play at
							Philadelphia, in the Summer of 1794. much better than now— The part of
								<persRef ref="ladyeleanorirwin">Lady Eleanor Irwin</persRef> was
							then performed by <persRef ref="whitlock-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Whitlocke</persRef>, a Sister of

									>rs.</hi> Lefolle</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hathwell-unknown2">Hathwell</persRef>, both indifferent actors,
							and the play was quite another thing. The part of Jefferson himself,

							never knew it to fail. The practice would however require some
							modification, from regard to truth— Law told me that he and some other
							Citizens of this place, friends of the Drama, had given the Players a
							parting dinner, and drank them all except Jefferson under the table— The

								>Judge William Johnson</persRef>, in his recently published sketches

							calls in question Armstrong’s authorship of these Letters, as far beyond
							his ability, and attributes them to <persRef ref="morris-gouverneur"
								>Gouverneur Morris</persRef>— Since then, and within these few days
							a paragraph has been current in the Newspapers seemingly though not
							avowedly from Armstrong himself, introducing a Letter, purporting to
							have been written by <persRef ref="washington-george">President
								Washington</persRef> in 1793, to Armstrong. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hay asked me if I had seen it this morning in the Alexandria
							Herald. I had not seen that paper, but had seen it lately in other
							Newspapers. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay asked if I had ever heard
							of that Letter before. I had heard there was such a <pb type="ms"
								n="378"/>Letter but have no distinct recollection when or where. The
							Letter purports to have been written 23. February 1793. and is now
							stated, on belief, as having been first published in 1803. It is a
							declaratory certificate that in writing his address to the army on the
							occasion of the Newburgh Letters General Washington did not regard M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong as the author of those Letters,
							and further that he had since had reason for believing that the object
							of the author, was just, honourable, and friendly to the Country,
							although the means suggested by him were certainly liable to
							misunderstanding and abuse— And the reason alledged for giving this
							certificate are, the belief that there might be times and occasions,
							when the writer’s opinion of the anonymous Letters, as delivered to the
							army in 1783. might be turned to some personal and malignant purpose—
							Hay said he believed that this Letter was a forgery— It was impossible
							that General Washington should even have written such a Letter, or ever
							have certified that he had reason to believe that the object of the
							incendiary of Newburgh was just, honourable and friendly to the Country.
							I told Hay I was afraid that he had: as it was unquestionable that
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> had nominated the incendiary to foreign Missions
							of the highest trust— As a member of the Senate, I had voted against
							that nomination, alledging distinctly as my reason that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong was known to be the author of
							the Newburgh Letters— Others voted against him for other reasons—no one
							alledged that; and the nomination was confirmed by the casting vote of
							the <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Vice-President</persRef>— I told Hay that
							I still believed Armstrong to be the author of the Newburgh Letters—
							That I believed it impossible that their object should have been just,
							honourable or friendly to the Country— That I believed Armstrong to be
							one of the ablest writers and most unprincipled public men, that this
							Country had ever produced— And that General Washington, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><persRef ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="clinton-george">George Clinton</persRef>, the Senate of the
							United States, and the Legislature of New-York, all of whom had at
							various times, and in diverse manners concurred in appointing him to
							great public trusts, had indulgently overlooked the depravity of the
							Newburgh Letters, or attributed them to a youthful excess of an
							ambitious Spirit; afterwards chastised by experience into honour and
							honesty— I had myself been willing for some time to cherish such hopes;
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong’s public life has been but
							too clearly marked with the stamp of the Newburgh Letters— And I thought
							Judge Johnson’s suggestion that they were written by Governeur Morris,
							very feebly supported by his evidence— Hay said he thought so too— But
							he could not believe General Washington had ever written this Letter;
							and he mentioned reasons for disbelieving it— That no mention of it was
							made in <persRef ref="marshall-john">Marshall’s</persRef> Life of him—
							That his signature as printed in the Newspaper was not like that
							habitually used by the General, and that it was impossible he should
							have entertained the sentiment expressed in it— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hay has I think particular motives for these enquiries. The
							President returned this day from Loudoun. I received despatches from
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Duponceau’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef ref="mason-john">General
								Mason</persRef> was discussed— There was also a second Letter,
							explanatory of the first and more strictly confidential. The question
							was discussed what was to be done. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun has a most ardent desire that the Island of Cuba should become a
							part of the United States, and says that <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> has the
							same— There are two dangers, to be averted by that event. One that the
							Island should fall into the hands of Great-Britain; the other that it
							should be revolutionized by the Negroes— Calhoun says M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson told him two years ago, that we
							ought at the first possible opportunity to take Cuba, though at the cost
							of a War with England; but as we are not now prepared for this, and as
							our great object must be to gain time, he thought we should answer this
							overture, by dissuading them from their present purpose, and urging them
							to adhere at present to their connection with Spain— I thought it
							advisable to take a different course— To give them no advice whatever—
							To say that the Executive of the United States is not competent to
							promise them admission as a State into the Union; and that if it were,
							the proposal is of a nature which our relations of amity with Spain
							would not permit us to countenance— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun suggested, that it would be proper for the President to make it
							a subject of a confidential communication to Congress, at their next
							Session; and he objected that if much stress should be laid upon our
							relations with Spain as forbidding our acceptance of the proposal, it
							might be considered as indirect instigation to the declaration of
							Independence, inasmuch as that would release us from the obligation of
							considering it as involving any of the rights of Spain— I replied that
							there would be no possibility of proceeding in the business by
							confidential Communication to Congress— First because there has not been
							one Message, with closed doors, during the present Administration; nor I
							believe since the Peace— The very notice of a secret Session would rouse
							an insatiate curiosity throughout the Nation to know, what could be its
							object— And secondly the proposal was of a nature which would not admit
							of secresy; the power of Congress itself to act upon it was
							questionable— It involved external War and internal revolution, in its
							essential and inevitable consequences— It would neither be possible nor
							proper that such business should be transacted by secret Sessions of
							Congress— The whole affair would be divulged in a week—perhaps in a day.
							All Europe, as well as America would have notice of it, and the very
							communication of the proposal to Congress as a subject for their
							deliberations by the President, might be taken by Spain as hostility to
							her, and give warning to Great-Britain, to take an immediate and
							determined stand against it. As to taking Cuba at the cost of a War <pb
								type="ms" n="382"/>with Great-Britain, it would be well to enquire
							before undertaking such a War, how it would be likely to terminate; and
							for the present, and for a long time to come, I hold it for certain that
							a War with Great-Britain for Cuba, would result in her possession of
							that Island, and not ours. In the present relative situation of our
							maritime forces, we could not maintain a War against Great Britain for
							Cuba. Nor did I think that a plain distinct answer that our relations
							with Spain forbid our encouragement of a proposal to annex one of her
							Colonies to our own Union could be construed into an instigation to
							revolt. It was a reference to a plain principle of moral duty expressly
							applicable to the case; suitable to be acted upon as a motive, and
							honourable to the good faith of the Nation. I would give them at the
							same time to understand that the Government of the United States
							entertain the most friendly sentiments towards the inhabitants of Cuba;
							and are fully aware of the common interests which point to a most
							intimate connection between them and the United States— But to advise
							them to cling to their connection with Spain, would expose them to be
							transferred to Great-Britain by Spain, of which there is double danger,
							first by the present revolutionary Government of Spain to purchase
							support against the holy Alliance; and secondly by <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand</persRef>, to purchase the aid of
							Great-Britain to consummate a counter-revolution in his favour. Now by
							advising the People of Cuba to adhere to Spain, we expose them to both
							these dangers; and if the transfer should be made; they would charge the
							result upon us, and a heavy responsibility for the consequence would be
							upon us, for such ill-judged interposition— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun said he inclined to think there would be no
							immediate danger of a transfer of the Island to Great-Britain. The
							President directed an adjourned meeting for tomorrow— General Mason was
							at the President’s house, but not present at the Meeting— <persRef

						<p><date>29. VI:</date> Received this Morning from the <persRef

								<persRef ref="spence-robert">Captain Spence</persRef> of the Cyane,
							to the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>,
							and a correspondence between Captain Spence and the <persRef
								ref="linares-francisco">Governor of Porto-Rico</persRef>, relating
							to the privateers from that Island, and to the capture of one of them,
							by <persRef ref="gregory-francis">Lieutenant Gregory</persRef>— These

							immediately left them after perusal at <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi

								<persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>, from Romans 11.7 “What then? Israel hath not
							obtained that which he seeketh for, but the election hath obtained it,
							and the rest were blinded.” A discourse upon predestination and
							universal Salvation— This doctrine though not necessarily connected with
							unitarianism, seems congenial with it. If benevolence be an attribute of
							the deity, and such is the theory of all Christian Sects, eternity of
							punishments is impossible— Eternity of punishment is not necessary to
							any purpose of divine Justice. It subserves no end— It cannot reform the
							offender— It cannot redress his wrongs. It is suffering inflicted for
							mere vengeance. It can never proceed from benevolence. M<hi

						<p><date>30. VI:</date><persRef ref="hadfield-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Hadfield</persRef> was here this
							morning, and brought his Power of Attorney to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, to be authenticated at the
							Department of State and forwarded to him. <persRef ref="holley-horace"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holley</persRef> the President
							of the Transylvania University at Lexington, Kentucky, called for a
							moment; being on his way, returning with his family thither, after a
							summer visit to Boston. <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackelberg</persRef> called at the Office to ask for an Exequatur
							for a Swedish Vice-Consul; and to speak upon the claim that Norwegian
							Vessels should be admitted to import Articles other than of the growth
							produce or manufacture of Norway, without payment of any discriminating
							duties, because the Norwegian Ordinance admits vessels of the United
							States upon that footing into the Ports of Norway. We had repeatedly
							discussed this subject before and I had always told the Baron, as I now
							repeated that the Law of Congress did not admit of our going the full
							length of the Norwegian Ordinance— And I observed that no real
							reciprocity would result if it should. Sweden herself did not give us
							the benefit of the Norwegian Ordinance; and our exportations to Norway
							alone, must always be trifling and insignificant— Three or four vessels
							a year would carry all the merchandize for which Norway could furnish
							for us a market, and the proportion of Articles other than the produce
							of the United States, exported in them could be of no account— But if
							while by our necessary restrictions, conflicting with those of
							Great-Britain and France, our direct commerce with the British West
							Indies, and with France herself was nearly suspended, Norwegian Vessels
							could bring us all the Articles of importation from those Countries
							without payment of any discriminating duties, our countervailing
							restrictions would operate only against ourselves, and our Navigation
							Acts would prove altogether nugatory— The wishes of the United States
							were for the most liberal principles of commercial intercourse with all
							the world; but they could not adopt them with one Nation, while all the
							rest adhered to the system of restrictions, and of exclusions against
							them. Nor could Sweden claim them, in behalf of Norway, while she
							declined acceding to them herself, in her own intercourse with us. The
							Baron admitted that this was reasonable, and said he did not know why
							the Swedish Government had not extended the principle of the Norwegian
							Ordinance to Sweden itself. <persRef ref="mitchell-andrew2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew Mitchell</persRef> came to <pb
								type="ms" n="384"/>urge me to report to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> upon <persRef
								ref="mitchell-john2">his fathers</persRef> accounts— I attended the
							Cabinet-Meeting at the President’s— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							were there. The Letters from <persRef ref="duponceau-peter"
								>Duponceau</persRef> to <persRef ref="mason-john">General
								Mason</persRef>, and the proposals of <persRef ref="sanchez-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanchez</persRef> were again
							discussed. The proposition is that the People of Cuba should immediately
							declare themselves Independent of Spain without any co-operation of the
							United States, and then ask admission to this Confederation as one of
							the States of the Union. By his first Letter, Duponceau had understood
							the offer to be that they should come in as Louisiana had been received—
							To be governed first as a territory, and afterwards admitted, as one or
							more States— The second Letter rectifies this error. They ask admission
							at once; as one State, with full interior Sovereignty of its own. I
							doubted the authority not only of the Executive, but of Congress to
							perform this— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun thought the case of
							Louisiana had settled the Constitutional question. But a transaction
							which should make an Island separated from this Continent by the Ocean,
							at once a member of the Union, with a Representation in both Houses of
							Congress, would certainly be an act of more transcendent power, than a
							mere purchase of territory contiguous to our own. I observed also that
							we had not sufficient foundation for presenting the proposal to Congress
							in any shape. We had nothing but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sanchez’s word, that he had authority from anyone. We knew not from whom
							his authority came, nor how it had been given him— We knew not how far
							the project had been matured, nor what were its prospects of success.
							More information upon all this would be necessary before we could take a
							step of any kind in an affair of deeper importance and greater magnitude
							than had occurred since the Establishment of our Independence— It was
							concluded that the answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanchez must
							be negative, as to giving any encouragement to the Revolutionary
							movement; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun still thought we
							should dissuade them from it. I observed that whatever answer we should
							give must be one, which we must be prepared to see divulged— We must not
							expect it will be kept secret; whatever General Mason writes to
							Duponceau, he will make known to Sanchez, and Sanchez to his
							Constituents whoever they may be— It is said that the project has been
							long in agitation, and is even much discussed publicly at the Havanna.
							The controul of the secret, will not be in our power, and even if it
							should be faithfully kept, we must answer as it if would not. There was
							a proposal that General Mason should separately answer each of
							Duponceau’s Letters—one for communication to Sanchez, as our answer, and
							the other as suggestions to be made to him through Duponceau, as from
							General Mason himself. I thought this would make no difference; so far
							as secrecy was the object whatever should go from the Government would
							be known to go from the Government, however enveloped in forms— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Wirt made a short draft, of what he
							thought might be given to General Mason for an answer to Duponceau,
							which after some discussion the President said he would keep, and
							prepare a draft from it, to be considered to-morrow— I took an Evening
							walk and then played Chess with <persRef key="smith-william-steuben"
