						<p><date>1. VI.</date> This year began, as the last had commenced and
							closed; with solitary meditation. <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> was here this
							morning, on the subject concerning which <persRef ref="fuller-timothy"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef> spoke last
							Evening— He was anxious that some answer to the Slander in the
							Washington City Gazette of Saturday should be published, which I
							dissuaded. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
								Brent</persRef> and <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Watkins</persRef> were here— Watkins
							promised a list of the Claims for French Spoliations upon us in Spain.
								<persRef ref="sterling-micah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sterling</persRef> of New-York, came with a recommendation of a
								<persRef ref="butterfield-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Butterfield</persRef> for district Attorney in East-Florida. He
							excused himself for not dining with me, upon an engagement to dine at
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren’s</persRef>, with the whole Delegation from New-York. He said
							it might be thought there were politicks in this; for the rash step, of
							a part of the Legislature of South-Carolina, would set the whole
							Continent to premature electioneering. I asked what they had done— He
							said that 110 members out of 169. had met in caucus, and 57. of them had
							voted <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> as a Candidate for the Presidency, at the next
							election— It was but one third of the whole Legislature, and was
							altogether a precipitate and injudicious measure— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sterling spoke also of a Resolution that
							he has offered in the House of Representatives, having a view to the
							organization of some system for the settlement of claims upon the United
							States— He thought the Committee of Claims, and the House itself ill
							adapted to this business, and asked some questions as to the practice of
							the European Governments— At Noon we attended the Drawing-Room at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>— The Crowd of
							Company was as great as I have ever known it on any similar occasion. We
							remained not long there— The Indians paid their visit after we came
							away. <persRef ref="trimble-david">Trimble</persRef> told me that he had
							moved the Resolution for the call of the Papers concerning the
							Negotiation with France, as an individual member, without consulting the
							Committee of Foreign Relations of which he is a member, but in concert
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes— He said he had offered the
							Resolution before the papers had been sent to the Committee; which I
							thought strange—because the Resolution called for the papers classified
							as I had sent them to the Committee, in three divisions— From the
							President’s we went to <persRef ref="vanness-john">General Van
								Ness’s</persRef> and paid a wedding visit to his daughter <persRef
								ref="vanness-ann">Ann</persRef>, who was last week married to
								<persRef ref="middleton-arthur">Arthur Middleton</persRef>. We met
							among the company there, <persRef ref="eustis-william;eustis-caroline"
								type="multi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eustis</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan;russell-lydia" type="multi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Russell</persRef>— Russell told me, that Trimble had offered the
							Resolution calling for the papers not only without consulting the
							Committee, but against his opinion and inclination— I said Trimble had
							told me that he had moved the Resolution, before the papers had been
							received by the Committee— “He says so now,” said Russell—“but I have
							told him that I thought it extraordinary he should have offered the
							Resolution without notice to the Committee”— Eustis advised me to pay a
							visit to the Mess at <persRef ref="coyle-unknown2">Coyles</persRef>—for
							a bird had told him it would be advisable— I attended at the Office, and
							wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> to send with copies of the two Letters of the
							Spanish Minister <persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin">Anduaga</persRef>,
							against him— <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef> came and I had a conversation of an
							hour with him, upon the question between the Commissioners <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">P. B. Porter</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="barclay-thomas">Barclay</persRef> and upon the affair of
								<persRef ref="wilcocke-samuel">S. H. Wilcocke</persRef>— Upon the
							Navigation Act, and various other matters— He appeared anxious to
							maintain the position that the proposal for taking the middle channel
								<hi rend="italic">on a Condition</hi>, was not made by Barclay—
							Because Barclay’s Letter to him only says “a proposition was made”— But
							Porter’s Letter explicitly says that it was <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>written</hi> made by Barclay— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning’s object still seemed to be to ascertain what we would do; and
							he manifested a disposition to change the proposal from an engagement
							not to fortify, to a stipulation not to occupy the Islands— He enquired
							if we should be willing to extend the agreement to other islands
							throughout the line— I told him my authority was limited to an agreement
							respecting the Islands at the mouth of Detroit River, and that it was
							suggested merely to remove the fears and scruples of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barclay— He was afraid of the <hi
								rend="italic">use</hi> we should make, of Islands which would <pb
								type="ms" n="199"/>fall within our line— We were willing to remove
							those fears, by agreeing in the only way by which we could agree, not to
							fortify them— But this engagement must of course be reciprocal. He
							finally came to where he was at first; that he had no authority to
							interfere— Upon Wilcocke’s case too, he said he had done all in his
							power; but the <persRef ref="dalhousie-george">Governor of
								Canada</persRef> had no authority to discharge him— He was confined
							for debt— What could he do?— I said that as the man had been acquitted
							upon all the criminal prosecution; and as the persons at whose suit he
							was confined, were men over whom it was presumable the Governor had a
							personal influence, and as it was not likely any thing would ever be
							recovered of him, by keeping him in prison, I thought a hint might be
							given to him, that it would be well for him to let Wilcocke be
							discharged— He did not specially reply to this intimation, but induced
							me to suppose he would comply with it— As to the Navigation Acts, he
							said he saw there was some movement concerning them—referring to the
							Norfolk Resolutions, and the Message from the <persRef
								ref="randolph-thomas">Governor of Virginia</persRef>— I told him
							there were also counter movements, in the West-Indies, and referred him
							to the Petition from the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Christophers to the House of Commons— I added that the President of the
							Board of Trade, <persRef ref="robinson-frederick">Robinson</persRef>,
							and I believed the <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Marquess of
								Londonderry</persRef>, were at heart in favour of relaxation— He
							said the last words that the Marquess had said to him had been, that
							there was not the remotest prospect of the movement of that interest—
							That I said might be; though his Lordship’s opinion might be different—
							The conversation closed with some remarks of a soothing, and almost
							apologetic nature from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, about
							warm tempers and amicable dispositions— We had company to dine— Mess<hi

						<p><date>2. VI:30—</date> I took over to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> a translation of the Spanish Minister <persRef
								ref="danduaga-joaquin">Anduaga’s</persRef> Letter of 27 Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> to me, and a copy of my answer— <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy came in immediately
							afterwards. There was some conversation relating to the capture by
								<persRef ref="stockton-robert">Lieutenant Stockton</persRef> in the
							Alligator, of a Portuguese vessel, which fired upon him, mistaking him
							for a South-American privateer. Stockton has sent her into Boston— The
							President read a Letter which he had written to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, accepting his
							resignation as Governor of Florida— It was expressed in warm, though
							general terms of regard, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson
							objected that it would import the President’s approbation of General
							Jackson’s late transactions in Florida— This led to some discussion of
							them, in which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson admitted that he
							had a very imperfect knowledge of all the Circumstances, not having seen
							a great portion of the papers; but upon the facts as far as he was
							acquainted with them his opinion was unfavourable to Jackson— The
							President asked him to read all the papers, which he promised to do. The
							President asked me, if I thought the expressions in the Letter were too
							strong? I said they were such, that after receiving the Letter, General
							Jackson, would naturally not expect that the President would at any
							future period express public disapprobation of any thing done by him as
							Governor of Florida— But in my opinion there was not one word too much.
							General Jackson I thought had done nothing, with the exception of the
							papers seized at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine, but what he
							had a right to do. It was indeed impossible for me to scan the actions
							of General Jackson, as I might those of an indifferent person— General
							Jackson had rendered such services to this Nation, that it was
							impossible for me to contemplate his character or conduct without
							veneration— But setting this aside, in the whole of his transactions
							with <persRef ref="callava-jose">Callava</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">Fromentin</persRef>, I saw nothing in what
							Jackson did, which he had not the right, nay more, which he was not
							bound in duty to do. As to the banishment of the Spanish Officers, as a
							question of expediency General Jackson <pb type="ms" n="200"/>might
							perhaps have despised their insolent publication in the Newspapers, but
							I had no doubt of his right to order them away, and the same thing had
							been done in Louisiana. <persRef ref="bronaugh-unknown">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bronaugh</persRef> told me he believed
							that General Jackson did not know of the agreement between <persRef
								ref="butler-robert">Butler</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="coppinger-jose">Coppinger</persRef> concerning the papers at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine— And if Jackson should
							himself states this it would furnish an answer to that part of the
							complaint. The President gave me the Letter to have it copied at the
							Office, and sent to the General; but he afterwards sent me a note asking
							me to return it to him to make some slight modifications in it; and it
							was sent back— After M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson withdrew, I
							spoke to the President of the call by <persRef ref="trimble-david"
								>Trimble</persRef> for all the papers which had been sent to the
							Committee of Foreign Relations and to the composition of that Committee
							itself. I told him that there were subjects upon which I had hoped I
							should never be under the necessity of speaking to him; or if ever, not
							till the very close of his administration— But things had been so
							prematurely forced on, that they were now infecting and would continue
							to infect every measure of this administration— I reminded him of the
							offer which <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> had made
							of friendliness to the administration, before the commencement of The
							Session of Congress— Of the proposal that I had made to him by the use
							of such influence, upon members friendly to the Executive as might
							properly be exercised, to permit or rather not to prevent the
							re-election of Taylor as Speaker— He had thought it an obligation of
							duty, to avoid all interference in the election, in consequence of which
							I had felt it my duty to use the same forbearance— But others had not so
							abstained— I had at that time a conversation with <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							in which I had endeavoured to persuade him merely to permit the
							re-election of Taylor, but without success. He and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson had effectually prevented the
							re-election of Taylor— But they could not accomplish the election of
							either of the men whom they had intended for his substitute— The result
							had been a <persRef ref="barbour-philip">Speaker</persRef> whom nobody
							had expected; and certainly not very friendly to the Administration— It
							had always been considered as a practical rule that the Committee of
							Foreign Relations should be the confidential medium of Communication
							between the Administration, and Congress. The Speaker had now appointed
							a Committee entirely new, of members, chiefly known to be hostile to the
							administration, with a chairman generally understood to be at personal
							variance with me— To this Committee, all the papers relating to a
							complicated and delicate pending negotiation with France are
							confidentially committed, and the next day one of the members of the
							Committee offers a resolution calling for them all— And while this is
							going on, last Friday Evening a deputation from a small number of
							members of Congress waited upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							at his house and invited him to stand as a Candidate at the next
							Presidential election, to which he assented— The next day in a Gazette
							of this City a piece of three columns of the vilest and foulest slander
							upon me is published, and from that day, no conclave of Cardinals was
							ever more belaboured with cabaling than Congress have been to make
							partizans for the new Candidate— All this was a natural consequence of
							the position in which the members of an Administration were placed
							towards one another, by <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s</persRef> principle of
							limiting the Presidential service to eight years— I could solemnly
							declare that all my views hitherto had been exclusively confined to the
							support of his administration. It was with that view alone that I had
							proposed to accept the proffer of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor—
							It was very unfortunate for the administration that this offer had not
							been accepted— I should continue to act on the same principles, as long
							as it would be possible; but in the way things were now working, I knew
							not how long this might be— The President said he was fully aware that
							such always had been my conduct— That he had been perfectly satisfied
							with my service and hoped I should continue it during the remainder of
							his administration— That from the interest always taken by the members
							of Congress in the Presidential Election, it was natural that the
							prominent members of an administration, should by their respective
							friends be considered as competitors for the succession to the
							Presidency; and there was no question but that the diverse <pb type="ms"
								n="201"/>views of different members of Congress with reference to
							the succession, would affect very materially their conduct in relation
							to depending measures. He believed that any movement by members of
							Congress now, would be premature, and of little effect upon the ultimate
							result— He had been during a certain period of <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> administration in a predicament not unlike that
							of the present time— With regard to the management of the War, <persRef
								ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef> being at the Head
							of that Department, he, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, had from
							various circumstances, entertained the opinion, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison did not give due weight to his own
							opinions of military measures to be adopted— The succession then too
							mingled itself with every thing in Congress, and at a most critical
							period of the War, in order to take away from those who were thus
							disposed the motive: for such cabaling he had requested some of his
							particular friends, among whom <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hugh Nelson</persRef> was one, to say
							that he desired his name might be discarded, as a candidate for the
							succession to the Presidency: and if the War had continued, an
							arrangement to that effect was actually made, and the name of another
							person was to have been brought forward: after the close of the war
							however, no great interest of the Country being at stake, it was not
							thought necessary further to pursue that plan— With regard to the person
							who might be chosen as his Successor, from the relations between the
							several members of the Administration, and himself, he felt it his duty
							to take no part in favour of or against any one— I said this was what I
							should have expected, and was in my own opinion the only proper course
							to be pursued by him; and I added that if in the progress of his
							administration, any similar crisis to that of which he had spoken should
							arise, wherein the withdrawal of my name; from all Consideration as a
							Candidate, could subserve any purpose useful to the Country, I should
							very cheerfully imitate his example— He said he could see no possible
							occasion for that; and there might be occasions on which a vindication
							of my character from obloquy in the public prints would be proper— I
							observed that as to <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef>, I knew of no other
							cause of personal dissatisfaction on his part to me, than the fact of
							his not having been sent on a foreign mission, since his return from
							Sweden, which he might perhaps attribute to me— I had never borne him
							personally any ill-will— The personal intercourse between him and me had
							begun by my rendering him a service of great importance to him— I had
							afterwards corresponded with him as Chargé d’Affaires in France and
							England— We had acted together as Ministers at Ghent, having always been
							upon terms of good understanding together— How far M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell had acted the part of a friend to
							me, or done justice to my character, when he the President consulted him
							with a view to appointing me as Secretary of State, he knew as well as
							I. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s conduct and testimony on
							that occasion was well known to me. I was not unacquainted with the
							efforts which had then been made to stagger his confidence in me; but
							the only memory which I wished to retain of it, was his resistance to
							them, and his perseverance in calling me to the Station in opposition to
							them— This I should never forget; but I retained no resentment against
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Russell— In August 1817 I had seen
							him at Quincy, when he was just on the point of sailing to return to
							Sweden— He had then told me that he thought himself entitled to a better
							Mission, and expressed some inclination for that of Russia— And I
							appealed to the recollection of the President that I had informed him of
							this very soon after I came here. He remembered it, and said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell was under obligations to him. He
							had aided in advancing him in the diplomatic career, as far as the
							public Sentiment would possibly bear; and had told him when he last
							returned to Sweden, that it was not expected the Mission would be for
							more than one year— I might tell him from <hi rend="italic">him</hi>,
							that his mind had been so fully made up on the subject, that if I had
							made ever so earnest recommendation of Russell for a foreign Mission he
							should not have appointed him— His opinion was that the Executive had
							favoured him as far <pb type="ms" n="202"/>as was consistent with
							propriety— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s proper course
							was after the close of that mission to come home, and be brought forward
							in the line of popular support— To serve in the State Legislature, and
							in Congress for some time— To manifest his qualifications for public
							Office, before the Country and the world. After which he would stand on
							fair pretensions for employment abroad in competition with others— After
							returning to the Office, I sent for <persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Amado</persRef> the Portuguese
							Charge d’Affaires, who had sent me a note and called to claim the
							restoration of the Portuguese vessel taken and sent into Boston by
							Lieutenant Stockton. She attacked, and fired into his vessel mistaking
							her for a South-American privateer— We attended an Evening party at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thompson’s, the Secretary of the Navy—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> being unwell did not go. I had
							conversations with <persRef ref="king-rufus">R. King</persRef> and J. W.
							Taylor, upon the state of our Commercial Relations with France— Taylor
							says Trimble told Russell that he moved the call for the French
							Negotiation papers, to relieve him from embarrassment arising from his
							personal misunderstanding with me— Which imputation Russell repelled
							with some resentment— I had also some conversation with <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, concerning General Jackson’s Florida concerns— It
							was a dancing party.</p>

							who had assured him that his assent to stand as a Candidate, at the next

								Poinsett</persRef> a member from South-Carolina came to ask for the

								>President</persRef> summoned an immediate Meeting of the members of
							the Administration, which was fully attended— It was upon the
							appointment of the Postmaster at Albany— There was a Letter from the
								<persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice President</persRef>, and both
							the New-York Senators <persRef ref="king-rufus">R. King</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>, requesting that
							the appointment might be delayed a fortnight to give time to hear from
							Albany. The Postmaster General <persRef ref="meigs-return">R. J. Meigs
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> was at the
							President’s, and was called in—upon enquiry from the President, he said
							that he had determined to appoint immediately General <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-solomon">Van Rensselaer</persRef>, unless the
							President should object against it. His motives for making the
							appointment were, that twenty-two members of the New-York delegation, 11
							of whom were Bucktails, 7 Clintonians, and 4 federalists had signed a
							written recommendation of him. He had served as an Officer in the late
							war, and was suffering for life from the effect of wounds received in
							it— There could be no doubt that his appointment would be acceptable to
							the Peoples of Albany, for it was by their suffrages that he was now the
							Representative in Congress of their district— And finally, no other
							candidate had been presented to his Consideration. <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> asked if the late <persRef ref="lansing-john"
								>Chancellor Lansing</persRef> had not been named to him— He said
							no—and added that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lansing was nearly 70
							years of age— I enquired if there would be any inconvenience in delaying
							the appointment for a fortnight— He said there would, That <persRef
								ref="southwick-solomon">Southwick</persRef> would in the mean<pb
								type="ms" n="204"/>time be receiving the money of the public, and
							the longer he remained in Office the greater would be the amount of his
							delinquency— I asked if his deputy could not be authorised to act in the
							interval— He said his deputy was of his own family and would be under
							his controul. After he withdrew, the President said he thought it very
							questionable whether he ought to interfere in the case at-all— And now a
							warm discussion arose; with much diversity of opinions— Wirt said that
							the determination now not to interfere, would itself be an interference,
							and he severely censured the Postmaster General, for asking at-all the
							opinion of the President, after having made up his own mind. It was an
							attempt to put off his own responsibility upon the President— <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> concurred in this
							opinion— I said I did not see his conduct exactly in the same light— The
							law, gave the appointment of all the Postmasters exclusively to the
							Postmaster General— But he himself was removable from his own Office, at
							the pleasure of the President— Now <persRef ref="granger-gideon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger</persRef> had been removed
							with disgrace by <persRef ref="madison-james">President
								Madison</persRef>, for appointing <persRef ref="leib-michael">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leib</persRef> Postmaster at
							Philadelphia— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meigs therefore in
							determining to appoint Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Van Rensselaer,
							not only exercised a right, but performed a duty of his Office— But with
							the example of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger’s dismission
							before him it was quite justifiable in him to consult the President’s
							wish, with the declared intention of conforming to it— I thought I
							should have done the same under similar circumstances— <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford then shifted their ground of
							censure upon the Postmaster General, to the charge of having told Van
							Rensselaer himself and others, of his intention to appoint him, unless
							the President should object— Even in this I saw nothing to censure— The
							grounds upon which he had resolved to make the appointment, were solid
							and sufficient— If the President had objections, it was proper that he
							should be responsible for them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson
							hinted, that as to Van Rensselaer’s character, much might be said
							against that; but he did not incline to say it— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wirt and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford then
							insisted that if the President should decline interfering, it should be
							on a general principle that he would in no case of a Post-Office
							appointment interfere— I thought on the contrary that the special
							circumstances of this case were sufficient, and ought to be the only
							reasons assigned for declining to interfere. There might be cases in
							which it would be quite proper that the President should interfere; and
							I said I hoped he would not preclude himself from the use of influence
							on a proper occasion, by extending beyond its necessary limits the
							ground of declining to act at this time— Crawford said then the Law
							ought to be changed— I said that might be— And Crawford adverted to a
							joint Report made by him and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, in
							1816. which had recommended that all the Postmasters whose Salaries
							amounted to 2000 dollars should be appointed by nomination to the
							Senate— The effect of this would be to transfer Patronage from the
							Postmaster General to the Secretary of the Treasury, through whom all
							applications for those appointments would be made— The President without
							declaring how he should decide, requested M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Thompson when the Meeting broke up to remain with him—
							Calhoun took scarcely any part in the discussion, but after we came out
							from the President’s said that the conduct of the Postmaster General had
							been perfectly correct— Why did he not say so while the discussion was
							going on at the President’s? The four members of the House from
							New-York, who did not sign the recommendation of Van Rensselaer are
								<persRef ref="pitcher-nathaniel">Pitcher</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="walworth-reuben">Walworth</persRef>, <persRef

							declined signing the paper— I drafted a despatch to <persRef

							Resolutions, I should have advised him many times to look before he took
							the leap. He said he was sure of his facts, and if he could do nothing
							with him in Congress, he would expose them to the view of the People— He
							thought the appointment of Thomas to examine the Land-Offices a
							violation of the Spirit, both of the Constitution, and of a Law of
							Congress: it was he believed, a violation of their Letter—perhaps in
							that, he might be mistaken. He could not be mistaken, in the opinion
							that it was essentially corrupt— I asked him, if in the debates that
							would arise, he could reckon upon support in the House— He said he had
							been <pb type="ms" n="206"/>assured of support from several members of

							Resolution, for information, the return of which would shew the loss of
							large sums of money to the public, by deposits of it in Banks known to
							be insolvent, with stipulations that they should have the benefit of it
							for six Months— This made all the Directors of all these broken Banks in
