							Canning’s alterations which were only of a few words— <persRef

							and had also seen the <persRef ref="carbery-thomas">Mayor</persRef>; who
							had received from the Constable complained of an account of the incident
							differing in some particulars, from that which Stackelberg had received
							from his Servants— The Constable says he was invited into the House. The
							Baron said he would make further enquiry into the facts— That he should
							not now have complained if something in the same sort had not happened
							to him, once or twice before, which he had not noticed; and that he
							wished now to make no unnecessary difficulty; but would readily withdraw
							his note if desired— He asked also for a copy of the provisions in the
							Act of Congress, requiring that foreign Ministers should furnish lists
							of their families, and servants at the Department of State—with which he
							had not been acquainted. I received a despatch from <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">H. Middleton</persRef> our Minister at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, dated 8/20 August relating
							entirely to the North-West Coast Controversy. — The <persRef

							Minister from Russia, charged with a proposal for negotiating on the
							Subject— <persRef ref="speransky-mikhail">Speransky</persRef>, now
							Governor General of Siberia told Middleton that they had at first
							thought of declaring the Northern Pacific Ocean a Mare Clausum— But
							afterwards took the 100 Italian Miles, from the 30 leagues in the Treaty
							of Utrecht, which is an exclusion only from a fishery, and not from
							Navigation. I took this Letter which is most confidential to the
							President, and desired him after reading it to return it to me, that it
							may not be exposed to be brought before the public, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton requests that it may not. The
							President read me a paragraph, of the draft of his Message, which he had
							begun to prepare. It related to the Proclamation of 24. August, and
							intercourse with the British Colonies in America. I asked him if he
							would not think it admirable to notice in the message, the latitude of
							Construction which was given to the term West-Indies in the act of
							Congress of 6. May by the Proclamation— He said he would— I left Cards

							could be diplomatically sustained— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young

							the contrary for sometime in perfect good humour and civility, as he
							still persisted, in the warmth of the collision, I said, “why, you never
							drank a drop of Tokai in your life”— I set this down as a token of
							self-disapprobation for having said it— Tazewell made no reply; but
							looked hurt— The conversation turned upon other topics; and as leaving
							the table he went away, without returning with the rest of the company
							to the drawing room— I have no good apology to make to myself for this
							incivility; for that Tazewell himself is not sparing of feelings in the
							clash of conversation, and had been much otherwise even at this dinner
							is no justification to me.</p>

									>r</hi> Little</persRef>; in the Morning from Proverbs 10.29.—
							“The way of the Lord is strength to the upright: but destruction shall
							be to the workers of iniquity”— A moral discourse— After the morning
							service he gave a short Lecture of about fifteen minutes, introductory
							to a course, to be delivered in the same manner. He said it was a
							practice customary in many of the Unitarian Societies in England— That
							it had been observed that the Unitarians were better informed than other
							Sects of Christians, and that it was desirable they should be careful to
							preserve that reputation— He laid down an extensive plan upon which he
							proposed to follow up this course; and said that in his Lecture next
							given he should begin with a historical account of the Scriptures. His
							course is to be historical, geographical and critical; a mass of
							information more suitable to be communicated by Lectures, than by
							Sermons— I thought his plan a very good one, but that it would be more
							profitably pursued, by devoting to it one of the Services of the day,
							than by distracting the attention from the morning Sermon to a different
							subject for meditation— The afternoon discourse, was from Matthew 5.45.
							“That ye may be the children of your father which is in Heaven: for he
							maketh his sun to rise on the evil, and on the good, and sendeth rain on
							the just and on the unjust.”— The precept of returning good for evil is
							one of the most exalted and sublime lessons of Christianity; and perhaps
							the most difficult of all its doctrines to carry into practice— There is
							little of that sort of Christianity in the world— Would there were more—

							commenced a series of numbers under the Editorial parts of that paper,
							headed the Presidential Question; each of two of three Columns— Five
							numbers have appeared, written in Colvin’s best manner, professing to
							give a delineation of my character, and scanning my pretensions to the
							Presidency. They present me in caricature, and touch upon every thing
							true, and every thing false that can be made to resemble truth, which
							could degrade me in the popular opinion. They are written with just so
							much regard to truth, as to seize on single facts, to which a suspicious
							colouring may be given, from which a whole tale of falsehood is
							fabricated and asserted as fact to exhibit me as a base and despicable
							character. Between three and four years ago, Colvin attempted to fawn
							himself into my favour, by eulogizing me in newspapers— He published a

							it was written by him, I requested him to abstain from any such
							publications having any personal reference to me whatever— That if he
							inclined to political newspaper discussion, and would defend and
							vindicate any measures of the administration which might be assailed,
							his labours would be acceptable, but that I wanted no personal
							panegyrist— He continued to cringe however, and to work windingly for my
							good graces, but besides the warning of his old treachery to <persRef
								ref="smith-robert">Robert Smith</persRef>, the more I saw of him the
							more reason I had for distrusting him; and I never placed any confidence
							in him— He had shrewdness enough <hi rend="strikethrough">to</hi> after
							a year or two of ineffectual parasitical courtship, to discover his
							failure, and among my present characteristics enumerates, a lurking and
							distrustful suspicion in the eye— He would occasionally endeavor
							indirectly to get sight of the secret diplomatic documents but they were
							kept out of his reach— His absences from the Office, and neglect of his
							duties, in the mean time kept increasing with his habits of intemperance
							till they could no longer be <pb type="ms" n="411"/>tolerated. I had
							long been aware that it must ultimately come to this; and have been
							gradually breaking his hold from the Office till he could be dismissed
							without inconvenience— I know that from that moment he would become the
							bitterest of my revilers; and of the whole tribe he is the only one, who
							can be instigated to injure me, by revenge— A comparison between his
							Portrait of 1819 and his Caricature now, would be curious, as marking
							the depraved ingenuity of unprincipled intellect. His five numbers on
							the Presidential Question, teem with falsehoods. I wrote this morning
							and sent to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>, a short paper containing a
							direct contradiction of two among the basest of those falsehoods— I did
							this in deference to feelings in my family more sensitive to such
							Slanders than my own— No man in America has made his way through showers
							of ribaldry and invective of this character, more frequent and various
							than I have breasted— A new storm of them has in the last eighteen
							months burst upon me; and will rage, until every indication of a party
							holding my name up as a Candidate for the Presidency, shall have
							vanished— I received a Letter from <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph"
								>Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> at Philadelphia, stating that a new
							Commission would issue from the Court to take over again my first
							deposition in the case of <persRef ref="harris-levett">Harris</persRef>
							vs <persRef ref="lewis-william">Lewis</persRef>, on account of some

								>Comptroller’s</persRef> Circular and the Colonial Intercourse— He

								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>— The <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef> is at Baltimore—
								<persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning’s</persRef> Letter was read by the President; and I read the
							draft of my answer. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning’s complaint
							is two fold— One that while the Act of Parliament levies the same duties
							in our importations to the Colonies whether in American or in British
							Vessels, and admits direct importations in American Vessels of the
							Products of the whole United States, our Proclamation, as explained by
							the <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller’s</persRef> Letter,
							levies foreign tonnage duties, and the ten per Cent additional on
							merchandise, and limits the importations to West India Products from the
							West-Indies, and to North American Products from North-America, when
							imported in British Vessels. And he argues, that in the principle of
							reciprocity for opening the intercourse, Great Britain has a right to
							claim, that we should impose no restriction upon the British Navigation,
							employed in it, which is not a specific counterpart of a like
							restriction, upon our Navigation in the Act of Parliament. My Answer,
							alleges a want of Authority in the Executive to remove the Tonnage and
							discriminating duties; and denies the principle that we should be
							confined to specific counterparts of any restrictions in the Act of
							Parliament— It enumerates the various restrictions upon our Navigation,
							as admitted under the Act of Parliament, and says that our restrictions
							may perhaps not be sufficient to counteract them. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford expressed a doubt whether the
							second point of Canning’s complaint was completely answered by my draft—
							He said that as to the tonnage and other <pb type="ms" n="412"
							/>discriminating duties it was clear, that the President had no
							authority to repeal them, but he might remove the restriction upon the
							importations, so as to admit the Productions of all the Colonies, from
							any of the Colonial Ports— And he inclined to the opinion that the
							discriminating duties were sufficient to countervail in favour of our
							Navigation the British restrictions— This however is altogether
							conjectural— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun enquired, whether we
							had any facts, and knew how the late opening of the intercourse had
							operated— I had nothing but <persRef ref="hollingsworth-jehu"
								>Hollingsworth’s</persRef> Letters, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford had nothing— There was some discussion as to the
							effect of admitting in British Vessels West India produce from
							North-America and North-American produce from the West-Indies. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun remarked upon the advantage it
							would give in making up assorted Cargoes, and I observed that its effect
							must be estimated in connection with the latitude of exportation which
							we have allowed to British vessels without restriction; while they lay
							our vessels under export bonds, to land their own Cargoes exclusively in
							the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford finally said,
							and all agreed that no alteration of the Proclamation would be
							advisable; the Meeting of Congress approaching now within a Month; and
							it being evident that the regulation of the intercourse with the British
							Colonies, must be a subject of negotiation between the Governments— The
							President suggested the propriety of omitting the passage of my draft
							which intimated that the counter-restrictions of the Proclamation might
							perhaps not be sufficient, but consented that it should remain, modified
							to say they were surely not more than sufficient— My draft of a Letter
							to the <persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin">Spanish Minister
								Anduaga</persRef>, on the case of the Palmyra, was also read and
							approved— The new Chargé d’Affaires from Portugal <persRef
								ref="constancio-francisco">Constancio</persRef> arrived and while I
							was at the President’s, left at the Department of State the Letter to
							me, introducing him, from the Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs. It
							is dated in February last, and contains the proposals of alliance, and
							of a Commission for Claims, of Portuguese Subjects upon the Government
							of the United States, which had been broached by the <persRef
								ref="correa-joseph">Abbé Correa</persRef>, and discussed with
								<persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Amado-Grehon</persRef>. He left three Letters from the <persRef

							of which was the notification of recall of the Abbe Corréa. <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							sent these Letters over to the President’s while we were there in

								Solano Constancio</persRef>, the new Chargé d’Affaires from
							Portugal, came to the Office. He is new in the Diplomatic Career, to
							which he has been introduced by the late Revolution in Portugal. He
							comes last from France, and appears lively and loquacious— He told me
							that his introductory Letter to me from the Portuguese Minister of
							foreign Affairs was of an old date. That he had read the latest
							Correspondence between me and <persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Amado-Grehon</persRef>—that he should
							not revive the subjects of it, without further Instructions from his
							Government— That they had naturally been much pressed by Claimants,
							Portuguese and Brazilian, who had suffered by capture of their property;
							but he was happy that nothing further of that kind was likely to occur.
							Portugal was now at Peace with all the world, and there was not even a
							flag of <persRef ref="artigas-jose">Artigas</persRef>, under which
							captures of Portuguese property could be made— Portugal was disposed to
							recognize the Independence of all South-America, not excepting Brazil
							itself, if the People there should desire it. He professed also great
							attachment to the United States, and high admiration of our political
							Institutions; and said he had been several times on the point of coming
							to settle in this Country as a private individual— He wished to be
							presented to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, for
							which with the President’s subsequent approbation I appointed one
							O’Clock, to-morrow. I received despatches from <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef> at Buenos-Ayres, and from
								<persRef ref="raguet-condy">Condy Raguet</persRef> our new Consul,
							at Rio de Janeiro, and from his predecessor there, the vice-Consul

							Buenos-Ayres struggling faction against faction, and fanaticism against
							freedom, without any settlement, and with little prospect of any
							settlement upon principles of order, justice, or liberty. I took all
							these despatches, and those yesterday received from Russia, and from
							Spain to the President, with whom I left them— The President read to me
							the paragraphs prepared for his Message relating to Great-Britain and
							the Colonial intercourse, to France and the Commercial Convention, and
							to Russia and the mediated Convention—also those concerning
							South-America, and the illegal blockades of both parties to that War. He
							had not prepared the paragraphs concerning the state of the Treasury,
							but told me that although since his return <persRef

								Crawford</persRef> had sent him a statement less favourable than
							those he had before received from the <persRef ref="jones-edward">Chief
								Clerk</persRef> and <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">Register of the
								Treasury</persRef>, the receipts of the year would exceed the
							estimate by more than four Millions of dollars— I mentioned to the
							President the Negotiation for which we must be prepared with the Russian
							Minister daily expected, <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron
								Tuyl</persRef>, concerning the Russian claims on the North-west
							Coast of this Continent, and which I apprehend will be of considerable
								<pb type="ms" n="415"/>difficulty, for the whole claim on the part
							of Russia seems to be groundless. The <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> has committed himself on the face of the world to
							pretensions that he cannot sustain, and now comes to obtain by
							negotiation, a part of the wrong by renouncing the remainder— The
							President said he had no doubt the Emperor would be satisfied with
							Latitude 55 for the boundary; but I remarked that we had no immediate
							interest in the boundary question. Having no claim of our own, North of
							49. it was immaterial to us whether Russia came to 55 or to 51— That was
							a question particularly for Great-Britain— He said the maritime question
							might be settled by reducing the claim of exclusive jurisdiction to a
							distance of one marine league from the Shore— I did not apprehend any
							difficulty in that— The prohibition to our Citizens of trading with the
							Indians of the North-west Coast, was the knot that I expected, and the
							embarrassment will be, that having no counter-claim on our part,
							whatever we agree to in the negotiation must in its nature be
							concessions without equivalent— I desired the President to turn his
							attention to this subject; and to consider, whether it would be
							expedient to communicate with the British Government through <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> or <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi

							Great-Britain might treat such a communication, as she had done with the
							proposal for acknowledging the Independence of Buenos-Aires— Communicate
							it immediately to Russia, and turn it to her own account— To avoid this,
							I asked if it might not upon the first overtures from Baron Tuyl, meet
							them immediately by an enquiry how the question stands in this affair,
							between Great Britain and Russia; with a frank avowal that we think
							Great-Britain has so much claim of interest in this concern, that no
							effective arrangement of it can be concluded without consulting her— He
							said it would deserve great consideration— I also spoke of the necessity
							of settling some determinate system of diplomatic intercourse with the
							South-American Governments, and expressed my opinion that of the five
							Plenipotentiary Missions, for which appropriations were made at the last
							Session of Congress, one at the most, ought to be now filled, and I had

									>r</hi> Constancio</persRef> repeated to him, the substance of
							what he had said yesterday to me, and reciprocal professions of friendly

							particularly dwelt upon the similarity of principles on which the two

							to have the work ready to be laid on the tables of the members the first

							their supply of Paper from <persRef ref="patterson-e"
								>Patterson</persRef>, and are expecting a Supply from Baltimore,
							hourly— I told Seaton that they must postpone their necessities for
							money, till they got their paper— That the members of Congress would be
							much dissatisfied if this document should not be ready for them at the
							commencement of the Session, and that I had finally dismissed <persRef
								ref="colvin-john">Colvin</persRef> from the Department principally
							for his neglect of this work. Seaton said I ought to have dismissed

							enclosing the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Canto of an Epic Poem in
							36. Books, of which the author requested my opinion as a critic. The

							unsettled State of Europe— I doubted most of those concerning Spain and
							Portugal, in which he had spoken of their revolutionary Prospects, more
							favourably than I thought the state of facts according to our most

						<p><date>17. VI:30.</date> The Services at the Unitarian Church were
							performed by <persRef ref="taylor-james3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Taylor</persRef> of Philadelphia; whose Morning Sermon was from John
							13.19. “Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass ye
							may believe that I am <hi rend="italic">he.</hi>” The general subject
							was the effect of prophecy as Evidence of the truth of Christianity. He
							divided the prophecies concerning Christ into two Classes: those
							contained in the Books of the Old-Testament, and those given out by
							himself in the New— And subdivided again the latter, into prophesies
							accomplished while he lived, and those fulfilled since his decease.
							Among the prophecies of the old Testament, he spoke with special
							emphasis of those of <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>, so clear,
							so precise, so circumstantial that it seemed as if they could only have
							been written after the Event; insomuch that this prophet had sometimes
							been denominated the fifth Evangelist; though his prophecies had been
							delivered 700 years before the birth of Christ— Of the prophecies of
							Jesus himself fulfilled while he lived he remarked the minuteness of the
							incidents equally beyond the reach of human foresight and deception—such
							as the piece of money found in the mouth of the fish—the colt tied in
							the village for which he sent—the man with a pitcher who was to be
							followed into the house where he meant to keep the passover, and the
							furnished upper chamber into which they would be shewn— The designation
							of the disciple who would betray him— The declaration to the disciples
							themselves that they would all desert him, and the positive prediction
							of his own death— Of those fulfilled since his decease, the declaration
							concerning the woman who anointed his feet, and the prediction of the
							destruction of Jerusalem were chiefly particularized as Events
							exceedingly improbable when foretold, yet so exactly realized that it
							was impossible to compare the narrative of the destruction of Jerusalem
							in Josephus, with the prediction, without astonishment— The text of the
							afternoon discourse was 1. Corinthians 10.32. “Give none Offense,
							neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God”—
							After explaining the meaning of the text necessarily to be an injunction
							to give no one, just <hi rend="italic">Cause</hi> of Offence, he
							enlarged first upon the general Christian duty of kindness, benevolence,
							and brotherly love, as applicable to all mankind, and then, following
							the division suggested by the words of the text pointed out the line of
							conduct suitable for the members of this Society, towards those of other
							Christian denominations, towards unbelievers, and towards those of the
							Society itself. With regard to all, he inculcated the Laws of Charity
							and Love— With both these sermons I was much gratified, and ought to be
							improved; by the first in confirmation of faith; by the second in purity
							of heart, and kindliness of affection towards my fellow men: It is hard
							in the observation and reflection of a long human life, to preserve in
							untainted certainty the belief—either of Christianity, or of a life
							beyond the grave. It is yet harder in the conflicts with the world, and
							with human depravity to retain the feeling of brotherly kindness towards
							all men— Whatever tends <pb type="ms" n="419"/>to confirm confidence in
							the truth of the gospel, and to fortify the social affections is
							profitable to direct; and points to the path of virtue. Evening employed

							Officer in the Marine Corps— I went with him to the Navy Department, and
							introduced him to <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thompson</persRef> the Secretary. The Bishop of
							Louisiana, <persRef ref="dubourg-louis">Dubourg</persRef> came in behalf
							of a Convent of Ursuline Nuns at New-Orleans, disquieted, as to their
							title to the Land upon which their buildings stand— In April 1818 an Act
							of Congress authorized the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> to sell adjoining Lands which had formerly
							belonged to the Convent, but many years before the Cession to the United
							States had been taken for Barracks and a military Hospital— Shortly
							after the passage of the Act of Congress the Nuns sent a memorial to the
							President, protesting against the Sale, which they rather gratuitously
							seem to apprehend was meant to include their own land and buildings; but
							advancing a claim to the Barrack and Hospital Lands also, on the plea,
							that they had been originally granted to them but were afterwards taken
							by <persRef ref="louis-xv">Louis 15</persRef>. for the special purpose
							of a military hospital and barracks— The Nuns say that if the lands are
							to be appropriated to other purposes, they ought in justice and Equity
							to revert to them. The President took the opinion of the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney-General</persRef> upon the Memorial,
							which was that the Nuns were entitled to their own premises and ought
							not to be disturbed in them: but that their claim to the Barrack and
							Hospital Land, could not be allowed by the Executive— The Bishop who has
							come here from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis, Missouri, on this
							affair did not know that the Nuns had ever advanced this latter claim,
							which he said was a folly; and was otherwise misinformed concerning the
							state of the business— He had understood that at two several times in
							the last four years, Letters in behalf of the Nuns had been written to
							me, and remained unanswered— No Letter to me of that sort had <pb
								type="ms" n="421"/>ever been received; the Memorial had been
							transmitted to the President directly: he had taken the opinion of the
							Attorney-General upon it; and then deposited the papers at the
							Department of State— The Bishop said his only object was that the claim
							of the United States to that portion of the Estate, in which the opinion
							of the Attorney-General, pronounced the title of the Nuns to be good
							should be removed— But as the subject matter is the resort of the
							General Land-Office, which is an appendage to the Treasury Department, I
							referred him to the Treasury, and directed the papers to be sent to
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"

							and where preparations were making for proclaiming the <persRef
								ref="pedro-iv">Prince</persRef>, on the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of October, Emperor of Brasil— As the latest accounts from
							Lisbon announce the adoption of measures by the Cortes there, which
							forebode a conflict between Portugal and Brazil, I observed to the
							President that we should be very soon called to assume a distinct
							attitude in relation to that question— He said he would notice it in the

								Duval</persRef>, the Governor of that Territory, has <hi

							Valparaiso of 5. August with the speech of the <persRef
								ref="ohiggins-bernardo">Director O’Higgins</persRef> on the new

								ref="barbemarbois-francois">Marquis de Marbois</persRef> of 18.
							August— He proposes to write a History of the Cession of Louisiana, and
							writes to ask for a communication of any documents, or printed works
							relating to it which have been published here— He says it has become a
							sort of fashion to blame the Cession of Louisiana (meaning in France) a
							circumstance not surprising, but indicative of the restless ambition yet
							burning in the bosoms of French Statesmen— And from General <persRef
								ref="devereux-john">John D’Evereux</persRef>, Commander of the Irish
							Legion in the Army of the Colombian Republic. This Letter is dated
							Bogota, 22 September last, and its object is to persuade the President
							to issue Letters of Marque and reprizal against Spain, to prevent the
							Colombian Republicans from falling into Monarchy; to which he intimates
							they are dangerously addicted— <persRef ref="levy-unknown">M<hi

							transportation to Florida— That for the peculiarity of the case,
							Congress only could provide— He asked, if the President would recommend
							the subject to Congress?— I said it would be better for the parties
							concerned to apply by Petition or Memorial— The President had also told
							me that Levy had made a direct application to him on another subject.
							That he had a sugar plantation in East-Florida, whence he wanted to make
							a road to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine— And the President

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef> at the Unitarian
							Church, from Luke 16.2. “Give an account of thy stewardship.”— There was
							a suitable solemnity in his treatment of the subject which is itself
							solemn. He dwelt with earnestness on the topic of future retribution,
							and disclaimed as no genuine principle of unitarians that there can be
							any merit towards God, in good works. This discourse was less impressive
							and more in the beaten track than either of those delivered by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor last Sunday— At one O’Clock we
							attended the funeral of <persRef ref="vanness-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Middleton</persRef>; who was buried
							in a grave-yard of the family, near the Catholic Church— The attendance
							was numerous, and the sympathy with the distress of the family very
							general.— An only child, married less than a year ago, with every
							prospect of a long and happy life, thus prematurely cut off in the prime
							gives a lesson upon the delusions of earthly hope, which appeals for the
							moment to every heart— There was on account of this funeral, no

							presbyterian, and heard <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi

							of their career, and a panegyric upon <persRef ref="paul">Saint
								Paul</persRef> as one of the most distinguished and effective
							Apostles of Christ; he divided his subject into the consideration of the
							beginning the progress and the termination of the Christian’s course— It
							must begin with <hi rend="italic">regeneration</hi>. This brought the
							preacher at once into the train of calvinistic doctrines, which
							thenceforth guided him to his conclusion. How is it, that men will
							pertinaciously insist upon being told as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Campbell told his hearers, that <pb type="ms" n="423"/>every one of them
							knew his own heart to be deceitful above all things and desperately
							wicked; and yet that they would resist as a cruel injury the slightest
							allusion to any specific imputation of wrong to any of them
							individually? Is it that all the terrors of Calvinism are dealt out in

							But he must be aware that most or all of the Merchants in this Country

							Subjects or so connected, as to be in British Interests— Our merchants
							told a very different story— There would be doubtless a bias of
							partiality on both sides, but our Merchants would of course expect that
							we should attend to their Interests— He said he thought Congress would
							see the thing in a more favourable light than this; I replied that if
							such a disposition should be manifested in Congress, it would in no wise

								<persRef ref="hollingsworth-jehu">Jehu Hollingsworth</persRef>,
							dated the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Eustatius, and declaring that all of the
							American vessels that have entered at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Kitts, and Nevis since the opening of the Ports, not one had been
							satisfied— He touched again upon the discrimination made by us between
							the North-American, and the West-Indian British Colonies, which I
							defended and he contested on the same arguments as heretofore— I told
							him it was probable however that Congress might remove that
							discrimination and substitute other regulations in its stead. Perhaps a
							limitation to direct voyages, both to and from the Colonies— Perhaps a
							limited list of imports, excepting the most important of their export
							articles; such as Rum, for which they could find no other market, as
							they excluded our salted fish, and provisions— He said he was sure that
							was what I was coming to—and again intimated the threat of closing the
							Ports again, which I again told him they were quite free to do: and
							would no doubt do, if they found it for their interest. We knew that had
							been their motive for opening the Ports— He said we supposed they had
							been compelled by our restrictive measures to open the Ports; but he
							believed we were in that mistaken— I said that we did not attribute it
							altogether to that— We ascribed much to the Independence of the South
							American Provinces under which it was impossible that the old exclusive
							and excluding Colonial system should much longer endure, any where. He
							remarked that the reason upon which Colonies were confined to <hi
								rend="italic">exclusive </hi>intercourse, with the mother Country
							was the <hi rend="italic">expense</hi>, of their Settlement— Observing
							me to smile at this, he asked whether it was not so?— I asked how much
								<hi rend="italic">expense</hi>, the Settlement of Mexico and Peru
							had cost Spain under Cortes and Pizarro? I added it was conquest and
							conversion: the Bull of <persRef ref="alexander-vi">Alexander
								6</persRef>. and the sword of injustice, in which the exclusions of
							modern Colonization had originated. Spain had set the example— She had
							forbidden foreigners from setting a foot in her Colonies, upon pain of
							death and the other Colonizing States of Europe, had imitated the
							exclusion, though not the rigour of the penalty— The expense of
							colonizing had formed no part of the Consideration— The whole system of
							modern Colonization was an abuse of Government, and it was time that it
							should come to an end. But he said that the British Colonies had been
							settled upon principles of the utmost liberality. I asked him if he had
							ever read <persRef ref="neal-daniel">Neal’s</persRef> History of the
							Puritans?— No— Well— He knew that the first Settlement of New-England
							was made by Puritans— Yes— And they were outcasts from their Country,
							for the sake of Conscience; and Pilgrims from Holland to a Wilderness in
							America for the sake of their Country— They came here to escape turning
							to Dutchmen, and even here could not obtain a Charter securing to them
							the blessing of toleration— He said that was because intolerance was
							unfortunately the Spirit of that age; which I admitted, but thought it
							no proof of the liberality of the British System— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning was also very inquisitive about
							this expedition of General <persRef ref="ducoudray-holstein">Ducoudray
								Holstein</persRef> and <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">Baptis
								Irvine</persRef> against the Island of Porto-Rico, which he seemed
							to fear was not yet entirely broken up— He betrayed more of alarm than
							he avowed— It was apparent to me that he suspected the expedition had
							been secretly sanctioned or connived at by the American Government and
							that we, intended to make ourselves Masters of Porto-Rico— Without
							appearing to discover his apprehensions, I said what was sufficient to
							tranquilize them; told him that the expedition was entirely broken up;
							and that we had known nothing of it, until we first heard of it from the
							Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartholomew— He intimated a
							wish that we should give orders to our public vessels in the West-Indies
							against it, but I gave him no encouragement to expect that we would—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning as usual kept me till near
							dark— My family spent the Evening at <persRef ref="thornton-william"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton’s</persRef>, and I went

						<p><pb type="ms" n="425"/><date>26. V.</date> Note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> directing a Meeting of the
							Members of the Administration at one O’Clock— Present, <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>— The President read the draught prepared for his
							Message to Congress, at the opening of the Session of Congress. It is
							very long, and contains more of discussion than seemed to me suitable
							for such a paper.— The meeting was adjourned to half past one to-morrow,
							for reading it by paragraphs. Very few observations upon it were made
							this day— Calhoun proposed to substitute the words <hi rend="italic"
								>value</hi> of freight, for <hi rend="italic">cost</hi> of freight,
							and I proposed the use of the term <hi rend="italic">freight</hi>
							alone—which was sufficient to express the idea intended to be conveyed
							in the passage— The criticism in Calhoun’s objection to the term cost,
							was minute, but ingenious and just— It was in a paragraph concerning the
							comparative <hi rend="italic">value</hi> of our exports and it had been
							drawn up by Crawford— The term cost, as thus applied to freight was
							incorrect, and Calhoun’s objection to it shewed that he was deeper in
							political Economy than Crawford— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							objected to a passage concerning the decision of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, on the Ghent Treaty
							question— The President had said the Documents, <hi rend="italic"
								>including</hi> a Convention, to carry the decision into effect,
							would be communicated— Crawford thought this mode of expression would
							appear to imply that the <hi rend="italic">Convention</hi>, had also
							been made by the Emperor— He had not heard of the Convention before—
							There was in the draught a very long paragraph upon the Military Academy
							at West-Point— I thought it occupied too large a space in the Message— I
							doubted whether any part of it was necessary; and there were in it a
							number of remarks upon the indocility and ardour of youthful minds of a
							nature too speculative, and doctrinal, for the occasion— I started the
							question first only upon these; and on the reperusal extended it, to the
							whole paragraph, with the exception of two or three sentences,
							sufficient to declare explicitly the President’s opinion in favour of
							maintaining the Institution: to check the disposition to abolish the
							institution, should it reappear, which was manifested in Congress at
							their last Session. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford concurred
							with me in opinion, and observed that the remarks relating to the West
							Point Academy were the less necessary, as no measure was recommended to
							Congress in connection with them. He added that he thought there would
							be no attempt in Congress against the West-Point Academy at the next
							Session— That one member only, <persRef ref="cannon-newton">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Cannon</persRef>, had heretofore made
							efforts against it without success— I observed that besides this there
							had been at the last Session of Congress a Report of the Military
							Committee of the House against it, with some incorrect calculations of
							its expensiveness, to its disadvantage— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford did not remember it— After we left the President’s M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun came to my Office, and suggested a
							wish that I would not press the objection that I had opened to the
							paragraph in the Message concerning the West-Point Academy.— He said
							that the principle of objecting because no measure was recommended,
							could go great lengths to expunge much the greatest part of the Message,
							the object of which was adapted to the existing state of things; and the
							intention of the President was strongly to mark his opinions in support
							of the Institutions of the Country. I said I was not tenacious of the
							objection; but the message was very long; and remarks of general
							speculation upon the difficulty of keeping young men under proper
							discipline, did not seem to me to be there in their proper place. He
							said they might be omitted. The Message was very long, owing to the
							President’s style of writing; as he was apt to dwell upon details— The
							whole substance of this message for example might be compressed into
							less than half the words in which he had cloathed it— I shall say no
							more upon the West-Point speculation in the Message— I see the state of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s mind; and one of my motives
							for the question that I made upon it was to ascertain whether he would
							be sensitive upon it. I am satisfied. I have a good opinion of the
							West-Point Academy, as one useful Institution; and have no disposition
							to reduce it, to curtail the Patronage of the War Department. A motive
								<pb type="ms" n="426"/>which I believe instigates those who now
							assail the establishment, as the Patronage animates Calhoun in its
							defence— I answered this Evening a Letter from <persRef

								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef>— The Message was again read
							through by Paragraphs— And various alterations were suggested— I
							questioned the use of the word <hi rend="italic">internal,</hi> as
							referring to the Conventions with France, and with Great-Britain, under
							the Russian Mediation; and to the Proclamation opening the Ports to
							British vessels from the Colonies— Also the word <hi rend="italic"
								>supervision</hi>, as applied to the Cumberland Road. The part of
							the message relating to the Affairs of the Treasury Department, was on a
							separate sheet in the hand-writing of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford— It stated the receipts of the year as having exceeded the
							anticipation of the last, which it does by six or seven Millions. But
							after adding that the income of the year will be more than adequate to
							defray its expences, it proceeds to say, that our exports having now
							less in value than our imports, there will be a reaction which will
							occasion a deficiency of revenue in 1824 though not beyond what the
							excess of income in 1823 will be sufficient to cover— I questioned the
							expediency of introducing either part of this prophesy— I said that
							there was no doubt that the value of our imports this year had largely
							exceeded that of our exports— The exportation of Spice, at least 8 or 9
							Millions beyond the imports; and the rate of exchange with England, from
							ten to fourteen per Cent against us was decisive proof of that— But
							whether it would produce reaction sufficient to occasion a deficiency of
							revenue in 1824 was to me too doubtful, to hazard upon it a prediction,
							which if realized, will be of no use, and if contradicted by the event
							would make matter for animadversion hereafter— It was looking forward
							two years, and although a diminution of revenue is to be expected; yet
							there are so many not improbable events, which may produce an opposite
							result that I should deem it wiser not to foretell without necessity.
							Calhoun said that 8 per Cent of the rate of exchange was owing to our
							proportional valuation of gold to silver— And he further said that
							altho’ there might probably be a diminution of the revenue in 1824—it
							would certainly not be such as to fall short of the expenditures of the
							year so as to require to be made up by the surplus of 1823. Crawford
							said it was looking forward only 18 Months, as the whole receipts of the
							year 1824. must be secured before the first of July of that year— That
							unless a War should break out in Europe, there was no Event within
							bounds of probability that could prevent a reaction that must make the
							revenue fall short.— I had mentioned the contingency of scarcity
							harvests in Europe. The increase of our trade with South America and the
							annual increase of our population. He said there was no prospect of an
							improvement in the markets for our principal productions. The prices of
							Cotton, were continually falling, and flour had born during the present
							year a good price— There was no prospect of its rising but the contrary—
							He did not think much was to be expected, from the increase of trade to
							South-America, and he had calculated that the increase of our own
							manufactures, would in the effect upon our revenue, about balance that
							of our population. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun observed that
							notwithstanding the great importations at New-York during the last year,
							the goods were going off so fast, and business was so brisk that it was
							doubtful whether any diminution of the imports would take place— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson also took up the objection to the
							prophesy, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford finally gave it
							up, with a view to introduce it into his own annual Report, where I told
							him I thought it would be more proper than in the Message— There was a
							paragraph upon the piratical States of Barbary, containing severe
							reflections upon the Maritime Powers of Europe, for <pb type="ms"
								n="427"/>not suppressing the whole system. I asked whether this
							would not be offensive to those European Powers, without answering any
							useful purpose? The more so, as there had been no exercise of the
							piratical system so called since <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord
								Exmouth’s</persRef> attack upon Algiers. Great-Britain had done
							something towards the suppression of the system. It had not since been
							practised— Would it not seem ill-timed to reproach them now with not
							having done more— The President said he had introduced it in connection,
							with our own exertions to suppress the recent piracies in the West-India
							Seas— I remarked that the West-India Piracies, and the Barbary system,
							could hardly come under the same denomination— The latter was regulated
							by a principle— It was religious War, prescribed by the Coran, which
							commanded War against infidels, with the option to them of conversion or
							tribute. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford to whom this appeared
							to be new, said that the Turks acted upon no such principle; as the
							Porte made no such alternative a condition of Peace with Christian
							Powers— I said no Treaties could be made with them, but by Presents,
							which they doubtless consider as tribute, and if they ever made Treaties
							of Peace without them, their plea for justifying themselves was
							necessity—compulsion— After some discussion, the President said he would
							perhaps omit the paragraph— The Message had also several paragraphs
							relating to the Greeks, with no little invective upon the <hi
								rend="italic">horrible</hi> despotism by which they are oppressed—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford suggested that these might
							give offence to the Sublime Porte— I thought it doubtful whether they
							would ever see the Messages but he said that there were those who would
							take care to make them see it. Some passages of high panegyric upon
							ourselves were questioned: and there were two references to the opinion
							of the President sent to the House at their last Session upon the
							Constitutional power of Congress to make internal improvements, one of
							which I thought would be sufficient— About three hours were occupied
							with these deliberations, and the President will modify the Message, as
							he shall think proper, on consideration of all the remarks that were
							made— With the family I spent the Evening at <persRef
								ref="decatur-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Decatur’s</persRef>. The Calhouns were there— <persRef

								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R.

								Chambers</persRef> who comes as a Candidate for the Office of Clerk
							to the House of Representatives called to see me— Note from the
							President, calling a Cabinet Meeting at half past one— The object was to
							consult upon the expediency of sending the Missions to South-America,
							for which Appropriations were made at the last Session of Congress.
							There was much discussion upon this point, in the course of which
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> came out in character, with his
							opinion that the Missions ought to be sent; but that there was <hi
								rend="italic">less</hi> reason for sending them now than there had
							been when the appropriations were made last Spring. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, gave no decisive opinions— Mine has invariably
							been that we ought to send none, but in return for Ministers sent by
							them here— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford said he had
							understood it was determined last Spring to send none except in that
							manner— The President said he had not so determined but the appointments
							had been postponed on various considerations— I observed that those
							Countries were yet all in a convulsive and revolutionary State— Since
							the <pb type="ms" n="428"/>last Session of Congress, <persRef
								ref="iturbide-augustin">Yturbide</persRef>, had by the forms of
							Election by a Congress, but in fact by military usurpation made himself
							Emperor of Mexico; but, without any of the necessary means for carrying
							on his government. From the Accounts we have it is highly probable that
							his Government will be overthrown within a year—In the Republic of
							Colombia, and in Peru the Spanish party had rather gained ground this
							year— There had even been a prospect of their reoccupying Lima, while on
							the other hand the Patriot <persRef ref="sanmartin-jose">General San
								Martin</persRef>, appeared much disposed to re-act in Peru the part
							of Yturbide in Mexico— In Chili there had been a Revolution in
							Government, and a Congress called to establish a Constitution— We had
							two very different views of these transactions presented; one favourable
							by <persRef ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Prevost</persRef>— The other much otherwise by <persRef
								ref="robinson-jeremy">Jeremy Robinson</persRef>; while commodore
								<persRef ref="stewart-charles">Stewart</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hogan-michael">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hogan</persRef>
							wrote with the utmost disgust and abhorrence of all the leaders and
							ruling men in that Country— There had been recently a conspiracy against
							the present Government of Buenos-Ayres, and <persRef ref="forbes-john"
								>Forbes</persRef> himself who has always favoured it as the purest
							and most liberal that had ever been established there, now almost
							despairs of its being able to defend itself. From Mexico we have been
							informed of the appointment of two successive Ministers Plenipotentiary
							with assurances that they were coming immediately, but there is no
							appearance of either of them yet. Since <persRef ref="todd-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef> has arrived in
							Colombia, the <persRef ref="soublette-carlos">Vice-President
								Soublette</persRef> has informed him that probably they would there
							prefer to continue the diplomatic intercourse with the Country by
							Chargés d’Affaires; and the Newspapers mention that there is a <persRef
								ref="barrientos-alejandro">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barrientos</persRef> who has been at the Havana, and is coming here.
							The only view for the appointment of Ministers Plenipotentiary to any of
							these States is, to establish with them Commercial Treaties; and if they
							are to be appointed with that view it would be necessary to settle some
							principles upon which such Treaties are to be formed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford said they all favoured the
							British Commerce more than ours— I said there was a distinction made in
							Colombia; of which I had spoken to <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres</persRef> before his death, who
							assured me he would write immediately to his Government concerning it.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd is likewise instructed to
							remonstrate against it. Torres told me he had no doubt it would be
							immediately removed, but he died so soon afterwards, and was then so
							ill, that I do not know whether he did write concerning it, or not.
							Crawford insisted that there were also discriminations to our
							disadvantage, at Buenos-Ayres, but I think he was mistaken— Crawford
							finally said he thought the Missions ought all to be sent except that to
							Peru, which should be postponed for the present. He then launched out on
							the subject of Cuba, and said that the late French Minister <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de Neuville</persRef>, before he
							went away last June had made a communication to him entirely
							confidential, and which must therefore now be received as confidential.
							Which was that the French Government knew for a certainty that the
							British Government had been for two years negotiating with Spain for the
							Island of Cuba— And had offered them for it, Gibraltar, and a large sum
							of money. That there was a British Agent living at the Havana, in great
							splendor, and with profuse expenses; and he closed all by remarking what
							a great misfortune it would be if Great-Britain should get possession of
							the Island of Cuba— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun remarked that
							this Story about a magnificent British Agent at the Havana, had been
							enquired into by several Commanders of our vessels who had been there,
							and they had found there was nothing in it— The President mentioned the
							late correspondence with <persRef ref="duponceau-peter"
								>Duponceau</persRef>, and asked if <persRef ref="mason-john">General
								Mason</persRef> had left the papers with me. He had not. The
							President asked me to write to Mason and ask for them— He repeated also,
							that he thought we ought to have an intelligent Agent at the Havana— As
							Crawford has views upon this subject, which the President does not
							appear to perceive, I said nothing about it, till after the Meeting had
							broken up, and then asked what Salary he would allow to the Agent
							proposed to reside at the Havana. He said not less than 3000 dollars a
							year— I said we could not <pb type="ms" n="429"/>have an avowed
							political agent there; as not even a Consul is admitted, and if it were
							even known that we had a person there as a political agent there, he
							would be immediately ordered out of the Island— The President said it
							must be altogether secret. I asked him if he had in his eye any person
							who would at once be a trusty Agent, and yet would keep the secret of
							his being such. Calhoun who has a Candidate always ready for every thing
							immediately named <persRef ref="mcrae-unknown">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> M’Rae</persRef>, who he said was secret as the grave,
							and would by temper prefer concealing such an appointment to disclosing
							it— I observed that the secrecy of such an appointment would not depend
							on the agent alone— A military man, going from the United States to
							reside at the Havana, must have some ostensible motive for being there—
							Calhoun asked if he could not connect himself with some commercial
							establishment; the President named <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E
								Wyer</persRef>; but it was now apparent that the appointment of a
							political agent to reside in the island of Cuba, is a measure requiring
							more combinations than we were prepared for— After the Meeting was over;
							Calhoun spoke to me about the South-American Missions again. He said he
							had no opinion of the measure, and thought if any appointment should be
							made, it should be with a view to commercial negotiations only; and that
							the Ministers appointed should be rigorously bound by Instructions to
							take no part in the internal struggles of parties at the places to which
							they will be sent. He said he supposed I had seen the course that
							Crawford intended to take on this subject. I said I had; but I did not
							think he would make much of it— I dined at <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning’s</persRef>, with a company of about twenty; among whom all
							the heads of Departments.</p>

						<p><date>29. VII.</date><persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi

								Buildings Elgar</persRef>, announcing to him that from the end of
							the present year, a general reduction of Salaries, to the persons
							employed in the public Buildings would take place; and that his,
							Bulfinch’s Salary as Architect would in future, be 2000 dollars a year.
							Bulfinch brought also my Letter to him, written by direction of the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> in December 1817.
							offering him the place, with a Salary of 2500 dollars a year; and a copy
							of his answer accepting the offer, though remarking that the Salary was
							less than he had been led to believe. Bulfinch said that he considered
							his Salary as a matter of contract, and that it was of great importance
							to him; his family being large, and <persRef

								type="multi">his Sons</persRef> not having succeeded so well in

							notwithstanding a desperate struggle against him by the partizans of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> to whom he is specially obnoxious— At

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John W. Taylor</persRef>, member
							of Congress from the Saratoga district, State of New-York, called on me
							this morning, and had a long conversation with me— He has been
							re-elected to the next Congress in opposition to what they call in that
							State a regular nomination— In the National Advocate, it has been stated
							that he would be a Candidate for the Office of the Clerk of the House of
							Representatives: he assured me that he had not at the time had a thought
							of it, but asked my advice whether he should offer himself as a
							Candidate or not— He said he inclined himself against it— He thought it
							would be a descent from his present Station; but several members had
							asked him if he would be a candidate; and had promised him their votes
							and support if he should be— Even several of his colleagues who had last
							year opposed his election as Speaker— I told him I thought it was the
							least they could do for him by way of reparation for what they had done—
							I thought with him that the situation of Clerk of the House, though very
							respectable would carry less Consideration than that of a member,
							especially of his long standing; but it was more profitable and more
							permanent. With regard to his personal views, I thought he could take
							counsel only from himself— If he concluded to be a candidate he would
							have my best wishes, and any services that it might be in my power to
							bestow— Upon public considerations, I should prefer to have him remain a
							member of the House, believing that he would be more useful there, and
							that his sphere of action would be much larger than in the Clerk’s
							Office. He entered very fully into particulars with regard to his own
							situation, prospects and purposes— Said <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was coming to the next
							Congress, with the intention of making the Speaker’s chair, a step for
							his own promotion to the Presidency— As on the very probable
							contingency, that the election would fall to the House of
							Representatives, his influence in the House, and the Esprit de Corps in
							favour of their own Speaker would operate strongly upon the members in
							his favour— But he said he had lately seen <persRef ref="shaw-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw</persRef>, formerly a
							member of Congress from Berkshire Massachusetts, and a very particular
							friend of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay with whom he is in
							correspondence, who told him that he believed there had been some
							understanding between M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clay and me, or
							between our friends, who would move in concert— He said he did not wish
							to draw from me any thing that I might not wish to disclose, but his own
							views at present might in some sort be influenced by the knowledge of
							the facts— I told him that I had no motive for concealment or hesitation
							with him— There was no understanding or concert between M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and me, on this subject; and never
							had been— When M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay left Congress two
							years ago we parted upon friendly terms, and although M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s political course as a member of the
							House had not been remarkably friendly to me, I had never been
							unfriendly to him— As to the next Presidential election I had no concert
							or understanding with anyone. He said he had been for some time
							convinced that there would be but one candidate from the North; for
							although the <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice-President</persRef> was
							coming to take the Chair of the Senate; and proclaimed his health
							restored he would not be restored as a Candidate— Now on the score of
							qualifications and services, if the South in the present case, could not
							be induced to vote for the Northern Candidate, he considered that their
							acquiescence in the choice of such a Candidate would be postponed
							indefinitely— There was no reason to believe it would <hi rend="italic"
								>ever</hi> be obtained: because there was no reason for expecting
							that the claims of the North, would ever stand upon more unequivocal
							ground— But at the last Session of Congress there were numbers of the
							Northern men, and particularly <persRef ref="holmes-john"
								>Holmes</persRef> of Maine, who professed a very high opinion of the
							Northern Candidate, but always insisting that there was no chance in his
							favour— No possibility of his being elected— He had heard during the
							recess of Congress frequent Conversations to the same effect; and had
							constantly maintained the opposite opinion. I observed that he had never
							before spoken to me in a manner so explicit on this subject— That I had
							not known what his opinions concerning it were, but that informations
							had been given to me, that they were favourable to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford; which I had not credited— He
							said that his own wishes were in favour of a Northern Candidate— Should
							it ultimately appear <pb type="ms" n="431"/>that the chance of election
							in his favour is desperate, he should perhaps incline to favour that of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— He had been two years ago
							in favour of the reduction of the army; as he understood M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford to have been— He knew not what my
							opinion had been, but had heard it was opposed to the reduction. But
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had been unjust and he would
							say ungrateful to him in that transaction: for it was through his means,
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s plan for the reduction had
							finally been adopted in preference to that of the Committee of the
							House— I said that as to the reduction of the army, I had taken no part
							whatever in relation to it— I had inclined against it; because the Head
							of the Department immediately concerned in it had disapproved it— And as
							a member of the Administration, I had been governed by two general
							principles— One to support to the best of my power the Administration
							and the other not to intermeddle with the Departments, at the head of
							which other persons were placed— I believed M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun was now sensible he had been misadvised in
							preventing the election of Taylor as Speaker, but it was the prejudice
							raised by the Missouri Slave question that had been the cause of it.
							Taylor repeated to me the circumstances of his having been promised as
							he understood it the Office of Judge of the Northern District of
							New-York, and its having been given to <persRef ref="skinner-roger"
								>Skinner</persRef>; a subject upon which he is sore.</p>
