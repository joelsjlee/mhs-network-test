							Philadelphia; and thought him rather improving in his health— I attended
							the Theatre this Evening, and saw Richard the Third, with the
							Rendez-vous, or Hide and Seek; the second time, this Season— The part of
							Richard was performed by <persRef ref="booth-junius">Booth</persRef>,
							who belonged to the strolling company of English Players whom I saw at
							Ghent; and who afterwards just before I left England, broke out, as a
							first rate actor and rival of <persRef ref="kean-edmund">Kean</persRef>—
							He was then a mere copy of Kean, but is not so now— His performance of
							Richard was tame and flat. Seemingly with little effort to please, and
							little regard for the Audience. The house was well-filled. The most
							interesting Scenes of the Play; the murder of king Henry—The courtship
							of Lady Anne, and the tent Scene, were all balked, dismally. The Play
							itself is very absurd, and interesting principally by the character of
							Richard— There are few English actors capable of understanding <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespeare</persRef>, and Booth is not
							one of them. <persRef ref="warren-unknown2">Warren’s</persRef> king
							Henry was well performed, but he is too fat for the part— The farce was

							which both from its Style and Contents I take to have been written by

							bitter upon <pb type="ms" n="350"/>“the Secretary,” and apologizes for
							Clay’s having agreed to the Mississippi proposition, upon the plea of
							the new Instructions— It abandons all <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell’s</persRef> pretences, and says that Clay thought the
							Government ought not to have given the Instructions— Clay’s conduct
							throughout this affair towards me, has been that of an envious rival—a
							fellow-servant whispering tales into the ear of the common master. He
							has been seven years circulating this poison against me, in the West,
							and I have now no doubt that Russell’s Letter was brought forth upon
							suggestions originating with him— Russell has all along performed for
							him the part of a Jackall— Clay seems to have fancied that I should have
							no means of self-vindication if Russell’s Letter should be brought
							before Congress, and this Article in the Argus evidently betrays his
							vexation and disappointment at the result— Evening at the Play— <persRef

							from 1. Timothy 4.7. [“]But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and
							exercise thyself rather unto godliness.” This was a moral essay against

							visit from <persRef ref="law-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Law</persRef>. The latter part of the day was Showery, and the
							attendance at Meeting for the Evening so thin, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little dismissed the congregation, with a
							short prayer; omitting the Sermon, and the other parts of the Service—
							There is in the Richmond Enquirer of the 2. inst<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> which came this day, a jesuitical and most insidious
							Article upon the Diplomatic controversy. It begins by copying from the
							Charleston S.C. Courier an Article upon it very severe upon <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Russell</persRef>, with which it expresses
							concurrence in part, but cavils at some comment in it upon <persRef
								ref="floyd-john">Floyd</persRef>, and instigates Floyd to come out
							against it— Then it pronounces Russell decidedly in fault in the
							“quarrel about the duplicate”—and with the same dogmatism pronounces
							that the proposition made to the British at Ghent seems to defy all
							justification— Extracts all the part of the sham Editorial Article in
							the Frankfort Argus, which charges “the Secretary” and calls upon me to
							answer it—but omits all that part of the same Article which contains
							Clay’s admissions of his having assented and subscribed to the
							proposition— The main object of the Richmond Enquirers instigators in
							this affair is to blow the Coals— They want to bring in Floyd and
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, to fall upon me; and help
							out Russell; for considering him as already disgraced before the Nation
							they wish to uphold him just enough to assist him in his notable attempt
							to disgrace me— At the first explosion of this affair, they could not
							suppress their exultation at the prospect of two distinguished
							Massachusetts Men afoul of each other, and sure, both to lose character
							by the result. But the burst of public Sentiment, was so quick and so
							strong against Russell, on the publication of his Duplicate Letters and
							my Remarks, that in a few days the Richmond Enquirer gave out that I had
							seized with great ability, upon this occasion to make myself a Party for
							the next Presidential Election, for which it declared I was before,
							quite out of the question. The Richmond Enquirer is the organ of a great
							and predominating political party in Virginia. It is the Main Spring for
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"

							under an affectation of impartiality and liberality has been and <pb
								type="ms" n="351"/>will be managed with the most inveterate

							full of <unclear>absur</unclear>dity— Lear begins with too much folly as
							well as injustice to be an interesting character— The changes from the

								Elliot</persRef> of the Patent Office, and a <persRef
								ref="peake-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peake</persRef>
							were at the Office. I made a draught of a Proclamation opening the Ports
							of the United States to British Vessels from their Colonies; and took it
							to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>. I found several
							difficulties in making the draught. The Act of Congress of 6 May last,
							authorizes the President by Proclamation to open the Ports of the United
							States, on certain contingencies to British Vessels employed in the
							trade and intercourse between the United States and the British Colonies
							or Islands in the West-Indies, under such reciprocal rules and
							restrictions as he may prescribe, anything in the two Navigation Acts to
							the contrary notwithstanding— The British Act of Parliament of 24 June,
							opens certain Ports by name <pb type="ms" n="355"/>in the West Indies,
							in North and South-America, and in Newfoundland; under certain
							restrictions of duties, and authorizing only the importation directly of
							articles the growth produce or manufacture of the United States. As the
							Act of Congress speaks only of the British Islands or Colonies in the
								<hi rend="italic">West-Indies</hi>, the first question was whether
							the Proclamation can open our Ports to British Vessels from
							Newfoundland, North and South America, under the general denomination of
							the West-Indies— If it cannot, it cannot meet the Act of Parliament, and
							will be of no effect— I therefore made the draught opening our Ports to
							vessels, from all the Ports opened to our vessels by the Act of
							Parliament, construing the term West-Indies as used in the Act of
							Congress in its most extensive and general sense— The next question was
							as to the <hi rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> rules and restrictions; it
							occurred to me that under that provision the Proclamation might exact
							countervailing duties; but as that might be thought to encroach upon the
							revenue-raising power, I thought it would be best to leave it to
							Congress— To countervail the restriction of direct trade, I limited the
							importations from each Colony in British Vessels to the productions of
							that Colony— I left the draught with the President for his
							Consideration— Evening at the Play. Hamlet; and the Mayor of Garratt,
							for <persRef ref="booth-junius">Booth’s</persRef> benefit, and the last
							Night of his performance— He played <persRef ref="hamlet"
								>Hamlet</persRef> and <persRef ref="jerrysneak">Jerry
								Sneak</persRef>—both indifferently— He is utterly incompetent to the
							conception of the character of Hamlet, the most exquisitely drawn
							tragical character in the whole compass of the drama. A mind deeply
							meditative, with ardent sensibility, and a pure and lofty sense of
							rectitude, wrought up by the murder of his father by the incest of his
							Mother, by the Summons of his fathers Spirit from the sufferings of
							purgatory, by the usurpation of his own rights to the succession and by
							the pangs of disappointed love, to a partial melancholy alienation of
							mind; complicated by a purposely simulated madness— This is I think the
							real character of Hamlet, and explains all its seeming inconsistencies.
							Booth’s Jerry Sneak, was disgusting by its indecency, and not even
							comical. He sung a filthy song, poorly. The Play itself is not fit to be
							seen.</p>

							His daughter <persRef ref="monroe-maria">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							Indies, in the Act of Congress upon which it is founded, and upon the
							reciprocal restrictions to be imposed upon the British Vessels; and had
							not yet received M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kings’ answer— The
							President approved this but thought if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							King’s answer should be long delayed it would be necessary to issue the
							proclamation, without waiting for it— Letter from <persRef

								Deabbate</persRef> the Sardinian Consul to enquire whether I had
							received a Letter from him written a month since or more. He has written

							American vessels are treated in the Ports of Sardinia, more favourably,
							with regards to duties and charges than in the Ports of the United
							States themselves; and demanding that Sardinian vessels should pay no
							more in the Ports of the United States, than American vessels in the
							Ports of Sardinia— That is, not so much as our own vessels. And he has
							supported this demand by fallacious tables of comparative charges— I
							answered his first Letters, and pointed out the inaccuracy of his
							tables; besides which I informed him that our Consul at Genoa <persRef
								ref="schee-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schee</persRef>
							had represented that discriminating duties were levied in the Sardinian
							Ports upon our vessels, higher not only than those upon Sardinian
							vessels, but than those upon British vessels— This Deabbate denies, but
							as Schee has left Genoa, and deserted his Consulate I have not now the
							means of ascertaining the facts through him— I have therefore postponed
							answering Deabbate’s Letters for the present but told his agent that I
							had received them— I received this day a second Letter from the French
							Louisianan Lunatic, <persRef ref="leduc-unknown">Le Duc,</persRef> who
							sent me small transparent pebbles, which he says he procured in
							Nova-Scotia, from an old Indian, who took him to a remote and
							uninhabited region, to what he called diamond mountains, where after
							swimming across a river, he brought him back these stones which many
							persons believe to be diamonds, because they cut glass; but he thinks
							them only fine crystal— After a magnificent panagyric upon Nova-Scotia,
							which he insists belongs to him, and an argument upon its importance to
							the United States, he informs me that he can furnish me the means of
							acquiring it without the expense of a Sous, and asks of me an interview
							to explain himself. I did not answer his Letter. I wrote to <persRef

								Adams</persRef>, and after a long delay answered two Letters from
								<persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. N.

							slightly indisposed. I nevertheless took a solitary walk by Moonlight,
							and made a short Evening— The Washington City Gazette has this day come
							out for the first time with the Treasury Stamp unequivocal upon its
							face— It has long been at market, apparently between <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> and me— Really sold to him, years ago, but
							wishing also to make its price with me. <persRef ref="wyer-edward"
								>Wyer</persRef> told me not long since that <persRef
								ref="elliot-jonathan">Elliot</persRef> the Editor had asked him if I
							was <hi rend="italic">his</hi> friend; complained that I had given him
							no jobs of printing lately to do— Said that my objection <pb type="ms"
								n="361"/>to his Account for printing papers relating to the Census,
							had been only a misunderstanding—hinted that he could not afford to be
							my friend, for nothing— Boasted that he had entirely put down M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s pretensions to the Presidency;
							and considered himself as thereby serving me: with a distinct intimation
							that could serve me as he had served M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun. I told Wyer, that I had been obliged to cut down Elliot’s
							account for the census papers, for its extortions and then told him that
							I should give him no more work, at the public charge. That he had not
							put down M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Calhoun; and if he had, it was
							not for the purpose of serving me—And that I should not purchase the
							services of any printer, either with public money or my own— This was
							but a few days since, and this day the Gazette shews its flag. It
							enumerates also the other Newspapers, which it considers as pledged to
							the same cause, which is obviously to give them a signal of mutual
							intelligence— The organization of newspaper support for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford throughout the Union is very
							extensive, and is managed with much address, Democracy, Economy, and
							Reform, are the watchwords, for his recruiting service— Democracy to be
							used against me— Economy against Calhoun; and Reform against both—
							Calhoun is organizing a counter-system of Newspaper-Artillery; and his
							Washington Republican, is already working powerfully in his favour—
							These Engines will counteract each other; but I shall be a mark for both
							sides, and having no counterfire upon them, what can happen but that I
							must fall? This fall may be the happiest event that could befall me, and
							I but fervently ask that my mind may be disciplined to what ever may
							betide me; and supported to the level of higher aims than any political
							fortune can reach—</p>

							was of the same Mass with two or three of Crawford’s managing partizans—
							He says that Crawford is a very singular instance of a man of such
							character rising to the eminence he now occupies— That there has not
							been in the history of the Union of another man, with abilities so

							contrived to make himself a Candidate for the Presidency. He thinks it

							Letters to the <persRef ref="ritchie-thomas">Editor of that

							the main honest intentions, but with an intellect somewhat offuscated,
							violent passions, suspecting dishonesty and corruption, in all but
							himself; rashly charging it upon others; eager for distinction, and
							forming gigantic projects upon crude and half-digested information. He
							has a plan for establishing a territorial Government at the Mouth of
							Columbia river; and being leagued with <persRef key="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef> of
							Missouri, made his Bill for that purpose the pretext for moving the
							Calls for the Ghent papers and then for Russell’s Letter— Clay who is at
							the bottom of it all, has from the day after the signature of the Treaty
							of Ghent, been working like a Mole, to undermine me in the West, by
							representing me as an enemy to the Western interests, and by
							misrepresenting the transactions at Ghent, in a way to suit that
							purpose— Russell’s Letter of 11. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1815
							was concerted with Clay, who must have supposed that I should be
							precluded by my situation from making any defence and that the poison
							would operate, without the counteraction of any antidote. The
							mismanagement of Russell, blew up their whole plot, and Floyd’s part in
							it being partly detected he himself has been handled as he deserved in
							many of the newspaper Commentaries upon the whole transaction. The
							Richmond Enquirer intent upon bringing out all possible opposition to
							me, and <pb type="ms" n="363"/>knowing the coarseness and insolence of
							Floyd’s hostility, put forth a provocative to Floyd to come out, and he
							has come out accordingly; at once crafty and ferocious; pretending
							self-defence, as if I had injured him—falsely charging me with having
							asserted that <hi rend="italic">he </hi>had made himself subservient to
							Russell’s purposes, and then imputing direct falsehood to that
							assertion— Pretending to take no part in the dispute between Russell and
							me, that he may discharge his venom upon me with more affect under the
							colour of neutrality— The Washington Gazette in its allegiance to the
							Treasury now copies every Article against me, from all quarters of the
							Union, usually with the addition of a thrust at me of its own, by way of
							Commentary— It republied this afternoon Floyd’s Letter with such a
							comment; turning it against me, and using it as a lift for Russell.</p>

						<p><date>30. VI:</date><persRef ref="floyd-john">Floyd’s</persRef> Letter
							was published this morning in the National Intelligencer. I wrote a very
							short answer to it, for publication in the same paper to-morrow Morning—
							Among the absurdities with which Floyd’s Letter abounds is his attacking
							me in the Newspapers with a charge that I am seeking Newspaper
							Controversy— I have confined my answers to a direct denial of having
							made the assertion which he imputes to me, and declares false, and have
							fixed the falsehood unanswerably upon himself— The City Gazette of this
							afternoon has another insulting paragraph, of high panegyrick upon
							Floyd’s character, purity of motives and veracity, and asserting that
							his Letter puts the dispute between <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell</persRef> and me upon an entire new footing— This is
							followed by a paragraph hoping that I have not employed <persRef
								ref="hunt-seth">Seth Hunt</persRef> (as my enemies insinuate) to
							plot the destruction of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Russell’s
							character, for a reward in case of success. This alludes to a charge
							published in the New York Statesman under the signature of Ariel,
							charging Russell with having speculated for pecuniary profit upon
							information which he gave to commercial houses at the Negotiation of
							Ghent— Russell having called upon the publishers for the name of the
							author of Ariel, Hunt wrote to him and avowed himself as the author,
							upon which Russell prosecuted him both by action and by Indictment, and
							prosecuted also the publishers of the Statesman— Of all these
							transactions I have no knowledge but by the newspapers.— There are other
							paragraphs in this days Gazette equally insidious and base, interspersed
							with encomiums and defences of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef>, written as I have reason to suppose by a man
							named <persRef ref="richards-g">Richards</persRef> of spotted character,
							whom Crawford knowing him as such has this Summer taken as a Clerk into
							the Treasury Department— I note these things as they pass to indicate
							for memory hereafter, the situation in which I am placed, the means used
							to ruin my character, the agents by whom the machinery is wielded, and
							the persons for whom the dirty work is performed— The thing itself is
							not new— From the nature of our Institutions the competitors for public
							favour, and their respective partizans seek success by Slander upon each
							other as you add to the weight of one Scale, by taking from that of the
							other. I disdain this ignoble mode of warfare, and neither wage it
							myself nor countenance it in my friends. But from present appearances it
							will decide the succession to the Presidency— I was idle at the Office,
							and received a Letter from <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, intimating an apprehension that it might be
							necessary to take over again my deposition in the case of <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">Harris</persRef> vs <persRef ref="lewis-william"

							Success was infallible, upon which he would not only repay all the

							the views of the Government to make advances of money upon a claim in

							indicates insanity— His language is correct both in writing and
