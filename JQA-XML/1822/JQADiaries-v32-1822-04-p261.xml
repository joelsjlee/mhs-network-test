						<p><date>1. VI:</date> I make one more effort to resume my diary which has
							now suffered repeated and irreparable interruptions— I abandon
							definitively the attempt to keep it, minute and circumstantial— I called
							this morning again upon <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller,
							about my accounts. I shewed him that the Statement of the balance had
							not been three years unsettled, and presented him my revised statement
							agreeing with that of the Treasury with the single exception of the half
							outfit on the mediation Mission— Anderson proposed to allow me the
							credit if the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would
							revoke the requisition he had made to me to repay the money. I spoke of
							it to the President, who proposed to refer it to the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef>, to which I consented—
								<persRef ref="boardman-elijah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boardman</persRef> S.U.S. and <persRef ref="tomlinson-gideon"
								>Tomlinson</persRef> of H.R. from Connecticut came to the Office,

							hung next Thursday for the murder of <persRef ref="kelly-unknown"
								>Kelly</persRef>. many extenuating circumstances— <persRef
								ref="hook-j">Captain Hook</persRef> sent for, and speaks much in his
							favour. <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">T. Ringgold</persRef> the Marshal
							brought a petition in his favour—discussion between <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> who denies and
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef> who asserts the
							right of P.U.S. to grant a conditional pardon— Crawford strongly
							inclines to the Execution— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							and Thompson waver— I gave no opinion— The President finally desired me
							to write to the judges <persRef ref="cranch-william">Cranch</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="thruston-buckner">Thruston</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="morsell-james">Morsell</persRef>, requesting them, and also the
							district Attorney, <persRef ref="swann-thomas">Swann</persRef> to come
							to his house at one, to-morrow— I sent them notes accordingly. Sent my
							reply to <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef>, and received
							a stinger from <persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph">Amado</persRef>—
							Evening party at <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen"

							came with a similar application— <persRef ref="stratford-canning">M<hi

							to palliate his own gross and unpardonable carelessness in sending the

						<p><date>12. VI:</date> My eldest Son, <persRef ref="adams-george">George

							The President had concluded to send his Message concerning the execution
							of the Law of the last Session for reducing the army, only to the
							Senate. He had modified it accordingly and read the alterations he had
							made— It was agreed that this message would be proper if the President
							had determined to nominate again <persRef ref="towson-nathan">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Towson</persRef> and <persRef

								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> expressed doubts of the expediency of
							the measure, as tending to excite irritation in the Senate— And thought
							it probable they would reject the nominations again— I had intimated to
							the President similar impressions after the last Cabinet Meeting, but he
							had made up his mind to send the Message— He told me that the opposition
							in the Senate was headed by <persRef ref="williams-john">John
								Williams</persRef>, a Senator from Tennessee, brother of <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> a member of the House
							from North-Carolina, and that he P.U.S. knew its motive— He did not
							further explain himself; but the motive which he conjectured was that of
							censuring and embarrassing the Administration of the War Department,
							with a view to promote M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawfords election
							to the Presidency. Both the brothers Williams are devoted partizans of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford; the Senator from Tennessee
							a very active one of long standing— Crawford has heretofore, been
							somewhat cautious in the management of his opposition; but in these
							affairs he has been decisive and explicit— At the same time repeating
							with iteration more anxious than prudent, that he had had no
							communication with any members of the Senate on the subject, and did not
							know on what grounds they had rejected the nominations of Towson and
							Gadsden— Crawford makes it a Constitutional question whether Congress
							can limit the selection of persons to whom the President’s right of
							nomination shall be confined, for appointment to Office— For instance
							whether a Law, could confine the nomination of a Judge, or Attorney
							General, to persons learned in the Law— Commissioners of the Navy, to
							Captains in the naval service, and the like— The President entertains
							the same opinion, and has expressed it in the Message. <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, the Secretary of the Navy maintained the
							contrary to which I also inclined— After I returned to the Office,
								<persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef> the
							Swedish Chargé d’Affaires came to renew the application that <pb
								type="ms" n="266"/>that the President would propose to Congress the
							adoption of a total repeal of discriminating duties upon importations in
							Norwegian vessels, by way of reciprocity, for a like-regulation by the
							Government of Norway in favour of American vessels— I had informed him
							that this could only be done by Congress, and he had construed the
							expressions of civility which I had used in declining his demand of this
							reciprocation of a privilege, as a promise that the President would
							recommend it to Congress. I never intended to make such a promise, but
							after some conversation with him, I told him I would propose to the
							President to send a Message with copies of the correspondence, stating
							the demand of reciprocity, and recommending the subject to the
							consideration of Congress— But that it was not probable Congress would
							agree to it, because it would affect unfavourably our trade with other
							Countries— And I repeated what I had distinctly said to him before—that
							as the Norwegian regulation had been voluntary it might be revoked
							whenever they should think proper— I dined with <persRef

								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Josiah Quincy</persRef> is his

							Venezuela; but never got nearer his destination than the Island of
							Margarita— More than a year since he came home on a plea of health
							without leave, and has been drawing Salary, at the rate of 4500 dollars
							a year, nearly the whole time— He now comes for Instructions and to
							solicit the appointment of Minister— I told him I would take the
							directions of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— At
							the Office I met <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"

							He also said the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French
								Minister</persRef> had applied to him about the commercial
							negotiation and wanted a definitive answer, or ultimatum— I told him the
							President had now a reply to De Neuville’s last note, under

								ref="wilcocks-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilcocks</persRef> came again; very impatient for a Commission as
							Consul general in Mexico, and applying for Passports for three Steam
							Engineers— He had a contract for supplying Steam Engines for draining
							the Mines; and is afraid of losing it, unless he hurries back as soon as
							possible— He expects this Country will make large profit by this supply
							of Steam Engines to Mexico— He says that scarcely any part of the Mines
							has been worked for several years—being filled with water. <persRef

							that I had read them and was satisfied— And he was willing I should
							write to their father <persRef ref="edwards-pierpont">P.

							satisfactorily refuted. But he wished me to send the Letter to him H.
							S.—observing that his father had got to be an old man, and was more
							troubled with these things now than he would have been some years ago—
							And as he now knew nothing of these charges, he H. S. would keep the
							Letter, only to transmit to him in case he should hereafter be informed
							of them— I called at the President’s, but he was gone out— In the

						<p><date>19. V:45.</date><persRef ref="todd-charles">Col<hi

							again this morning, about his mission to the Republic of Columbia, and I
							desired him to call to-morrow when I expected to be able to give him a
							definitive answer. Cabinet Meeting of four hours from 1. to 5. at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, where the various
							questions which have already arisen from the recognition of the new
							Southern Governments were discussed; the first was whether Ministers of
							Plenipotentiary rank, should be immediately sent to them all—or whether
							we should wait first to receive Ministers from them, and return
							Ministers of the same rank as they may send here. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> was for sending immediately four Ministers,
							without standing upon any point of etiquette;—I thought the best course
							would be to wait and reciprocate— To receive <persRef
								ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres</persRef>,
							as Chargé d’Affaires from the Republic of Colombia. To receive the
							Minister from Mexico, when he shall arrive, and immediately send one of
							the same rank in return— To ascertain from the Governments of Colombia,
							Buenos-Ayres, and Chile upon what footing they wish the political
							relations with us to be placed, and to send Ministers Plenipotentiary,
							wherever they send Ministers of that rank to us. <persRef
								ref="deforest-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Forrest’s</persRef> claim of precedency for Buenos-Ayres was
							considered: it was agreed that it could not be admitted; and determined
							that he could not be received as Consul till he shall obtain a new
							Commission; nor, being a Citizen of the United States, at all, as a
							diplomatic character— It was incidentally discussed whether in any case,
							the President ought to receive a Citizen of the United States as a
							Minister from a foreign power; and there was some diversity of opinion
							between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> upon the doctrine of expatriation. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford inclined also to the immediate
							appointment of <persRef ref="wilcocks-james">Wilcocks</persRef> as
							Consul, but the other members of the Administration and the President,
							preferred to delay the appointment till the arrival of the Minister— The
							question upon the authority of the President to appoint during the
							recess to these new Offices was incidentally touched; but the Offices
							being not created either by the Constitution, or by Act of Congress, but
							being Offices under the Law of Nations, they were not considered as
							affected by the Constitutional provision concerning appointments during
							the recess. Crawford mentioned that this question had once been debated
							in the Senate; and <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">Bradley</persRef>
							after at first insisting that the case did come within the restriction
							of the Constitution, had afterwards come to the opposite conclusion, by
							considering the offices by a legal or diplomatic fiction as always
							filled, and that when the President made the appointment he was supposed
							to have previously removed an imaginary incumbent and thereby made a
							vacancy. Another question was much discussed— I have received official
							notice, first through <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, and lately from the
							Spanish Minister <persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin">Anduaga</persRef>, of
							the Appointment of a Commissioner, Surveyor, Astronomer, &amp;c. on the
							part of Spain, to run the boundary line, according to a stipulation in
							the late Treaty— The House of Representatives struck out of the
							appropriation Bill, the sum which had been estimated for the expence of
							this Commission during the present year; on the ground of the proposed
							recognition of Mexico— The appropriation was said however to have been
							restored by the Senate— If the house should agree to the amendment and
							the appropriation should pass, the question was whether the Commissioner
							should be appointed and the line run— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> thought it could not
							be done—that it would be inconsistent with the recognition of Mexico—
							That it would give offence, and rouse the indignation of the new Empire;
							and that if the line <pb type="ms" n="270"/>is to be run at all, it must
							be with Mexican instead of Spanish Commissioners— The President and all
							the other members of the Cabinet however thought otherwise— That as it
							was the mere mechanical execution of a compact already consummate we are
							still bound to the Execution of the Treaty, notwithstanding the
							subsequent recognition of Mexico, which is a recognition of
							independence, but not of boundary— That we should proceed, to the
							fulfilment of the stipulation, unless objection should be made on the
							part of Mexico—in which case the Commissioners must of course cease. By
							the Article, the Commissioners were to meet within one year, from the
							exchange of the Ratifications, at Natchez, which by the delay of Spain
							to appoint her Commissioner became impossible. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun thought this released us from the obligation of this
							engagement; especially considering the subsequent <unclear>. .
								.</unclear>ts in Mexico. I thought it would have the appearance of
							subterfuge to alledge this ground for non performance— The conclusion
							was to wait and see how the House will dispose of the Senate’s amendment
							in the appropriation Bill. My draft of a reply to the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister’s</persRef> Note was not
							considered— I gave the President a Letter from <persRef
								ref="sawyer-lemuel">L. Sawyer</persRef>, a member of the House from
							North-Carolina, enclosed in a Note to me, and requesting him not to send
							the Commission of judge in Florida to <persRef ref="branch-john">John
								Branch</persRef>, as he was not qualified for the Office, not having
							been bred to the Law, or at least having never practised— Sawyer said
							that the whole North-Carolina delegation in the house were to have a
							meeting this day to <hi rend="italic">remonstrate</hi> against the
							appointment of Branch as a judge— But their real reason is not his
							disqualification as a judge— It is to shew their resentment that he was
							not appointed Governor. Branch was the Crawford man; and his appointment
							has for sometime expected as the test of Crawford’s ascendancy over the
							President’s nominations. Its failure has produced a concentration of
							rage— The President said they had all written Letters to him about it—
							He had answered <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">Macon’s</persRef>— He
							considered himself personally insulted by them, and if he was not in the
							situation in which he is, he would call them to account for it— On
							returning to the Office, I found a Note from <persRef
								ref="duval-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duval</persRef>
							asking to have his Commission made out this day—but all the Clerks were
							gone from the Office and it was impossible— Evening at home—writing a

							seemed anxious for some security to guard him from personal danger, and
							intimated that there were passages in his published Letter which might

							Letter Clay had requested Woodson to shew to the President which he did—
							The President told me his Conversation with Woodson upon the subject;
							and how he had explained to him the principles of the course he had
							determined to take. But he was staggered by this aparte Negotiation,
							between Clay and Torres, and I told him that I <pb type="ms" n="271"

								ref="moore-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. Moore</persRef>
							a member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, who
							immediately withdrew. I found the President still undetermined, whether
							to send a Minister immediately to the Republic of Colombia, or to send
							back <persRef ref="todd-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todd</persRef>; or merely to receive Torres, as Chargé d’Affaires,

							informing him that whenever it shall suit him to come here I will
							present him as Charge d’Affaires of the Republic of Colombia, to the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had written to
								<persRef ref="woodson-samuel">Woodson</persRef> to be shewn to him,
							he had conjectured that Clay himself was disposed to accept one of these

							pretension to notice from it; unless it should be to shew that
							opposition was the way to favour. I told the President of the
							Conversation, which I had with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay,
							before he left this last Spring after the termination of his service in
							Congress. When I had asked if it would suit his convenience in case a
							vacancy in any of the Missions abroad should occur to accept it; and he
							told me it would not; the state of his private affairs requiring all his
							attention, and the liberality of the Bank of the United States, in
							making him their agent General for the States of Kentucky and
							Ohio—giving him the means of relieving himself from his embarrassments
							in the course of four years— I said now that my intention was if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had answered that a mission abroad
							would be acceptable, to have named him for consideration to the
							President wherever a vacancy should occur— I added my belief
							nevertheless that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay now, wished for
							the offer of one of these Missions; and that he would accept that of
							Mexico, and perhaps, that of Colombia; but not either of the others— But
							I distrusted so much M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s views in
							relation to South-American Affairs, and was apprehensive of their
							tendency to entangle us, that I doubted much the propriety of appointing
							him— I should have no objection to his going to Buenos-Ayres or Chili,
							where he could do no harm— I esteemed the talents of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and knew him to have some good
							qualities— But his ambition was too ardent to be very scrupulous or
							delicate; and he was too much addicted to intrigue— The President
							concurred in these opinions, and said he had not determined upon any of
							the nominations to be made; but he had thought of selecting one from
							each of the four great sections of the Union.— I said I had no
							favourites to recommend; but I told him what had passed between <persRef
								ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sanford</persRef> and me, and my opinion of Sanford’s merits and

							applications of <persRef ref="wool-john">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Wool</persRef>, and <persRef ref="worthington-william"

									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Scott</persRef> as having been
							recommended to him— I asked him if <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson</persRef>, had occurred to
							him— He said he had; but he was afraid of his getting us into a quarrel—
							He told me also that he had thoughts of disapproving the Bill now before
							Congress for the further reduction of the army—and read me a draft of
							reasons, which he intended to assign for it— He said he considered it as
							a most pernicious policy; and might as well say so; as those in both
							houses in real opposition to the <pb type="ms" n="272"/>Administration
							were already as inveterate as they could be, and their influence would
							be no greater, nor more mischievous upon one point more than upon those
							on which a collision had already arisen. On returning to the Office, I

								>r</hi> Monroe, then Secretary, which has been called for by a
							Resolution of the house of Representatives, at the motion of <persRef
								ref="floyd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd</persRef>— It
							is a Letter of seven folio sheets of paper; and amounts to little less
							than a denunciation of the majority of the Ghent Mission, for proposing
							the Article recognizing the Fishery right, and the British right to
							navigate the Mississippi, to the proposal of which he himself concurred—
							Russell wrote this Letter at Paris, where we all were, without ever
							communicating it to me, or letting me know that he had any intention of
							writing such a Letter— It is a most elaborate, disingenuous and
							sophistical argument against principles in which he concurred, and the
							joint Letter of 25. December 1814, to which he signed his name— His
							motives for writing it then, to a Virginian Secretary of State, under a
								<persRef ref="madison-james">Virginian President</persRef>, were at
							once to recommend himself to their sectional prejudices about the
							Mississippi, and to give me a secret stab in their esteem and favour,
							for future effect— His motive now for abetting Floyd in his call of the
							paper as a public document, is to decry my chances of popular favour in
							the Western Country— It is I doubt not part of a system of measures
							concerted with others, the developement of which is proceeding from day

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, of which he is a member, he
							Calhoun has a full and thorough knowledge— He said there had never been
							a man in our History, who had risen so high, of so corrupt a character,
							or upon so slender a basis of service— And that he Calhoun had witnessed
							the whole series of Crawford’s operations from the Winter of 1816 to
							this time— Home to dinner between 6 and 7.</p>

								Poletica</persRef> the Russian Minister, to take leave upon his

								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> and of
							himself towards this Country. He said he was instructed to say the

							his friendly relations with them, and saw nothing either in present

							I replied that of the manner in which it might affect him, he must

						<p><date>27. V:15.</date> Morning and evening absorbed upon <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Russell’s</persRef> Letters— The <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had yesterday read me a
							sketch of a Message which he had prepared to send to the House, stating
							that on referring their Resolution to the Department of State, it
							appeared that there was no such Letter there as the one called for— That
							he had then searched among his papers and found a Letter, marked
							“private” from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, and dated Paris
							11. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1815. containing views relating to
							certain Transactions at Ghent, upon interests which have since been
							satisfactorily arranged, but which would naturally call for a reply from
							the surviving members of the Mission— That under these Circumstances he
							should decline sending the Letter, unless the House on a review of them
							should think proper to renew <pb type="ms" n="275"/>the call. I objected
							to this, that it withheld the very material fact that Russell had left
							at the Department, since the Call of the House, a paper purporting to be
							a duplicate of his Letter, but very materially differing from it. This
							morning I received from the President a Note saying that he had made a
							change in the sketch of his message, which he wished to send to the
							House this day, and asking me to call at his House. I went accordingly,
							and took with me a draft of a Report to him upon the reference of the
							Call of the House to the Department of State. In this draft, I had
							stated the fact of Russell’s leaving his duplicate at the Office, to be
							communicated to the House; and had requested the President to
							communicate my remarks upon Russell’s Letter, together with it, to the
							House in answer to their Call. The President appeared to be apprehensive
							of becoming himself implicated in the controversy. He said he thought
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s conduct had been extremely
							reprehensible, and he saw the motives which had occasioned the bringing
							of this Affair before Congress— It was to influence the election to the
							Presidency, when he himself should retire. That he thought it his duty
							to take no part whatsoever in that question, and now if he should send
							this Letter and my Remarks, an extremely acrimonious controversy would
							ensue of which all the parties concerned would claim the right of making
							him the vehicle— I told the President that I approved entirely of his
							determination, and thought that the course which he proposed was the
							only proper one in his situation— I should therefore acquiesce in any
							determination that he should take, with reference to his personal
							concern in this affair; nor did I ask or desire from him the most
							distant manifestation of favour to me in this controversy. But so far as
							concerned my own interest, I had neither doubt nor hesitation— My wish
							was that both Russell’s Letters should be transmitted to the House, and
							my remarks upon them also. It was a deadly thrust at my character and
							reputation, aimed at me on the floor of Congress; and there I would wish
							to meet and grapple with those who had plotted it against me— In the
							face of the Country, the attack upon me had been made— In the face of
							the Country I wished to make my defence. I told him that in all the
							intriguing and cabaling in Congress and in the Newspapers, against
							individuals; supposed Candidates for the Presidency, I had never made
							nor countenanced a charge against any human being— The President said he
							was entirely convinced of this. I added that I had no wish to prostrate
							or expose Russell’s character—my only object would be to defend myself—
							The President said he would consider further of the subject; upon which
							he could not consult the cabinet; but he had consulted <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>,
							the Attorney General— He had at first, thought of answering the Call of
							the House, by simply saying that there was no such Letter as the
							Resolution called for, at the Department of State— On further reflection
							he had preferred the special Statement of facts; and had shewn it to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, who also preferred it, and
							thought it would do justice to me. He read me a note from Wirt to that
							effect— He also read me an additional paragraph which he had prepared
							and thought of introducing, saying that his Predecessor <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>, and himself had approved the general course of
							proceeding, of the Commissioners at Ghent, which he said would be in
							effect supporting the conduct of the Majority— I told him, I duly
							appretiated this approbation; but I did not wish for a testimonial of it
							now— I wished my conduct as one of the majority to stand upon its own
							grounds, and I could refute Russell’s objections to it, as completely as
							I could expose his conduct in making them. When I left the President he
							appeared disposed to send in the duplicate and perhaps the original; but
							within two hours after I received at the Office, a Note from him,
							expressing a doubt whether he should not decline sending in Russell’s
							Letter, under any Circumstances. At the Office there came in succession
								<persRef ref="parrott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parrott</persRef>, a Senator from New-Hampshire, whose object was to
							recommend some person for a Consular Appointment, <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> the British Minister, and <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef> the Swedish
							Charge d’Affaires— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning came to inform
							me that he was instructed by his Government to say, that although they
							approved of their Commissioner <persRef ref="barclay-thomas"
								>Barclay’s</persRef> scruples about the three Islands at the Mouth
							of Detroit River, yet they would be satisfied with his <pb type="ms"
								n="276"/>agreeing to a Report by which the three Islands will fall
							within the Jurisdiction of the United States. Canning said he was much
							gratified at receiving this Instruction which he should immediately
							communicate to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barclay. Stackelberg told
							me that his latest Instructions from Sweden were to remain here at
							present and he should not avail himself of the leave of absence which he
							had some time since informed me that he had received. I made a draft of
							a Letter to the <persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph">Chevalier
								Amado-Grehon</persRef> the Portuguese Charge d’Affaires, which I
							sent to the President— He sent it back, with a Note suggesting an
							addition to it.</p>

							unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this

							God, ye cannot overthrow it.” A controversial Unitarian Discourse— There
							is a certain persecution carried on against these doctrines here, which
							alone could justify this polemic style of preaching before Congress— I
							am still deeply occupied in writing Remarks. <persRef ref="hay-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Hay</persRef> called at
							my House, and told me that the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> was in great concern, about these Letters of
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Russell</persRef>, and much
							distressed as to the proper mode of proceeding in regard to them. That
							owing to particular Circumstances the President had consulted him on
							this occasion, which he very seldom did on public affairs, and had
							requested him to call and have some conversation with me concerning it.
							Particularly as he understood there was a difference of opinion between
							the President and me, as to the proper course to be taken— I said the
							difference of opinion was only as to the course most expedient with
							reference to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> concern in the affair— I was
							perfectly aware that the only line for the President; was that of
							impartial neutrality. In this I had entirely acquiesced, and it was all
							I had asked of him— He must exclusively judge of what that required of
							him, and if he concluded to decline sending in the papers on that
							account I should cheerfully submit to his determination. But I had been
							convinced from the beginning, and reflection had only confirmed me in
							the opinion, that the course most suitable for me would be that both
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s Letters, and my remarks
							upon them should be communicated to the House in answer to their Call.
							It was a base attack upon my character of which Russell had made himself
							the instrument— He had actually dragged me before the House of
							Representatives of the Nation, there to charge me with treachery to a
							great public trust— The object of the charge was to dishonour me in the
							face of my Country. The only course that became me was to meet the
							charge where it was made— That I could expose the conduct of Russell in
							a manner disgraceful to him was no motive for me to wish to come before
							the Public; but he has brought himself and me there. If the papers are
							withheld, a vague and indefinite charge will be hanging over me, of
							which as much use will be made to ruin my reputation, as if it was
							distinctly proved, and the universal impression will be that I was
							afraid to meet it, and that the object of the suppression is to screen
							me— I knew it was equally in my power to put Russell to shame for his
							conduct, and to demolish the whole argument of his Letter. I could not
							undertake to conquer prejudice and jealousy, which never reason; but I
							could satisfy every reasonable person that Russell’s imputations of our
							having offered to sacrifice the interest of the western Country were
							totally groundless. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay said he believed
							if the case were his own, he should think so too; but he was not sure it
							would be the most expedient course. He spoke with the most utter
							detestation of Russell’s conduct—and said there was no expression too
							bad to mark its infamy. He also told me that in the course of <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> administration there had been several occasions
							of very great disagreement, and even misunderstanding between him and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe: and particularly concerning
							the transac- in the late War, which terminated in the capture of this
							City by the British— And he related a Scene between himself and <persRef
								ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef> in June 1814. in
							which he told Armstrong that the British would infallibly take this
							place, if measures should not be taken more effective for its defence.

								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of December 1814—I had made the draft of
							the joint Letter of the Mission to the Secretary of State, mentioning
							that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had offered to the British
							Plenipotentiaries the Article, confirmative of the fisheries to us, and
							of the Mississippi Navigation to the British, <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had desired that
							an alteration should be made, saying that <hi rend="italic">a
								majority</hi> of us determined to make this offer. This was M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s desire, and not his; but when the
							joint Letter was so written, as he had voted in the minority on the
							question, he thought it necessary to justify his conduct to the
							Government, and therefore had written the Letter from Paris— That when
							he came to this Country in 1816, there had been a paragraph in the
							Boston Centinel, charging him with having been willing to sacrifice the
							fisheries at Ghent. That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd had moved
							his Resolution calling for the Ghent papers, without consulting him; but
							as upon the first call of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd, his,
							Russell’s separate Letter of 25. December 1814. had been reported it
							became necessary for his justification that the Letter containing his
							reasons, as promised in that Letter should also appear. He had written
							to <persRef ref="russell-unknown7">his daughter</persRef> at Mendon, for
							his own original draft of the Letter, she had found and sent it to him
							all but the two last sheets— There was therefore some variation between
							the original and the duplicate of his Letter; and he had inserted some
							passages to defend himself with those who feel a particular interest in
							the fisheries. But there was no alteration of <hi rend="italic"
								>facts</hi>. I told him he was mistaken— There was an alteration of
							fact in the form of the most aggravated of all his charges against the
							Majority of the Mission, that of a wilful, direct, and positive
							violation of Instructions. This was not in the original Letter; but on
							the contrary; there was an express acquittal of the violation of
							Instructions. But the charge was in the duplicate, in language as strong
							as he could make it— He said the acquittal in the original and the
							charge in the duplicate referred to different Instructions— I replied
							that the original had no reference to the Instructions cited in the
							duplicate— It expressed a concurrence with the Majority in the belief
							that the proposal referred to in no ways violated our Instructions. The
							terms were general, and reserved no exception. The duplicate limited the
							acquittal of violated Instructions, to the single Instruction of 25.
							June 1814. but brought in an express charge, in the most aggravated
							terms of the violation of other Instructions, namely those of 15. April
							1813. from which it cited the paragraph, which it alledged to have been
							violated— And this duplicate, now delivered by himself as having been
							the Letter written by him at, Paris in Feb<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi>
							1815 declares that he had thought at Ghent, and still thought that this
							wilful and positive violation of Instructions had been <pb type="ms"
								n="278"/>committed; while the real, original Letter, expressed no
							such opinion, and made no such charge— But I could shew him that it was
							impossible he should have thought at Ghent that we had violated the
							passage cited in his <hi rend="italic">duplicate</hi>, of the
							Instruction of 15. April 1813. because before the proposal was made, we
							had received the subsequent Instruction of 19. October 1814. which
							released us entirely from the restriction of that passage, and
							authorised us expressly to conclude a Treaty upon the Basis of the
							Status ante Bellum— I then shewed him on the Book of Records of the
							Department, the Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe to the
							Mission of 19. October 1814 to the Mission, which was received on the
								24<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of November of that year; and also
							another Letter of 6. October 1814. containing the same authority, but
							which I told him had not been received by the Mission— I further told
							him that <persRef ref="madison-james">President Madison</persRef>, by a
							Message to Congress of 9. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1814 had
							communicated to Congress, so much of our Instructions, as would shew the
							terms upon which we were authorised to make Peace; the Instructions of
							15. April 1813. were included in that communication; but the passage
							cited in the duplicate in proof of violated instructions, was omitted,
							as having been subsequently cancelled. During the whole of this
							exposition, Russell’s countenance gave the usual indications of detected
							imposture; alternately flushing and turning pale. He said he had no
							recollection of the receipt of this Letter of 19. October 1814— And
							asked if I thought the Status ante Bellum, included necessarily the
							right of the British to navigate the Mississippi— I said that was a
							matter upon which he was at Liberty to make his argument; but when, with
							the authority to conclude on the Basis of the Status ante Bellum, was
							connected the omission from the Instructions communicated to Congress of
							the paragraph cited by him as having been violated; when copies of these
							Instructions, thus communicated were transmitted to us, as shewing the
							terms on which we were authorised to conclude, it was impossible for me
							to doubt that the passage now cited by him, had been cancelled— At all
							events it had been so considered at Ghent, for this Instruction of 19.
							October had not only been received, but was actually produced in the
							course of the discussions of the Mission. He said if I recollected that
							there could be no question but it was so. <unclear>But</unclear> he said
							he could assure me he had not acted in this case in concert with my
							enemies, and had never written or published a word against me in the
							newspapers. He had acted from no motive of hostility to me— I then said
							to him, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, I wish not to enquire
							into your motives.— Henceforth, as a Public man, if upon any occasion
							whatever I can serve either you or your Constituents, it will afford me
							as much pleasure as if nothing had ever occurred between us; but of
							private and individual intercourse, the less there is between us from
							this time forward, the more agreeable it will be to me— He only replied
							“I wish you well”—and left me— Among the other observations he had made
							was that he was entirely indifferent whether his Letter should be
							communicated or not; and he had told <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Brent</persRef> so, on delivering the
							Letter to him; and he asked me if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent
							had told me this. I said he had not; but that I had requested the
							President to communicate both the Letters to the House, with such
							remarks, as I had to make upon them; among which I should certainly
							notice the variations between the original and duplicate of his Letter.
							About two hours after he left the Office, I went over to the President’s
							upon other business, and found Russell with him— He had no doubt been
							there the whole of the interval. <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> the Secretary <pb
								type="ms" n="279"/>of the Navy was also there, and when I went in,
							Russell immediately withdrew. The President said he believed Russell was
							not so anxious, for his Letter to be sent to the House as he had been— I
							said I presumed not; but it was too late for him now to retreat— I then
							told the President and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson, what had
							passed this Morning between Russell and me; and that I had expressly
							renounced all future private and personal intercourse with him. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson soon afterwards retired, and upon
							conversing with the President he told me nothing of what Russell had
							been saying to him, but I found in him an increased reluctance to
							sending in the letter to the House. Not having yet finished my remarks I
							did not press the subject upon the President; but mentioned <persRef
								ref="wilcocks-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilcocks’s</persRef> importunities for a Commission as Consul
							General in Mexico. But he does not incline to make any formal
							appointments to the South-American States at present. <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary Roberdeau</persRef> and <persRef

							Salary due since the beginning of this year. The appropriation Bill has
							not yet finally passed, or rather was this day signed by the <persRef

							deposited with the Rolls in the Department of State, I could not give
							the Doctor an order for his Salary; but I gave him a check for the money
							on the Bank of the Metropolis, taking his note for repayment on
							receiving his Salary. <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">H. Niles</persRef>
							the Editor of the weekly Register at Baltimore came to solicit a place
							in the Department for <persRef ref="niles-samuel">his second
								Son</persRef>— I called at the President’s, who to my great surprize
							read me a draft of a Message to the House of Representatives, stating
							that on reference of their Resolution to the Department of State, no
							such Letter from <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Russell</persRef>, as that described in it, had been
							found upon the files. Then suppressing entirely the fact that Russell
							had delivered his duplicate there himself, to be communicated to the
							House, and declaring positively to send a copy of the original Letter,
							as a private Letter, which could only occasion controversy to no useful
							purpose— I told the President that this Message was totally different
							from any thing that I had heard him intimate his intention of sending
							before— That the Resolution from the House had been officially referred
							by him to the Department of State, and I had officially reported to him
							upon that reference, that there was a Letter there from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, delivered by himself to be
							communicated as the Letter called for by the Resolution. That the Letter
							itself was now of record in the Department— That my Report to him upon
							it, and the remarks that I was preparing to submit to him upon the
							contents, would also be of record in the Department. A Message to the
							House therefore declaring that there was no such Letter at the
							Department, would be liable to strong public animadversion, when it was
							impossible that the fact should not become notorious, that there was
							such a Letter, and when it could not but appear that the fact was known
							to him from my Report. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> Report! . . . said
							the president, in a tone of sharp anger—’tis <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
							Report . . . It is no Report at-all until I have accepted it”— My
							feelings were wound up to a pitch, at which it was with extreme <pb
								type="ms" n="280"/>difficulty that I preserved the controul of my
							temper and the command of my expressions. I did so, however; and
							said—Sir, it is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Report, to do what you
							please with it when received; but so far as I understand the
							Constitution of this Country, it is my Report to make; and I am the
							responsible person in making it— He said that he had always when
							Secretary of State considered the Reports he had made to <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>, as subject entirely to the controul of the President,
							and had always felt himself bound to make any alteration in a Report,
							required by him— I replied that I had invariably observed the same Rule
							with him— I had never in a single instance written a public paper to be
							submitted to him, without making every alteration in it, suggested by
							him, and insisted on— I was now willing to make any alteration that he
							would desire in this Report, and had told him so, when I presented the
							Report to him— But the Report when made I considered as mine— He said
							that the object of this whole transaction, and of <persRef
								ref="floyd-john">Floyd’s</persRef> Resolutions was to have an
							influence upon future Events— That as to the Elections, he felt it his
							duty to take no part: in them whatever— That the production of these
							Letters would be followed by an extremely acrimonious controversy in
							Congress and in the Newspapers; and all the parties would claim the
							right of making him the vehicle of their publications— I said that from
							the beginning I had assured him I would acquiesce in any course he might
							think proper to avoid committing him in the most distant manner in the
							controversy— I asked no favour— Nothing but a hearing. But the
							suppression of the facts, that Russell has delivered at the Department a
							paper, to be communicated to the House as the duplicate of the Letter
							called for, and that this Letter differed from the Letter really written
							by him, in a heavy aggravation of charge against the majority of the
							Ghent Mission, would seem to me to be taking part very decidedly against
							the accused majority and in favour of Russell. The President finally
							said he would consider of it further. I have received a new Note from
							the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef> with
							proposals for the commercial Negotiation; and the President directed a
							Cabinet Meeting to consider of them tomorrow— I dined at <persRef

							of Congress and foreign Ministers. In the Evening I joined <persRef
