						<p><date>1 V:30.</date> A Sleepless Night. The cause of which I could not
							assign to myself, but it was with a dispersion of spirits which disabled
							me from turning to account the time thus cast upon me; towards the dawn,
							only I fixed my mind upon a train of thought suited to the occasion and
							rose just after daylight— Received a Note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, desiring the members of the
							Administration to meet at his house at 11. O’Clock— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> were there— The President had prepared answers for
								<persRef ref="mason-john">General Mason</persRef> to return to both
								<persRef ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duponceau’s</persRef> Letters— The substance of them was that he was
							sure the Government as well as People of the United States entertained
							the most friendly Sentiments; towards the People of Cuba, and felt the
							most lively interest in their welfare but that their relations with
							Spain, did not admit of their forming any engagements in the present
							state of things; such as were implied in the proposals of <persRef
								ref="sanchez-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sanchez</persRef>; and that the Executive Government would not in
							any event be competent to form them, without the concurrence of
							Congress. The more secret Letter suggested as General Mason’s own idea
							that it would be well for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanchez to give
							information more explicit and precise of the authority by which he
							acted; whence it came—who were the persons concerned in the project—how
							far it was matured, and what means and resources they had for
							accomplishing their purpose— I suggested the expediency, that General
							Mason should furnish copies, both of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Duponceau’s Letters and of the answers—to which the President said he
							would attend— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt gave a written opinion
							in the case of the Danish Slave, which was that the President had the
							power to deliver him up. I asked him where he found the grant of the
							Power in the Constitution— He said it was in the general instruction to
							take care that the Laws should be faithfully executed. I said that in
							his opinion that the President could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> deliver
							up a Pirate, he did not admit that doctrine—where did he find it now? He
							said, laughing, that he took it from me. But his opinion as to the mode
							in which the delivery is to be effected was altogether nugatory— It
							presumes that the President might order the Marshal to take the man and
							deliver him over to the <persRef ref="pederson-peter">Danish
								Minister</persRef> without ceremony; but he recommends that the
								<persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor of New-York</persRef> should
							be written to, and invited, to deliver up the man— I said that I should
							ask to be excused from writing either the order to the <persRef
								ref="livingston-john">Marshal</persRef>, or the Letter to the
							Governor of New-York; for I was convinced that in the first case if the
							Marshal should obey the order, the man would be taken out of his custody
							by Habeas Corpus, and very probably he himself be presented in a State
							Court for False Imprisonment, by the manumission Society; and in the
							second we should have an answer from the Governor of New-York, not only
							refusing to deliver up the man but subjoining a commentary upon the
							demand, which would be any thing other than palatable. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said that the subject was quite as
							much political as legal; and he wished the President would take other
							opinions as well as his— The truth is that between his Virginian
							aversion to constructive powers, his Virginian devotion to State Rights,
							and his Virginian <hi rend="italic">autocracy</hi> against Slaves, his
							two opinions form the most absurd jumble of self-contradictions that
							could be imagined— If the President has not the power to deliver up a
							Pirate, he cannot possibly have power to deliver up a Slave— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun agreed entirely with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt as to the power of the President, in
							the case of fugitive Slaves, but felt more the difficulty of carrying it
							into execution. Calhoun has no petty scruples about constructive Powers,
							and State Rights— His opinions are at least consistent— I have no doubt
							that by the Constitution the President has the Power, but perhaps a Law
							of Congress may be necessary, providing the process, by which the power
							should be exercised. Despotism itself would be startled at Wirt’s
							opinion that the Marshal under a bare order from the <pb type="ms"
								n="386"/>President through the Secretary of State, should have power
							to seize a man, without judge or jury, pack him on board ship, and send
							him out of the Country, like a bag of cotton. An invitation to the
							Governor of New-York to do the same thing is not less absurd. The
							President said he would take time to reflect upon the subject, before
							coming to his determination. He left the City for his seat in Albemarle
							County, immediately after the Meeting. <persRef ref="thornton-william"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> was at my
							house this Evening. I wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="lloyd-james">James
								Lloyd</persRef>, and sent him a copy of my pamphlet.</p>

							be the particular document that had been required at the Treasury for
							the final adjustment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meig’s account,
							and I left it with the Comptroller. He thought at first that it was a

							been quite irregular and made a voucher from him questionable, but
							observing it dated in 1815, he said it might perhaps answer. I told him
							I had been obliged to suspend the credit upon the public Bankers of
							London, of his nephew and namesake the <persRef ref="anderson-thomas"
								>Consul at Tripoli</persRef>; from whom for nearly three years,
							neither Account nor Letter has been received, and who in the meantime

						<p><date>4. VI:</date> I received this morning a Note from <persRef
								ref="burckle-cj">C. J. Burckle</persRef>, a German, a Citizen
							of the United States, sometime resident at Philadelphia, stating that he
							had just arrived from Bogota, the Capital of the Republic of Colombia,
							charged with a mercantile negotiation very important for the new
							Republic and interesting to the United States— And requesting an
							interview with me— I answered that I would <pb type="ms" n="387"
							/>receive him immediately and he came— He said he was authorised to
							negotiate here or in Europe a Loan of three Millions of Dollars for the
							Government of the Republic of Colombia, upon terms very advantageous to
							the lenders, and which if successful would be of great benefit to the
							commercial violations of the United States—A great part of the money
							being wanted to pay for supplies which may be obtained in this Country,
							but which if the loan should be made in Europe, would be sought there.
							The project included, an exclusive privilege for exporting certain
							Articles during a number of years, and appeared to be the same as that
							in which <persRef ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bollmann</persRef> was engaged when he died some months since at
							Jamaica, on his way to England. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burckle
							shewed me his authority which appeared to be regular and complete;
							originally given to a person named <persRef ref="elbers-b">B.
								Elbers</persRef>, with substitution by him to Burckle, and all
							authenticated, by the <persRef ref="santander-francisco">Vice-President
								of the Republic Santander</persRef>. Burckle’s enquiry was whether
							this Government would be disposed to countenance this loan, by private
							communication to persons in Philadelphia, who might incline to engage in
							it, such as <persRef ref="girard-stephen">Stephen Girard</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="ralston-robert2">Robert Ralston</persRef>, or the
							United States Bank, intimating the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> opinion, or mine, that the borrowers deserve
							Confidence— I told him that the President being absent, I could only
							refer the subject to him, and answer according to such directions as he
							should give. He said he must proceed immediately to Philadelphia, and
							unless he should succeed there, within a few weeks to Europe— I promised
							to write to the President immediately, and did in the course of the day.
							Burckle told me that <persRef ref="gebhard-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gebhard</persRef> the member of Congress from New-York
							State was his brother-in-Law and that he was also related to one of the
							members from Pennsylvania— I had some conversation with him on the
							general subject of the affairs of the Republic of Colombia, and of
							Mexico. Burckle had written Letters from Bogota to R. Ralston
							exceedingly unfavourable to the Country and its Rulers, which Letters
							Ralston had sent me. I intimated to him that I had seen them, and he was
							conscious of their contents— He said there had been great changes there
							since those Letters were written, and things had acquired much greater
							stability, since the new organization of the Government. He added
							however that the People were altogether different there from ours; less
							enlightened; more immoral, and could not be governed in the same manner.
							Yet they were decidedly partial to a Republican form of Government; were
							much dissatisfied with the Imperial dignity assumed by <persRef
								ref="iturbide-augustin">Yturbide</persRef> in Mexico; and very much
							afraid of him.— They disliked <persRef ref="sanmartin-jose">San
								Martin</persRef> for his affectations of Protectoral power in Peru,
							and they had a better opinion of <persRef ref="bolivar-simon"
								>Bolivar</persRef> himself, for a General, than for a Liberator
							President. He spoke of <persRef ref="ravenga-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ravenga</persRef>, who was going to be
							the Minister of the Colombian Republic in England, but who after
							embarking, had by some accident happening to the sloop in which he had
							sailed, been obliged to return. He gave me a Newspaper, containing a
							declaration from the Government that <persRef ref="zea-francisco">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea</persRef> was the only person in
							Europe authorised to contract for them; for it seems others have
							pretended to such authority, and brought upon them burdensome bargains—
							He also offered, and afterwards sent me a file of Bogota Newspapers to
							the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August— At the Office there
							came a <persRef ref="chastant-l">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> L.
								Chastant</persRef>, and <persRef ref="shewell-l">L. D.
								Shewell</persRef>— Received a Letter from <persRef

								<persRef ref="cook-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Cook</persRef>, which I took to him this Evening at his house— After

							of the <persRef ref="onis-luis">Chevalier de Onis</persRef>, not
							altogether concurring with mine. I think better of the two former than
							he does— It is not easy to estimate accurately the moral character of
							Public men— Their reputation is always made up, of a composition by
							friends and foes; all discoloured by favour and by hatred. There is a
							disposition to believe rather the ill than the good that is said of
							them; virtue is never presumed, and seldom credited, by or in political
							adversaries— <persRef ref="tucker-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Duffie</persRef> the member of
							Congress from South-Carolina; Calhoun’s protegé, friend and partizan—
							This feud has become a sort of historical incident. It originated in the
							rivalry between <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> and Calhoun for the Presidential succession—
							Began by some vulgar abuse upon each other in newspapers, in consequence
							of which Cumming challenged M’Duffie before the last Session of
							Congress; and came here last winter during the Session to fight him— The
							meeting was then postponed to 30 days after the close of the Session of
							Congress, when they met and M’Duffie was shot in the back—
								<unclear>They</unclear> then returned to the war, of newspaper
							ribaldry, till Cumming challenged him a second time. By double
							manoeuvering on both sides about the time place and circumstances of
							meeting the second duel was avoided, and each party resorted again to
							hand-bills, posting, newspaper proclamations <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>of</hi> of imputed cowardice, and pamphleteering— The seconds,
							Surgeons and Others have got involved in the dispute, and all have
							become the laughing Stock of the public throughout the Union, except in
							South-Carolina and Georgia; where the parties are feasted and toasted,
							“alive or dead.” Never was such a burlesque upon duels since the
							practice existed. Both parties were considered as unerring shots, and
							there was before they fought made such ludicrous lamentation, in the
							presage that they would both be killed. From the contradictory
							statements of both parties it appears that it has been on the part of
							Cumming a deliberate and determined purpose of assassination founded on
							a confidence in his own shooting, joined to a belief of M’Duffie’s want
							of nerve to meet the occasion, without disabling trepidation— And on the
							part of M’Duffie, a faltering resolution, shrinking both from the fight,
							and the refusal to fight— Dragged into the field against his will, and
							without just cause—behaving equivocally upon it; making and snatching at
							pretences to withdraw from it, boasting of his own firmness against the
							evidence of facts, and covering his <pb type="ms" n="389"/>retreat by
							charging cowardice upon his antagonist. Calhoun, does not talk of it
							with pleasure: but says Cumming is subject to hereditary insanity from

								Little</persRef> preach the funeral Sermon upon the Death of
								<persRef ref="law-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Law</persRef>. His text was Corinthians 15.26. “The last enemy that
							shall be destroyed is Death.” This is the Chapter in which the
							immortality of the Soul, and the Resurrection of the dead, is argued to
							all the reason, and urged to all the feelings of human Nature with the
							deepest logic and sublimest eloquence of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>. I am always
							profoundly affected by the perusal of this chapter. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little’s comment upon it was sensible, and
							temperate— Death and immortality are topics, never unsuitable, nor
							exhaustible to a teacher of Religion and Morality. He noticed but
							slightly M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Law himself, though in
							appropriate terms; and he spoke also of the decease of <persRef
								ref="young-moses">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young</persRef>.
							They were both members of this religious Society; and had both taken
							much interest in its formation, and in the erection of the Church. He
							gave notice that there would be no afternoon service; but that the
							funeral of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young would be at four in the
							afternoon— At the close of the service “<persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope’s</persRef> Dying Christian to his Soul[”] was <pb type="ms"
								n="392"/>sung as an Anthem, with the accompaniment of the organ, and
							with much effect. This Ode is exquisitely beautiful, though most
							singularly compounded of five half ludicrous Latin lines, said to have
							been spoken by the <persRef ref="hadrian">Emperor Adrian</persRef>, at
							the Article of Death; of <persRef ref="sappho">Sappho’s</persRef> fiery
							lyric ode; and of that triumphant and transporting Apostrophe of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul in the 55<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>verse of this 15<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>chapter of
							Corinthians—“O death where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”
							From these materials, upon a suggestion, and at the request of Steele,
							Pope wrote this truly seraphic Song; to be set to Music. In comparing it
							with the lines of Adrian, I see the effect of the Christian doctrines
							upon the idea of Death. Pope contends that there is nothing trifling, or
							even gay in the lines of Adrian; but his imagination leads his judgment
							astray— The heathen philosophers taught that Death was to be met with
							indifference; and Adrian attempted to carry this doctrine into practice,
							by joking at his own death, while in its agonies— Yet the thought of
							what was to become of his Soul, was grave and serious, and his idea of
							its future State, was that of darkness and gloom. The character of his
							lines therefore is a singular mixture of levity and sadness, the Spirit
							of which appears to me to be lost in Pope’s translation of them given in
							a Letter to <persRef ref="steele-richard">Steele</persRef>— I set down
							the lines here, with a translation of them as literal, and as much in
							their Spirit as I can make them.</p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>Animula, vagula, blandula,    Dear, fluttering, flattering little
									Soul;</l>
								<l>Hospes, comesque corporis,    Partner, and inmate of this
									Clay,</l>
								<l>Quae nunc abibis in loca?    Ah! whither art thou now to
									stroll?</l>
								<l>Pallidula, rigida, nudula,    Cold, shivering, naked little
									droll;</l>
								<l>Nec (ut soles) dabis joca!    No more thy wonted jokes, to
									play!</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p>Pope insists that the diminutives are epithets not of levity, but of
							endearment— They are significant of both, and the repetition of them
							with the rhyme of <hi rend="italic">loca</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
								>joca</hi>, in Latin verses of that age, decisively mark the
							merriment of affected indifference. In the process of the
							correspondence, Steele desired Pope to make an Ode as of a cheerful
							dying Spirit, that is to say the Emperor Adrian’s Animula vagula, put
							into two or three Stanzas for Music.— This hint was Pope’s inspiration—
							He made the cheerful dying Spirit a <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>,
							and cheerful death then became the moment of triumphant exultation, and
							the song is as it were the song of an Angel. I was deeply moved at its
							performance. After church I called to visit <persRef ref="brown-jacob"

							for himself applied by Letters— There is not one of these persons but

							to hear their necessities urged, while those of only one can be
							relieved; and the greatest want, being never in the same person as the
							greatest qualification— This however is the first principle upon which I
							am bound to make the appointments, and I determined in this instanced to
							act upon a second—That is to give the place to a person, not an
							inhabitant of the district— I therefore fixed upon <persRef
								ref="smith-linnaeus">Francis Linnaeus Smith</persRef> of Richmond
							Virginia, recommended by <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Hay</persRef>, as a person
							qualified for <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Service in the Department for
							which there may be occasion to call—and I wrote to him; offering him the
							place vacant, being the second Clerkship at the Salary of 800 dollars a
							year— Having first advanced Fontaine Maury, from a Salary of 1000 to
							1400 dollars, which was that of <persRef ref="young-moses">M<hi

						<p><date>15. VI:</date><persRef ref="bulfinch-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George S. Bulfinch</persRef> came this
							morning to renew his application for the vacant Clerkship, and learnt
							with some disappointment that it was filled— He asked if there would be
							any better prospect for him at the next vacancy— I told him, that with
							the best disposition to serve him, I could not flatter him with any such
							encouragement— His qualifications I had no doubt of, but supposing them
							to be upon an equal footing with those of others, his want of the place
							could not be so great— He was a young man; without family to support,
							and already prepared for the practice of the Law. Having thus a
							Profession, which could provide for him— Others had families in extreme
							distress, and without other means of subsistence— It was also
							indispensable to make a portion of the appointments from persons not
							residing within the district; from which I had hitherto taken more than
							a due proportion. Those reasons were certainly not satisfactory to him;
							but he received them with respect, and without any manifestation of
							improper temper— There came a person of different character and
							pretensions named <persRef ref="hood-unknown">Hood</persRef>, from
							Loudoun County Virginia, without recommendations; but he said he had
							come to see if there wasn’t <hi rend="italic">any</hi> office in the
							Department vacant here that he could get. I told him I did not know of
							any— He said he had heard that <persRef ref="watson-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Watson</persRef> who had an office in
							the Treasury was dead, and he did not know but what he might have <hi
								rend="italic">his’n</hi>. I said he had better enquire at the
							Treasury Department. <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Hay</persRef> called at the Office to enquire if
							I had made the appointment, and if I had written to <persRef
								ref="smith-linnaeus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>
							to give him notice of it. I told him I had. He said that would render it
							unnecessary for him to write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith,
							which he should rather prefer not to do, as if it should be known, that
							the appointment was obtained at his recommendation, he would be teased
							with numerous other solicitations— I told him that by the appointment of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, I had greatly disappointed
							another Virginian and highly recommended applicant <persRef
								ref="berryman-n">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berryman</persRef>—
							Hay said he did not know him; had never heard of him; and was sure he
							could not be a man at-all known in Virginia— A young man by the name of
								<persRef ref="allison-unknown3">Allison</persRef>, from Alexandria
							came, and brought Letters from <persRef ref="mason-john">General John
								Mason</persRef>, and from the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>— The latter was a mere general expression of
							good will in his favour. He had been at the Office with them once <pb

							Sardinian Consul <persRef ref="deabbate-gaspare">Deabbate</persRef> to
							answer them, after a long delay. In the Evening I answered a Letter from
								<persRef ref="hall-joseph3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph

								ref="deabbate-gaspare">Deabbate’s</persRef> Letters with a view to
							answer his demands. I finally dismissed <persRef ref="colvin-john">John
								B. Colvin</persRef> from the Office of a Clerk in the Department of
							State— I have come to this Resolution with great reluctance and after
							indulgence long protracted, and so frequently repeated that I can no
							longer justify it to myself— His principal vice is habitual and
							increasing intemperance. He was introduced into the office by <persRef
								ref="smith-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert
								Smith</persRef>, whose confidence in and reliance upon him was
							rewarded by signal and well known treachery— He had however been
							continued in the Office, and when sober, was the most active,
							intelligent, and useful Clerk in it. He had always professed much
							personal attachment to me since I have been in the Department, and wrote
							frequently editorial and other Articles in various Newspapers to defend
							and eulogise me— Very soon after the first of those papers appeared, on
							hearing of their being attributed to him, I requested him not to
							continue them with any personal reference to me, though I had no
							objection, if he saw fit, to defend in that way measures of the
							administration which might be assailed. But his habits of intoxication,
							and his absences from the Office, for whole weeks at a time in
							consequence of them, have been for the last two years growing to such
							excess, that about six months since, after numerous comings to him, and
							intreaties from him to be forgiven for the last time, I displaced him as
							a Clerk with a permanent Salary by the year, and directed that he should
							be paid by the day, for the days of his actual attendance—Allowing him
							four dollars a day, which with constant attendance would have been very
							nearly equivalent to his Salary of 1400 dollars a year— As the
							Correspondence and the Office details relating to the taking of the
							Census had been chiefly carried on by him, I gave him the abstract from
							the returns of the manufactures, required by the Resolution of Congress
							of the last Session, to be prepared, and earnestly enjoined it upon him
							to complete it so that it might be printed, and ready to be laid on the
							table, of the Members on the first day of the next Session— But although
							paid by the day, pinched by penury, and crippled with debts he has been
							absent at least half the time, and the Printers of the
							manufacture-abstract, sent me word last week, that at the rate that copy
							was furnished them, they could not have the work ready in less than two
							years. I immediately directed that the work should be transferred to
								<persRef ref="thruston-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thruston</persRef>, and that further special aid should be employed
							to ensure the completion of the work by the commencement of the Session.
							Colvin had been several days absent, and it was not known when he would
							return— But I directed that when he should return he might still be
							employed in assisting to finish the work— This day I directed that
								<persRef ref="baker-john">John Martin Baker</persRef> should be
							placed as a Clerk with a permanent Salary of 800 dollars from the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> the
							day before the appointment of <persRef ref="smith-linnaeus">F. L.
								Smith</persRef>— I advanced <persRef ref="ironside-george">George
								Ironside</persRef> to the Salary of 1000 dollars, and Thomas
							Thruston to that of 1400 dollars which had been held by Colvin. Baker
							was many years since a Clerk in the Department; then went to Europe as a
							Consul and returned as destitute as he went— He has a considerable
							family, in extreme want. For the last year I <pb type="ms" n="395"/>have
							kept him employed as a supernumerary at 3 dollars a day. He earnestly
							solicited however the permanent appointment, and I concluded to give it
							to him— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> called at the Office and enquired if I should

							Paris, and the Diligence— Mathews the sole performer, personated in the
							course of the Evening; ten or twelve characters, male and female; with
							varieties of voice, and countenance scarcely credible— He has at command
							a distinct female voice, and the power of ventriloquism, by which he
							maintains with ease a dialogue of several interlocutors. He has also
							extraordinary powers of mimicry; a talent perhaps intimately connected
							with that of varying so much the tones of his voice. His performance was
							divided into three parts, each occupying upwards of an hour; at the end
							of the first and second of which he withdrew from the Stage; for a space
							of 8 or 10 minutes— For the two first parts he had a table before him;
							at which he stood and discoursed, as if delivering a Lecture— A Chair
							behind him in which he occasionally seated himself impersonating
							particular characters, the costumes of which he assumed in the presence
							of the audience, by a movement, never taking two minutes of time— He
							thus travestied himself as a French Professor, a German Professor of
							Craniology, and an old Scotch woman, telling a story how the keys of the
							kirk were lost. In these parts he imitated the Scotch, the German, and
							the French pronunciation of English inimitably, and the caricature face
							of the broad-cheeked, wide-mouthed, heavy-moulded German, then of the
							long, lank, projected single-toothed frenchman, with a powdered,
							pomatumed frizzled toupee, and a head sunk into a perpetual shrug of the
							shoulders, and next of the smooth-tongued, oily mouthed coax-accented
							Scottish old women, were in the most exact congeniality with their
							several modes of Speech. In relating the adventures of the passage from
							Dover to Calais, he introduced a dialogue between several of the
							supposed characteristic passengers—and described them under the
							operation of Sea-sickness, with great humour, and yet without indecency—
							In the third act, instead of his table, he had a Scene as of the door of
							a Stage-Office, and a French Diligence standing at the back of the
							Scene. He began with personating an English <hi rend="italic">Boots</hi>
							or Waiter at the Stage-Office; then came in successively in four
							characters taking Seats in the Diligence, and finally in that of the
							driver, Monsieur Poudre Meneur, with his blue and red uniform, his long
							queued powdered hair, his jack-boots, and his wood-thonged whip— His
							mode of withdrawing from the Stage, to change his character and dress
							was by getting in to the diligence—and each time when getting in, he
							gave a disputing dialogue, between the person entering, and those
							supposed to be already seated in it— One of his personages, was a
							doll-figure dressed as a boy, shut up in a box from which he
							occasionally drew him, and held with him a ridiculous dialogue— An old
							maid brought in another box, in which was supposed to be a lap-dog.— The
							yelling of which upon being supposed to be pinched, he imitated as
							exactly as all his varieties of the human voice— The whole entertainment
							was interspersed with occasional humorous songs—at which during the two
							first Acts he had the accompaniment of a performer on the Piano; but
							worse than none; the musician being so rapt in extasy at the exhibition
							of Mathews himself, as to be never in time for his own. This
							entertainment was wonderful, and amusing, and continually laughable, and
							yet passed heavily off— Most of the hearers are weary of it before it is
							over. Its humour is all light— Its wit flashing away in puns. Its
							ridicule often resolvable into mere absurdity— It is a picture of
							Teniers, or of Jan Steen. Imitation <pb type="ms" n="398"/>to admire, of

							He brought with him a Letter from the <persRef ref="george-iv">King of

							which he said being rather of an old date, he would request me to take
							charge of, to be delivered to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, rather than ask a special Audience for the
							purpose. It was merely a notification of the birth of a <persRef
								ref="augusta">daughter</persRef> to the <persRef ref="adolphus">Duke
								of Cambridge</persRef> at Hanover— We had also a couple of hours of
							desultory conversation upon various political topics, as well of general
							interest, as of particular concernment between the two Nations at this
							time— He spoke first of the measures recently adopted in England, and
							here, for opening the commercial intercourse between this Country, and
							the British Colonies in America. He observed that complaint had been
							made to him that by a Circular Letter from the <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller of the Treasury</persRef> to the
							Collectors of the Customs, explanatory of the President’s Proclamation
							of 24. August last, the foreign tonnage, and discriminating duties, were
							levied upon British vessels from the American Colonies, and upon
							Articles imported in them— He said this was not only short of
							reciprocity to the provisions of the Act of Parliament opening the
							Colonial Ports to our Vessels, but laid the British Navigation under
							such disadvantages, as would make it impossible for them to pursue the
							trade in competition with ours— There was another restriction too upon
							British Vessels from the Colonies which had no counterpart in the Act of
							Parliament— Those from the West-Indies being allowed to import only
							British West-Indian Articles, and those from North-America only Articles
							of their own growth or produce. As the object on both sides was to open
							the intercourse on terms of reciprocity, and as these regulations were
							so incompatible with it, he hoped we would remove them immediately; and
							he remarked that the Act of Parliament authorised the king in Council to
							withhold the privileges of the intercourse from Nations which should not
							grant the same privileges to British Vessels in return. I told him we
							were aware of that; and that the Proclamation had gone as far as the
							President was authorized by the Act of Congress of the last Session to
							go, in meeting this overture— We had even given a very enlarged
							Construction to the words of the Act, by admitting Vessels from
							North-American Ports under an authority to admit vessels from the
							West-Indies— But the Act of Parliament, did not grant to our Vessels the
							advantages secured to them in the European British Ports, by the
							Convention of 3. July 1815— It admitted them only by a voyage, direct
							from the United States, allowed them to return only to the United
							States— It admitted only certain enumerated Articles, and charged them
							with duties, almost equivalent to prohibition; while it excluded the
							most important articles of our exports suited to the Colonial Markets.
							Besides which our vessels which had entered their Ports in the
							West-Indies under the Act of Parliament had been subjected to an export
							duty, levied by the Colonial authority, distinct from the duties levied
							by the Act of Parliament; and were otherwise so shackled and trammelled
							that our own Merchants thought it impossible for them, to pursue the
							trade in competition with the British, and we had received remonstrances
							against opening the Ports at-all, subject to the Conditions required
							under this Act of Parliament. I mentioned to him the Letters I had
							received from <persRef ref="hollingsworth-jehu">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hollingsworth</persRef>, the Consul at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Eustatius with the enclosed opinion of
							the <persRef ref="woodley-john">Attorney General of S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Kitts</persRef>; and promised to have
							them looked up and to shew them to him— I told him also that I had
							written to <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, immediately after the proclamation issued,
							mentioning the continued disposition of this Government to concur with
							the British, in any measures necessary for setting this intercourse upon
							principles of reciprocity, and our belief that some further
							understanding between the two Governments concerning it would be
							advisable. The next subject upon which he touched was the disagreeing
							Reports of the Commissioners <pb type="ms" n="400"/>under the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the Treaty of Ghent. He said
							that before he left the City last Summer he had written to his
							Government, for Instructions, in reference to what had passed between
							us: he had not yet received his answer, and perhaps it might be now
							further delayed, by the changes in the British Ministry, consequent upon
							the death of the <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Marquis of
								Londonderry</persRef>— I asked him if <persRef ref="canning-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> George Canning</persRef> would
							accept of the Office of Secretary for the foreign Department in
							preference to that of Governor General of India, to which he had already
							been appointed— He thought he would— The place in India is more
							lucrative—that in England more brilliant, and more deeply responsible— I
							said that from what I had observed of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning’s character, I believed that upon a question resolvable only by
							that alternative, he would without hesitation choose the place at home;
							but I had supposed other considerations would be involved in the
							formation of his decision. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning had
							been more than once distinguished in his relations with the Cabinet, by
							adherence to his personal Independence, more than to his place. He was
							supposed to entertain opinions upon important objects of national
							policy, clashing with those of other leading members of the Cabinet.
							Whether they could be reconciled, or whether they could be disposed of
							so that an Administration could move in the harmony necessary for
							successful operation under them, was an enquiry which I should expect
							would give more cause for hesitation to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning, than a mere question between money and glory. It was expected
							if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning should come in to the foreign
							Department, that the foreign Policy of Great Britain, would undergo some
							modification— That the proceedings of the Congress at Vienna, would be
							affected by it— He said the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
								Wellington</persRef> was going to the Congress of Vienna; but the
							Duke of Wellington goes only to execute instructions, and the system,
							must go from the foreign Department— Assenting to this remark he passed
							to the subject of the Slave-trade, and enquired if we were prepared to
							resume that discussion— I said we were prepared to receive and consider
							any further observations which he might be disposed to offer concerning
							it— He said that in his late tour, he had become satisfied, that our
							compliance with the proposal of admitting mutual search, depended
							personally and exclusively upon me. I assured him he had been
							misinformed, as he might hereafter have occasion to know— This topic was
							not further pressed and he withdrew— Evening walk, and Chess with

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef

							The subject for Consideration, was the Instructions to be given to
								<persRef ref="biddle-james">Captain Biddle</persRef>, who is going
							to cruize in the West-India Seas— Letters from Captains <persRef
								ref="spence-robert">Spence</persRef>, <persRef ref="cassin-stephen"
								>Cassin</persRef> and <persRef ref="renshaw-james"
							>Renshaw</persRef>, who have been recently cruizing there, to the
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> were
							read. The instructions heretofore given to our naval officers, under the
							recent Slave-trade and Piracy acts were brought in by <persRef
								ref="homans-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Homans</persRef>, the Chief Clerk of the Navy Department— From the
							annoyance to our commerce of late by Pirates of various descriptions,
							and from the capture of several of them, with real or colourable Spanish
							Commissions, questions have arisen how far, the Instructions to Biddle
							should be modified; how far privateering Commissions from Porto-Rico may
							be respected; whether a blockade of all the Ports of Terra-firma, by
							more declarations of Spanish Officers at Porto-Cavello should be
							recognized, and whether Biddle should be authorized to convey our
							Merchant vessels to any of those Ports. The Spanish Privateers from
							Porto-Rico, began by capturing all vessels bound to or from any of the
							Ports in Terra-firma, on the double pretence of a blockade of the whole
							Coast, declared by Spanish Officers themselves besieged in the only Port
							possessed by them, and having only one old Frigate, and two small
							vessels to support it, and of the old Spanish exclusion of all foreign
							vessels from the Ports of their Colonies—and in one case when the judge
							at Porto-Rico, decreed the restoration of a vessel carried in there, the
							Captain of the Privateer told him in open Court, that if his prize was
							thus released, he would follow her out of Port, take her again, and
							carry her in to Porto Cavello— The Palmyra some days before she was
							taken by the Grampus, had made an attempt and pretension to examine and
							search an American Vessel under her convoy. The President now inclined
							to give Instructions to Biddle to remonstrate to the <persRef
								ref="linares-francisco">Governor of Porto Rico</persRef>, and to the
							Commanders of any Spanish armed Vessels with whom he may fall in,
							against the Blockade, and to declare that it cannot be acknowledged by
							the United States as valid, but to avoid any positive act of force
							against it. But Spence and Renshaw both have remonstrated against the
							Blockade to the Governor of Porto-Rico, who answered them that he would
							report their remonstrances to the Spanish Governments but that it had
							been declared by the commanding Officers in Terra-firma, over whose acts
							he had no controul; nor could he revoke them— I thought Biddle should be
							instructed to go in to Porto Cavello itself, and there declare to the
							Spanish Commanders themselves that the United States would not recognize
							their paper Blockades, and also to convoy American vessels to or from
							any Port, not actually invested: and in no case whatever to permit the
							search or boarding of any vessel under his Convoy. Calhoun was at first
							startled at this. He thought that to resist the search would be war, and
							doubted the Power of the Executive to give such instructions— I said it
							was the old question of Sterrett and the Enterprize, who after fighting
							and compelling to surrender, the Tripolitan Cruizer let her go, because
							he thought he could not bring her in as prize— To authorize force in
							self-defence, I believed the authority of the Executive under our
							Constitution, to be entirely competent, and if a naval Officer could be
							authorised to convoy at-all, he must be authorised to defend the
							convoyed vessel as he would his own, against force. Calhoun asked it we
							could authorise the merchant vessel itself to resist the belligerent
							right of search— I said no— And that the British claimed the right of
							searching convoyed vessels— But that we had never admitted that right;
							and that the opposite principle was that of the armed Neutrality— They
							maintained, that a Convoy was a pledge on <pb type="ms" n="402"/>the
							part of the convoying Nation that the convoyed vessel has no Articles of
							contraband on board, and is not going to a blockaded Port; and the word
							of honour of the commander of the convoy to that effect must be given—
							But I added, if we could instruct our officer to give convoy at-all, we
							cannot allow him to submit to the search by foreigners of a vessel under
							his charge; for it is placing our officer and the Nation itself in an
							attitude of inferiority and humiliation— The President agreed with this
							opinion, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun declared his
							acquiescence in it. And it was determined that the Instructions to
							Biddle should be drawn accordingly— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun asked me if <persRef ref="early-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Early</persRef> of Georgia, had called upon me— He had
							not— He had upon Calhoun, and upon the President— His object was to
							represent that <persRef ref="morrell-john">John H. Morel</persRef>, the
							Marshal for the District of Georgia, was now accumulating a fortune of
							at least 30 000 dollars a year; by working a number of African negroes,
							who are in his possession as Marshal of the District, while at the same
							time he is making the most enormous charges against the Public, for the
							maintenance of the very same negroes— That he makes it his open boast,
							that he holds the Office of Marshal for no other purpose, and that he
							intends to <hi rend="italic">swamp</hi> the Negroes, that is, to work
							them to death, before they shall be finally adjudicated, out of his
							possession. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Early adds that his cruelty
							to Negroes is universally notorious, and that it is equally well known,
							that he did commit the murder of the black man, for which he was tried
							and acquitted— The principle witnesses against him were <hi

							the same political party as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morel,
								(<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford’s</persRef>) but is
							so horror-struck at the character and conduct of the man, that he feels
							it to be his duty to denounce him— Yet he does not incline to support

							propriety of dismissing Morel immediately from Office; but the President
							said that could not be done while there was no avowed accuser against

						<p><date>28. V:30.</date> Visit of two hours at the Office from <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef>. He resumed the Subject of the West India trade,
							and urged again for the admission of British vessels from the Colonial
							Ports, upon the same terms with regard to duties as our own. I repeated
							to him that the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> could do
							nothing further before the Meeting of Congress. He said he was afraid he
							should be obliged then to trouble me with a long note upon the subject.
							I told him I should then of course lay it before the President, by whom
							it would be deliberately considered. He took from his Pocket immediately
							and gave me his Note, and with it an extract of a Letter from Barbadoes,
							mentioning that orders had been received there from London to admit
							American Vessels, upon payment of the <hi rend="italic">same fees</hi>,
							as are paid by British Vessels; and expressing some misgivings how it
							would all operate, and a sort of imperious assurance that their Vessels,
							must of course be admitted into our Ports, upon the same terms as our
							own— I observed that this should be more than was even implied in the
							Letter, as being extended to us, for that spoke only of the same <hi
								rend="italic">fees</hi>, which included neither duties, nor
							Port-charges by the necessary import of the term— But that a different
							Construction appeared to have been given to the Act of Parliament in
							other Islands, and I looked up and read to him the Letter from <persRef
								ref="hollingsworth-jehu">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hollingsworth</persRef>, and the opinion enclosed in it of the
							King’s Attorney, <persRef ref="woodley-john">Woodley</persRef>, at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Kitts— I then asked how it would be
							possible for our vessels to stand any competition in the trade, with
							theirs, while theirs should enjoy here every advantage and exemption of
							our own, Liberty to import from all of their Ports West-India,
							North-American, or British European Articles indiscriminately, admitted
							upon credit for the duties, and subject neither to duty nor restriction
							upon exportation, while ours were restricted to direct voyage, both to
							and from their Ports and the United States, limited to a specific list
							of enumerated Articles of importation, all heavily laden with duties,
							and pinioned with an export bond, and ransomed with an export-duty of 4
							1/2 or 5 per Cent. How was it possible for us to throw wide open all the
							Gates, while they only half-opened one door? He said the expression was
							rather strong. But that the common object of the Act of Parliament and
							of the Act of Congress was to open the intercourse upon liberal terms of
							reciprocity— That the Act of Congress in its Spirit contemplated a
							correspondent indulgence to every such provision in the Act of
							Parliament— Whether yet further accommodations to the trade could be
							hereafter granted might be a subject of negotiation, or of further
							Legislation; but in the meantime, it appeared consonant to our own
							interest to yield specific counterpart for every favour extended to our
							vessels by the Act of Parliament, and as that subjected neither our
							vessels, nor the merchanize imported in them, to any duties, to which
							British vessels, and the same articles imported in them are not also
							liable. In the Spirit of Both Acts, British vessels and their
							importations here are fairly entitled to the same advantages as our own;
							and if not now granted, would give them hereafter a fair claim for
							indemnity to the full extent in which they may be withheld. I said that
							was what we could not admit— The Act of Parliament was an Act of
							voluntary Legislation on the part of Great-Britain, passed with
							reference to her own interest, and requiring nothing of us as obligatory
							in return— We were indeed disposed to meet it, in a Spirit of
							liberality, and even to go further; but we must judge of its liberality
							to us, from the practical result of its operation, and not from the
							specific purport of its provisions. For real reciprocity and equal
							competition we <pb type="ms" n="404"/>we are prepared; but not for
							dispositions reciprocal by the Letter, and one sided in their effect.—
							He said that the restriction of importations to West-Indian Articles
							from the West-Indies and to North-American Articles from North-America
							had no counterpart in the British Act of Parliament— The Act of
							Parliament admitted vessels from all parts of the United States with
							productions of any part— A vessel from Boston for example, could carry
							the produce of Virginia or of Louisiana and vice-versa— But the
							Proclamation considered the British Colonies in the West-Indies as one
							Country, and the British Colonies in North-America as another— The
							British Government, might as well discriminate between the Northern and
							the Southern State— The British Act considered all the Countries under
							the same Government as one— We divided the Colonies into two Classes,
							and refused to receive the productions of one Class from the Ports of
							the other— I replied that this restriction though not identical as a
							specific counterpart to theirs was corresponding to it as to the effect—
							They admitted us only to enumerated Ports— They admitted only enumerated
							articles— They loaded those Articles with almost prohibitory duties, and
							excluded from them our principal Articles of trade adapted to the
							market. Our counter restriction is not by enumeration either of Articles
							or of places, but by classification of both— The British Colonies in the
							West-Indies, and in North-America, are to all purposes of commerce and
							Navigation Countries as different from each other as Portugal and
							Sweden— They are under a government totally different in relation to our
							intercourse with them from that of Great Britain. As a specific
							counterpart to their restrictions here we might admit them only to a few
							of our Ports, we might admit only enumerated Articles, and exclude Rum
							or Sugar from the list— Instead of this we exclude West Indian Articles
							from North America, and North American Articles from the West-Indies—
							The effect, is a counter-restriction—The difference is only of form— He
							left the Note with me, rather he said as a memorandum, which he might
							perhaps wish hereafter to revise— He then asked if we had received the
							Convention concluded at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg about
							the Slaves— We had not, though we have advice of <persRef
								ref="pinkney-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Pinkney</persRef>, the Secretary of the Legation’s having sailed
							with it on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of July— He asked if we
							had not received a copy of the Convention— I said we had; but it was
							from England, through <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>. I enquired if he was
							informed whether it had been ratified in England, he said he had not. I
							told him M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had been informed that it
							was in a process of Ratification; and remarked upon the extraordinary
							Solemnity which the lawyers in England considered as essential to the
							Act fixing the Great Seal to an instrument, exemplified in the scruples
							of <persRef ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Adams</persRef> at Ghent, whether the Treaty of Peace, could be
							executed in triplicates— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning finally
							mentioned again the Reports of the Commissioners under the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the Treaty of Ghent. The
							disagreement of the Commissioners is as to the place of the Highlands
							which divide the rivers flowing into the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Lawrence from the waters that fall into the Atlantic Ocean: and they
							differ by a space of more than a hundred miles— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning said that on his late excursion, he had accidentally
							met with a Geographer of this Country, who without knowing him, had very
							strongly confirmed the opinion of the British Commissioner <persRef
								ref="barclay-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Barclay</persRef>. For in looking over one of the Geographer’s Maps
							of that region; he Canning had pointed at the place where the American
							Commissioner pronounced the highlands to be; and said, why there must be
							hills along here; upon which the Geography had said—Oh! No! Nothing of
							the kind there— I smiled, and said I fansied that must have been an
							English Geographer— He did not deny it, but said he believed <persRef
								ref="melish-john">Mellish</persRef> himself was an Englishman— I
							then asked him whether it was probable we could negotiate, for a
							successful adjustment of that line? Why—what were we disposed to-do?
							Then said I—you want a road between your two Provinces, do you not?—
							Yes— Well, said I <pb type="ms" n="405"/>we will treat on this basis—
							You shall have the road, and give us an equivalent accommodation in
							Territory— He appeared thus far satisfied; but had not yet received his
							instructions from England; authorizing him to proceed in the
							Negotiation— Evening at Chess with <persRef key="smith-william-steuben"

							a prize Crew, of a dutch Vessel, prize to a Spanish privateer, retaken

							the United States Circuit Court at Charleston South Carolina—to which
							Anduaga adds a long enumeration of other complaints of hostile armaments
							against Spain in our Ports, overlooked or connived at by the Government
							of the United States— As to the first of these Notes, I observed to the
							President that there was no existing tribunal which could take
							cognizance of those cases; and suggested to him the expediency of
							proposing to Congress the institution of such a tribunal, which he said
							he would— As to the other Note, the President, felt some indignation at
							the tone in which it was written, and thought that in the reply it would
							be proper to make a full statement of all the piracies upon our Commerce
							recently committed by vessels under Spanish Colours. The charge against
							Elton must be examined into. I left with the President <persRef
