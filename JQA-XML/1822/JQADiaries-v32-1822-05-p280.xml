						<p><date>1. V:30.</date><persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Trumbull</persRef> came this morning
							with information that the Appropriation Bill had passed, and requested a
							warrant for his money, in payment for his third picture— I referred him
							to the Department to have the Warrant prepared, which I afterwards
							signed and he departed. <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef>, a member of the
							House of Representatives from Massachusetts called on me, having heard
							something of these transactions, relating to <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Russell’s</persRef> Letters— I told him all
							that had passed concerning them and that I found myself in the most
							painful situation of my whole life; compelled to renounce all private
							and friendly intercourse, with a man whom I had esteemed, and with whom
							I had been associated in a trust of the highest public importance, the
							result of which had been satisfactory to the <pb type="ms" n="281"
							/>Nation, and to expose him to shame in the face of the Country. This
							had never happened to me with any other man. But Russell had brought it
							upon himself. He had not only obtruded himself and me upon the floor of
							Congress, to charge me with treachery to a great public trust; but he
							had wantonly made me the official vehicle to convey that charge against
							myself. And such was the nature of the charge, that if the Letter gave a
							true representation of the facts which it alleged, it would in my
							opinion be the duty of the House of Representatives, even now to impeach
							the surviving members of the majority of the Ghent Mission. It was
							therefore absolutely indispensable for me to defend myself; which I
							could not do without exposing him— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fuller that he was the only member of Congress to whom I had spoken upon
							the subject— I was aware of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Russell’s
							present situation as a member of the House, and wished in no wise any
							other member to take side with me against him— But the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> hesitated whether to send
							Russell’s Letters to the House, in answer to their call; or to withhold
							them. I had requested him to send them, with my remarks upon them—
							Perhaps he might send them without my remarks— In that case I should
							address a Letter to the <persRef ref="barbour-philip">Speaker of the
								House</persRef>, requesting their permission to lay my remarks
							before them— My wish was that if the President should in any manner
							refer the production of the Letters to the discretion of the House, some
							member would move another call for the papers— If <persRef
								ref="floyd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd</persRef>, the
							original mover for the Ghent papers, and then for Russell’s Letter
							should move for them again, or M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell,
							or any of his friends, I wished that every friend of mine would support
							the motion— If as I thought it not unlikely the original movers and
							Russell himself should now hang back, I wished some other member would
							move the Call— I did not ask it of him unless it would be entirely
							agreeable to him; nor unless it should appear that no other member made
							the motion of his own accord. I was only desirous that if the papers
							should be withheld, it should be known that it was not at my desire, nor
							from any purpose of screening me from disclosure— Fuller said he would
							pay due attention to the subject— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward
								Wyer</persRef> came to tell me, of a controversy between D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Floyd, and <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef>, who is now here— Floyd in his place two or
							three days since, observing that he would say nothing there but what he
							would equally say out of the house, made a pretty direct charge upon
							Scott, of <hi rend="italic">forgery</hi>, though not so explicitly, but
							that the imputation might rest between Scott and the War Department—
								<persRef ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Stevenson</persRef> of Virginia undertook to
							give an explanatory vindication of Scott, upon enquiry into the facts—
							Scott sent <persRef ref="wool-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Wool</persRef>, with two Notes to Floyd, one asking an explanation,
							and the other, contingent upon the refusal of that containing a
							challenge— Wool upon conversing with Floyd, delivered neither of the
							Notes; Floyd having said that he would give his explanation through
							Archer— Wyer said that Scott was not satisfied with this; nor with Wool
							for omitting to deliver his Notes; but that he would yet have
							satisfaction. <persRef ref="wilcocks-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wilcocks</persRef> came again to the Office, and I gave
							him the Letter and packages prepared for <persRef ref="herrera-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Herrera</persRef>, the Minister
							of foreign Affairs of Mexico; but Wilcocks said he should not venture to
							go there without the Commission as Consul General; which the President
							has determined not to give for the present. The Bill appropriating
							100000 dollars for Missions to South-America, passed the Senate
							yesterday, without opposition. It had passed the day before to the third
							reading, with only three dissenting voices—<persRef ref="lloyd-edward"
								>Lloyd</persRef> of Maryland, <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel"
								>Macon</persRef> of North, and <persRef ref="smith-william2"
								>Smith</persRef> of South-Carolina. <persRef ref="jesup-thomas"
								>General Jessup</persRef> called and took leave of me; going to
							Cincinnati, Ohio— There was a Cabinet Meeting at the President’s, all
							present, excepting <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wirt</persRef>, the Attorney-General, who is at
							Baltimore. The Subject under consideration was the last Note from the
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, the French Minister and its proposals relative
							to a Convention concerning discriminating duties. I had proposed to him
							a discriminating duty <pb type="ms" n="282"/>of two per Cent on the
							value of merchandize imported, to be levied in France upon importations
							in American, and here upon those in French vessels— He accepts this with
							a conditional proviso that it shall not upon any one vessel amount to
							less than 21 or more than 26. franks— He also proposes as an alternative
							a duty of 20 franks upon the laden ton, with the further proviso, that
							it shall be levied only upon the excess of importations beyond the
							exportations in the same vessel— This has an appearance as if it looked
							to an ultimate abandonment of all discriminating duties; and the Baron
							in his Note holds it out, as if it was offered in the Spirit of
							abounding liberality— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							both seemed much pleased with it; but I thought it would require an
							exception for articles imported for re-exportation— With this M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford explicitly concurred— It was
							agreed that the proposal of a discriminating duty of four dollars a
							laden ton should be accepted. There was little discussion, and little
							difference of opinion expressed; except as here mentioned; and that I
							had some reluctance to admit so heavy a discriminating duty, as four
							dollars— After the other members of the administration had withdrawn,
							the President told me that he had made up his mind to send both M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s Letters to the House in answer
							to their Call— That it would be of no use to withhold them, as they
							would undoubtedly come before the Public; and he might as well give them
							at once— I concurred entirely in that opinion, and told the President,
							that upon reflecting further on the subject, and with a view to relieve
							him even from every semblance of co-operation with me, I would withdraw
							the request, that he would send my remarks to the House with the
							Letters— If he would send them in, I would address a Letter to the
							Speaker of the House, requesting their permission, to submit my remarks
							upon the Letters, to them— To this I understood the President that he
							was now fully agreed. I was occupied morning, and evening in making the
							draft of the remarks.</p>

					<div type="docbody">
						<p><date>2. V:15.</date> I received this morning a Note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> a Note requesting me to call
							at his house, which I did; with a draft of a Report to him upon <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Russell’s</persRef> Duplicate, omitting the
							request that he would communicate my remarks upon it to the House. And I
							read to him the draft of a Letter which I had prepared to the <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Speaker of the House</persRef> requesting their
							permission to submit my remarks upon the Letters of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell to them. He advised me not to send
							my Letter with his Message, but within an hour afterwards; which I told
							him was precisely my intention. But I found him now wavering again upon
							the question whether he should send in Russell’s Letters and inclining
							to that draft of a Message, which was his second thought; and which
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> had approved. That is, stating the facts, and my
							request to be heard in answer to Russell’s Letter, and referring to the
							House whether they would under these views of the subject again call for
							the Letter, promising in that case to send it. I was willing he should
							take this course; being well assured that the call of the House would be
							renewed. I returned to the Office, and soon after received a Note from
							the President, asking me to prepare a Report to him on Russell’s Letters
							adapted to a Message, stating the facts and withholding both the
							Letters— I called at his House again, and without discussing the subject
							with him any farther, observed that the Report which I had prepared
							would suit either of the forms of his Message, but if he should decline
							sending the Letters, or if he should mention my request that he would
							transmit my remarks with them to the house, though I had withdrawn that
							request, and omitted it from the Report last made to him, it would no
							longer be necessary for me to write to the Speaker, requesting the
							permission of the House to submit my remarks upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s Letter to them— In no
							transaction have I ever seen so much indecision, and so many
							fluctuations of intentions in the President as in this— He has time
							after time told me that he considered Russell’s conduct throughout the
							whole transaction as extremely reprehensible— That he had no doubt he
							was acting in concert with <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="floyd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd</persRef>, and
							that their object was to work upon the prejudices of a certain portion
							of the Union, with a view to influence <pb type="ms" n="283"/>future
							elections— That as to the proposed Article to confirm the right of the
							British to navigate the Mississippi, neither he nor <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>, had ever considered it as a violation of our
							Instructions, nor as in the slightest degree affecting injuriously the
							interests of the Western Country— But from the moment of the detection
							of Russell’s falsification of his own Letter, the President’s aim has
							been to screen him from exposure, or at least to have no participation
							in effecting it. Mine has been to bring the whole subject before
							Congress, and before the Nation— Not from choice, or for a vindictive
							purpose against Russell; but as indispensably necessary to my
							self-defence against his conspiracy with Floyd and Clay— <persRef
								ref="smith-joseph2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Joseph L.
								Smith</persRef> who has been appointed one of the judges in Florida,
							under the new Act called this day at the Office for his Commission— As I
							was going the second time to the President’s I met at the bottom of the
							Stairs of my Office, <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> R. King</persRef> Senator from New-York;—there were sent
							in to Congress yesterday two Messages, from the President, one relating
							to the Norwegian discriminating duties, and the other to the duties on
							rolled and hammered iron; the first at the desire of <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef>; and the second
							at that of <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King
							came to ask me to go to the Capitol to-morrow morning to meet the
							Committee of Foreign Relations of the Senate, to converse with them,
							upon the Norwegian proposal of a total abolition of all discriminating
							duties; which he said there would be great difficulty in agreeing to. I
							told him we had not expected that Congress would agree to it, and I had
							told Baron Stackelberg there was no prospect that Congress would accede
							to it. But as it could be done only by Congress, he had urged so
							earnestly urged that it should be submitted to their Consideration by
							the President, that he had consented to send in the Message. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King said that being understood it would
							not be necessary for me to meet the Committee to-morrow. He asked if
							there would be any nominations to these South American Missions before
							the close of this Session of Congress— I believed not— He said there had
							been some question in the Senate, as to the right of the President to
							make any original appointment during the recess of Congress. I told him
							I was aware of that— But the President had no doubt, with regard to such
							appointments as of Offices not created by Congress, but existing by the
							Laws of Nations. King said, that the confirmation of any such
							appointment by the Senate, would depend much upon the individual named—
							If the person should be popular, he would be confirmed— If a cripple, or
							a favourite should be sent, he would upon nomination be rejected. This
							question was very much discussed at the Cabinet Meeting yesterday and
							had been so once before. It is one of those questions which <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and his partizans
							are conjuring up to make strife between the President and the
							Legislature. Crawford’s own conduct concerning it in the Cabinet is
							ambidextrous— On the question as it concerns domestic appointments, he
							has taken decided part against the President’s authority— With regard to
							appointments abroad, he talks as if he considered the President as
							having the power but avoids committing himself upon that opinion— He
							really wants the President to make the appointments during the recess,
							so that it may make another quarrel between him and the Senate, in which
							he Crawford may side again with the Senate— These are the tactics of
							Crawford’s ambition— As <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							stands now most in his way, the great burden of his exertions, this
							Session, and the last has been against the War Department. While Calhoun
							by his haste to get at the Presidency has made a cabal in his favour in
							Congress, to counteract Crawford’s cabal, and the Session has been
							little more than a violent struggle between them; both however
							countenancing the insidious attacks upon the Secretary of State. The
							Government is thus becoming daily with more and more decision a mere
							prize for two unprincipled factions, of which Crawford’s has at the
							present moment the fairest prospect of success— The President has
							hitherto supported Calhoun, to the extent of committing his own judgment
							upon two most questionable public measures— The Dauphin Island
							fortifications, and the Army appointments of last Summer. The Cabinet
							Discussions between Crawford and Calhoun, have become painful, by <pb
								type="ms" n="284"/>the tone in which they express their
							opinions—being that of suppressed hatred and subdued anger. This Evening
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef> returned home, from
								<persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Major Roberdeau’s</persRef>— I was
							still deeply engaged.</p>

						<p><date>3. V:</date><persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi

							Son in Law, and private Secretary called this morning at my House, with
							the Message concerning <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell’s</persRef> Letters which he was taking to the House of
							Representatives. It was that which was the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> second thought—stating the fact of Russell’s
							having left the duplicate at the Department of State, for communication
							to the House; of his the President’s having found among his papers the
							original, which was marked “Private” by Russell himself; and of my
							request that he would communicate my remarks upon Russell’s Letter, with
							it to the House—and then declining to send the Letter, unless the House
							on a view of all these Circumstances should repeat the Call, in which
							case it will be communicated, with my Report upon the duplicate. He had
							also a nomination of <persRef ref="dearborn-henry">General Henry
								Dearborn Senior</persRef>, as Minister to Portugal, which he took to
							the Senate— The President has within the last three days several times
							consulted me about this nomination, to which I have told him it was
							impossible for me to object— It is certainly not a nomination that I
							should have suggested; believing as I do that a younger man, and one
							whose life has been more conversant with commercial affairs, would have
							been better suited to this Mission. The President’s motives for this
							appointment are however laudable. The first was to do honour to an
							Officer of the Revolution— The second to serve a personal friend, and
							also to gratify as he told me, the wish of <persRef ref="dearborn-sarah"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dearborn</persRef>. A third was
							to compensate for having yielded to the pressure of <persRef
								ref="king-william">W. King</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="chandler-john;holmes-john" type="multi">Maine
								Senators</persRef>, against all the remonstrances of the Dearborn
							interest, in the appointment of <persRef ref="ware-asher">Ashur
								Ware</persRef> as District Judge in Maine. This was I believe the
							deciding principle; for he told me with a good deal of feeling that he
							meant those Gentlemen should be made sensible that he was not entirely
							in their hands— And what a whimsical play of political machinery it is;
							because a district judge in Maine is indecently crowded upon the
							President by the Maine Senators, he takes his revenge, by mortifying
							them in the appointment of a Minister to Portugal— The day was absorbed
							by a succession of visitors at my house and at the Office. <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>5. V:30.</date> Heard <persRef ref="staughton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Staughton</persRef> this Morning at
							the Baptist Church; from 1. Kings 3.5. “Ask what I shall give thee”— The
							divine Communication to Solomon— It was an eloquent discourse, and the
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> has an original turn of thought;
							though with a manner some what affected. The house, a very small one,
							was crowded. After Church, I gave the Doctor, the recommendatory Letters
							for <persRef ref="staughton-james">his Son</persRef>. I returned by Card
							at <persRef ref="strother-john">Strother’s</persRef> the visit of
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> walked home with me; and told me
							the sequel of the affair between Scott and <persRef ref="floyd-john"
								>Floyd</persRef>. The latter has totally unsaid his charge of
							forgery against Scott, and by implication but not explicitly from the
							War Department— There was a remarkable alteration made in a Book of
							General Scott’s, adopted last year by Congress, as Regulations for the
							army, so that the Book used at the War Department differed from that
							printed under the Act of Congress. The mistake has not been fully
							explained, but seems imputable to some inattention, in the Military
							Committee of the House of Representatives: but all the questions
							concerning the legality of the army appointments last Summer, are
							closely connected with one of the alterations— The Senate have again
							rejected the nominations of <persRef ref="towson-nathan">Col<hi

								ref="gadsden-james">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							acted upon in either House, but such as has already passed through the
							other. The second, that no Bill shall be presented to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> for his signature the last
							day of the Session— As they are to adjourn next Wednesday, yesterday was
							the last day of acting upon business in each House, on which the other

						<p><pb type="ms" n="286"/><date>6. V:</date> Went with <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> at nine this morning to see the
							first experiment of <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore
								Rogers’s</persRef> invention for cradling Ships of War. I had seen
							the experiment on a small model at the Office of the Navy Commissioners,
							9 Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1820. It was now tried upon the
							Frigate Potowmack, lately launched— There were a multitude of
							Spectators, among whom many members of Congress. The experiment had
							every prospect of success, and the vessel was already drawn partly out
							of the water, when a part of the cordage, by which it was hawled gave
							way, and knocked down <persRef ref="brent-w">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> William Brent</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="brent-henry">his Son</persRef>, a boy of 12 years of age, and
							broke the leg of the boy— The vessel was so secured that this accident
							had no further consequences; but the conclusion of the experiment must
							be deferred. I met at the Yard <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef>, to whom I spoke of
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> Message concerning
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Russell’s</persRef> Letters. I told
							him that my wish continued as I had expressed it to him before— That the
							call should be repeated. I would not ask any member to repeat it,
							because, in the conflict with Russell, in my self-defence, which must
							come before the Public, I asked neither favour nor affection of any one—
							But if any of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s friends in the
							House, <persRef ref="floyd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Floyd</persRef>, who first moved the call for the Letter, or any
							other should move to repeat the Call, I wished it might be known as my
							desire that it should pass; and if they did not, I should be obliged to
							any member who would move for it— Returning from the Navy-Yard I stopped
							at the Capitol, and visited successively both Houses of Congress while
							they were in Session. Several of the members spoke to me on various
							Subjects— Especially the nomination of <persRef ref="dearborn-henry">H.
								Dearborn</persRef>, as Minister to Portugal. <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">Eustis</persRef> told me, he thought the House
							would not make the appropriation for a Minister there the next year—
							Well, said I—then Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dearborn must come
							home. In the Senate, <persRef ref="williams-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Williams</persRef> of Tennessee
							came and shewed me a Letter, which he had received from <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, concerning the pamphlet which
							at Williams’s request I lately sent him— About the Mecklenburg
							Declaration of Independence, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams
							asked me, if I thought my father would have any objection to his sending
							this Letter to <persRef ref="polk-william">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Polk</persRef> of North-Carolina— I said no. But I
							question whether Williams’s views in all this, are either fair or
							honourable— <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R.
								King</persRef> of New-York intimated to me, that the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron de Neuville</persRef> complained
							to him of <hi rend="italic">delays</hi> in his Negotiation; and said he
							had taken great pains to induce him to take part with him against the
							course of the administration; which he had at last most explicitly
							refused— I told him I should take up the negotiation with de Neuville,
							immediately after the close of the Session of Congress; but I believed
							the best prospect of concluding a Convention would be the result of
							manifesting rather indifference than anxiety for it. He said he thought
							it would. He also spoke to me of Russell’s Letter, and said that he
							understood the whole drift and object, of it; and of the proceedings in
							the House of Representatives relating to it, that it was the same System
							of defamation which had been pursued for so many years against <persRef
								ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay</persRef>—and
							which was exposed in the late publication of the Secret Journals of the
							Old Congress. <persRef ref="rodney-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rodney</persRef> spoke to me of Russell’s Letter and of
							its argument that the Treaty of 1783 had been abrogated by the War of
							1812. He said that there had been in the year 1802 a debate in the
							British Parliament, which involved the principle of this question; and
							in which the British Ministers and particularly <persRef
								ref="jenkinson-charles">Lord Hawkesbury</persRef> maintained the
							doctrine that rights stipulated by Treaty were not abrogated by War. He
							also shewed me in the Annual Register of 1800. the Treaty between France
							and Spain, which he had mistaken for the Treaty of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Ildephonso; when in a recent debate in
							the Senate he had said that he thought he had seen this latter Treaty in
							that work.— It was late when I came to the Office— <persRef
								ref="nelson-jeremiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nelson</persRef> a member of the House from Massachusetts came to
							have search made for papers relating to claims before the Florida Treaty

							too, from Baltimore; a candidate for office. <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>7. V:</date> I called this Morning on <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the first Comptroller of the Treasury, to speak
							about the Warrant for the Salaries of the Clerks in the Department of
							State— I told him if he chose to withhold <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
							Salary, on a claim of a balance due from me, when I had a claim of a
							balance due from the Treasury to me, at least <pb type="ms" n="287"
							/>they should not withhold the Salaries of persons, upon whom there was
							no pretence of a claim at the Treasury. He proposed to me to draw a
							warrant for the amount due to the Department, with deduction of the
							portion due to me. I declined this, because it would imply my assent, to
							the withholding of my own Salary. But I told him they might if they
							chose, withhold payment of the portion of the Warrant due to me, and pay
							the rest to which he agreed— I also left with him my Statement of my
							Account, which I told him I wished now to have settled as soon as
							possible— He said he would attend to it, as soon as the pressure of
							business at the close of the Session of Congress would permit. I called
							at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> in the course
							of the morning and left with him the copy of my remarks upon <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Russell’s</persRef> Letters, and a written
							request to him that he would communicate them to the House of
							Representatives, with the Letters on the renewal of the Call. I told him
							that the remarks had necessarily been written in great haste, and if he
							had time to read them, I would readily make any alteration in them that
							he should advise. I found <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J.
								Sergeant</persRef> and <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">Hugh
								Nelson</persRef> with the President, but they immediately withdrew.
							Sergeant told me that <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">Fuller’s</persRef>
							Resolution had passed, with not more than three or four votes against
							it— But <persRef ref="floyd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Floyd</persRef>, the first mover for the Letter, and <persRef
								ref="cocke-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cocke</persRef> had
							objected to the renewal of the Call— On returning from the President’s
							to the Office, a succession of visitors occupied my time till six in the
							Evening. <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="russ-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russ</persRef> member
							of the House from Connecticut, <persRef ref="burton-hutchins"
								>Burton</persRef> from North-Carolina, <persRef ref="newton-thomas"
								>Newton</persRef> from Virginia, and Fuller of Massachusetts came
							and took leave— Newton was in high Spirits— The Session had begun with
							Meetings of the People of Virginia his immediate Constituents, a Message
							from the <persRef ref="randolph-thomas">Governor of Virginia</persRef>
							to the Legislature and various other movements in the South against our
							Navigation Acts, which he had always supported. He was Chairman of the
							Committee of Commerce, and was called by his duty to report upon the
							Memorials of his Constituents and others— He remained inflexibly firm,
							and reported most decisively in support of the Laws. It is now
							ascertained that the British Government itself has determined to yield
							at least partially in this controversy, and that Bills have been brought
							into Parliament for opening their West-India trade to our shipping. The
							opposition of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford’s</persRef> partizans to the Navigation Acts, has been
							totally silenced for this Session; and to complete Newton’s triumph, I
							received a few days since from <persRef key="rush-richard">R.
								Rush</persRef>, dated 9. March, mentioning that he had been informed
							the Ministry after having determined to present a plan to Parliament for
							opening to us the West-India trade, had suspended this determination,
							upon receiving information of the popular Meetings and Memorials here
							against our Navigation Acts. Newton asked me for an extract from this
							despatch which I gave him— Fuller had brought with him a copy of the
							Resolution of the House calling for Russell’s Letter, and for any
							Communication from any other of the Ministers of the Ghent Mission upon
							the same subject— It was certified by the Clerk, who had promised Fuller
							that he would officially deliver a copy of it to the President in the
							course of the day. Fuller took the copy that he had with him to the
							President— <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef> came likewise to the Office, and had a
							long conversation with me upon various topics as usual— He had a draft
							of a despatch to his Government giving an account of the last
							Conversation between him and me, when he told me that the British
							Government approving altogether the grounds upon which their <persRef
								ref="barclay-thomas">Commissioner Barclay</persRef> had acted in his
							difference with <persRef ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef>,
							nevertheless, from a conciliatory disposition, they had authorised
							Barclay to agree to the Report, which will leave the three Islands in
							question within the bounds of the United States. When M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning told me this, I had assured him
							that I should make it known to the President, who, I was well assured
							would see in it an Evidence of a conciliatory disposition in the British
							Government, a disposition which he would very sincerely reciprocate— But
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning in his despatch had
							represented me as having said that the President would consider it as a
								<hi rend="italic">concession</hi>, on the part of Great-Britain, to
							which the American Government would on a proper occasion yield a
							suitable return, which he said was the English for the term reciprocate,
							which <pb type="ms" n="288"/>I had used. Without noticing his criticism
							upon the term reciprocate (which is a genuine English word, as you may
							find by consulting <persRef ref="johnson-samuel">Johnson’s</persRef>
							dictionary.) I said he had in his translation of it, given it a sense
							rather more extensive than I had intended in using it. I did not mean to
							say that the President would consider this order of the British
							Government as opening an account current of concessions in which these
							three Islands were to be an item debited to the United States, to be
							paid for hereafter by some concession of equal value on their part— The
							reciprocity which I had promised for the President was of conciliatory
							dispositions; of which he would consider this order as a manifestation.
							But we did not receive it as a concession, but as the mere waiver of an
							unfounded claim; being convinced that Great-Britain has yielded nothing
							by it, but what we should have obtained by an award of the arbitrator.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning very earnestly contested this
							point, but finally took the draft of his despatch, and said he was glad
							he had shewn it to me before sending it, as he would not misrepresent
							any thing that I said to him— He also complained that the Message to
							Congress relating to the duties on rolled and hammered iron, had been
							sent in to Congress so late in the Session that they could not act upon
							it—particularly as he had written to request it before the commencement
							of the Session. I said that the real cause of the delay had been the
							unremitting pressure of the public business through the whole Session,
							and the probability that it could not have been taken up; even if it had
							been sent in on the first day of the Session— There had been two
							Subjects before Congress for consideration with which this subject might
							have been connected, and only two— One was certain Resolutions moved by
								<persRef ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef>— The other a Bill for revising the Tariff,
							proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means— Congress had not found time
							to act upon either of them; and if this subject had been brought before
							them separately, they would probably have rejected the alteration
							desired— He said he had entertained better hopes, from conversations
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin of the House, and <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef> of
							the Senate. I replied that as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin had
							been the principal antagonist of the measure in the House heretofore and
							as he understood more of the merits of the question, than perhaps any
							other member of the House, and there was reason to expect that he would
							withdraw his opposition, it might perhaps pass the House, but a member
							of the Senate had told me yesterday that he thought it would be rejected
							there. At this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning seemed to be much
							surprised— I told him that the case appeared by no means clear, even to
							the Executive Government, that rolled and hammered iron were the same
							thing. That France had very recently made a discrimination between them—
							That the President had been willing to give the most liberal
							Construction to the Convention; and that if between this and the next
							Session of Congress, the trade between us and the British West-Indies
							should be opened by Parliament, as there was now a prospect that it
							would be, perhaps a more liberal disposition would prevail in the
							Senate, and a better prospect of their consenting to remove the
							discrimination between the duties on the two kinds of iron. He said he
							would communicate to his Government these observations— After dinner I
							called at the President’s, and found him going to the Capitol— I rode
							with him and <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gouverneur</persRef>, who had the Message to the House
							with Russell’s two Editions of his Letter and my remarks upon them— He
							immediately delivered the Message to the House— The papers were not
							read; but ordered to be laid upon the table, and to be printed. Before
							we left the President’s House, he put into my hand a paper proposing
							three or four very slight alterations, which he suggested should be
							made, to my Remarks upon Russell’s Letters; all of which I immediately
							made— They were merely harsh expressions which in the hurry of writing,
							and the indignation at the baseness of Russell’s conduct in this attack
							upon my character and reputation, had escaped me. The President had not
							himself read my paper, the pressure of other business being so great:
							but <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
								Hay</persRef> had read it, as he told me; very attentively; having
							already perused both Russell’s Letters; the real and the spurious one.
							He had marked the passages which the President proposed to me to alter,
							the whole not amounting to six lines; he said my paper was so
							unanswerable in substance that the less there was of severity in the
							manner the more powerful would be its effect— For setting aside entirely
							Russell’s <pb type="ms" n="289"/>misconduct through the whole business,
							on the mere discussion of the public question at issue my paper was both
							for fact and argument the most overwhelming thing that he had ever read.
							I told him that I only wished he had marked more passages for
							alteration, and that if there had been time, I had intended to have
							requested him to examine the paper deliberately and rigorously with a
							view to expunging or altering any objectionable passage— At the Capitol
							we found <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef>— And the
							President remained there till past eleven at Night, examining and
							signing between fifty and sixty Bills. At intervals of time, I went into
							the Hall of the House of Representatives, where they were in the usual
							state of dissolution, of the last Evening of a Session. We left the two
							Houses still sitting, and the President took me home in his
							Carriage.</p>

						<p><date>8. VI:30.</date> Close of the first Session of the Seventeenth
							Congress— The House of Representatives adjourned to meet this Morning at
							six O’Clock; but they could not form a Quorum; and the Senate had
							adjourned to meet at ten— I called before that hour at the <persRef

							concerned at a statement, which appeared in the last Evening’s
							Washington City Gazette; importing though in equivocal terms that
								<persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fuller’s</persRef> Resolution calling for <persRef

								<persRef ref="dougherty-thomas">Clerk of the House</persRef> had not
							yet furnished him the Official copy of it— I told him that the statement
							in the Gazette was erroneous and asked him if he had the National
							Intelligencer of this Morning. He sent for it and found it stated that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller’s Resolution had been adopted
							by the House, after a Conversation between M<hi rend="superscript"

									>r</hi> Floyd</persRef> and <persRef ref="cocke-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cocke</persRef>, on the propriety of
							calling again for a paper which the President had already once declined
							to send— The President remarked that this statement was incorrect— He
							had not declined to send the Letter, but referred it to the House to
							decide whether upon a view of all the Circumstances they would chuse to
							call for it.— After some detention at my Office, I went to the Capitol—
							The President was there—as were Mess<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs.</hi><persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef>. By the new joint rule of
							the two houses, no Bill can be presented to the President for his
							signature, on the last day of the Session. But this was not understood
							to include Bills which passed last Evening, after he left the Capitol—
							The Senate were chiefly engaged upon executive business—passing upon
							nominations to Office. There was in circulation a copy of a Letter from
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> to <persRef ref="ruggles-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruggles</persRef>, the Senator from

							in the case of <persRef ref="cohen-m;cohen-p" type="multi"
								>Cohens</persRef>— <persRef ref="hay-george">G. Hay</persRef> at
							first thought it not genuine; and afterwards said it was unworthy of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson. Thompson said every word
							in it contained in it a volume of meaning. Crawford avoided giving an
							opinion upon it; but spoke of another argumentative Letter of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s on the same Subject; and said
							he could agree with the doctrine contained in it according to such
							Construction as he should give to certain passages in it— Calhoun said
							it was a most extraordinary Letter. Every one of these Gentlemen, spoke
							with side-glances towards popular prejudices. Calhoun spoke to me with
							great bitterness of the proceedings of both houses of Congress at the
							present Session, and especially of the conduct of the <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Speaker</persRef>— I said to him, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, you may thank yourself for it
							all— You and you alone, made M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour
							Speaker—and I trust you have not forgotten, how earnestly, I intreated
							you, merely not to prevent the re-election of <persRef ref="taylor-john"
								>Taylor</persRef>, who had offered friendship, and good-will to the
							Administration, and who would have kept his word— He said he remembered
							it, aid he now believed Taylor would have been friendly— But he had been
							much otherwise before— Well, said I; you succeeded in turning him out;
							and you have got one ten times worse in his stead. He said there had
							never been such a state of things in this Government before. I did not
							pursue the Conversation. <pb type="ms" n="290"/>I spoke to Dougherty,
							the Clerk of the House of Representatives, about the Resolution of the
							House, calling for Russell’s Letter &amp;c. of which I told him the
							President had not received the Official copy. He had forgotten it, but
							sent one in the course of the morning— I told <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> that his Reporter had stated
							incorrectly the Conversation upon the passage of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fuller’s Resolution, which he did not admit; and said he had
							happened to take the minutes of that whole debate himself and should
							publish it entire— I said that was precisely what I wished—but in the
							mean-time the statement in this morning’s paper was in correct. Fuller
							himself also spoke to Gales about it and he promised to rectify the
							error— I was some time in the House, which was in a manner breaking up—
							They adjourned from 12 till 2 O’Clock— And in the interval <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Macon</persRef>, of the Senate and <persRef ref="hill-mark">M. L.
								Hill</persRef>, one of the three Committee-men from the House, came
							with the usual Message to the President, that the two Houses were ready

							said he had not. The President then immediately went home—and I returned
							to my Office till dinnertime— In the Evening <persRef

							called this morning at my house, and informed me that the experiment of
							cradling the frigate Potowmack, would be resumed this morning at eleven
							O’Clock, and invited me to attend— I went first to my Office, where
								<persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef>, member from
							Illinois, called and took leave— He was proceeding on his way homeward.—
							He told me that he had heard that during the latter part of the Session
							of Congress, <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">Governor Edwards</persRef>
							the Senator from Illinois, had ranged himself among the partizans of
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>, for the succession to the Presidency. He said he
							had spoken to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards about it, he had
							denied the fact; but Cook intimated that he nevertheless believed it to
							be true— But he said that as to the vote of the State, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards well knew it would not be for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun; nor for any Southern man. Cook
							last Summer, married <persRef ref="cook-julia">Edwards’s
								daughter</persRef>. Until this Session of Congress, Edwards has
							constantly held himself out to me, as peculiarly and earnestly my
							friend— He has this Session sought no occasion of conversing with me,
							and I have no doubt has chained himself to the Car of Calhoun. As the
							time of that Election approaches it becomes daily more apparent, that
							the Election will be a contest between two factions in Congress, which
							is now an open market for the purchase of votes. The two Houses of
							Congress are the Pretorian Guards, who will in substance if not in form
							set up the Empire at Auction— It has been nearly so once before. Were it
							consistent with my principles to work for my own advancement any
							otherwise than by public service, it is now too late for me to commence
							bidding for the Presidency— Neither have I any faculty at driving such
							bargains— I told Cook that I thought it impossible the present Executive
							Administration should hold together through another Session of Congress—
							It is now nothing but a system of mining and countermining between
							Crawford and Calhoun; to blow up each other; and a continual underhanded
							working of both jointly against me, which has been the more effective,
							because I have neither creature nor champion in either house of
							Congress. At this game, Crawford is a much superior artist to Calhoun,
							whose hurried Ambition will probably ruin himself and secure the triumph
							of Crawford— Such is the present prospect— There was a <persRef
								ref="mauri-evariste">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Evariste
								Mauri</persRef>, who by dint of importunities and of
							recommendations, particularly from <persRef ref="stokes-montfort">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stokes</persRef>, the Senator from
							North-Carolina, had obtained a nomination as Consul at Syracuse— The
							Senate rejected the nomination. He came this morning to solicit an
							appointment of agent somewhere—Some informal appointment to which the
							sanction of the Senate would not be necessary.— This I assured him could
							not be done. <pb type="ms" n="291"/>I went with <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> to the Navy-yard, where the
							experiment of Commodore Rogers’s <unclear>. . .</unclear>tion was
							resumed. Met there, the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>,
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Crawford, Calhoun, <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef>, and some others. We
							remained there about two hours— The experiment proceeded successfully,
							but the movement of the vessel, as drawn up on an inclined plane out of
							the water was slow, and the cradling was not completed this day.
								<persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> came home with me, and I returned to my Office—
							Then called at the President’s where I met M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun. A <persRef ref="doolittle-unknown">M<hi

								>President’s</persRef> two Messages to the House concerning <persRef

							lost his Notes, which he said had never happened to him but once before,
							of the debate or Conversation upon Russell’s Letter’s on Fuller’s
							Resolution to call for them— So that Gales cannot perform his promise of
							publishing that debate in extenso. The remarkable part of it was that
								<persRef ref="floyd-john">Floyd</persRef>, who had first moved for
							the residue of the Ghent Negotiation papers, and then specially for
							Russell’s Letter, and who but a few days since manifested great
							impatience to get the Letter, now opposed the call for it— Upon his
							first motion for the Ghent papers, he had pretended to want them, to
							ascertain whether there was any thing in them that bore upon his
							projected Settlement at the mouth of Columbia river— He did not make the
							same pretence in moving for Russell’s Letter, because it was evident
							from the short Letter of 25. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> from
							Russell, communicated with the Ghent Documents, and upon the hint of
							which Floyd moved his second Call, that Russell’s Letter from Paris
							could have no possible bearing upon the Columbia river Settlement— But
							now, when <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">Fuller</persRef> moved that the
							call should be repeated, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd objected
							to it, saying that he found from the President’s Message that the Letter

						<p><date>13. V:15.</date><persRef ref="eaton-john">J. H. Eaton</persRef>,
							the Senator from Tennessee came this morning to my Office, and requested
							to see the papers concerning the complaints against <persRef
								ref="purdy-robert">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Purdy</persRef>
							Marshal of West Tennessee; by two of his Assistants in taking the
								Census—<persRef ref="goodlet-unknown">Goodlet</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="childress-unknown">Childress</persRef>.— I shewed him all the
							papers, and told him what had passed upon the complaints transmitted to
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> through <persRef
								ref="cannon-newton">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Cannon</persRef>— Purdy as Marshal wrote to me, requesting to be
							paid his account in paper equivalent to specie, alleging the express
							purpose of doing thereby justice to his assistants, and testifying that
							they had all faithfully done their duty. He was accordingly paid in
							paper equivalent to specie— But Goodlet and Childress complain that he
							paid them in depreciated Tennessee Bank paper, and retained to himself a
							part of the compensation allowed by Law to them. There are very strong
							testimonials from some of the most respectable people in Tennessee, in
							favour of Purdy, and Eaton, has a great regard for him— I told him that
							the President would have all possible deference for these
							recommendations and all possible delicacy and indulgence towards
							Purdy—but that in this affair he stood self-condemned, by his Letter to
							me demanding specie payment of his account— It was impossible to uphold
							him against these complaints; for if the President should disregard
							them, the sufferers would bring them before Congress by petition, and
							the whole transaction, would thus be disclosed— Eaton upon reading over
							the papers acknowledged that Purdy had been wrong, but requested that
							the President would take no decisive measure in the case, until after I
							should hear from him Eaton, upon his return to Tennessee, and that if
							finally the President should think it necessary to dismiss Purdy, he
							might be allowed the opportunity of resigning; both of which I promised—
								<persRef ref="parker-daniel">General Parker</persRef> came and
							enquired, if there was any vacant employment under the direction of the
							Department of State, to which he could be appointed— There is no such
							vacancy— Parker was for some years Chief Clerk in the War Department,
							and afterwards Adjutant and Inspector General, with the rank of
							Brigadier General— At the reduction of the army last year the Office of
							Adjutant and Inspector General was abolished; but in the arrangements
							made under that Act, <persRef ref="towson-nathan">Towson</persRef>, who
							had been Paymaster General, was made Colonel of the second regiment of
							Artillery, and Parker was appointed Paymaster General— This appointment
							of Towson’s, was the principal cause of the difference between the
							President and the Senate, and of their twice rejecting his nomination—
							The consequence of which has been, that Parker has been removed from the
							Office of Pay-master General, and Towson re-appointed to it— But from
							what the President said to me sometime since, he intended at all events
							to have dismissed Parker, from the Office of Paymaster-General; <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							having considered himself as ill-treated by him— Parker told me this
							day, that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, one day in February
							last, had him called into the War-Office, and taking the precaution <pb
								type="ms" n="293"/>of having a Witness present, asked him if he had
							spoken in a Spirit of ridicule or censure upon his, the Secretary of
							War’s Reports— That Parker had said the question was of so extraordinary
							a kind, that he did not know how to answer it— Had any one said that he
							had so spoken?— Who was the accuser, and what had he charged him with
							having said?— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had replied that
							he, Parker, knew whether he had so spoken, and could be at no loss to
							answer the question— That he had however declined answering a question,
							in such general terms, when he was neither told who had made the charge,
							nor what he was accused of having said— I suppose this was the decisive
							cause of Parkers removal— <persRef ref="baldwin-henry2">Young

							trial, I told him that the first day he should be absent without leave,
							I should be compelled to dismiss him— He came some days after, and asked
							leave of absence for one day—on the plea that he was removing from one
							house to another. I gave him leave for that day— But he was then drunk;
							and has not been since at the Office— I desired <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							this day to give him and <persRef ref="colvin-unknown">his
								wife</persRef> notice that he has been dismissed from the Office. I
							propose hereafter to employ him by the day, till he can find employment
							elsewhere— I received this day from the <persRef ref="anderson-joseph"
								>Comptroller Anderson</persRef>, the Letter which he had promised
							me, respecting my old account. Took a solitary walk after dinner, and
							after returning wrote to my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>— The weather grows so warm, that I find it very
							difficult to write in the Evening.</p>

							questions, relative to this affair, which he had verbally told me, he
							would answer at a suitable time— But that Harris having been here to
							apply for his testimony upon the trial, which he had then declined
							giving, he had thought it best to wait till the trial should be over
							before answering my queries— He asked if I could furnish him with a copy
							of them— I said I could— But that since that time, the Depositions of

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Hay</persRef>, called
							this morning at my house, and said he had heard I had dismissed <persRef
								ref="colvin-john">J. B. Colvin</persRef> from his Office as a Clerk
							in the Department, and he came to recommend a young man from Virginia
							named <persRef ref="smith-linnaeus">Linnaeus Smith</persRef>, who was
							well qualified even to be the Chief Clerk of the Department— I told him
							that although I had dismissed Colvin as a regular Clerk, it was not my
							intention immediately to supply his place— I should employ him by the
							day, to give him time to look out for some other mode of occupation for
							his support. I added it was probable there would shortly be another
							vacancy among the Clerks of the Department, in which case I would
							readily consider the claims of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith,
							with those of others. But as there was a graduation of the Salaries of
							the Clerks I had made it a rule whenever a vacancy occurred of the
							higher Salaries, to advance those who had already served at lower rates,
							to them— He said he thought this very proper, and that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith would be content to enter the
							Department at the lowest rate of compensation in the hope of advancement
							hereafter. There was a Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, at Noon, attended by all
							the Members of the Administration, to consider new proposals of the
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef>— He
							has sent in answer to my Project of a Convention, not a counterproject;
							but a paper called substance of a temporary arrangement—as loosely
							drawn, as all his former papers. It is drawn in the form of Articles;
							but the Articles themselves are argumentative, and the side Notes are as
							spacious as the Articles— The first is that the Act of 15. May. 1820.
							and the French Ordinance of 26. July after, shall be repealed— The
							second that the duties collected under them shall be refunded— The
							object of these Articles is to give the United-States the appearance of
							retracing their steps— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> was for agreeing to
							them— To which I warmly objected. The third Article, was a stipulation
							to restore deserting Seamen; to which I objected also, as belonging to a
							general commercial Negotiation— The other Articles made new difficulties
							about the ascertainment of the French and American Ton—renewed the
							proposal that the discriminating duties should be levied only upon the
							excess in value, of importations over the exportations in the same
							vessel; and proposed that the operation of the Convention should
							commence on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August next. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford was for agreeing to every thing.
							When the Act of Congress of 15. May 1820 was on its passage through
							Congress, at the several Cabinet Meetings that were held on the subject,
							he never intimated an objection to any part of it: when the controversy
							with France grew into serious difficulty, and symptoms of
							dissatisfaction with this act began to appear abroad in the Country and
							in Congress, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford declared that he
							had been against the Act of 15. May 1820. at the time of its passage—
							But Congress at their late Session shewed a determination so firm and so
							nearly unanimous to abide by that act, and the prospect is now so fair
							of obtaining at least a tolerable bargain with France, that Crawford is
							afraid of its being too favourable— He therefore is for granting every
							thing that the Baron will please to demand, because the more is granted
							to France, the less advantageous will be the Treaty to us; and the less
							advantageous to us; the less credit and the more discredit to the
							Secretary of State, who is to sign the Treaty— There was warm discussion
							between Crawford and me, upon several of those Articles proposed by the
							Baron; particularly the first and second, the repealing of the Acts, and
							refunding the duties levied.— As questions of interest they amount to
							nothing; but the appearance to the world would be that the United States
							retreated from their own ground. Crawford said it would be conciliatory—
							That we were suffering much by the present state of things—that in the
							last year there had been 38000 ton of foreign shipping employed in the
							commerce between us and France; which was more than there had been of
							French shipping in the commerce between us and France; which was more
							than there had been of French shipping employed in it, at any time— I
							agreed that it was very desirable we should form a Convention with
							France; and said that as to the main point in dispute we had already
							conceded more than I <pb type="ms" n="298"/>thought we ought to have
							done— I believed also, that such would be the public opinion, should the
							convention be concluded— But certainly we should be taken to task for
							any unnecessary concession; Crawford said that if we negotiated in such
							a temper, no Convention can be formed— That if by admitting these
							Articles we retracted our Law, France also retracted hers— But I
							observed, the first retracting in this proposal would be ours— <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>,
							and the President observed that if we retracted France must go farther
							back, and retract her tariff of 1817. But Crawford said we had begun
							with discriminating duties in 1790. This is precisely de Neuville’s
							Argument, which has been a dozen times refuted in the Correspondence. So
							about the Article to restore deserting Seamen—Crawford said he was for
							agreeing to it; and said he was afraid de Neuville would insist upon it—
							The President and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> were
							against agreeing to it, and I objected to it unless we could obtain some
							advantage for it in return— Crawford said there was a moral obligation
							to do it by Law, and Wirt said the State of Virginia had a law to that
							effect— I concurred in the opinion that on principles of Justice it
							ought to be the Law; but observed that Congress had four years ago
							refused to enact such a Law—and if it was to be conceded as a Treaty
							Stipulation to a particular Nation, it ought not to be gratuitously
							given— There was also much waste of discussion upon the Articles
							concerning the admeasurement of tons, and I remarked upon the arrant
							trifling in the Baron’s Project, upon a matter of detail so
							insignificant— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and the President, all thought
							very favourably of the offer to levy the discriminating duties only,
							upon the excess of importations. Crawford said it would operate as an
							entire abandonment of all discriminating duties— I thought it was a
							snare to levy the duties upon Articles imported for re-exportation; and
							said that although the Baron had agreed to except the latter, I did not
							see how the details of the two principles could be reconciled together—
							I was afraid its first and immediate effect would be to raise questions
							on the meaning of the Articles; and that they would produce a new
							controversy instead of an adjustment— The Baron presents it however as
							an Article of his own suggestion, to be inserted subject to acceptance
							or refusal separately so that the rest of the Convention may be ratified
							either with or without it— The Baron likewise proposes that although the
							Convention shall be limited to two years, it may continue longer unless
							six Month’s notice be given by either party of its termination and that
							after the two years if no such notice should be given, the
							discriminating duties shall be reduced on both sides from year to year.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford relied much upon this power
							of putting an end to the Convention in two years; but I thought its
							operation would be disadvantageous to us in either alternative; for if
							the Convention should operate in our favour France would give the notice
							and at the end of two years we should have to begin again. If it should
							operate against us, we shall be obliged to give the notice, and not only
							have to begin again; but incur the disgrace of having been overreached
							in the Negotiation— The Baron proposes that the Convention should be in
							force from and after the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August, to
							which I thought the first of September should be substituted. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford supposed at first, that my
							objection was to the distance of the day, but I told him, it was to the
							day, and for the very reason, which had led the Baron to propose it
							because it was the festival of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis,
							the kings fête, and the great holiday of the Bourbons. Crawford was for
							indulging him also in this humour— He said that de Neuville was now
							exceedingly anxious to return to France, and very desirous of embarking
							in a vessel, which is to sail from New-York, the first of next Month. He
							considered the proposals of the Baron as amounting in substance to a
							total abandonment of discriminating duties, which was the great object
							at which we had been aiming, and he thought we ought not to lose the
							opportunity of securing it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun,
							inclined also to these opinions; particularly that the Convention would
							operate to abolish the discriminating duties, and that de Neuville was
							exceedingly anxious to go home with a Convention in his pocket, My great
								<pb type="ms" n="299"/>objection was to the Articles stipulating the
							repeal of the Acts and the refunding of the duties which would exhibit
							us in a humiliating attitude to the world— Crawford said that in other
							respects the Convention would exhibit France in a humiliating attitude
							to the world; which I assured him would afford me neither consolation
							nor gratification. I had not the most distant desire of mortifying
							France, nor should I take one moment of pleasure in her humiliation— But
							between that and subscribing to the humiliation of my Country, there was
							an immeasurable distance which I never would traverse— As to the Article
							for the restitution of Seamen, there was one consideration, which might
							induce me to agree to it— There was a principle of Negotiation that each
							Article in a Treaty was to be considered as an equivalent for all the
							others; and all together as an equivalent for each— If the Convention
							should prove in substance to be an abandonment of all discriminating
							duties, and as such operate rather unfavourably to France; this Article
							might reconcile her to its continuance; as she considers it as very
							important, and as its operation would be all in her favour— For as the
							laws of France prohibit the shipping of foreign Seamen in French
							vessels, there is neither motive nor means of desertion to foreign
							Seamen in French Ports. The President finally desired me to make a draft
							of a reply to this project of the French Minister conformable to the
							impressions which had appeared to be prevalent at this Meeting. After I
							returned to the Office, <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackelberg</persRef> called and complained of a mistake in the
							translation of one of his Notes, published among the documents of the
							late Session of Congress— He shewed me the passage, which was really
							mistranslated. The documents were sent in, one of the last days of the
							Session, when I had no time to examine the papers, and in such cases,
							blunders are almost sure to happen. I made enquiry of <persRef
								ref="ironside-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ironside</persRef>, who was the translator, who thought it was an
							error of the press. I told Baron Stackelberg that the safest way in
							future would be for him to send a translation with his Notes, as was
							practised by the French Minister; but he said he had not the means—
								<persRef ref="menou-charles">Menou</persRef> had however called this

									>r</hi> May</persRef> and <persRef ref="bulfinch-george">G. S.
								Bulfinch</persRef> came this morning for a subscription for a Bell,
							for the Unitarian Church; for it is remarkable, that with a population
							of fourteen or fifteen thousand Souls, and at least eleven Churches,
							there is not a single Bell in the City. At my Office, <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> came with an old manuscript
							Letter-Book, and book of characters, and read to me passages to shew me
							how he had always detested and despised <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Jonathan Russell</persRef>, and <persRef ref="harris-levett">Levett
								Harris</persRef>— He valued himself much upon his book of
							Characters, from which he read me several extracts— <persRef
								ref="obrien-richard">Captain O’Brien</persRef> came again about his
							Accounts— I told him he must make out a fair Statement of all his
							claims, and I would determine upon each item— I took to <pb type="ms"
								n="300"/>the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> a
							copy of my Letter to him of<space/>July last, asking his answers to
							certain questions respecting the reference of the charges against L.
							Harris to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> in 1818 and copies of the
							depositions of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, and myself, taken last November.
							I told him they were all taken upon the attempt made by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, to discredit my testimony given in
							April 1821. I requested him to read with the utmost attention the
							interrogatories, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s, and my answers to each of
							them—so as to possess himself entirely of the precise points of the
							question to be answered by him— As to the suggestion of his giving his
							deposition in Court, I must leave that entirely to his own
							determination— Whether a President of the United States ought in any
							case to give testimony in a Court of Justice was a question of great
							public interest, on which I would not wish to give an opinion, in a case
							so directly affecting myself. <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jefferson</persRef> had when
							President declined giving testimony; and I would ask nothing of him,
							which could be questionable with reference to his public duties— All I
							could say was, that so far as I could be personally affected by it, I
							was desirous that he should give his testimony, and should be glad if he
							would give it— But if he did not, I must earnestly renew the request
							that he would answer the questions in my Letter, and answer them in
							writing— I wanted his answers for my own satisfaction and for that of my
							children— He would suit the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of giving these
							answers to his own convenience and inclination— He promised to examine
							with the utmost attention the papers that I left with him; and to answer
							my questions, before he should retire from public life— I brought him
							also a Letter from <persRef ref="dearborn-henry">General H.
								Dearborn</persRef>, accepting the appointment of Minister to
							Portugal; at which he expressed himself much gratified— My remarks on
							Russell’s Letters were this day published in the National Intelligencer.
							After dinner I took a solitary walk, and called upon <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. H.
								Eaton</persRef>, the Senator from Tennessee, at <persRef
								ref="oneal-william">O’Neal’s</persRef>— I found him convalescent
							from a bilious fever with which he was seized last Monday, the day upon
							which he had fixed for his departure— His physician thinks him not yet
							sufficiently recovered to proceed on his journey— I sat with him an hour
							or more in conversation chiefly upon Russell’s Letters. He told me he
							had never liked Russell much, but this character in which he had now
							placed himself of a spy upon the conduct of persons with whom he was
							associated in office, did not, at all accord with his ideas— As I was
							returning home I met <persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef>,
							who stopped and began with me upon the same subject— He told me that in
							the years 1796 and 1797. Russell had been in France concerned in
							privateers fitted out at Brest; and so despised that the decent
							Americans in Paris would not associate with him.— Lee told me that
								<persRef ref="lee-susan">his wife</persRef> and family were gone off
							this morning to Boston.</p>

						<p><date>24. VI:</date><persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> came in this
							morning and began at once upon <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell’s</persRef> Letters and my Remarks. He said he had a very
							poor opinion of Russell’s Letter when he first saw it, but this is not
							the impression which it has generally made— It has passed for being very
							well written— There is an air of plausibility about it, imposing at a
							first perusal— Its misrepresentations of facts are artful, its argument
							though radically sophistical, elaborate and subtle— There is a fatuitous
							affectation of diplomatic and legal knowledge, shallow and blundering in
							fact, but masking real ignorance under a shew of learning. The <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> really thought at first that
							it would make a profound impression upon the public mind— <persRef
								ref="walsh-robert">Walsh</persRef>, the Editor of the National
							Gazette, a man of talents, and literature, was so much convinced by the
							argument, that without waiting for my answer he pronounced at once upon
							it, in favour of Russell’s position that the Treaty of 1783. was
							entirely abrogated by the War of 1812— All the Newspapers in which
							Russell’s Letter as published in Walsh’s Gazette has been noticed have
							spoken of it as an argument entirely conclusive, and <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">Eaton</persRef> last Evening in speaking of it,
							observed that Russell wrote remarkably well for so dull a man. <persRef
								ref="hay-george">G. Hay</persRef> observed to me two days <pb
								type="ms" n="301"/>ago, how surprizingly the real state of the
							question was misunderstood, throughout the Continent, adding that he had
							no apprehension, but that the public opinion upon it, would ultimately
							come out right— How that may be depends upon a higher power. I shall not
							satisfy prejudice, nor appease malice. There was a Cabinet Meeting at
							the President’s— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> absent, confined to
							his house by an intermitting fever; and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>, at Alexandria— The
							question to be considered was upon a Report of <persRef
								ref="preston-james">Governor Preston</persRef>, Commissioner to
							ascertain the losses of Citizens of Georgia by depredations of Creek
							Indians, for which by a late Treaty the United States have undertaken to
							make indemnity. They have gone back in search of such losses, to the
							year 1775— Tis chiefly for negroes and cattle stolen— Preston has made
							an award to the amount of more than 90000 dollars, and there are claims
							for interest reserved to perhaps double that amount— Preston has awarded
							in favour of claimants upon very feeble testimony; sometimes nothing but
							their own affidavit’s, and has allowed enormous prices for the value of
							Negroes and horses lost— He has invariably considered the proof of the
							loss, alone, as decisive in favour of the claim of indemnity for
							restitutions although restitution could only have been of the Negroes
							and cattle which were living at the time of the Stipulations in the
							respective Treaties— The claim of interest is the most important point,
							and I observed that it was made more so by its bearing on the claims of
							indemnity for Slaves, upon the British Government, in case the decision
							of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> should be
							in our favour. <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Calhoun</persRef> questioned whether the claimants
							ought not to have been held to prove the life of the Articles loss, at
							the time of the stipulation for restitution, as well as the loss; but
							that seems to require proof that could not be obtained— It was objected
							that the testimony as to the <hi rend="italic">value</hi> of Articles
							lost had been received by one loser, in favour of another— On the whole
							the general impression was that Preston’s award should be taken as it
							was made; and as it had been so liberal to the claimants in regard to
							the Evidence, of loss and value, to reject the claim of interest as
							unusual, and dangerous for a precedent. But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun desired the decision might be deferred to another
							day when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, and especially M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford might be present, and it was
							fixed for to-morrow, being M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s
							well day. There was some conversation upon three Resolutions of the
							House of Representatives, passed on the last day of the Session at the
							motion of <persRef ref="johnson-francis">F. Johnson</persRef> of
							Kentucky. Two of them relating to the Office hours and Clerks in the
							Departments, and the third calling for a Report of a Navy-Peace
							Establishment— The first Resolution was that the practice of keeping
							Office hours only from 9 to 3 O’Clock, at the Departments, was not
							giving due attendance for the Salaries allowed, and ought to be
							abolished— There was some discussion whether it would be practicable or
							reasonable to require attendance earlier or later, or both— Whether
							attendance twice a day should be required, with an interval for dining;
							or a greater number of hours in one continued attendance. There are
							difficulties and inconveniences in both— I observed that the first
							Resolution had no application in fact to the Department of State, where
							the attendance the whole year round is from 9 in the morning till 5 or 6
							in the Evening— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun said that his
							attendance was till 4. in the afternoon— The propriety of the Resolution
							itself was questioned, and the President thought it, an officious
							intermeddling on the part of one branch of the Legislature with the
							Executive Administration— I thought it was Legislation by one branch;
							and that if a different system of attendance was to be prescribed, it
							should be done by Law— But the main motive to the Resolution was the
							earnestness of F. Johnson to obtain a re-election— There is a Report to
							be made to the House on the second day of the next Session, by the Heads
							of Departments, and the <persRef ref="meigs-return">Postmaster
								General</persRef>; upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							observed that it should be made with a joint understanding. I think of
							introducing some new regulations with regard to attendance into the
							Department of State, for which <pb type="ms" n="302"/>this Resolution,
							and another of similar character adopted on the motion of <persRef
								ref="patterson-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patterson</persRef> of New-York, will afford the occasion— After
							dinner I took again a solitary walk. Called at <persRef
								ref="bomford-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Bomford’s</persRef> and saw <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> of Pennsylvania, who
							has been detained here by illness since the close of the Session of
							Congress— He is recovering, and hopes to be able to travel in a few
							days.— He began immediately to speak of Russell’s Letters and my
							Remarks, which were published in the National Intelligencer of
							yesterday. He said that which had struck him, as the most remarkable
							circumstance of the whole transaction was the falsification by Russell
							of his own Letter, and the shameless impudence of delivering at the
							Department of State, the pretended duplicate; as being the Letter he had
							written at Paris— He said that if he had done the same thing with a
							promissory note, it would have introduced him to the Penitentiary— And
							what was the difference between the two cases? a positive Law,
							inflicting the penalty— But the moral turpitude was the same in both—
								<persRef ref="menou-charles">Count de Menou</persRef> came in while

						<p><date>25. V:30.</date> Adjourned Cabinet Meeting upon the Georgia claims
							of indemnity for Creek Indians depredations— <persRef ref="wirt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> was yet absent at
							Alexandria, and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, by indisposition,
							confined to his house. The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> sent for him; but he sent word that he was
							unable to come out— These claims, which the U.S. in their last Treaty
							with the Creek Indians have undertaken to pay, are some of them as old
							as the year 1775—and nearly half of the amount admitted by the
							Commissioner is for losses before 1783. They are all for negroes, horses
							and cattle stolen by the Creeks, or absconded or strayed away from the
							owners into their Country— I examined more particularly the papers this
							day.— The allowance for the negroes was at an average of nearly 300
							dollars a head— That for horses about 90. both considered as far above
							the current value of negroes and horses, at the time, and places when
							&amp; where they were lost— On the advice of <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> this day it was determined to allow all the
							claims admitted by the Commissioner, even those only recommended by him
							as fair, though not proved— But to decline allowing interest on the
							claims, for various reasons— One that interest is not usually allowed on
							claims against the public— Another that the allowance of the claims
							themselves is upon principles of great liberality to the claimants with
							regard to the evidence both of their losses and the amount of them— A
							third that the engagements of the Treaties were all, only for specific
							restitution of the Articles lost; and not for damages or interest upon
							their value. And the United States having undertaken only to do what the
							Indians had in the Treaties promised to do, are bound only to indemnify
							for the failure of specific restitution, and not for consequential
							damages, or interest— A fourth, that the engagement of the United States
							in their Treaty is to pay the amount of the indemnities found by the
							Commissioners to be due, in five annual Instalments without Interest;
							which shews that payment of interest upon the claims, was not
							contemplated by the parties; and if not after their amount and validity
							have been ascertained, a portion interest cannot be claimed for the
							prior time— I gave no opinion— But this subject will come before the
							Cabinet again— The President, asked us to call upon him to morrow
							immediately after Church; to speak with me of my draft of an Answer to
							the last proposals of the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French
								Minister</persRef>— At the Office, <persRef ref="todd-charles"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> C. S. Todd</persRef> came,
							but I was not yet prepared to give him his final Instructions— The
							President thinking it best to wait and hear from <persRef
								ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="rhea-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J.
								Rhea</persRef> of Tennessee came to take leave— Going this
							afternoon— He spoke of <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell’s</persRef> Letters, with much contempt; but what had
							struck him most, was his writing with such severe censure upon measures
							in which he had concurred. There are so many varieties of baseness in
							the whole of Russell’s conduct on this occasion, that men of any feeling
							of honour, have a choice of favourite points for special detestation—
							Calhoun spoke to me of it yesterday; and of a paragraph in the City
							Gazette, which charges him with having secretly worked to bring forth
							Russell’s Letter— He said he never <pb type="ms" n="303"/>knew of the
							existence of Russell’s Letter till after <persRef ref="floyd-john"
								>Floyd’s</persRef> call for the Ghent papers— I told him that
								<persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Elliott</persRef> the Editor of the

							from Hebrews 11.25.26. “Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the
							People of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
							Season;—Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
							treasures of Egypt”— He gave notice that the new Unitarian Church would
							be dedicated this day fortnight— After Church I went to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>— He told me that he wished
							me to see the French Minister, <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde
								de Neuville</persRef>, and endeavour to arrange this Convention with
							him— That the difference between us, was now very slight— That de
							Neuville was very anxious to come to an agreement, wishing to leave this
							Country with friendly Sentiments and retaining a recollection of the
							kindness which he has experienced here— And he said it would give great
							satisfaction in this Country that an arrangement with France should be
							made, and would perhaps lead to a satisfactory arrangement of the trade
							with the British West Indies.— In going over the Articles however the
							President rather indicated the difficulties which he wished to be gotten
							over than the manner of getting over them. I told him that I would see
							the French Minister to-morrow, and endeavour to approach towards a
							conclusion with him.— I mentioned having received yesterday a Letter
							from <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith</persRef> stating
							that he saw by the newspapers, that our vessels were subjected to
							heavier duties in the Republic of Colombia than those of other Nations—
							He did not say what newspapers, and I knew not to what he referred— But
							I thought it would be proper to despatch <persRef ref="todd-charles"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Todd</persRef>, as soon as
							possible, still in his character of an informal agent, and referring it,
							as originally intended to them whether an interchange of Ministers
							Plenipotentiary shall take place, or whether it shall be only of Chargés
							d’Affaires. The President agreed to despatch Todd immediately, but said
							he had no doubt of his right to send a Minister during the recess of the
							Senate: and he gave me to read a Letter from <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>, which he had lately received, in which he gives his
							opinion in favour of the same principle. In the same Letter M<hi

							factions, which have been struggling against each other in Congress at
							their late Session. The President had alluded to it in the Letter to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison, to which this was an answer.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison speaks of it, as a grave and
							alarming symptom in our public affairs— The President said nothing of
							this part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s Letter— Nor did I
							to him— Returning home from his house I met <persRef ref="menou-charles"

								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							passed to <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rogers’s</persRef>
							inclined plane and ship-cradle; against which he had many objections— He
							talked also of the Quarrel between Captains <persRef ref="shaw-john"
								>Shaw</persRef> and <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Hull</persRef>—upon
							the Court-martial lately held upon Shaw and upon the proceedings

								Homans</persRef> at the Navy Department, that Elliott asked O’Brien
							to procure for him a couple of copies of them, as he did not like to ask
							for them himself— O’Brien was in a rage about it, as an unconstitutional
							use of the public money by the Navy Department, to injure the character
							of Barron, because they would not employ him— Speaking of this, and of
							the personal factions raging in Congress, he said the Cask would soon
							burst its wooden hoops, unless it should be fortified by some iron ones—
							He told me that <persRef ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef>
							would be the candidate of the Hiesterites, for the next Governor of

							The <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de

							loose phraseology that it is difficult to come to terms with him. As to
							the refunding of the duties levied under the Act of Congress of 15. May
							1820 and the ordinance of 26. July of the same year, he said his
							principal motive for asking that was because it would serve as indemnity
							to the Eugene, the only one of the vessels which had been taken in the
							waters of Florida, and which had paid the duties— He insisted very
							earnestly on the Article for taking up and restoring deserting Seamen,
							and urged strongly the signature of a whole Consular Convention— On the
							question of fixing the amount of tonnage, by specified quantities of
							each Article he was not less stiff and unaccommodating, and as to the
							tonnage duties and light money he insists upon a discriminating duty on
							both sides of 5 francs— To the Articles that the Convention shall last
							two years; and longer unless six Months notice be given by either party
							of its cessation to the other; and that if continued beyond the two
							years the discriminating duties shall be diminished by one eighth from
							year to year; we agreed— Also to the proviso, that the discriminating
							duties should be levied, only upon the excess of importations over the
							value of exportations, with the exception of Articles imported for
							re-exportation— But as this is to be subject to distinct ratification by
							both Governments, I proposed it should be drawn up as a separate
							Article, to which he agreed. I finally gave him my observations upon his
							last projet, and desired him to send me a draft of a Convention in form,
							which we may discuss Article by Article, which he promised— Before
							leaving the Office however, he gave me a copy of the Correspondence
							between the British and French Governments <pb type="ms" n="305"/>on the
							case of a French Slave-vessel having been taken, by a British Cruizer;
							for which Lord Castlereagh ordered the British Ambassador at Paris to
							make an apology, and offer of reparation, without waiting for a
							complaint— He said he did not mean to hold out this example of the
							British Government, as a rule for us to follow; but wished us to
							consider whether we could not give something like it, for the captures
							of the 5 french vessels by <persRef ref="stockton-robert">Lieutenant
								Stockton</persRef>, and the case of the Apollon— He had shewn me
							this Correspondence some weeks since— I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">Jo: Hopkinson</persRef> at Philadelphia—
							Evening walk with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

							having declined making an appropriation to run the boundary line with
							Spain according to an Article in the Treaty of 22. February 1819. it

							mistake I had made, and observed that it would now be necessary to

							the accounting Clerk of the Department of State— Since the late Session
							of Congress there is a more scrutinizing and captious spirit among the

							trifles. The Comptroller had, as Maury said objected to an account for
							Books which I had purchased of <persRef ref="wells-william"
								>Wells</persRef> and <persRef ref="lilly-robert">Lilly</persRef> at
							Boston, thinking some of the prices very high— Anderson disclaimed this
							altogether— He had also told Maury that my approbation must be certified
							to every receipt and account that he presented— I observed to Anderson
							that this would give me much additional, and useless trouble, and the
							same object would be answered by my certifying Maury’s general account
							from quarter to quarter—to which he agreed— He spoke much to me also of
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Russell’s</persRef> Letter and my
							remarks upon it, which he thought acrimonious— But he said he thought
							very indifferently of Russell’s character and even of his talents— He
							also told me, that Russell’s hostility to me, was of long standing, and
							had long been well known to him; particularly in the winter of 1816 and
							1817.</p>

							carried there for him and sold— The loan was for six Months, but when

							and if he thought proper to pursue his claim before the Danish

							sent me yesterday by the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French
								Minister</persRef>; and told him that there was no material point

							Convention which would not satisfy the people of this Country; and it
							was my deliberate opinion that it would have been a wiser and more
							successful policy to have adhered inflexibly to the principle of entire
							reciprocity, and to have admitted no discriminating duties on either
							side. He said that was his own opinion— But that the Nation was uneasy
							under the interruption of our direct intercourse with France; and until
							the late Session of Congress we could not calculate upon the firmness,
							and especially upon the unanimity, with which the ground taken by this
							Government would be supported. I said that would be precisely the
							mainground of complaint against the Convention; for the Executive will
							be charged with agreeing to this heavy discrimination, after knowing
							that Congress approved of the opposite course— However we were already
							so far committed, in the points to which we had acceded, that I saw no
							justifiable reason for breaking off the Negotiation— The stipulations
							that after two years if the Convention continues the discriminating
							duties shall be diminished by one eigth from year to year, and that they
							shall be levied only on the excess of importations over the value of
							exportations may perhaps partly reconcile our people to the Convention,
							but at all <pb type="ms" n="307"/>Events it was now too late for us to
							retreat. I left the Translation of the Projet with the President for his
							Consideration— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="mcrae-unknown">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								M’Rae</persRef>, who was at Wheeling wished to be informed whether
							he should be employed as Commissioner to run the line, under the Florida
							Treaty— I mentioned the Letter I had yesterday written to the Spanish
							Minister to rectify the mistake I had made, under the belief that no
							appropriation had been made for the expense of running that line. We are
							to wait for <persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Anduaga’s</persRef> answer, before replying to Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> M’Rae. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun consulted the President also upon what was now to be done
							concerning the Dauphin Island fortifications. Congress have refused
							appropriations for continuing them; and large advances have been made to
							the contractors, which must now be recovered back from them;— Calhoun’s
							project seemed to be, to bring suits at Law upon the Bonds and Mortgages
							of the Contractors, who might plead the breach of contract on the part
							of the Government, by the withholding of appropriations, and recover
							judgment against the Government— The President asked my opinion, and I
							said that according to my first impressions, the proper course was to
							bring an action for monies had and received against the Contractors for
							the advances, and if the contract had been broken on the part of the
							United States, by the refusal to appropriate, the only remedy that I
							knew for the Contractors was by petition to Congress— Calhoun afterwards
							observed that the Contractors themselves had failed to complete their
							work within the time; though the Government had not intended to take any
							advantage of that— It changed however the aspect of the question. The
							President concluded to take the opinion upon it, of the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef>. Calhoun’s object is
							to escape the investigation of the Contract by Congress— Evening walk
