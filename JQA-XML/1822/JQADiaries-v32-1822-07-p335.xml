							Commissioner, and he had been personally to the <persRef

							a <persRef ref="darcy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								D’Arcy</persRef> of Baltimore appointed to that place a year ago—
							But upon application for it, from another person last April, it appeared

							was gone. <persRef ref="davy-alexander">Alexander Davy</persRef> a Son

							Angostura— I thought it had been settled; but no charge of it is to be
							found in the Accounts. Hunter is here upon a claim before the Florida
							Treaty Commission; and came just in time to see them adjourn. He said he
							was a good hunter, to be in at the death— I received from Boston,
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russells</persRef> reply to
							my Remarks upon his Letters, communicated to Congress— It is published
							in the American Statesman, a Newspaper printed at Boston, of which
								<persRef ref="orne-henry">Henry Orne</persRef> is the Editor— The
							paper is of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June. Orne is a
							young lawyer of some talents and a political adventurer of whom W King
							has made a partizan for <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef>, for the succession to the Presidency. Russell’s
							reply is as full of falsehoods and misrepresentations as his Letter from
							Paris— But he admits the interpolations in his duplicate— He attempts to
							represent me, as having tricked him into the delivery of his Letter at
							the Department as a duplicate; and having no sort of regard to truth he
							has made up a plausible tale of new accusation against me, to which I
							must Again reply. It is a great mortification to me, to have a large
							portion of the time which ought to be devoted <pb type="ms" n="336"/>to
							the discharge of my public duties, absorbed in necessary self-defense—
							This is a miserable plot against me, devised by <persRef

							Article of the Treaty of Ghent. I told him of its present situation, and

							should disagree upon their Report, it should be referred to the decision
							of a friendly sovereign. But as this must be attended with great
							difficulties, we proposed to the British Government to make a previous
							effort to adjust the affair by Negotiation— To this the British
							Government have agreed, but with a notification that they are not
							disposed to yield upon the point made by their Commissioner on this
							Article, as they had with regard to the sixth—which seems almost
							equivalent to saying that it is useless to negotiate. I told King that I
							expected we should be obliged to resort to the umpire, and that it would
							be necessary to resort to some mode of obtaining his decision. I had
							thought of proposing that it should be by a Commission of three persons,
							one to be appointed by the British and one by the American government,
							and the third by the umpire— The Commissioners to sit in this Country,

						<p><date>3. V:</date> Bath in the river— The Summer heat has set in with the
							new Month intensely. My accounts are at length settled, and the Warrant
							for my last Quarter Salary has been furnished me. Those for the first

							service in Europe being still delayed, I called this morning upon the
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller Anderson</persRef>, who
							finally gave me one of the warrants and soon afterwards sent me the

							chicaneries, and should have been kept out of it years longer, but for
							the clause in the appropriation Act of the last Session of Congress,
							that no person in arrears to the Government should be paid for his
							current Salary— On this clause they have withheld my Salary these six
							Months— I had pressed for a Settlement within half a year after my
							return to this Country, and repeatedly since that time— The question
							about a half outfit upon the Mediation Mission was made against me, and
							although the Comptroller told me time after time that the Constitution
							and Law were in my favour, yet he would not settle my account on that
							principle— He required the Sanction of the Secretary of State or of the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>. I could not give it
							in my own case, and the President declined giving it from a scruple of
							delicacy from my present official connection with him. But after the Act
							of Congress of the last Session it became absolutely necessary. He took
							the official opinion of the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney
								General</persRef> upon it, which was decisively in my favour, and
							thereupon decided— Anderson said he supposed they would bring it up at
							the next Session of Congress <unclear>but</unclear> I should be the only

							Bank of the Metropolis the Warrants for the Balances due to me upon my
							Accounts, with much satisfaction that those of my last service in
							Europe, are at length closed— I have had occasion through the whole of
							this transaction, to observe the necessity, not only of a just cause,
							but of continual wariness, discretion, firmness and perseverance, to
							avoid inextricable entanglement in a case, itself perfectly clear— Upon
							the Call from the House of Representatives at the last Session of
							Congress, for the sums paid to Ministers abroad since the year 1800, a
							call which was to be answered by the Secretary of State, but from
							returns made up at the Treasury, the first return from the Register’s
							Office, exhibited me, as having been paid only half an outfit upon the
							Mediation Mission— This was directly contrary to the fact; but if I had
							reported to the House, the return as I received it, I should have been
							debarred from disputing it afterwards— It was with the utmost difficulty
							that I obtained the rectification of this mis-statement— Not till after
							I had sent it back to the Treasury, three or four times for amendment—
							Not until I had declared that if it was not amended to state the fact as
							it was, I should in reporting it to the house point out its inaccuracy,
							as it related to myself— <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse</persRef> the Register then
							came to me, and agreed to make a new return conformable to the fact— The
							error was not only a mis-statement in itself, but it gave a false
							colouring to the statement of my own account, in the very point upon
							which the question was made— For by representing me as having been <pb
								type="ms" n="338"/>paid only half an outfit upon the mediation
							Mission, the residue which had actually been paid me, would have charged
							to me as a payment on my general account, and thus have presented a
							balance as due from me, instead of that which was really due to me. The
							obstinacy and the cunning with which this point has been maintained and
							managed against me these five years, has not been without design—
							Perhaps is not yet wholly unfolded.</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Davy</persRef>, son of the <persRef

							respecting the disagreement between the Commissioners under the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the Treaty of Ghent, and
							respecting the contemplated renewal of Negotiation for the suppression
							of the Slave trade— That is to obtain from us the stipulation admitting
							the mutual right of search. I told him I would enter upon this latter
							subject with him when he pleased, but hoped he would postpone it till
							cooler weather. As to the Commission under the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Article of the Ghent Treaty, it would be occupation for
							the Summer to obtain a correct knowledge of the points upon which the
							Commissioners have disagreed, and after all, we should probably be
							obliged to take the course stipulated by the Treaty, of reference to a
							friendly Sovereign— I mentioned to him what I thought would be the most
							convenient mode of making this reference— By the appointment of three
							Commissioners, one by the Government of the United States, one by the
							British Government, and the third by the Umpire Sovereign— The
							Commission to sit in this Country, and the decision to be made, upon the
							Report of a Majority of them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning did
							not state any positive objection to this proposal but it did not appear
							altogether to please him— There is a large trunk full of Books, thirty
							folio Volumes at least reported; with the disagreeing opinions of the
							Commissioners. The question upon the Construction of the first Article
							of the Ghent Treaty, was merely a question of the grammatical meaning of
							a written sentence. Nothing could be more simple, and a Sovereign could
							decide it in person as well as by Ministers or Commissioners— But a
							complicated question about the North west angle of Nova-Scotia, the
							Northwesternmost head of Connecticut river, the Geocentric Latitude,
							Charters of English Colonies, Proclamations and Acts of Parliament
							Geographical Surveys of North-American Wildernesses, and ridges of
							highlands dividing rivers that fall into the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Lawrence, from those that fall into the Atlantic Ocean, it
							is impossible that a foreign Sovereign, absorbed in the Cares of his own
							Government, should have time, or be willing to take upon himself the
							labour, of acquainting himself with the merits of the dispute
							sufficiently to decide with justice, and in a satisfactory manner,
							either to himself or to the parties. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning proposes making a Northern tour this Summer. <persRef

							Easton Pennsylvania, at their head to set him up as a Candidate for the
							succession to the Presidency— From that moment the caballing in

							Dallas</persRef>, <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef>,

							against a Northern Man; &amp; that he himself was decidedly for a

							when so large a proportion of members was enlisted for Calhoun, that
							they had it in contemplation to hold a Caucus formally to declare him a
							Candidate. But this prospect of success roused all Crawford’s and
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> partizans against him—
							The administration of his Department was scrutinized with severity

							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> in collusion with

							up a course of the most violent abuse and ribaldry against him, and his
							projected nomination for the Presidency has not met with scarcely any
							countenance throughout the Union— The principal effect of it has been to
							bring out Crawford’s strength, and thus to promote the interest of the
							very man whom he professes alone to oppose— Calhoun now feels his
							weakness but is not cured of his ambition. My personal intercourse with
							him is necessarily an intercourse of civility and not of confidence. The
							President returned this Evening from Loudoun.</p>

							of the whole— They have also been crowned with blessings for which I am
							gratified to the giver of all good— They have had their trials of many

							lamented mother. I am now in the midst of another and far different
							trial— A trial for my character, before my Country. It is but one of
							many which are preparing for me, and through which I must pass as it
							shall please Heaven— The caballing against me is so extensive, and so

							Southern Country against me. I have now the advantages of Russell
							entirely in my hands. But the main argument of my cause requires
							discretion and firmness, both in an eminent degree. My cause is the
							cause of truth, of honesty, and of my Country— There is hardly a bad
							passion in the human heart, but is arrayed against me— But in
							controversies of this kind, success depends much upon the manner in
							which it is conducted. I have now my own errors to dread more than the
							power of the adversary. A single false step would ruin me; I need advice
							very much; but have no one to advise me. I finished yesterday the
							draught of a rejoinder to Russell’s publication in the Boston Statesman
							of 27. June— But it replies only to his false statements of the manner
							in which his Letters were brought before the House of Representatives;
							and is already so long that it will with difficulty be crowded into one
							newspaper. I have so much more to say upon the subject, that it will at
							least fill another newspaper; and I am apprehensive the public will grow
							weary of the subject, before it can be fully laid open to them. I began
							this morning the draught of the sequel to my rejoinder.</p>

								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Russell as a man, at the time of the Treaty of Ghent, very recently

							that the object of bringing forward Russell’s Letter in Congress was to
							produce a prejudice in the Western Country, looking to future Events;
							but he thought it a very poor expedient, and that it would fail of
							producing the effort intended by it— This Evening <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							brought me the Roman Coins of which he had spoken— There are 163 of

						<p><date>14. V.</date> Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef> this morning from
							Isaiah 42.8. “I am the Lord; that is my name: and my glory will I not
							give to another”— This text sufficiently indicates the unitarian
							doctrine of the discourse— The afternoon sermon was from 1 Peter 5.5.
							“Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea all of you
							be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God
							resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.” The Christian
							Religion is I believe the only one that teaches humility as a virtue and
							a duty. Its primitive meaning in the Latin language whence it was
							derived is prostration to the earth—and its meaning in classical Latin
							is always in an unfavourable sense— Synonymous with low, sordid and
							base. It was no Roman virtue. Its excellence as a Christian virtue, was
							that which characterizes all the morality of Jesus—whose whole system is
							founded upon the sacrifice of the selfish to the social passions—
							Humility before God had been inculcated in the Jewish Scriptures, and
							humility had been taught by <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, as
							a precept of worldly wisdom; to obtain honour— By Jesus Christ it was
							enjoined as a moral obligation; and his own example was given by him as
							the example of the virtue to be imitated by his disciples. It has been
							questioned by philosophical speculators whether the Christian system of
							morals has not laid too much stress upon humility, to the disparagement
							of the more energetic virtues— It has in this respect as in many others
							been much abused; but the example of Jesus as well as his doctrine
							taught fortitude and inflexibility to righteous purposes, not less than
							humility. This is one of the virtues which require the sacrifice of the
							natural propensities of the human heart, and which can be exercised only
							by exertions of self-controul: but it must be tempered with a firm and
							determined Spirit which will not suffer itself to be made the sport or
							the instrument of the vices of others— I wrote this day to <persRef

							brought their accounts, which are indeed not made up: the reason for
							which Delafield states to be that since the agreement between the two
							Governments, that each should pay its own Commissioner, they had
							understood that this agreement extended also to the expenses of the
							Commission. The British Commissioner and his party incur considerable
							expenses, which <persRef ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef>
							does not incline to admit, yet against which he thinks it a matter of
							great delicacy to object. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Delafield, that the Agreement of the Governments was only for the
							Salaries of the Commissioners, it being expressly stipulated by the
							Treaty that the other expenses should be jointly and equally borne by
							the two parties. Delafield spoke also of their proceeding upon the
							Execution of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Article, and said that
							some difficulties had arisen upon the description in the second Article
							of the Treaty of 1783. of the boundary line through Lake Superior, and

							Superior now known by the name of Philipeaux— That they could not
							ascertain what Lake was meant in the Article by the name of the Long
							Lake, and that the Article did not expressly indicate whether the water
							Communication between the Lake Superior and Long Lake was uninterrupted.
							I told him there could be no doubt of that and shewed him the original
								<persRef ref="mitchell-john">Mitchells</persRef> map used at the
							Negotiation of 1783 for the delineation of the boundary, where the Long
							Lake is laid down in immediate communication with Lake Superior.
							Delafield had never seen this map, and said the Commissioners had not
							been able to obtain a copy of it. In the later maps, and particularly in
								<persRef ref="melish-john">Melish’s</persRef>, there is no Long Lake
							laid down, and Delafield says that the whole topography of that part of
							Mitchell’s Map is imaginary. This must needs be the map having been
							published in 1785. before the Country had been explored— At this day,
							nearly seventy years later, it is still a land of Indian Savages.

							the Merry Mourners— The greatest portion of the pleasure which I now
							take in frequenting the theatre consists in the recollections of former
							occasions when I had seen the same Plays. Therese is a new piece—
							Brought out since I last returned from England, and the Melo-drama
							itself is a species of theatrical exhibition, invented I believe within
							the last twenty years. It is a mixture of Tragedy, Comedy, Opera and
							Pantomime, deeply interesting when well composed and well performed— But
							the instrumental music of the Melo drama is one of the essential
							ingredients of its pathetic power, and the Orchestra here being composed
							of five fiddlers is quite inadequate to produce any effect— The
							Melo-drama, exhibits situations of deep distress, of desperate danger—of
							malice, treachery, robbery and murder, at the most critical incidents of
							which the dialogue ceases, the scene passes in pantomime, accompanied by
							a strain of music from the orchestra, wild, irregular, and melancholy—
							The appeal to the sympathies of the Soul by instrumental music is
							forcibly illustrated by the Melo-drama; but our orchestra here is not in
							the Secret— The Modern Antiques, was the farce with which the first
							brick Theatre in Federal Street, Boston opened in February 1794. I was
							one of the original proprietors and builders of that Theatre, the
							erection of which was an incident of some note in the History of the
							town of Boston, as well as in that of my life— The association of
							remembrances connected with the performance of this farce at that time,
							with the Tragedy of Gustavus Vasa, three Nights successively. <persRef

								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, each having

							Newspaper, to expose the intrigues of those Gentlemen to the Nation— The
							City Gazette is known to be under the management of Clerks in the
							Treasury— It has been several months incessantly scurrilous and abusive
							upon Calhoun; cautiously and equivocally so upon me; and without avowing
							its devotion to Crawford, occasionally disclosing it in a manner not to
							be mistaken— Its <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Editor is an
								Englishman</persRef>—having no character of his own—penurious and
							venal— Metal to receive any stamp; and as his Treatment now of Crawford
							and me, looking like one of the Tower-stamped dollars during the late
							War, with <persRef ref="george-iii">George</persRef> the third’s head
							struck over that of <persRef ref="charlesemmanuel">Charles the
								fourth</persRef>, and not entirely effacing it. The National
							Intelligencer, is also in subjection both to Clay and Crawford, by the
							Act of Congress which Clay carried through, under which the Printers of
							Congressional documents for every Congress, are chosen by the preceding
							Congress— Calhoun thinks that this gave the <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Speaker of the House</persRef> absolute control
							over the National Intelligencer Newspaper, both as a rod over the heads
							and a sop for the mouths of its Editors; and he has no doubt it was
							Clay’s object in carrying the Law— By making them dependent upon
							Congress, it palsied them at least, as supporters of the Executive— They
							incline also from other motives towards Crawford; and although uncertain
							which will be the strongest side, and therefore wishing to keep
							themselves neutral as much as possible, they will while endeavouring to
							avoid direct commitments of themselves, lean as much as they can, in
							favour both of Crawford and of Clay. An Independent Newspaper therefore
							is indispensable said Calhoun, and he asked me what I thought of
								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M’Kenney’s</persRef> Prospectus— I
							thought an <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> Newspaper would be very
							necessary to make known the truth to the People; but I said I was not
							acquainted with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney, and knew
							nothing of his qualifications for editing a paper, nor of his
							Independence— His prospectus was well written, and opened an excellent
							plan as that which he should pursue— But he must have a heart of oak,
							nerves of iron and a Soul of Adamant to carry it through— His first
							attempt would bring a Hornet’s Nest upon his head, and if they should
							not sting him to death or blindness, he would have to pursue his march
							with them continually swarming over him, and beset on all sides with
							Slander, Obloquy and probably assassination— Calhoun thought this
							picture highly coloured, but admitted there was reason to foresee a
							stormy career for M’Kenny. I doubt much however whether M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney’s paper will be Independent. I
							think it originated in the War-Office, and will be M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s Official Gazette, as long as it
							lasts. Whether it will live through a Session of Congress, is to be
							seen; but if it fulfills the promise of its prospectus it will pass
							through more than fire if it does. It is to be an Evening paper, twice a
							week, and the first number is to be published the 7<hi

						<p><date>31. V:30.</date> Potowmack Bath with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>— The day passed without interruption at the
							Office. I dined with George at <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye’s</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="johnson-george">George Johnson</persRef> was there— After
							dinner, <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef> having retired to the parlour, I left the table and
							joined her, where being alone with me she inquired if I had ever spoken
							with disapprobation of her marriage with Frye. I was surprized at the
							question, and assured her that I had not— She had been told that I had;
							and in terms which would have been as unbecoming in me, as mortifying to
							her— I immediately named to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye the
							person who had told her this, which she did not deny; but said she could
							not tell me who it was— I assured her it was utterly false— That far
							from disapproving her Marriage, I had been much gratified when informed
							of it. Having always respected the character of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frye, and having a regard for him which has increased the
							more I have known him— There is the venom of vipers in such tongues as
							these. This has been rankling for years in the mind of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye; and in all probability in that of
							her Husband. There was not the shadow of a foundation for it— But it was
							said to gratify some momentary malice, and a natural propensity to
							mischief-making— Walk home.</p>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Rise between 5 and 6. Breakfast about 9. Write till

							reading or writing, I find impracticable, for the heat and the bugs.
							Occasionally I attend the Theatre— I have been however deeply engaged
							the whole Month in my controversy with <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Jonathan Russell</persRef>. I received on the first day of the
							Month his publication in the Boston Statesman of 27 June, and replied to
							it in part by a paper in the National Intelligencer of the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> I then promised another, but in taking
							up and discussing thoroughly the topics of his Letter of 11. February
							1815 from Paris, I have found it necessary to write three papers each of
							them too long for publication in one Newspaper— I have this day finished
							the first draught of the last of those papers— But the arrangement is
							yet to be completed, and some additions and some retrenchments are to be
							made— But in the present Stage of the controversy the public Sentiment
							is almost universal against Russell; and very strongly expressed— A
							Volume more in the newspapers would weaken instead of strengthening that
							impression— It could look like mangling a fallen enemy— I have no such
							inclination, and have no wish to exult over him— But the doctrines of
							his Letter must be put down. I think of publishing a pamphlet— The
							writing of these papers has totally absorbed all my morning hours, that
							my Diary has been running the whole Month in arrears.</p>
