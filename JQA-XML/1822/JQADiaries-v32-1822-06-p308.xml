						<p><date>2. V:30.</date> Bath with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>; without <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson
								Hellen</persRef>— I was prepared to attend Church; when <persRef
								ref="parker-daniel">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> D
								Parker</persRef> came in and detained me, at an interview of more
							than three hours— Parker was brought in as Chief Clerk of the War
							Department by <persRef ref="eustis-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Eustis</persRef>— He continued in that office through
							the period while <persRef ref="armstrong-john">General
								Armstrong</persRef> was Secretary at War, and afterwards while
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> was the Secretary. He was afterwards appointed
							adjutant and inspector-General, with the rank of Brigadier General. At
							the reduction of the army last year that office was abolished, and
							Parker was made Paymaster General, in the room of <persRef
								ref="towson-nathan">Towson</persRef>, who was suddenly turned into a
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> of Artillery. But the Senate
							having at their late Session rejected the nomination of Towson as Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> of Artillery, the President nominated him
							to his old Post of paymaster General, whereby Parker was removed from
							it, without any other provision being made for him— Both the President
							and the Secretary of War, have reasons for disliking, and as he
							evidently thinks, for dreading Parker, and the very day that he was
							wormed out of Office by the nomination of Towson to his place, <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> wrote him a Note
							(6. May) unsolicited on his part, offering him a Clerkship of a thousand
							dollars Salary, in the Treasury Department; which he declined— He shewed
							me this Note of Crawford’s, and said he understood its meaning. It was
							saying to him— This is all I have to give—and this is at your disposal.—
							This avidity of Crawford, to secure Parker in his interest, is easily
							accounted for— He knows that great use may be made of him, against both
							the President and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>— Parker
							is deeply exasperated at the treatment he has received, and says he has
							been so long out of all business other than the public service that he
							knows not what will become of him. But he manifests no passion. And he
							kept me during almost the whole of this day, telling me, with an air and
							tone of indifference, what he knew, and intimating what he further could
							tell. He said he had had a very long interview with the President, in
							which he had appeared to be excessively sore, upon an attack on him in
							the New-York Philosophical and Literary Repository, in an anonymous
							paper written by Armstrong— Parker asked me if I had seen it— I had; and
							told him there was a charge in it, against M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe, in relation to the campaign of 1813 which in my
							opinion amounted, to nothing less than Treason— Parker said there was in
							that charge a reference to evidence in his possession— That as to
							Armstrong’s inferences, from which the <hi rend="italic">charge</hi>
							resulted, he had nothing to do with them— The same facts were
							compatible, with a course of conduct on the part of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, correct, or otherwise— But the
							facts, were as Armstrong had stated them,— Neither Armstrong nor M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, possessed the documents which
							would shew the full, and detailed state of the case; <pb type="ms"
								n="309"/>but he himself did possess them very complete— He then gave
							me an Account of his own situation between M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong in 1813
							and 1814— They were rival Candidates for the succession to the
							Presidency. But when he observed this the other day to the President; he
							stopp’d him, and said, no—he was not a Candidate for the Presidency— He
							had thought he had not due weight in the Councils of <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>; and had supposed the cause of it was his being
							considered as a Candidate for the Presidency. He had therefore to remove
							this cause requested three of his friends in the House of
							Representatives, <persRef ref="pleasants-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pleasants</persRef>, <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Nelson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="gholson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gholson</persRef>, to inform the Republican Members of Congress,
							that he, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a Candidate— And as by some
							accident they did not give this notice, he had requested in the ensuing
							year 1814, <persRef ref="lacock-abner">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lacock</persRef>, and <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Roberts</persRef>, the Senators from
							Pennsylvania to give it; which they had done.— But in 1815, after the
							conclusion of the Peace, and when the same difficulties no longer
							existed, he had at the solicitation of his friends, consented to be
							considered as a Candidate— Of this however Parker said he had known
							nothing at the time— In August 1813. Armstrong being Secretary of War
							had left the City and gone to the frontiers where he remained till the
							next January, long after the Session of Congress had commenced— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison the President had gone during the
							Summer into Virginia— Parker’s instructions as Chief Clerk of the War
							Department were, to consult the President and the Secretary of War, by
							Letter, when it could be done, and in cases of emergency, when time
							could not be lost, to consult verbally the Secretary of State— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe however became possessed of all the
							Military Correspondence of the campaign— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison returned to the City in October, and Parker called on him in the
							Evening. He desired Parker to inform the Secretary of State that he
							wished to see him the next morning. Parker called accordingly at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s house, and left word there, he
							not being at home, that the President wished to see him. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe early the next Morning left the
							City, and went to Loudoun, whence he did not return for several days.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison then went himself to the
							Department of State, and directing all the papers of the military
							Correspondence to be brought to him, ordered the whole of them to be
							sent over to the War Department— He was more in a passion than Parker
							ever saw him at any other period of his life; and gave it very
							distinctly to be understood, that he thought that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, had been meddling with the Affairs
							of the War Department more than was proper— It was to this event that
							the paper in the philosophical and literary Repository referred; and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, Parker said had intimated to
							him the other day that he should confer a new Office upon him, only on
							condition, that he would give some written declaration to discredit
							Armstrong’s Statement in the Repository. It had altogether to him the
							appearance of proposing a bargain; and yet M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe had always known his determination to take no part in
							the controversies between him and Armstrong— When after Armstrong’s
							removal in 1814. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe took the War
							Department, Parker soon perceived in him a reserve and distrust which
							ought not to subsist between the Head of a Department and its Chief
							Clerk— He had then candidly exposed his feelings to President Madison,
							and told him that his general impressions with regard to Armstrong’s
							administration of the War Department having been favourable, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe might naturally feel some reserve
							and want of Confidence in him; he was willing therefore to make way for
							any other person to come into the Department in his place— The office of
							Inspector General, with the rank of a Brigadier General, was then
							offered him, and he had accepted it— Then the army had been reduced; and
							he had been prevailed upon to consent to be transferred to the pay
							Department, and now Towson was re-appointed Pay-master Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> and he was displaced— He had been with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, who had told him that he was
							perfectly <pb type="ms" n="310"/>satisfied with him and his conduct; but
							had intimated to him, first that the Committee of the Senate had been
							prejudiced against him— But upon Parker’s shewing decisive proof to the
							contrary, by the signature of the chairman of the Committee himself,
							Calhoun then represented that it was the President who was prejudiced
							against Parker, and had said that if he should give him a new place it
							would have the appearance as if he were afraid of him— Calhoun’s anxiety
							to make Parker believe that any other person than himself was the cause
							of his not receiving a new appointment sounds oddly to me, who knew from
							the President himself that he had determined upon a complaint of Calhoun
							that Parker had treated him ill, to remove Parker, and appoint <persRef
								ref="smith-joseph2">Joseph L. Smith</persRef> to his place, even if
							Towson had been confirmed in his appointment as Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> of Artillery— I said nothing about this
							to Parker, but he appeared to understand Calhoun entirely— He said that
							after Calhoun had avowedly taken Gibson, as a witness to an
							inquisitional scrutiny about what he had said of his Reports, it was in
							vain for him to talk of being satisfied with him, or his friend. Parker
							said that he should now go to Massachusetts, and in the course of the
							Summer, endeavour to make some arrangements for settling in some
							business either at Boston, or at Philadelphia; but he was determined to
							come and spend the next Winter at <unclear>Washington</unclear>; and see
							how things would then be managed— He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun was very sanguine in his expectations of succeeding to the
							Presidency and believed he had a majority of Congress in his favour. And
							among the rest of his converts was <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General
								Scott</persRef>, who was now gone to Richmond to ascertain whether
							by resigning his Commission in the army, he can obtain an immediate
							election to the Legislature of Virginia, and then, into the next
							Congress. He was in that case to be one of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun’s Champions— And he was the author of a paper in the
							National Intelligencer, attacking the majority of the Senate, for their
							proceedings in the case of the rejected nominations. He said Scott had
							taken great pains to persuade him that Calhoun was friendly to him, and
							had several times repeated to him M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							had said to him how much he esteemed General Parker, and how fully
							satisfied he was with his conduct—all which Parker said he fully
							understood— I said I believed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun was too sanguine in his calculations of success as a Candidate
							for the next Presidency. There were in Congress three parties— One for
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford—one for <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>; and
							one for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun. They embraced indeed
							almost the whole— But the party for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford was the strongest, and that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun the weakest of the three— And I had little doubt that the
							parties of Crawford, and Clay would finally coalesce together— Parker
							said that he had heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay would come
							again, not only into the next Congress, but probably even to the next
							Session of the Congress— I said I doubted whether the Cabinet, as it is
							called of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, would continue entire
							through the next Session of Congress—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, or M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun; and most probably
							the latter would be compelled to resign— Very probably the case might be
							my own— For the attacks upon me at the late Session of Congress had been
							from masked batteries; but they have been of the most deadly character,
							and as they imputed to me as a crime that which I believed to be the
							greatest service I had rendered my Country, I could not possibly foresee
							what the next charge against me would be— All I knew was that it became
							me to be prepared for my political decease at a moment’s warning— Parker
							said that General Scott had told him he had read <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Russell’s</persRef> Letter and my remarks
							upon it, with <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hay</persRef>, and that they agreed in the opinion that I had the
							best of the argument. He said also that <persRef ref="ringgold-tench"
								>Tench Ringgold</persRef>, the Marshal had told him that the
							President had sent for him and asked him to make search among his the
							President’s private Papers, for Russell’s Letter—telling him that I had
							noticed a passage in the duplicate, and expressed a belief that it could
							not have been written at Paris at the time that it was dated. He said
							the President spoke of me at the same time in terms of great respect and
							esteem. Parker thought I might therefore rely upon the support of the
							President; but I told <pb type="ms" n="311"/>him I must stand upon my
							own support, or not at-all— The President had enough to do to support
							the Secretary of War— He had already brought himself into collision with
							both Houses of Congress, by supporting him— The President had little
							personal influence in Congress. He was no longer the centre of hopes and
							expectations— He was independent of all, and had no lures for retainers,
							or baits for ambition to hold out. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun’s friends had countenanced Russell’s attack upon me, though
							Calhoun himself had disclaimed it; but not a friend of mine, unless it
							were Eustis had countenanced the attacks upon Calhoun, and Eustis had
							certainly not acted in concert with me— Parker said that if Eustis had
							been as strong, as he was ten years ago, he would have broken down
							Calhoun at the last <unclear>ses</unclear>sion of Congress, and that he
							might yet do it at the next. The management of the War Department had
							been inefficient, and extravagant; which was very susceptible of
							demonstration; and the intrigues of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General
								Brown</persRef> were sufficiently known—particularly with <persRef
								ref="atkinson-henry">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Atkinson</persRef>— He, being a Georgian had made them known at the
							time to Crawford; and Crawford had authorised a friend of Parker’s, to
							tell him, from him that there was an intrigue for turning him out of
							office— Parker told me further, that most of the late attacks upon
							Calhoun in the Washington City Gazette, were written by <persRef
								ref="richards-g">Richards</persRef>, once a Captain in the army, and
							now an expectant of crumbs from the Treasury. I know Crawford has been
							taking pains to get an office for this man, against
								w<unclear>ho</unclear>m I have once or twice warned the President—
							Parker added that <persRef ref="child-unknown">Child</persRef> wrote the
							pieces in the Gazette, against the National Intelligencer; that <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef> one of the Clerks in
							the Treasury had been called upon by <persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher"
								>Vandeventer</persRef> to say whether he was the author of some of
							the pieces against the Mix contract; and had denied being so— This
							communication from General Parker has been altogether voluntary on his
							part. The heat of the day was so excessive that I did not leave the
							house after returning from the morning bath— There was a short thunder
							shower towards Evening— <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge
								Cranch</persRef> was here.</p>

						<p><date>3. V:30.—</date> Bath with <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson
								Hellen</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>—
							Cabinet Meeting at Noon— Full. The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> submitted for consideration several Letters
							from the Island of Porto-Rico, giving notice of several privateers
							fitted, and fitting out from thence for the purpose as they state of
							capturing the vessels of all Nations trading to the Ports of the
							Revolutionary party. The questions were whether naval force should be
							stationed to cruize in the Mona passage and generally in the West-India
							seas, with Instructions to protect our vessels; and what the purport of
							those instructions should be. It appeared by one of the Letters that
							several captures had already been made by the privateers; and one
							American vessel, tried upon some petty charge of having a few Articles
							of Cargo not included in the manifest from S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Thomas. It was proved to have been an omission, not of the
							Master of the Vessel; but of the Custom House at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Thomas. The judge acquitted the vessel— Upon which the
							Captain of the privateer told the judge that if he liberated the vessel,
							he the privateersman would take her again, when she should sail, and
							would carry her into Porto Cabello— Upon which she was again seized, and
							condemned to pay one third part of the Costs— From which Sentence the
							American Captain appealed— The <persRef ref="levy-n">Consul</persRef>
							who gives this account observes that if they should condemn for breaches
							of their revenue Laws, Vessels captured by privateers, no vessel will
							escape; no regard whatever being had for those Laws by any of the
							Customs House Officers. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, expressed doubts whether Instruction could be
							given to protect vessels against capture for the breach of revenue Laws,
							any where.— I said it was evident that in this case, the charge of
							infraction of the revenue Laws had been a mere pretence. The capture had
							been by a Privateer. When carried into Port, the privateersman of
							course, took every possible ground to procure the condemnation of the
							vessel; and if he could not allege the Laws of War, would adduce the
							Laws of revenue— But privateers are not fitted out to protect the
							Revenue Laws, nor <pb type="ms" n="312"/>was the vessel in this case
							going to Porto-Rico— Privateersmen, it was well known, were among the
							most lawless of mankind— These privateers from Porto Rico, evidently
							belong to that system of piratical depredation of which the West-India
							Seas have for several years been the Scene. I thought therefore that the
							Instructions to the Commanders of our armed vessels ought to be general,
							to protect our Commerce, and not to suffer any of our merchant vessels
							to be captured, unless in a very clear case that they were liable to
							capture. But the great object was to have the armed vessels there— The
							sight of their flag and of their guns, would give more protection to the
							trade, and save more vessels from capture, than any Instructions— It was
							finally determined that Instructions should be given, generally to
							protect the trade— And that several of the public vessels should be
							ordered to visit the Mona passage occasionally, and to cruize in the
							neighbouring regions. The next question was about the sum of money to be
							applied for the negotiation of a Treaty with the Cherokee Indians, to
							obtain cessions of Lands for the State of Georgia, and indemnities for
							claims of Citizens of Georgia, for property stolen from them— This
							brought up the question again upon the allowance of interest, on the
							award of the <persRef ref="preston-james">Commissioner on the Claims of
								Citizens</persRef> of Georgia, against the Creek Indians, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford immediately assured in the
							broadest terms, that if interest should not be allowed it would be a
							refusal merely arbitrary— That the amount of the Claims being admitted
							by the Commissioner, interest upon it was due of course, and to refuse
							it would be an act merely of Will, and not of Justice— Crawford was a
							Georgian, and was this day quite alone in his opinion. The evidence upon
							which the Commissioner admitted the claims being not only all ex parte,
							but such as in no Court of Justice in the world would be admitted to
							establish a claim to the value of a half a dollar. The Articles lost
							were Negroes, Horses and Cattle; many of them lost nearly half a century
							since, all perishable articles— Specific restitution being the only
							thing stipulated; for which the United States have engaged to make
							indemnity: no proof having been furnished that any of the individual
							articles were existing at the time of the engagement to restore them,
							and the whole being unquestionably valued in the award, at more than
							double their real worth— <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> said that Uncle Sam,
							would fare in this case, as he did with most of his dealings— Claims
							admitted without proof estimated at double their value; and then
							interest for half a century upon the whole amount of the claim. I
							observed that the compensation would amount in most of the cases to
							about six times the value of the loss— I added that from the excessive
							valuation of the Articles I had no doubt that each claimant had in
							fixing his estimate taken into the account his damages consequential to
							the loss, as well as the value of the Article. I believed the 90000
							dollars admitted by the Commissioners would amply repay all the loss
							actually sustained— Perfect justice to every individual it was
							impossible to do, from the nature of the case— Some would receive more,
							and some might receive less than they were entitled to; and
							unfortunately the honest and consciencious who had valued their loss at
							their real worth, would have less than entire indemnity, and those who
							had most exaggerated, would be most profusely paid. But this could not
							be helped— Justice on the whole would as nearly be done as was
							practicable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson repeated as his
							opinion, that interest ought not to be allowed, with which <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							concurred— Calhoun said however, that if interest should be allowed the
							amount must be sent back to the Commissioner, for a re-examination of
							the claims upon more rigorous principles of proof and of estimation:— I
							thought the award ought not to be sent back to the Commissioner— That
							would only make double labour, probably to come to the same result— With
							more dissatisfaction to the claimants; and no better prospects for the
							Public. The whole of the <pb type="ms" n="313"/>award should be allowed,
							and I had no doubt would be full indemnity for the whole of the loss.
							Crawford made little or no reply; but examined the book of the awards;
							said he knew personally most of the claimants, and declared the
							valuation of the Articles in almost every case to be at more than double
							what could have been their real value at the time of the loss— There
							were some cases however in which they were not overvalued. But he said
							he had always believed that the whole loss did not exceed in value 50000
							dollars— The President appeared to be much embarrassed in coming to a
							decision, and said it would certainly give dissatisfaction, to the
							claimants if interest should not be allowed, and to the public if it
							should— Upon which I observed that in allowing the award of the
							Commissioner, a full written statement should be presented, to be laid
							before Congress, shewing the great liberality, with which evidence had
							been admitted to prove the losses, and the excessive valuation at which
							they had been estimated; and setting forth the reasons upon which the
							allowance of interest had been refused— I believed this would be
							satisfactory to Congress and to the Nation; and if the claimants should
							press their demand for interest, Congress might make provision for the
							allowance of it. In the proposed Treaty with the Cherokees, the question
							was at what sum the Commissioners should be limited as that which must
							not be exceeded in the engagement of the United States to assume the
							payment of similar losses— The sum in the Creek Treaty was limited at
							250000 dollars, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford proposed
							that the same sum should be the limitation with the Cherokee Treaty
							though he admitted that the losses by Cherokee depredations, had not
							been probably one fifth part in value so great as those by the Creeks. I
							observed that a limitation of a Million, to cover an amount,
							unascertained, but known not to exceed a thousand dollars, would be a
							warning to all concerned to swell as much as possible the real sum to be
							allowed. I believed the limitation in the Creek Treaty had been much too
							high, and a principal cause both of the profuse allowances of the award,
							and of the further claims of interest. The President postponed his
							determination upon the whole matter— There was something said about the
							disposal of the goods at the Indian Trade factories, in consequence of
							an Act of Congress passed at their late Session, abolishing the system
							of Indian trade, which had been for some years established— After the
							Meeting I began the draft of a Convention with France; from that
							proposed by the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French
								Minister</persRef>— A <persRef ref="allen-john">M<hi

							gratified at having him as a visitor in the United States. I spoke to
							him of the scandalous contents of a pamphlet which I had received from

							adversaries—purporting to be memoirs of his life; and containing Letters
							apparently from him to the woman with whom he lived— He expressed some
							curiosity to see it, and I promised to send it to him— He spoke also of
							the recognition of the South-American Governments, and intimated that as
							no Ministers were sent to those Governments, the Recognition of them, on
							our part was not complete. He was evidently anxious to ascertain what we
							had done, and were about to do in this respect; but I did not think
							proper to gratify his curiosity. Another subject upon which he spoke,
							was the new Instructions which he had received to resume the Negotiation
							concerning the Slave-trade. He asked me, if I had been informed by
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							would not press them much in hot weather. He spoke of the Report of the
							Committee of the House of Representatives in Congress, in favour of the
							right of search, and intimated that there were other Members of the
							Administration, less averse to it than I was— I assured him that he was
							mistaken as there was no diversity of opinion in the administration
							concerning it— He hinted that some or one of them had spoken otherwise
							of it to himself; which is not impossible; but I told him if they had it
							was only by the complaisance of conversation avoiding to come to a
							direct issue, of opinion. He said he had understood me to say that I
							never would sign a Treaty agreeing to the principle of a mutual search;
							but as he had considered it merely as a strong expression of my
							individual opinion, he had not communicated it to his Government in a
							despatch, which might have been laid before Parliament— I told him that
							I had no doubt I did say so: not with an expectation that it would be
							communicated in a despatch, but merely to make known to him in the most
							explicit manner my impressions on the subject— I had no objection
							however on my own account to its being known to Parliament— My
							individual opinion was of very little consequence, as by the course of
							events in less than three years there will be a total change of the
							Administration of this Country; but I did not think there was one member

							of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this Month, neither of which I
							had seen. I mentioned to him a general outline of my political course,
							from 1793 to the present time. He said that <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef>
							had told him of a Conversation that he had some years since with
								<persRef ref="lowell-john">John Lowell</persRef>—Who said that I had

							May 1802. Upon Major Roberdeau’s coming in M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Parker went away— Roberdeau’s object was to tell me that he
							had been to Richmond to endeavour to obtain possession for the War
							Office of the late <persRef ref="tatom-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tatem’s</persRef> papers; and he brought me a Letter
							from a person having apparently no sort of right to them, yet having a
							pretension to something like an order for their delivery— I told Major
							Roberdeau that I could not authorise the delivery of those documents to
							any one— They had been left by Tatem with <persRef ref="king-josias"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> of the Department
							of State, with express injunction to deliver them to no person but
							himself— There was among them the identical copy of <persRef
								ref="mitchell-john">Mitchell’s</persRef> Map, used by the Ministers
							who negotiated the Peace of 1782. and with the boundary pencil-marked by
							them— This map belonged to the public, and the Department of the State
							was the place where it ought to be deposited. How Tatem came by it was
							never explained— He had proposed to sell these Documents to the Public,
							but there had been some disagreement about the price to be paid for
							them— Tatem, was now dead, and had left no legal representative,
							entitled to claim the property— The conclusion was natural that being
							conscious they belonged to the public, he had placed them where they
							would be in their possession— Major Roberdeau replied <pb type="ms"
								n="317"/>that had been precisely his object; but he had supposed the
							War Department was the place where it would be proper they should be
							deposited— The papers that he had found at Richmond were of no value. At
							the Office, came <persRef ref="mcilvaine-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Ilvaine</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="henshaw-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Henshaw</persRef>, with a subscription paper, for the establishment
							of an Episcopal Theological Seminary here at Washington.— The <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> summoned a Cabinet Meeting at
							one O’Clock, which was fully attended— The project of a Convention with
							France was again discussed. There was some conversation about the terms
							gross avoirdupois weights which I had used; and which <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> did not understand— He thought the term gross,
							was applicable only to the proceeds of merchandize as correlative to the
							terms not proceeds— <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wirt</persRef> concurred in this opinion—whence it is
							evident that the term gross as applied to weights is not universally
							used; and that its use in the Convention might hereafter give rise to
							questions; it must therefore omitted and other words substituted for it.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford insisted also that the 56
							and 28 pounds weights, were never called 50 and 25 pound weights,
							although they are so in the ordinances of his own State of Georgia. But
							the main object of discussion was upon the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron de Neuville’s</persRef> proposal
							of the separate Article, that the discriminating duty shall be levied
							only upon the excess of importations over the value of the exportations
							by the same vessel— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> by a process of general reasoning has
							brought himself to the belief that this Article will operate entirely in
							our favour, and will in substance abolish the discriminating duty
							entirely. He wished it therefore to be made essentially an Article of
							the convention, and not a separate Article— The Letter of <persRef
								ref="silsby-enoch">Enoch Silsby</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef>, strongly objects against this
							very article, as very unfavourable to our shipping generally, and
							especially to that of the Eastern shipping interest— But the more those
							objections were urged, the more Calhoun’s passion for the Article
							kindled, till he at last he objected against the Convention altogether
							unless the separate Article should be included in it. He thought the
							discriminating duty of $3.75 or 20 francs per occupied ton, was too
							high, unless with the deduction provided for in the separate article,
							and referred to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin’s</persRef> opinion, that we could not bear a
							discrimination of more than 1 1/2 per Cent and our determinations last
							year to go not beyond that— But I observed that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin’s opinions had since evidently leaned towards
							further concession, and I had little doubt that our shipping would win
							with the duty of 20 franks, obtain a large portion of the trade. My
							objection always was to the admission of the principle; and I had much
							less reliance than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun upon the
							operation of the separate Article in our favour. The practical merchants
							on both sides, evidently saw it in other lights. The Baron had proposed
							it, either by advice from home, or by consultation with French Merchants
							residing here. They certainly thought it would operate in favour of
							France— Silsby was alarmed at it, even supposing it only a duty of 3
							dollars. There was much consideration to be given to the course of
							trade, and although the separate Article offered a premium for a direct
							return of our vessels from France with Cargoes, it could not be obtained
							but by sacrificing greater profits by a circuitous trade. Calhoun still
							persisted with very plausible arguments on his general reasoning and
							said in reference to Silsby’s Letter, that it might injure <hi
								rend="italic">that particular part of the Country</hi>; but would
							equally benefit another—upon which I said with some temper, that I did
							not wish to injure <hi rend="italic">that particular part of the
								Country</hi>— The President proposed that the Article providing for

						<p><date>15. VI:30.</date> I received this morning a Note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> expressing some anxiety for
							the conclusion of the Negotiation with the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef>. He came to
							the office at the time appointed, and we discussed in a Conference of
							two hours the project I had sent him of a Convention. His first
							objection was to the quantities I had assumed as constituting the Ton—
							The proposal of agreeing upon certain quantities of each Article as
							constituting the Ton for the discriminating duty was his own; but I had
							increased the quantities for some of our Articles of exportation, and
							diminished it for some of those of importation— We chaffered upon the
							Articles of Wine, Brandy, Cotton, Tobacco, and Rice; but as I thought
							the object not worth contesting, I told the Baron it was impossible we
							should differ upon such trifles of detail, and finally acceded to his
							quantities in almost every case; obtaining however some concessions on
							other points from him— That upon which he made the greatest difficulty
							was to admit the charge of Brokerage as one of those to be equalized
							among the charges upon shipping, so that the discriminating duties
							should not exceed 94 cents in the United States, nor five francs in
							France— He said he should have all the Brokers in France in full outcry
							against him, and would hardly dare to land at Havre— He said also that
							this was a private charge—with which the Government had nothing to do.
							Not more I replied than Pilotage— The Government compelled our
							navigators to employ the Brokers, and would not permit our Consuls, to
							perform <pb type="ms" n="320"/>the service for them. The Brokers were
							paid for these services when performing them for their own Countrymen;
							why should they be allowed to charge more to Americans than to
							Frenchmen. It was only the excess, which they would be required to
							abandon, and that excess must be considered as a public charge since it
							was compulsively levied by the authority of the Government. And I
							reminded him of the controversy between <persRef ref="beasley-reuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley</persRef> and the
							Brokers at Havre, in which there had been a decision of a Minister of
							State in our favour; though it was afterwards reversed by a judicial
							tribunal, and we were told that the Minister had transcended his
							authority— He said that was <persRef ref="laine-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> L’Ainé</persRef>; and finally agreed
							to let the word brokerage stand, upon my consenting to allow 800 lb to
							pay for the ton of Cotton.— He objected also to the alteration I had
							made in his Article for delivering up deserting Seamen— He had copied
							his Article from that of the old Consular Convention, which authorised
							the arrest of Captains of Vessels, and others belonging to them, as well
							as of deserting Seamen, I had restricted to these last the liability to
							be arrested and delivered up— I told him there did not seem to be the
							same reason for arresting Captains and others, Officers, or not Sailors,
							and whose desertion could scarcely be a subject of apprehension— He
							assented to this; but wished that a time might be limited beyond which
							the Deserter themselves should not be detained under arrest—by which his
							real object seems to be to mark a time to the extent of which they may
							be detainable— He engaged to propose an Article as an amendment to mine,
							which I promised him would be considered. He made great difficulties,
							about accepting the reduction of the discriminating duties by one fourth
							yearly commencing at the expiration of the two years for which the
							Convention is positively to endure. He had proposed the reduction should
							be only of one eighth yearly and to commence, not till the end of the
							third year— He said that he thought a sixth would be better than a
							fourth, an eighth better than a sixth, and a tenth better than an
							eighth. He now proposed however one sixth, but I told him this provision
							was the only thing that reconciled us to the heaviness of the
							discriminating duty, which would give great dissatisfaction to the
							people of this Country; and that the President after consulting the
							administration, had thought it indispensable to insist upon this part of
							the Article; and after all it would commence only when the longer
							continuance of the Convention would be on both sides voluntary. He
							appeared finally to acquiesce, though not explicitly in the annual
							reduction of one fourth— He expressed the wish to make the two separate
							Articles, separate also from each other, to which I agreed. His last
							difficulty was that I had in the concluding Article expressed that the
							Convention was drawn up original in both languages; he said he was
							willing to do anything in that respect for which there was a precedent,
							but heretofore there had been a pretension on the part of France, of a
							preference for the French language. They no longer had any such
							pretension, but as this express assertion that both sides were original,
							was in no other Treaty, he was afraid it might make some difficulty in
							France. I referred him to the former Treaties with France; but although
							they were all signed in both languages, and all except the Consular
							Convention of 14 November 1788. expressly say so, yet all the rest
							except the Convention of 30. September 1800 say they were originally
							drawn up in French, and that says the signing in both languages shall
							not be drawn into precedent. He seemed to doubt the propriety of
							declaring the copies in both languages Original. I told him it was
							certainly no novelty in French diplomacy, and shewed him the discussion,
							between the French and British Commissaries previous to the War of 1755.
							in which the British Commissaries charge the French with having quoted
							the Treaty of Utrecht in the French translation instead of the <hi
								rend="italic">original</hi> Latin— To which the French Commissaries
							replied that the French copy was <pb type="ms" n="321"/>original as well
							as the Latin— Well, said the Baron, its avoient tort. He consented
							however, after I had shewn him this example, to insert the word Original
							at the top of the Treaty, on both sides, as was done in our last Treaty
							with Spain— With regard to the Separate Article stipulating only the
							excess of importations over the exportations, as liable to the
							discriminating duty, I told him the consequence would be, that not one
							French vessel would over pay the discriminating duty in this Country,
							for they all will carry away Cargoes of as much or more value than they
							will bring. He said he believed the effect would also be that few or
							none of our vessels would pay the duty in France; but then their
							commerce would gain what their navigations might lose by it; and he was
							so satisfied that by consenting to reduce the discriminating duty to 20
							franks the French Government had entirely given up the navigating
							question, that he wished to secure something for any other interest in
							its stead. It was after all only for two years, and in the course of
							that time the Sanford Law, which by the way he thought rather indiscreet
							would shew all the results— He said they had now a similar Law, and
							would have like returns in France. He also spoke of the complaint
							against <persRef ref="stockton-robert">Lieutenant Stockton</persRef>,
							and the Letter of apology, which he had requested on that subject. I
							told him Lieutenant Stockton was now here and had made a report of the
							affair to the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>; a copy of which I should send him, with a Letter
							which I hoped would prove satisfactory— He promised to send me a final
							draught of the Convention in both languages, with the modifications, as
							now agreed upon by us, to-morrow. <persRef ref="vail-eugene">M<hi

							But he declined agreeing to it; said his Instructions would not admit of

							he had returns from various places which made it only 1300 and 1400lb.
							All the accounts I had consulted made it near 2000 and one, much more.
							We agreed to have the copies of the Convention, made out leaving those

						<p><date>19 V:30.</date> This subject of the fisheries, is absorbing so much
							of my attention, that it encroaches upon my other necessary occupations—
							But I cannot give too deep attention to it—“What in me is dark,
							illumine—what is low, raise and support”—in pursuing my Letter to
								<persRef ref="walsh-robert">Walsh</persRef>, I lost my time for

								>President’s</persRef>, I met <persRef ref="menou-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Menou</persRef>, who was going to
							my office— He said the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron de
								Neuville</persRef> had heard the President was going to Virginia;
							and as he was going himself soon to France, he wished before the
							President’s departure, to have an Audience of him to take leave— At one
							O’Clock I presented <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Manuel Torres</persRef> as Charge d’Affaires, from the
							Republic of Colombia, to the President— This incident was chiefly
							interesting, as being the first formal act of recognition of an
							Independent South-American Government— Torres who has scarcely life in
							him, to walk alone, was deeply affected by it. He spoke of the great
							importance to the Republic of Colombia, of this recognition, and of his
							assurance that it would give extraordinary gratification to <persRef
								ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef>. The President invited him to
							be seated, sat down by him, and spoke to him with kindness which moved
							him even to tears— The President assured him of the great interest taken
							by the United States in the welfare and success of his Country; and of
							the particular satisfaction with which he received him as its first
							representative— The Audience was as usual, only of a few minutes, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres on going away gave me a
							printed copy of the Constitution of Colombia. I told the President of
							the French Minister’s desire to have an audience to take leave, which he
							promised to give before he should go to Virginia, He also directed a
							Cabinet Meeting for to-morrow at One O’Clock, to consider again the
							question whether Ministers shall immediately be sent to the
							South-American Governments. On returning to the Office, I wrote a
							paragraph to be inserted in the National Intelligencer to-morrow,
							announcing the reception of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres by the

						<p><date>20 V:45.</date> Cabinet Meeting at one O’Clock— <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>, being indisposed, did not attend, and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> is
							absent from the City— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> were present— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> proposed again the question whether Ministers
							should forth-with be sent to the Southern Republics— The opinions of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson were both against the measure— Calhoun’s chiefly
							because there appeared to be no urgent necessity for the measure, and
							because there was no strong manifestation of public sentiment for it— He
							observed there were only two or three Newspapers, and those not leading
							Prints, that were clamorous for it, and in general the public acquiesced
							in the course now pursued by the Executive. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson’s objection arose from a doubt of the power of the
							President to appoint a Minister during the recess of the Senate— I
							observed that my opinion had been that we should <hi rend="italic"
								>receive</hi> a Minister from the South-American Governments before
							sending one— As this opinion however had not been much countenanced, I
							did not wish to hold it too pertinaciously; and with regard to the
							Republic of Colombia, there was less reason to be punctilious, as having
							received from them a Charge d’Affaires, the mere appointment of a person
							of higher rank, to go there, would be less of a departure from the
							regular order of establishing diplomatic intercourse, than it would be
							to be first in making <hi rend="italic">any </hi><pb type="ms" n="324"
							/>diplomatic appointment— I should not object to the appointment of a
							Minister on that account, and I thought a Minister to the Republic of
							Colombia, ought to be appointed now, or at the Meeting of Congress— I
							supposed that a Treaty of Commerce might be negotiated with that
							Republic; but I should not propose or desire to obtain by it any
							exclusive advantages. Mutual advantages and reciprocity are all that we
							ought to ask, and all that we can be willing to grant— As to running a
							race with England to snatch from these new Nations, some special
							privilege or monopoly, I thought it neither a wise nor an honest
							policy.— Do what we can, the commerce with South-America will be much
							more useful and important to Great Britain than to us, and Great Britain
							will be a power vastly more important to them than we: for the simple
							reason, that she has the power of supplying their wants, by her
							manufactures— We have few such supplies to furnish them, and in articles
							of export are their competitors. Yet I was not apprehensive that England
							would obtain from them any exclusive advantages to our prejudice.— They
							had no partialities in favour of England, they were jealous of her—
							England would be in no hurry to send Ministers to them, unless prompted
							by our example, and for fear of us— The British Ministry were
							embarrassed by our recognition of the South-Americans; as was apparent
							from a late debate in the House of Commons— The French Government were
							equally so, and <persRef ref="zea-francisco">Zea</persRef> had taken the
							most effective means of compelling their acknowledgment, by letting them
							know that those who should acknowledge would have all their trade. As to
							the question of appointment during the recess of the Senate—The <hi
								rend="italic">words</hi> of the Constitution were against the
							exercise of the Power— The <hi rend="italic">reason </hi>for the words
							is in its favour. At the close of the Session of the Senate before the
							last, they had no such scruple of the power of the President to appoint
							during the recess; for at the last hour of their Session they passed a
							Resolution recommending such an appointment— At their late Session,
							however, a different doctrine did prevail with them; and as with it,
							some temper had been mingled, it was very probable if an appointment
							should now be made they would pass a negative upon the nomination— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson said he had no doubt they would
							reject it— That at the last Session they had been unanimous in their
							opinion against the President’s right. The President read a passage of a
							Letter that he had received from <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> upon the Subject— It
							mentioned that there had been an occasion upon which the question had
							been thoroughly examined by the Executive, and determined in favour of
							the right. But did not say when; now under what administration— Nothing
							definitive was resolved upon; but the President desired me to converse
							further with <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Torres</persRef>; and ascertain whether a Minister will probably be
							sent from Colombia here— After Calhoun and Thompson were gone—I proposed
							to the President, that the Mission to the Republic of Colombia, whether
							to be appointed now, or at the Meeting of Congress, should be offered to
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>— I thought it doubtful whether he would accept
							it—very probable that he would make no delicate or generous use of
							it—and that the comments upon the offer, both of his partizans and of
							others would be various, and in many cases invidious. But upon the whole
							the effect upon the public would be favourable— He wanted the offer— The
							Western Country wished it might be made to him. His talents were
							eminent— His claims from public service considerable— The Republic of
							Colombia and particularly <persRef ref="bolivar-simon"
							>Bolivar</persRef>, with whom he has been in Correspondence, will be
							flattered by his appointment, or even by information that he had the
							offer of it— In the relations to be established between us and that
							Republic M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s talents might be highly
							useful; and I did not apprehend any danger from them— The President
							appeared to be well disposed to take this course; he said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s conduct towards him and his
							Administration had not been friendly or generous, but he was disposed
							entirely to overlook that— He stood upon ground quite independent of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and as he had never needed his
							support, he had never felt the want of it. He would consider of the <pb
								type="ms" n="325"/>proposal to offer him the Mission, and was not
							indisposed to it— As to myself Clay’s conduct has been always hostile to
							me, and generally insidious— From the time of the Ghent Negotiation, I
							have been in the way of his ambition, and by himself and his
							subordinates he has done all in his power to put me out of it— In
							pursuing a generous policy towards him as an enemy and a rival, I do
							some violence to my inclination, and shall be none the better treated by
							him, but I look to personal considerations only to discard them; and
							regard only the public interests— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams</persRef>, with <persRef

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Physick</persRef>— About nine
							this Evening, for the first time in my life I saw through my Opera Glass

							my Letter to the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French
								Minister</persRef>, about <persRef ref="stockton-robert"
								>Stockton’s</persRef> seizures should be written, to see the Baron
							and shew it to him so as to arrange the matter to his satisfaction to
							avoid a Correspondence which might delay the conclusion of the
							Convention— Now this was undertow, through <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, or through
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Navy— De Neuville has worked through this Negotiation, chiefly by
							such means— He has wormed us out of a Convention, which will give great
							dissatisfaction here, and far less favourable to us than I could have
							obtained but for this countermining: Crawford has all along hung like a
							dead-weight upon the Negotiation— A bad Convention was precisely the
							thing suited to his interest— A good one would have been highly
							creditable to the Department of State. He has invariably been for
							conceding every thing: for agreeing to every thing demanded by France;
							and now he is for making humiliating concessions upon the complaint
							against Stockton— Thompson has not the same motives, but there is a
							Secretary of the French Legation intimate in his family, and that gives
							access to the President through another whispering gallery— Such is the
							way of the world— Winding stairs in every direction. I am sure the
							President has been beset by a Back-door, from this Note— It came too
							late however— My Letter to the Baron was already despatched—of which I
							am glad; for it is very obvious, that after writing him a Letter quite
							sufficiently apologetic, to send for him, shew it to him, and ask him if
							that was enough, would be no other than an invitation to him to insist
							upon more. I called upon <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres</persRef>, at <persRef
								ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel; and found him anxious to
							return to Philadelphia, immediately. He said he had no medical
							assistance here and was not comfortably lodged. If there was therefore
							no objection on the part of this Government, he should be glad to go
							to-morrow Morning— I said there was no reason for detaining him to the
							injury of his health, and the President would wish him to consult that
							altogether. He said he had again received instructions to propose a
							Treaty of Commerce, founded altogether upon principles of reciprocity. I
							told him that the proposal would be received with the most friendly
							consideration and asked him if he had prepared his representation upon
							the subject. He had not, but said he would send it to me from
							Philadelphia. He said a Minister would undoubtedly soon be sent to this
							Country from the Republic of Colombia. He thought it would be <persRef
								ref="salazar-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Salazar</persRef>— I shewed him the paper sent me by <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">General Smith</persRef> of Baltimore, containing
							the Ordinance of the Congress, in which a discrimination of duties is
							made in favour of merchandize imported from <hi rend="italic"
								>Europe</hi>, and observing that <pb type="ms" n="326"/>this
							discrimination was disadvantageous to the United States requested him to
							write to his Government concerning it, which he promised he would. He
							said he was sure it was a mere inadvertence not intended to operate
							against the United States— He had no doubt but that importations from
							the United States were under that Article of the Ordinance considered as
							Articles imported from Europe, but he would nevertheless write
							immediately, and was persuaded all doubt upon the subject would be
							removed, as soon as the case should be stated. I called at the Office of
							the Franklin Insurance Company, and at the Metropolis Bank— At the
							Office, I received a Letter from <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">C. A.
								Rodney</persRef>, a Senator <hi rend="strikethrough">from</hi> of

							Shipping and would accept his offer of putting it down, at 1600lb
							avoirdupois which is 100lb more than he had fixed it. He chaffered about

							but intimated that my Letter contained no offer of satisfaction, and
							said he should reply to it. He appeared rather out of humour with it,
							and half-hinting that he should insist upon something more— I said I
							supposed he would not wish to exact from us any thing humiliating. We
							had assured him that Lieutenant Stockton seized the vessels, mistaking
							them for Americans— That to avoid any such mistakes for the future
							express orders had been issued to all our naval Officers to seize no

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilcocks was very obnoxious there. That
							his connections had been with Spaniards— That his Letter; (which was
							published) had given great offence, and the people there were beaucoup
							enragé against him; though mon general, out of the kindness of his
							disposition, was willing to overlook what he had said of him— One of
							Yturbide’s Letters observed that it enclosed an answer to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>; and
							desired Cortes to use his influence, that the person sent out as
							Minister there might be friendly to them. Cortes and Bradburn went from
							the Office with Meade to the President’s— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. J.
								Ingersoll</persRef> of Philadelphia, was at the Office, with
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles2">his son</persRef>—and returned me
							de Stack on Consuls; a book he had borrowed of me last Summer— At One
							O’Clock, the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, the French Minister came, with <persRef
								ref="menou-charles">de Menou</persRef>, and we executed four Copies
							of the Commercial Convention in both languages— Two copies had been made
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ironside, at the Office, and two at
							the French Legation— Some small corrections were necessary to make them
							all uniform— The alternative was preserved throughout—both copies were
							signed and sealed by both parties, and both as originals— In the
							examination of the copies, the Baron held one of ours, and I one of
							theirs; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent the other of theirs and
							Menou the other of ours. Menou read the French copy, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent ours. We found the usual
							inconveniences of sealing the inside of the papers with wax and in more
							than usual degree, as there were two Separate Articles, each separately
							executed. I used my Constellation Seal. The Baron observed to Menou that
							this day was my festival day—S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							day—the Baptist. He said his own name was John too; but from the
							Evangelist: as we sealed on both sides of the paper, it happened in one
							of the copies, that by the turning of a leaf his seal and mine adhered
							together so that they could not be parted— I told him it was <hi
								rend="italic">de bon augure</hi>, which he took as a compliment. We
							interchanged the copies he taking one of his own and one of ours, and we
							the same— <persRef ref="debresson-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> de Bresson</persRef> afterwards came, and offered to
							take any despatches for France— He goes as a Messenger with the
							Convention, and said he expected to return here with the ratification
							before the commencement of the Session of Congress in December— I made a
							draft of a Proclamation of the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, suspending the operation of the Act of
							Congress <pb type="ms" n="328"/>of 15. May, and other discriminating
							duties, upon French vessels and merchandize imported in them, from the
								1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of October until the end of the
							next Session of Congress— But a question occurred as to the extent of
							the President’s authority, upon which I might consult him— I spent the
							Evening at <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thornton’s</persRef> where there was a small party—among
							the rest a <persRef ref="thompson-unknown6">Captain Thompson</persRef>;
							of the Mexican service. He came with Bradburn— The D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> was over-inquisitive about the envoy as
							he called him; and to know in what capacity he came— I told him at last,
							in none at-all— He was a Captain in the Navy. <persRef

								ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller Anderson</persRef>, together with
							the President’s opinion, which he said he supposed would do. He said
							again he had always been of opinion that the Law was on my side, but he

						<p><date>25. V:30.</date> At one O’Clock, I presented the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de Neuville</persRef> to the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> to take leave— He
							was attended by the <persRef ref="menou-charles">Count de
								Menou</persRef>, <persRef ref="hersant-michael">Hersant</persRef>;
							and <persRef ref="laborie-unknown">Laborie</persRef>— He addressed the
							President in a set Speech in substance much the same as that which he
							had made two years ago. He said that in 1807. he had found a refuge in
							this Country, as an exile; and then had formed a strong and affectionate
							attachment to it. That in 1815. after the return of Peace and order, in
							his own Country, the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">King</persRef> who like
								<persRef ref="louis-xvi">his brother</persRef>, had always felt the
							most friendly dispositions towards the United States had cast his eyes
							upon him, for his representative here; knowing him to <hi rend="italic"
								>be </hi>the sincere and faithful friend of both Countries— That his
							conduct here had been invariably inspired by those Sentiments. That as
							his Mission to Brazil had not taken place he had not received from his
							Government Letters of recredence, and he chose therefore now to take
							only a temporary and not a final leave. That if a sincere and earnest
							attachment to this Country, and a heartfelt respect for the virtues of
							its chief magistrate could give him any claim to his good opinion, he
							was conscious of deserving it— That the Count de Menou was the person
							whom he should present as the Charge d’Affaires of France, during his
							absence; and he would be the faithful interpreter of the same Sentiments
							on the part of the French Government as those he had expressed— The
							President answered without premeditation—that he was extremely gratified
							to hear the expression from <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. That for the
							King his Sovereign, the United States, as well as from his brother had
							never received any thing but kindness— That we remember it, and will
							remember it— That our most earnest desire is to be upon terms of the
							most perfect cordiality with France— That as for himself we should
							always recollect his residence here, with pleasure— His conduct had
							always been satisfactory, and such as to warrant the perfect sincerity
							of what he had now said— That he the President rejoiced at the
							Convention which he had concluded with us, and hoped it would lead to
							the best Understanding between the two Countries— That as to the
							discussions which had taken place with him, we had always considered him
							as maintaining the interest of his Country— We had been in similar
							situations ourselves— We considered the earnestness which he had
							manifested, as merely the discharge of his duty, and retained no unkind
							feeling towards him on that account. As to the affair of the seizure of
							the French vessels by <persRef ref="stockton-robert">lieutenant
								Stockton</persRef>, we much regretted it. The orders to our officers
							had only authorised them to capture American vessels. It was a mistake—
							Orders had been since sent to all our naval officers, to capture no
							vessel under a foreign flag, and we had made to France all the
							reparation in our power— With regard to himself, as he was going home,
							he would be assured that we wished him well; and I should write to
								<unclear>. . .</unclear> Minister in France to the same effect— We
							should also take pleasure in communicating with the Count de Menou, who
							he had no doubt would continue to cherish and promote the most friendly
							relations between the two Countries— The Baron then took his leave, with
							his <pb type="ms" n="329"/>suite, and as I followed him from the
							Drawing-Room into the next apartment, asked me, if he could have, what
							the President had just said to him, in writing. I said I would mention
							it to the President, and observed that it would then be necessary that
							he should also communicate his speech in writing. On returning to the
							President I told him of the Baron’s request, and the President said he
							would give the substance of it in writing, as far as he could recollect
							it— The Portuguese Chargé d’Affaires <persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph"
								>Amado</persRef> came to the Office, with the Consul General
								<persRef ref="pereira-joaquin">Joaquin Barroso Pereira</persRef>,
							whom he presented, to take his place; he having received permission to
							return to Lisbon. He also informed me that <persRef
								ref="dacosta-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Da
								Costa</persRef>, whom he had presented to me last March, was now
							gone to Brazil. He asked also when he could be presented to the
							President to take leave; upon which I promised to take the President’s
							directions and inform him— The President approved of the Proclamation to
							issue with the French Convention— I called at the Treasury Office, and
							read it also to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, who approved it,
							and promised to transmit orders to the Collectors of the Customs, to
							conform to it— We all thought that the President’s authority to suspend
							all discriminating duties, against France included that of suspending
							them in part— <persRef ref="obrien-richard">Captain O’Brien</persRef>
							came about his Accounts, and I wrote a Letter of directions to the 5<hi

								ref="rodney-caesar">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. A.

							are dissolved by War— He was to start on his return to Wilmington, this
							Evening— I received a Letter of painful advices from my <persRef

								ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef>. <persRef ref="bourne-george">George S.
								Bourne</persRef> came to solicit in person, an appointment as

							now for the fourth time comes in person. I told him that none of those
							appointments would yet be made. He then wished to be admitted as a Cadet
							at the military Academy of West-Point. I referred him to the <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, but expressed a
							doubt, whether, as the object of that Institution was Education, he
							having already gone through the University at Cambridge could be
							admitted there. I wrote for him however a Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun. <persRef ref="dickins-asbury"
								>Asbury Dickins</persRef> brought me a Letter, and two Packets from
								<persRef ref="hawker-john">John Hawker</persRef>, formerly Consul of
							the United States at Plymouth in England. <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef> the Swedish
							Charge d’Affaires, came and spoke of a Note which I lately received from
							him, enclosing the copy of a Letter to him from <persRef
								ref="engestrom-lars">Count Engeström</persRef> declaring the
							determination of the Swedish Government not to admit a Consul of the
							United States at the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Bartholomew. I told him I should answer his note and hoped his
							Government would reconsider their determination. He recurred to the
							reasons assigned by Engeström, that foreign Consuls were excluded from
							the Island, because it was a Colony; and because during the French
							Revolution a Consul from France had been admitted there, and had proved
							very <pb type="ms" n="330"/>troublesome by his turbulence. I observed
							that neither of these reasons could justify the refusal to receive an
							American Consul at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartholomew’s. That
							European Governments excluded foreign Consuls from their Colonies,
							because foreign Commerce with them was interdicted— Where there was no
							commerce, there could be no need of a Consul— But where Commerce was
							allowed the Consul followed of course— As much so as an army implied a
							General— Now the Swedish Government not only allowed foreign Commerce
							with S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartholomew’s, but in the Treaty
							between the United States and Sweden, that Island was specially named.
							Its inhabitants their vessels and their merchandize, were entitled to
							the same advantages in the United States as those of Sweden; and the
							Citizens of the United States were entitled to the same in the Island as
							in Sweden— The province of a Consul was to secure in effect to the
							People of his nation the real enjoyment in foreign Ports, of the
							commercial advantages to which they were entitled by Treaty or by the
							Laws of Nations, and the People of the United States, had in fact more
							commerce with the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartholomew
							than with the whole kingdom of Sweden— I saw therefore no more reason
							for excluding an American Consul from S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							Bartholomews, than a Swedish Consul from New-York; and if American
							Citizens were denied the benefit of an official protector in the island,
							why should the people of the island have the right to the support of a
							Swedish Consul in the United States. The Baron had little to say in
							reply to all this; and admitted that he had thought a Consul would be
							admitted, though he supposed the Government reserved to itself the right
							of granting the Exequatur— <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> of the Intelligencer
							came to propose that the President’s Proclamation and the Convention
							with France, which were published in the Paper this morning should be
							printed over again the day after to-morrow; the publication of this
							morning, particularly the French part of the Convention, being full of
							Errors— There is also a material error in the Proclamation itself, for
							which I am myself responsible, the draft being incorrect. Neither the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> nor <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> had discovered it; nor did I till I read the

							of to-morrow, that the publication of this Morning was incorrect— I took

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> unwell— The question

									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l. </hi>Fenwick</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="house-james">House</persRef>,<space/>and <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">Eustis</persRef>. They were nominated, to rank
							from 25. April 1822. to the command of particular Regiments— The Senate
							divided the questions; advised and consented to the first member of the
							nomination, and negatived the date of the rank— A desultory discussion
							took place and various questions arising from those transactions— Had
							the Senate a right, to divide the nomination by the President into two
							parts? To take two questions upon it? to confirm one and reject the
							other? Was it not equivalent to the rejection of the whole?— What was
							the first member of the nomination &amp; was it the simple nomination as
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>?<hi rend="superscript"/>or as
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l. </hi>of the specified regiment?
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> thought it was the mere nomination as Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l. </hi>and likened it to a nomination by the
							President of a person as Minister to France, upon which the Senate
							should advise and consent to him as Minister to England. <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> thought at first, that this was equivalent to a
							rejection of the nomination; and I inclined to the same opinion. Calhoun
							considered the Senate as having undertaken to decide that the
							Commissions should rank from the time of the new arrangement of the army
							last Summer— But upon further examination I found, that the Resolutions
							of the Senate explicitly confirmed the nominations, not only of the
							rank, but to the regiments specially designated, and that they negatived
							nothing more than the date of rank. They designated no other date of
							rank, and clearly could not by the Constitution— <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Calhoun for
							some time insisted that in the Report of the Committee of the Senate,
							and in other proceedings of the Senate itself connected with the
							subject, they had undertaken to designate the time when the Commissions
							should commence, and a different arrangement of corps— All however at
							last assented that the confirmation was of every thing but the date of
							rank— And that the Commissions might issue dated from the day of the
							Confirmations— The President once or twice intimated the wish to have
							the opinion of each member of the Cabinet in writing, as it was a
							Constitutional question; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun to
							the last urged the danger of the precedent on the part of the Senate;
							which he condemned, as an attempt to usurp upon the President, the right
							of nomination itself. The President also expressed something of a
							similar apprehension— I finally observed to him that by dating the
							Commissions from the day of the Confirmation nothing would be conceded
							to the Senate— It will be merely assuming that they have confirmed the
							nominations— The <hi rend="italic">date</hi> of rank may be considered
							as a point unadjusted between the President and the Senate; and not
							essential to the appointment— By which means a further and most
							unpleasant misunderstanding and altercation with the Senate will be
							avoided— If the President should finally decide to consider the
							nominations as confirmed, and date the Commissions from the day of the
							Senate’s confirmation, it would be best perhaps not to require written
							opinions from each member <pb type="ms" n="332"/>of the administration,
							but if he should consider the nominations as rejected, it will
							undoubtedly be necessary— The President said he would reflect upon it
							and come to his decision at leisure— There was also among the papers a
							Letter from <persRef ref="bissell-daniel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.
								</hi>Bissell</persRef>, and of the Officers left
								<unclear>out</unclear> of the army by the arrangements of the board
							of Officers last Summer— His Letter denies their right to leave him out
							and claims to be still in the service— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford said Bissell was a man of bad character; being a notorious
							gambler, and having ruined many young men officers, by enticing them
							into the same vice; by inviting them to his own marquee to play and then
							fleecing them. That complaint had been made against him for these
							practices, some years since, and he had avowed and justified them—
							Calhoun said he had made a handsome fortune, by the ruin, of many
							Officers— No express decision was made upon his Letter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thompson said that the President, could
							put an end to all his questions by dismissing him from the army; but the
							President said he did not wish to come to such extremities, without

								>Pleasonton</persRef> had now taken up his accounts more freely than
							before he had seen me— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> came,
							and is much reduced by an intermittent fever— <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> had written me a Note yesterday requesting to see
							me— I appointed this day at one, and he came— It was to take up the
							subject of the Slave-trade— He said from the communications of <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Londonderry</persRef> to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> it
							appeared that his Lordship believed that one main difficulty which had
							been made on our part to the arrangements proposed by Great-Britain
							might be removed—that is the trial by the mixed courts, and he hoped
							therefore that we should be willing to yield the other point, the
							limited and reciprocal right of search— I told him that any proposition
							that he had to make upon that subject would be received with the most
							respectful and friendly consideration— He gave me however to understand
							that he had no proposition to make and he evaded answering the question
							which I put, what was Lord Londonderry’s proposed substitute for the
							mixed Courts? With some circumlocution he came finally to the statement
							that he expected a new proposition from us— This had so much the
							appearance of a trick, that it heated me— I said to him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning there is nothing I like so much as
							a strait forward course— We have seen no cause to change our opinions
							upon any of the points which have been so fully discussed between us— We
							have no new proposition therefore to make— It is one thing to make a
							proposition, and another to ask that a proposition should be made— When
							the Marquess of Londonderry therefore gave notice to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, that it was proposed to resume the
							Correspondence upon the Slave-trade, we certainly expected that the
							British Government was prepared to make some new proposition to us. We
							are not prepared to make any to them— I could make none without
							authority from the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>; and
							the President I was persuaded would authorize none, without consulting
							all the members of the administration— He asked me then whether I
							declined discussing the matter further with him— I said no—I was willing
							to hear, and would faithfully report to the President any thing that he
							wished to say to me— He took from his pocket some prohibited documents
							laid before Parliament—correspondence from British Officers at Sierra
							Leone, containing lists of Slave vessels examined on the Coast of
							Africa, under French and Portuguese colours, and actively engaged in the
							Slave-trade—and he launched into a strong and general invective against
							the trade. I observed that in the lists contained in the papers, there
							was not a single vessel under American Colours, and alledged this
							Circumstance as a proof of the efficacy of the measures adopted by us to
							suppress the use of our flag in the trade, which is all that could be
							accomplished by our agreeing to the right of search and the mixed
							Courts. I remarked that it was evident from these papers that if we had
							two years ago, signed Treaties with Great-Britain, like those which she
							had obtained <pb type="ms" n="333"/>from Spain, Portugal and the
							Netherlands, there would not have been one Slave-vessel the less upon
							these lists— Search and the mixed Courts therefore, would have effected
							nothing for the suppression of the trade, which has not been effected
							without them— He said that a main purpose for which they wished to
							obtain our assent to the principle of search, was that it might be urged
							as an example to France— I said that we should rather wish France to
							adhere to her principles in this respect than to give them up— He asked
							if I could conceive of a greater and more atrocious evil than this
							Slave-trade? I said yes—admitting the right of search by foreign
							Officers of our vessels upon the seas in time of Peace—for that would be
							making Slaves of ourselves— We went over this ground again as we had
							often done before, repeating on both sides the same arguments as before;
							he particularly repeated that many persons in this Country were in
							favour of conceding this right of search, and alleged the two successive
							Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives in its favour. I
							merely said that there were other views upon which those reports could
							be accounted for— I finally desired him to leave with me his
							Parliamentary printed paper, which I wished to take to the President, to
							whom I promised him to make a full report of this conference— We
							conversed also, upon the Report of the Commissioners under the fifth
							Article of the Treaty of Ghent—upon the Convention recently signed by
							me, and the French Minister; upon the question of arbitration depending
							before the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>; and
							upon certain changes made by the <persRef ref="buchanan-james3">British
								Consul at New-York</persRef> of which the merchants there complain,
							concerning which I had received in March a Letter from <persRef
								ref="bayard-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard</persRef>, President of the Chamber of Commerce in that City.
							This Letter in the hurry of business had been overlooked and forgotten;
							and this morning I received a Letter from <persRef ref="king-charles"
								>Charles King</persRef> reminding me of it— I gave M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard’s Letter, and told him that the charges made by the Consul at
							New-York, were not made by other Consuls, and that we did not allow our
							own Consuls abroad to make them; although they received no Salaries— The
							merchants considered it a charge upon their commerce— If he could cause
							it to cease, it would render an application to his Government, thro’
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush unnecessary. He said though it
							was properly the business of the Consul General; as <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>
							was sick, he would attend to it. He said Lord Londonderry had understood
							it as our desire, that the subject of the difference, between the
							Commissioners under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the
							Treaty of Ghent, should be treated here, for which he had therefore been
							empowered: but he had already informed me, that the British Government
							could not concede the points maintained by their Commissioner on this
							Article, as they had on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article— I
							said that my instruction to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had
							merely been to consult the British Government to ascertain whether they
							were disposed to make an effort to adjust this difference by a
							negotiation, before resorting to the arbitration stipulated by the
							Treaty. I had not expressed any preference, as to the place of the
							negotiation— Though as the Commission had been held here; and as all the
							documents were in this Country, there would obviously be a convenience
							in pursuing the subject here. But I was not prepared to take it up
							myself, and it would take weeks if not Months of investigation to make
							myself master of it— I had not contemplated being charged with it
							myself, but that it should be re<unclear>ferr</unclear>ed to
							Commissioners who might have no other public duty to absorb their time,
							and with powers to propose mutual concessions to the two Governments—
							Upon our recent convention with France, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning discovered some curiosity and made some shrewd remarks— He said
							that although it purported only to begin from the first of October, yet
							by the Article stipulating to refund the duties levied upon the
							respective tonnage and cargoes, by the existing Laws, it would in effect
							begin from the time of the signature of the Convention— I said there
							might be a question whether the Article for refunding the extra duties,
							could be construed to apply to duties levied after the <pb type="ms"
								n="334"/>signature of the Convention— By its Letter it applied only
							to those levied before— He observed then that he believed one of the
							most difficult things in the world was to draw up the Articles of a
							Treaty and particularly to avoid stipulating more than is intended— And
							he cited the Article which we have in arbitration before the Emperor of
							Russia, as a memorable example of this. For the British
							Plenipotentiaries never would have agreed to the Article, if they had
							been aware that it was susceptible of the construction upon which we now
							insist— I said it was certainly then the fault of <persRef
								ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goulburn</persRef> who were intelligent men, and who were bound to
							see the purport of our proposed amendment. I added that we should not
							have signed the Peace without it, which he seemed inclined to doubt. I
							told him they had no right to carry away private property or to
							emancipate Slaves— He said banteringly that if he were at War, he would
							emancipate every Slave he could find— Then said I, I would never make
							Peace with you, till you paid for them— But who are you, to talk of
							emancipating Slaves— He said, they had none— And what are your West
							India Islands? What would you say if we should land in Jamaica, and
							emancipate your Slaves? Ay but said he, we do not mean to let you land
							in Jamaica— Not if you can help it said I— Do no right; and take no
							wrong I have heard was the English Sailor’s Motto— This conversation
							lasted about three hours, and as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							went out the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> came in with the <persRef ref="menou-charles"
								>Count de Menou</persRef>, whom he presented as Chargé d’Affaires of
							France. He began immediately upon <persRef ref="stockton-robert"
								>Lieutenant Stockton’s</persRef> publication, in the National
							Intelligencer, on the very same page with the Convention; and complained
							of it bitterly— He said that at the moment of his going away, he was
							very unwilling to complain, and he was highly gratified, with the
							message that the President had sent him; but that this publication
							appearing on the same page, in the same paper with the Convention, would
							have in this Country and in Europe the appearance as if it had been a
							part of the bargain— That it would prejudice the tribunals against the
							persons, criminated in Stockton’s Letters, and take from them the chance
							of having a fair trial— That he was convinced two of the vessels had
							been upon voyages wholly innocent, and that although he was bound to
							take Lieutenant Stockton’s word of honour, that he had taken them for
							American vessels there were circumstances leading strongly to the
							conclusion, that he was willing to take them, knowing them to be French—
							I told him that the publication had been made by Stockton himself
							without the knowledge of any member of the Government; that he had done
							it only for his own vindication, he having been severely censured in the
							newspapers for having made those captures; that he had only used the
							liberty of the press, and that his publication had been much less
							exceptionable as related to the French Government, than that of <persRef
								ref="edon-unknown">Captain Edon</persRef> in the Moniteur last
							Winter, against the President’s Message to Congress— He said Edon’s
							paper had not been published in the Moniteur; and that Edon was not an
							Officer in the service— Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Stockton he
							thought deserved punishment, for publishing an official paper without
							the permission of his Government— I said that might be an offence
							against the discipline of the service, for which he was accountable to
							his Government— He finally said he did not wish to <hi rend="italic"
								>write</hi> to me on the subject, but hoped, I should give him some
							explanation concerning it before his departure. He left me, in rather an
							indifferent humour—this incident being very much of what the French call
							a <hi rend="italic">Contretems—</hi> Evening walk with <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, as far as <persRef
								ref="porter-david">Commodore Porter’s</persRef>. I called at
								<persRef ref="gadsden-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gadsden’s</persRef> lodgings; but he was gone to Alexandria. I
							called also at the President’s, and informed him of the substance of my
							Conversations with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning and with the
							Baron de Neuville.</p>
