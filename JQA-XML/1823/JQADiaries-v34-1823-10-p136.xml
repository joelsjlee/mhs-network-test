								<persRef ref="austin-unknonwn">Captain Austin</persRef> with Sailing
								<persRef ref="hutson-unknown">Master Hutson</persRef> came out from

							this Will, mention is made of five Sons and one daughter— But Henry

							ancestors— Had their lives been recorded as minutely as my own has been

							look into them— The absence of information stimulates curiosity which
							can never be gratified— Laborious, frugal, and honest lives, may be
							safely ascribed to them all— May nothing worse ever be said of mine, or
							of those of my Children— We took leave of my aged and venerable <persRef
								ref="adams-john">father</persRef> and came into Boston. Stopp’d on
							the way at <persRef ref="eustis-william">Governor Eustis’s</persRef>,
							and bade Adieu to him. He said to me, that he would wish to serve me by

							friendly disposition, and told him if I should have occasion for his
							friendship, I would write to him— If he had told me what were the
							intrigues against me, known to him, it would have been a proof of
							friendship instead of a profession; but I asked no questions— We came to
								<persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							was at first so to them; but became an object of curiosity to some of
							them, and partly of surprize, till at last one of them asked me, if my

							the Clergyman of the place—from Romans 2.6.7.8.9. “Who will render to

							unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey
							unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,—Tribulation and anguish upon
							every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the
							Gentile.” An exposition of the retributive justice of God, proportioned
							to the good or evil deeds of man— After the morning service the Banns
							were published of a couple intending marriage— <persRef
								ref="boylston-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s
								son</persRef>, and <persRef ref="boylston-sally">his wife</persRef>

							spent the Evening with us— <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston</persRef> this morning shewed
							me the Bond, to which his signature was obtained by fraud; and which a
							Jury, after trial in the Supreme Court, found on that account to be not
							his deed— It involved his whole fortune, and if it had been found valid
							by the Jury, would have utterly ruined him. He told me the story of it,
							and of the years of anguish and terror which he endured while it was
							suspended over his head— <persRef ref="otis-harrison">H. G.
								Otis</persRef> who was Counsel to Boylston, at the time when the
							Bond was signed is deeply implicated in this transaction— The Bond is in
							his hand writing, and Boylston is deeply convinced that Otis was privy
							to the fraud, by which the signature was obtained— It was done, by
							slipping it in, among several other papers to be executed, and was
							signed by him among the rest, without being aware of what it contained—
							I asked <pb type="ms" n="138"/>how it happened, and he said he had
							called, I think at Otis’s Office, to sign two or three Deeds prepared by
							Otis; but supposing he knew their Contents entirely; being much hurried,
							and having met with an accident of dislocating his arm shortly before,
							he had signed the papers without reading them critically over, and
							without a conception of the engagement which it afterwards appeared had
							been smuggled into it, that he would indemnify the creditors of the late
								<persRef ref="gill-moses2">Moses Gill</persRef>, for all his debts—
							He was thunderstruck, when years afterwards an action was brought
							against him upon this bond; and Otis had no better advice to give him,
							than to shrink from the full investigation of the subject, and withdraw
							from the Commonwealth— His opinion of Otis’s motives throughout this
							affair, is darker than he ventures to express— The whole subject is
							unaccountable to me, upon any principle which it is pleasing to
							contemplate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston also gave me a
							pamphlet of <persRef ref="boylston-zabdiel">D<hi rend="superscript"
