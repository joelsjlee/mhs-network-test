						<p><date>1. V:30.</date> At the Office <persRef ref="bourne-w">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourne</persRef>, called and told me
							he had obtained the Commission of a Captain of Marines, and thanked me,
							for my solicitation in his favour— <persRef ref="herbert-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Herbert</persRef> of Alexandria called
							with a Bill at sixty days sight which I accepted, for a Hogshead of Wine
							from <persRef ref="march-john">J. H. March</persRef> at Madeira— I
							called at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> and
							proposed that <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Middleton</persRef> should be instructed to communicate
							to the Russian Government a copy of the Convention offered to
							Great-Britain for the regulation of Neutral and Belligerent rights, and
							to ascertain if Russia would be willing to accede to it. The President
							consented— I had begun the draft of an Instruction to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton concerning it— I asked the
							President, if he proposed to send a Minister to France in place of
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>. He had not determined; nor has M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin been explicit in declining to
							return to France— He cannot return this year, and he is willing that an
							appointment should be made to supply his place; if it is thought that
							the public service so requires— The President asked me what I would
							advise him to do— I thought the appointment might be postponed; perhaps
							until Winter; but not over that Season— I observed that the Act of
							Congress of 3. March 1815. offering the abolition of discriminating
							duties, and all the Acts founded upon it were so limited that they would
							expire during the next Session of Congress— A revision of the whole
							system would be necessary; and I would suggest to him the expediency of
							considering what notice it will be proper for him to take of it, in the
							Message at the Commencement of the next Session— He said that he had
							already in former Messages recommended perseverance in the system, and
							had seen no reason for changing his opinion— I said that before the
							opening of the Session, we must have some answer from England,
							respecting the proposed Negotiations, and perhaps they might render it
							proper that he should also mention them in the Message— Particularly the
							project for regulating the principles of Belligerent and Neutral rights
							in time of War— He said he would consider of this— I mentioned to him
							that I had heard the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef> had finally consented to accept the vacant Seat on
							the Bench of the Supreme Court; which he said was true— But he would
							remain some time longer in the Navy Department; and he added he had not
							yet thought of whom he should nominate for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Thompson’s successor— The public Newspapers say it has been
								<hi rend="italic">offered</hi> to <persRef ref="southard-samuel"

						<p><date>2. V:15.</date> Swam with <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef> in the Potowmack, an hour and a quarter— The tide
							was going out rapidly, for which reason I began by ascending the river,
							swimming against the current, and returning with it. We came back in the
							quarter of an hour the space which it had taken us the full hour to
							traverse outwards.— <persRef ref="thruston-buckner">Judge
								Thruston</persRef> called at my house in a temper of mind much
							tranquilised since the day before yesterday— But as his desire to make
							an excursion continues, I accommodated him with what he had requested—
							The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> was suddenly seized
							this morning with cramps or convulsions of such extreme violence, that
							he was at one time believed to be dying; and he lay upwards of two hours
							in a state of insensibility. I did not hear of it till the fit was over.
							I called at his house, and saw there <persRef ref="washington-unknown3"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Washington</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hay</persRef>.— The D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> said the

								ref="sim-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sim</persRef> had
							pronounced the danger to be past, and did not apprehend a renewal of the
							attack— But Hay added he thought it would be sometime, before it would
							be prudent to lay before him business of any kind— Before returning home
							to dinner, I sent to enquire how he was, <pb type="ms" n="112"/>and the
							answer to the Messenger was, much better. In the Evening I went to the
							theatre and saw the Cure for the Heart-Ache; not so well performed as it
							was last Summer— The House was very thin— Only two Ladies in the lower
							boxes; one of whom <persRef ref="weightman-louisa">M<hi

							There was a heavy thunder shower in the middle of the day, and the
							Evening weather was lowering.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef> in the morning,
							from 1. Corinthians 1:23.24. “But we preach Christ crucified, unto the
							Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;—But unto them

							heard a stranger, from Mark. 8.36. “For what shall it profit a man, if

							21.24. “And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
							away captive into all Nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of
							the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.” I was much

							finished this day the Draft of a Letter of Instruction to <persRef

							and will call again on Monday— At the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>— He received me in his bed chamber, which he
							was advised not to leave this day— He recommended to me to strike out
							from the Instruction to <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton</persRef>, upon the neutral
							and belligerent right project, all the reference to the Holy Alliance:
							because that Treaty being considered in this Country as a mere
							hypocritical fraud, any reference to it whatever, would have a turn
							given to it of odious misconstruction here, against myself— I said my
							reference to the Holy Alliance was merely an <hi rend="italic"
								>Argumentum ad Hominem</hi>. It was a call upon the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia,</persRef> for an Act
							unequivocally corresponding with the Sentiment that he had proclaimed— A
							direct appeal to his Conscience to support by Deeds his Professions, and
							I had been so far from expressing approbation of his Acts, or those of
							the Holy Alliance, that I had distinctly alluded to them as liable to
							censure and warned him of the danger to him that the judgment of
							posterity would contrast them with his Declaration in the Treaty— The
							President said he had remarked this guard, but still thought it would be
							best to omit the reference to the <pb type="ms" n="116"/>Holy Alliance
							altogether— I accordingly struck it out, and thereby gave up, what I
							considered the main Spring of the argument to the Emperor— I relied upon
							its operation, incomparably more than upon anything else— The President
							is often afraid of the skittishness of mere popular prejudices, and I am
							always disposed to brave them— I have much more confidence in the calm
							and deliberate judgment of the People than he has— I have no doubt that
							the Newspaper Scavengers, and Scape gibbets, whose republicanism runs in
							filthy streams from the Press, would have attempted to exhibit this
							reference to the Holy Alliance in a false and odious point of view, but
							I would have trusted to the good sense of the people to see through
							their sophistry and their motives— They would have seen in it what was
							intended—A powerful engine of persuasion; applied to the heart of him
							whom it was all important to persuade—A bold and direct address to his
							intimate conscience; and a warming voice to check and controul his acts
							bearing hard upon the Liberties of Nations.— In this case as in all
							others for which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe as the Head of
							his Administration is responsible, I submit my own judgment to his— The
							only case in which I insisted upon my own, was in the controvery with
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>—because
							in that all the responsability rested upon me— But I have now less
							Confidence of succeeding with the Emperor— The President was also
							apprehensive of speaking too favourably of the proposal by France to
							exempt private property from capture by Sea; least it should appear to
							countenance her invasion of Spain itself. He advised an additional
							paragraph to guard against that; which I accordingly wrote— I attended a
							Meeting of the Trustees of the second Presbyterian Church— The object
							was to borrow 1200 dollars of the U.S. Branch Bank, to pay the
							Carpenter— A vote to that effect was taken— <persRef ref="hellen-mary"

							no capture even of Spanish Merchant vessels— I said I supposed the

							there was a reservation of a right of resorting to reprizals, if Spain
							should not reciprocate the exemption of merchant vessels from capture—
							He said the reservation was not upon any thing which Spain should do,
							but upon what Neutrals might tolerate— I said it seemed to make no
							difference, since France was to be herself the judge of what would
							amount to such toleration— But I added that if the case suggested in the

							the regulation; which he said was all he desired— He promised to write

								Crawford</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi

							Peace with Turkey, and seemed only to wait for opposition, to maintain
							that we were not. Calhoun descanted upon his great enthusiasm for the
							Cause of the Greeks; he was for taking no heed of Turkey, whatever. In
							this as in many other cases these Gentlemen have two sources of
							eloquence at these cabinet Meetings—one with reference to sentiment, and
							the other to action— Their enthusiasm for the Greeks is all Sentiment,
							and the Standard of this is the prevailing popular feeling— As for
							actions they are seldom agreed, and after two hours of discussion this
							day, the subject was dismissed leaving it precisely where it was—
							Nothing determined, and nothing practicable proposed by either of them—
							Seeing their drift, I did not think it necessary to discuss their doubts
							whether we were at Peace with Turkey— Their contempt for the Sublime
							Porte, or their enthusiasm for the Cause of the Greeks— I have not much
							esteem for the enthusiasm which evaporates in words; and I told the
							President, I thought not quite so lightly of a War with Turkey. I said I
							would prepare an answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luriottis and
							an Instruction to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush for his
							consideration. He had proposed the question whether a secret Agent
							should be sent to Greece— Calhoun mentioned <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>; and I named <persRef
								ref="lyman-unknown3">Lyman</persRef>; but we cannot send a <hi
								rend="italic">secret</hi> Agent— Our Agents never will be secret.
							The President informed us that <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef>, the Secretary of
							the Navy had consented to accept the vacant Seat upon the Bench of the
							Supreme Court; and that he had thought of <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> the Senator
							from New-Jersey, for the Navy Department— But he had not written to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, nor given him any notice of his
							intention, nor was he under any engagement or promise whatever to
							appoint him— He had thought of him as a man of abilities, a native of
							the State of New-Jersey, one of the original thirteen, and from which
							there has never been a member of the Administration. He now mentioned
							it, because three of us stood in peculiar relations with reference to
							the succession to the place now occupied by him— He considered it
							honourable to us all, that large portions of the Country were disposed
							to support each of us for that station— His own confidence in each of us
							was entire and unimpaired— He made these remarks, not with the
							expectation that either of us would reply to them, but in reference to
							the appointment of a Secretary of the Navy; to say that if either of us
							had any observations to make he would give them full Consideration— As
							to the Mission to France, he had wished that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin should return thither; but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin himself had urged him to make another appointment
							and he had thought of <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> James Brown</persRef> of Louisiana— He was of opinion
							that in the present critical state of Europe this appointment should be
							made without delay— This address of the President, was followed by a
							pause of Silence, which I terminated, by asking M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson, when he proposed to quit the Department and enter
							upon his judicial Office. He intimated, not <pb type="ms" n="120"/>very
							soon, and that he thought it would not be necessary for him to hold the
							next coming Circuit Courts in New-York, Connecticut and Vermont— The
							President thought it would be best that he should, and said the
							Government would be blamed if those terms should pass without a Circuit
							judge to hold them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson made some
							question as to the Law, and asked me if I had examined the two Acts of
							Congress of 1802 and 1808.— By the first the President has the power of
							allotting a judge to hold the circuit. The second provides that the
							judge residing in the Circuit shall hold the Circuit Court.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson had some doubts whether his legal
							residence was in the second District, as he has dwelt for the last four
							years here. The President said he considered himself as residing in
							Virginia though he has lived here these twelve years— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun also considered himself as
							residing in South-Carolina— The President finally asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson to remain with him a few minutes
							alone— It is remarkable that several newspapers have some days since
							announced the appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard to
							the Navy Department as already made; and some of them have fixed upon
							the last of this month as the time when he is to enter upon the duties
							of the office. He is said to be a devoted partizan of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun; which I suppose was the occasion
							of the President’s remarks on announcing his intention to appoint him— I
							took a short, solitary Evening walk.</p>

							other Churches, and during a certain period, Confessions of fornication—
							None of these however, for the last seventy or eighty years. It is a
							meagre and chaotic Record; but it contains notices of births of my
							ancestors, both of the Adams and Quincy families, in which I take rather
