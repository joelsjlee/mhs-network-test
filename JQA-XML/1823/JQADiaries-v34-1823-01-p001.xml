								<l>With humble heart, and fervent voice to raise</l>
								<l>The suppliant prayer, and ever grateful praise.</l>
								<l>To thee, the past its various blessings owes,</l>

						<p><date>10. VII.</date> Just before breakfast, I received a Note from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> desiring me to call
							upon <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brown</persRef> of Louisiana, and propose to him the mission to
							Mexico— Immediately after breakfast I called at his house, but he was
							already gone to the Senate— I went to the Capitol, and saw him in the
							Senate chamber, from which we retired into the Committee Room— I told
							him I was charged by the President to enquire if the Mission to Mexico
							would be agreeable to him— He expressed the acknowledgments for the
							confidence manifested in the offer, which he declined— The State of
							Society, and the condition of the Country, being such that he could not
							think of taking <persRef ref="brown-nancy">his wife</persRef> there, and
							he could not think of going without her— I then told him that this was
							all I had in charge, from the President; but as he proposed to nominate
							Ministers also to Spain, to Colombia, to Buenos Ayres and to Chili, I
							would ask him of my own authority whether either of them would suit him
							better than Mexico— He said, if any one, there would be less objection
							to Spain, than any of the rest— The state of Society being better there—
							But he afterwards said no—he should prefer his situation as a Senator,
							twice conferred upon him, without solicitation on his part, and for
							which he felt himself under the deepest obligations to the People of
							Louisiana— Though the State of his health had been such as had almost
							induced him a few days since to send in his resignation— I reported to
							the President this answer, which somewhat perplexes him, for the choice
							of a Minister to Mexico in place of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brown. He is a man peculiarly fitted for that Mission; or indeed any
							other— A man of large fortune—respectable talents— Handsome
							person—polished manners, and elegant deportment— The President had
							already promised the Spanish Mission, to <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hugh Nelson</persRef> of Virginia. He
							spoke of <persRef ref="anderson-richard">Richard C. Anderson</persRef>
							of Kentucky for Colombia, <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">Caesar A.
								Rodney</persRef> of Delaware, for <pb type="ms" n="6"/>Buenos-Ayres,
							and <persRef ref="allen-heman2">Heman Allen</persRef> of Vermont for
							Chili— To distribute the appointments to the various Sections of the
							Union— He now spoke of <persRef ref="taylor-john3">John Lewis
								Taylor</persRef> Chief Justice of North-Carolina; and asked me to
							see; between this and Monday, <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Macon</persRef> the Senator from that
							State, and enquire into his character— At the Senate chamber in the
							Capitol I saw <persRef ref="gaillard-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gaillard</persRef> the Senator from South-Carolina, and
							spoke to him of the appointment of a District Judge in South-Carolina—
							He and his Colleague have recommended a <persRef ref="bennett-unknown2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett</persRef>— Others have
							very strongly recommended a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee— When I
							mentioned him, Gaillard said there were three brothers named Lee— If it
							was <persRef ref="lee-thomas">Thomas Lee</persRef>, he would be well
							qualified, but probably would not accept the appointment— From the
							President’s I went to the Office at one—and soon after <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> came with <persRef ref="parish-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parish</persRef>; and <persRef
								ref="ellisen-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ellisen</persRef>, the Russian Chargé d’Affaires, with <persRef
								ref="maltitz-friedrich">Baron Maltitz</persRef> and we exchanged the
							Ratifications of the Convention signed at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Petersburg, the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July
							last. This was the first Convention ever negotiated by the United States
							under a Mediation, and of which the exchange was accordingly tripartite—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning was excessively punctilious
							upon every point of formality. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellisen
							much less so— We were employed till six O’Clock before the Exchange was
							completed. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning had two certificates
							of exchange to execute—one with me, and one with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ellisen— That which I had drawn up was tripartite, to be
							executed by all three and each party to retain one— But after five or
							six copies of my draught had been made, and still M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning wanted some insignificant
							transposition of words, requiring new copies, which there was no longer
							time to make out, I gave up altogether my draught, and we merely signed
							a Protocole in French, proposed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ellisen, and which contained all the substance of the certificate that I
							had drawn up— It included of course an acknowledgment by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellisen of the receipt of the certified
							copy of the Convention, which by its 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Article was to be delivered by each of the parties, to the Minister or
							Agent of the mediating power— We compared together all the ratified
							Copies. I held the English ratified Copy, and <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>,
							the Russian ratified copy which we were to receive— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning held our ratified copy, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parish the Russian ratified copy, which
							were to be delivered to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning. And M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellisen held our ratified copy, and Baron
							Maltitz the British ratified copy which were to be delivered to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellisen, each party thus collating the two
							copies which it was to retain— <persRef ref="ironside-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ironside</persRef> holding at the same
							time the original executed Treaty, transmitted by <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef>. There were several slight variations between
							the copies— None of any consequence. But there were three explanatory
							documents in French only, which in the English copies and in ours formed
							part of the ratified Convention, but in the Russian, were on separate
							papers, not within the body of the ratification—but signed and sealed as
							annexed copies— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning took great
							exception to this, and insisted upon having a minute of it entered upon
							the Protocol, as it was— I executed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning also the agreement for the payment of the Commissioners and
							Arbitrators— He accepted the modification proposed by the President with
							some slight alterations. It was quite dark when I came home to dinner—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and all the family except myself passed
							the Evening at <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Frye’s</persRef>— As I was coming down this Monday from
							the Capitol, I meet <persRef ref="smyth-alexander">General
								Smyth</persRef>, and asked him if he had received my answer to his
							Letter asking to inspect <persRef ref="brearley-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brearley’s</persRef> copy of the
							revised draught of a Constitution— He said he had and would <pb

							it— I told him I should be glad to be present when he should come, and
							would thank him to give me notice of the time; which he said he
							would—</p>

								<persRef ref="jackson-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. B.

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smyth was inspecting <persRef
								ref="brearley-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brearley’s</persRef> copy of the Draft of Constitution—was taking a
							copy of a passage in it; and writing a certificate under the copy that
							he made, which certificate he desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brent to sign— The Journal of the Federal Convention, was published by a
							Resolution of Congress, under my direction in the year 1819— In the
							Section and paragraph enumerating the Powers of Congress there are
							errors of <hi rend="italic">punctuation</hi>; errors of the Press, which
							had escaped my attention. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smyth now came,
							with the intention of trumping up a charge against me of having
							intentionally falsified that publication by introducing a false <hi
								rend="italic">punctuation</hi>— Smyth was comparing Brearley’s
							printed draught with the copy of it printed in the Journal of the
							Convention, and eagerly seeking for variations between them— He found on
							Brearley’s paper a manuscript minute “Brought into the Convention 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1787.”— “The Book says on
							the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>” said Smyth; and charmed with his
							imaginary detection of a new blunder, wrote his certificate for Brent to
							sign that it was a true copy from the Constitution reported on the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September, shewing the punctuation,
							obliteration and amendments— He had written the copy in two different
							hands; one it seems intended to represent the printed, and the other the
							manuscript part of the copy. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent shewed
							me the Certificate, asking if he should sign it— I said the certificate
							as written was not correct— Smyth said Its not true— It is correct— I
							said the certificate purported to shew the punctuation, obliteration and
							amendments, but did not specify what part was in print and what part in
							manuscript— It also stated the Constitution to have been reported on the
								13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> while the Journal shewed that it
							had been reported on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> September— He
							said he had taken the date from what was written on the Brearley paper
							itself— I then shewed by the Journal, that the Report had been made on
							the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and ordered to be printed for the
							use of the members—so that Brearley’s manuscript minute “Brought into
							the Convention 13. September,” had reference to the printed paper, and
							not to the Report itself, which had been brought in the day before—
							Smyth then struck out of his projected certificate the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and inserted 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> but as I still objected that the copy did not specify what
							part was print and what part manuscript, it was not fair for comparison
							with the printed Journal of the Convention, which professedly gave only
							the printed part of Brearley’s paper— Smyth then cut off his proposed
							certificate from his copy, and threw the certificate away— I immediately
							picked it up, and asked him to let me have the copy itself, which he
							refused— He said he meant to keep that himself— I might have a
							fac-simile of it— A fac-simile of the paper was what he wanted— I then
							said that the Book, had not been printed from the printed paper, but
							from a copy of it, made at this Office, and which had been returned to
							it from the Printers, and was still in the Office— Smyth said he had
							what he wanted; the copy from the original paper— I then said I was
							ready to explain any variation which there might be between the original
							paper and the printed Book, and turning to D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jackson I desired him to notice that Smyth had refused to
							let me have the copy which he had made; adding that I might perhaps be
							under a necessity of requiring his testimony hereafter. This at length
							brought Smyth <pb type="ms" n="8"/>to; Jackson having repeated to him
							that I had said I should perhaps hereafter need his testimony— I then
							shewed to Jackson, the Copy of Brearley’s paper, which was sent to the
							Printer at Boston, and from which the Book was printed— In this copy,
							the punctuation was not precisely the same as in Brearley’s printed
							paper, from which it was copied, but it was the same, at that passage
							upon which Smyth wished to fix the charge of falsification. Jackson
							asked how it was in the Copy of the Constitution printed in the first
							Volume of <persRef ref="bioren-john">Bioren’s</persRef> Edition of the
							Laws, published under the direction of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> when Secretary of
							State and <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, Attorney General— Smyth said there were some
							differences of punctuation in that— I sent for the original roll of the
							Constitution itself, and for a copy printed from it in 1820 by my
							direction, and then collated with the roll— The punctuation in no two of
							the copies was exactly the same. But the proof was complete, that the
							only passage at which the punctuation could affect the sense, the copy
							made at the Office, and sent to Boston to be printed, agreed precisely
							with the original printed paper of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brearley— After a long and pertinacious examination of all the papers,
							which were taken for the purpose from my chamber into that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent, Smyth declared himself satisfied
							that he had been mistaken in his suspicions, and that the error of
							punctuation in the Volume of the Journal of the Convention, consisting
							in the substitution of a Colon for a Semi-colon : instead of ; and the
							Capital Letter <hi rend="italic">T </hi>instead of a small <hi
								rend="italic">t</hi>, was not a deliberate and wilful forgery of
							mine, to falsify the Constitution, and vest absolute and arbitrary
							Powers in Congress—but a mere error of the press. He took however a
							certified copy from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent of the passage
							as printed in Brearley’s paper; with the punctuation, obliteration, and
							manuscript interlineations— Smyth had published in the National
							Intelligencer of this Morning a long reply addressed to his Constituents
							to my answer to his first charges—a renewed attack upon <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>—a Panegyric upon Thomas Paine—a
							new selection of votes of mine while I was a member of the Senate; and a
							dissertation against hereditary honours— But mistrusting the effect of
							all this, he came to my office high charged with this project of
							arraigning me before the public for falsification of public papers—and
							this conspiracy of colons and Capital Letters, would have formed a new
							Impeachment of me before the Nation, had he not found me ready to meet
							him with irrefragable proof against his infamous imputation: and had not
							his own colleague whom he had brought with him for testimony, signified
							to him, that he could not sanction his suspicions, nor support him
							against the Evidence that I produced. This inquisitorial screw lasted at
							least four hours— That Providence without which not a Sparrow falleth to
							the ground, had preserved the papers from which the Book was printed,
							and preserved to me the means of complete justification— While Smyth was
							going through his examinations, I had several other visitors at the
							Office— <persRef ref="crafts-samuel">S. C. Crafts</persRef> of Vermont—
								<persRef ref="tracy-albert">A. H. Tracy</persRef> of New-York;
							members of the House of Representatives— Tracy came for an order for the
							release of two Prisoners for debt, which I promised to have made out and
							sent to him— <persRef ref="barbour-james">James Barbour</persRef>,
							Senator from Virginia called, and <persRef ref="cook-daniel">Daniel P.
								Cook</persRef> member from Illinois— Deeply concerned about the
							appointments to the Land-Offices in that State— He says if <persRef
								ref="bond-shadrach">Bond</persRef> or <persRef ref="mclean-john"
								>M’Lean</persRef> is appointed he himself will resign his Seat in
							Congress— He asked to see some of the <pb type="ms" n="9"/>documents of
							the Negotiation in England of the Convention of October 1818. which I
							shewed him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning also came, and
							conversed with me chiefly about the commercial intercourse with the
							British Colonies—and our discriminating duties; upon which he said he
							must write me a Note to ask me a yes or a no— I asked him if he had any
							Instructions from his Government concerning it— He said he had not—
								<persRef ref="cocke-john">General Cocke</persRef> of Tennessee came;
							and upon being informed I was engaged with other persons, complained as
								<persRef ref="maury-fontaine">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef> told me, that he could not obtain access to me, and
							refused to wait in the Audience chamber, till he could see me.</p>

							the District Judge, for that State, and told him the <persRef

							him and his colleague that there were strong recommendations of <persRef
								ref="lee-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
							Lee</persRef>— They had recommended <persRef ref="bennett-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett</persRef>— Smith said he had
							no doubts the duties of the Office would be much better performed by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett then by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee; who was a man of talents; and of
							integrity, but so indolent, that having held many Offices in the State,
							he had never filled any one of them, but for a very short time— Smith
							then said that he knew not why his opinion was asked on the subject, if
							it was to have no weight— The fact was that never in a single instance
							had a person recommended by him been appointed— He had disapproved the
							appointment of <persRef ref="johnson-william">Judge Johnson</persRef> as
							Collector of Charleston— Not from any objection to the man, but because
							he thought it derogatory to the Station of a Judge of the Supreme Court,
							to pass from it into the Office of a Collector of the Customs— The judge
							however having succeeded in getting his Salary raised, had declined the
							Collectorship, and then he Smith had recommended a person peculiarly
							qualified for the place; but another had been appointed— A Planter; who
							he had no doubt was a very good Collector— Smith has just failed to be
							re-elected as Senator from South-Carolina, because he was understood to
							be a partizan of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef>; and he feels
							sore— I next went to <persRef ref="dowson-alfred">Dowson’s</persRef>,
							and saw <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Macon</persRef>— In making the appointments to these South-American
							Missions the President wishes to distribute them, to Citizens of the
							different parts of the Union. He wishes particularly to take some
							distinguished notice of North-Carolina; it happens that the weight of
							talents in that State is with the federalists; so that the politics
							counteract the geography— Among the persons recommended to the President
							was <persRef ref="taylor-john3">John Lewis Taylor</persRef>, now Chief
							Justice of the State; and the President had requested me to call upon
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Macon, and make enquiries concerning
							him. Last Evening I received a Note from the President, saying it would
							be proper in these enquiries to ascertain if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Taylor is of the republican party. I made therefore that
							enquiry among the others— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Macon spoke of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor, as of a man of accomplished
							manners: but said nothing of any more elevated qualifications, and as to
							his politics, he had understood him to be among the warmest federalists
							in the State— But he added that politics had never been so hostile
							between the parties in North-Carolina, as in either of its neighbouring
							States of South Carolina <pb type="ms" n="10"/>or of Virginia, and that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor had been elected to the Office
							of Chief Justice of the State by a Legislature of different politics
							from his own— On returning home I found a Note from the President
							requesting me to call at his house this day, to confer with him on the
							proposed nominations of Ministers. I went to him immediately; and found
							him very anxious to make the nominations. I reported to him what M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Macon had said of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Taylor, upon which he said it would not do to nominate him—
							He added that it had been a great object of his administration to
							conciliate the people of this Union; towards one another; and to
							mitigate the asperities of party Spirit. But in effecting this he was
							obliged to consider how far he could yield to his own dispositions,
							without losing the Confidence of his own party— He would go as far as
							the public Sentiment would support him; but to overstep that boundary
							would be to defeat his own object— He had concluded to nominate <persRef
								ref="nelson-hugh">Hugh Nelson</persRef> of Virginia to Spain and
								<persRef ref="anderson-richard">Richard C. Anderson</persRef> of
							Kentucky to Colombia—and <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">C. A.
								Rodney</persRef> to Buenos Ayres— For Mexico and Chili, he was yet
							undetermined. I mentioned to him <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> for Mexico, and <persRef ref="holmes-john">John
								Holmes</persRef> of Maine for Chili— He received favorably the name
							of Jackson, but doubted whether he would accept, and made some question
							whether his quickness and violence of temper might not in the opinion of
							a great part of the Nation make the expediency of his appointment
							questionable— I said that although the language of General Jackson was
							sometimes too impassioned and violent, his conduct had always appeared
							to me calm and deliberate. Acting under responsibility, I did not
							apprehend he would do any thing to the injury of his Country; and even
							if he should commit any indiscretion, he would bear the penalty of it
							himself, for the Nation would not support him in it.— There was another
							difficulty which I thought more serious— He had been unanimously
