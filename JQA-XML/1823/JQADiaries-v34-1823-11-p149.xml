						<p><date>7. V:30.</date> Rainy day. Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> from half past one till
							four— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
								Secretary of War</persRef>, and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef> present— The subject for Consideration was the
							confidential proposals of the <persRef ref="canning-george">British
								Secretary of State George Canning</persRef> to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, and the correspondence between
							them, relating to the projects of the holy alliance upon South-America—
							There was much conversation, without coming to any definitive point. The
							object of Canning appears to have been to obtain some public pledge from
							the Government of the United States, ostensibly against the forcible
							interference of the Holy Alliance between Spain and South-America; but
							really or especially against the acquisition to the United States
							themselves of any part of the Spanish American Possessions— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun inclined to giving a discretionary
							power to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush to join in a declaration
							against the interference of the Holy allies if necessary—even if it
							should pledge us not to take Cuba, or the Province of Texas— Because the
							Power of G.B. being greater than ours to <hi rend="italic">seize</hi>
							upon them, we should get the advantage of obtaining from her the same
							declaration we should make ourselves— I thought the cases not parallel—
							We have no intention of seizing either Texas or Cuba— But the
							inhabitants of either or both may exercise their primitive rights, and
							solicit an Union with us— They will certainly do no such thing to G.
							Britain. By joining with her therefore in her proposed declaration; we
							give her a substantial, and perhaps inconvenient pledge against
							ourselves, and really obtain nothing in return— Without entering now
							into the enquiry of the expediency of our annexing Texas or Cuba to our
							Union, we should at least keep ourselves free to act as emergencies may
							arise, and not tie ourselves down to any principle which might
							immediately afterwards be brought to bear against ourselves. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Southard inclined much to the same
							opinion— The President was averse to any course which should have the
							appearance of taking a position subordinate to that of Great Britain,
							and suggested the idea of sending a special Minister to <hi
								rend="italic">protest</hi> against the interposition of the Holy
							Alliance— I observed that it was a question for separate consideration
							whether we ought in any event if invited, to attend at a Congress of the
							allies on this subject— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun thought
							we ought in no case to attend. The President referring to Instructions
							given before the Congress of Aix la Chapelle, declaring that we would if
							invited, attend no meeting relative to South America, of which less than
							its entire Independence should be the object, intimated that a similar
							limitation might be assumed now. I remarked that we had then not
							recognized the South-American Independence ourselves— We would have been
							willing to recognize it in concert with the European allies, and
							therefore would have readily attended, if invited, a meeting of which
							that should have been the object. We could not now have the same motive—
							We <hi rend="italic">have</hi> recognized them. We are very sure there
							will be now no Meeting of the Allies with that object. There would
							therefore be no use or propriety in resorting to the same limitation—
							Our refusal to attend should be explicit and unqualified— To this the
							President readily assented— I remarked that the communications recently
							received from the <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Russian Minister Baron
								Tuyll</persRef> afforded as I thought a very suitable and convenient
							opportunity for us to take our stand against the Holy Alliance, and at
							the same time to decline the overture of Great-Britain— It would be more
							candid as well as more dignified to avow our principles explicitly to
							Russia and France, than to come in as a Cock-boat in the wake of the
							British man of War— The idea was acquiesced in on all <pb type="ms"
								n="150"/>sides, and my draft for an answer to Baron Tuyll’s Note
							announcing the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							determination to refuse receiving any Minister from the South-American
							Governments, was read— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun objected
							to two words as sarcastic— The word <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>,
							annexed to Independent Nations and the words <hi rend="italic">of
								Peace</hi>, added to the word Minister. I told him laughing that all
							the point of my Note was in those two words, as my object was to put the
							Emperor in the wrong in the face of the world as much as possible— The
							President proposed one or two other alterations, but after examination
							did not insist upon them— But it was thought the best method of making
							the profession of our principles would be in answering that part of
							Baron Tuyll’s communication to me which was verbal— The intimation of
							the Emperor’s hope that we should continue to observe neutrality in the
							contest between Spain and South America— It was proposed that I should
							in my written answer to the Baron’s written Note, introduce a commentary
							upon the verbal part of his conferences— The discussion continued till
							four O’Clock when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had an
							engagement and the Meeting broke up without coming to any conclusion. I
							remained with the President, and observed to him that the answers to be
							given to Baron Tuyll, the Instructions to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush relative to the proposals of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning, those to <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Middleton</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg, and those to the Minister who must be sent to France must
							all be parts of a combined system of policy, and adapted to each
							other—in which he fully concurred— I added that as Baron Tuyll had made
							one part of his communications written, and another verbal, if I should
							answer the whole in one written Note; it might place him personally in
							an awkward predicament— My official intercourse with the Baron had
							always been of the friendliest character, and I was desirous of
							observing with him all the forms of courtesy and kindness. The President
							then proposed that I should confine my written answer to the purport of
							the Baron’s written Note and see the Baron again, upon the verbal part
							of his communications— This course I shall accordingly take— I told the
							President I would see the Baron, before sending him my written answer— I
							would then say that having informed the President of what had passed
							between us at our recent conferences, he had approved the verbal answers
							that I had given to the Baron, and had directed me to add, that
							receiving in friendly part the expression of the Emperor’s wish that the
							United States may continue to observe the Neutrality announced on their
							recognition of the South American Governments, he wished the Baron to
							state to his Government in return, the desire of that of the U. States
							that the Emperor on his part should continue to observe the same
							neutrality— The Baron would make this the subject of a despatch to his
							Government which I presumed he would according to his Custom shew me,
							before sending it off; and I could commit the substance of all these
							conferences to writing in the form of a Report to the President— Of all
							this he approved— The discussion <pb type="ms" n="151"/>at the Cabinet
							Meeting took a wide range— It was observed that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning had not disclosed to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Rush the special facts upon which he expected there would be a Congress
							to settle the Affairs of South America, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun expressed some surprize that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush did not appear to have made of him any enquiries on
							that point— I observed that I was rather glad of the objection of the
							British Government to the <hi rend="italic">preliminary</hi>
							recognition, as I should be sorry that we should be <hi rend="italic"
								>committed</hi> upon Cannings propositions even so far as we might
							have been by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush on his own
							responsibility— Calhoun wondered what could be the objection of Great
							Britain to the recognition— I said there were two reasons— One the
							aversion, to fly directly in the face of the Holy Alliance— And secondly
							the engagements of her Treaties with Spain; particularly that of 5. July
							1814— Calhoun and Southard thought that Great Britain would in no Event
							take stand against the Holy Alliance on South American Affairs unless
							sure of our co-operation— She could not be belligerent, leaving us
							neutral; because it must throw the whole commerce of the adverse party
							into our hands— It was the opinion of us all that a Minister must
							immediately be sent to France— The President read a copy of his Letter
							to A. Gallatin, urging him, 15. October, to return; and of Gallatin’s
							answer, saying that he cannot go this Winter—but promising to be here
							about the middle of this Month— I left with the President several papers
							this day received; among which one from <persRef
								ref="constancio-francisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Constancio</persRef>, the <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi>-Consul and
							Charge d’Affaires from Portugal; soliciting the pardon of a man named
								<persRef ref="cartacho-unknown">Cartacho</persRef>, just convicted
							of Piracy at Richmond. So we have now two persons claiming to act as
							Charge d’Affaires from Portugal— On returning to the Office I sent to
							Baron Tuyll requesting him to call at my Office to-morrow at one—
							Evening at home, writing in part this day’s Journal.</p>

						<p><date>8. V:30.</date> I wrote further this Morning upon the Journal of
							yesterday without being able to finish it. <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> called, and proposed to me to attend the Meeting
							of the Delegates, who met here the day before yesterday, upon a
							projected Canal from the Potowmack to the Ohio rivers— There are near
							two hundred of them, from Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and the
							District of Colombia— The project has been some time ripening, and there
							have been former meetings of a few persons concerning it. They had
							adjourned last Evening to ten this Morning; after referring to a
							Committee of fifteen several Resolutions offered by <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Charles F. Mercer</persRef>, the Member of
							Congress from Loudoun, who is the principal labouring man in the work—
								<persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> being one of
							the Delegates from Montgomery County Maryland, I went with him, and took
							up D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton at the patent Office— The
							Meeting was held at the Room where the United States Supreme Court, hold
							their Sessions— But the Committee of 15 were not ready with their Report
							upon Mercer’s Resolutions till between Noon and one. The Chairman
								<persRef ref="kent-joseph">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kent</persRef> of Maryland then took the Chair— The Report of the
							Committee, of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercers Resolutions with
							amendments was read, debated, and finally adopted— <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef>
							who called there told me he would request <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick"
								>Baron Tuyll</persRef> to postpone his call to meet me at the Office
							till three O’Clock— But although I left the meeting in Session, I did
							not reach the Office till near four, and apologized to the Baron for
							having made him wait. While I was at the Meeting <persRef
								ref="mcrae-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander
								M’Rae</persRef> called me out to say that <persRef
								ref="pleasants-john">John H. Pleasants</persRef> was here; but going
							away tomorrow— That he apprehended <persRef ref="hay-george">G.
								Hay</persRef> would countenance and assist Pleasants in the
							establishment of his paper, entirely ignorant of his character, unless I
							should tell Hay of Pleasants’s behaviour to me— That Pleasants in his
							Lynchburg paper had some months since published a violent and abusive
							piece against <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>; and if he established himself at Richmond would
							certainly do great mischief there— I told M’Rae that I had not seen the
							piece against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, which he mentioned;
							and if I had should have inferred the character of Pleasants from it as
							conclusively as I had from his conduct to myself— And that I would speak
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay as he desired. <pb type="ms"
								n="152"/>Hay was at the meeting. I called him out, and he walked
							with me, leading his horse, to my Office— I told him what M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Rae had said to me, and what had passed
							between me and Pleasants, at which he was much astonished. He said he
							had taken an interest in this Pleasants, though he had not known him
							till he came here, with two duels upon his hands—occasioned by his
							quarrel with <persRef ref="ritchie-thomas">Ritchie</persRef>— One was
							with a young man by the name of <persRef ref="leigh-unknown"
								>Lee</persRef>— That he, Hay and the President had taken much pains
							to prevent this duel and had succeeded and Pleasants was to see the
							President this day before going away. Hay mentioned also that he had
							sent <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> a copy of his papers
							under the signature of Phocion, published in the National Intelligencer,
							against a Congressional Caucus, but had received no answer— From
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> and <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> he had. I found
								<persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron de Tuyll</persRef>, waiting for
							me at the Office— I told him that I had submitted to the President the
							Note from him declaring the Emperor’s determination not to receive any
							Minister or Agent from any of the South-American States, to which I
							should shortly send him an answer. I had also reported to the President
							the substance of our verbal conferences; of what had been said by him,
							and of my answers— That the President had directed me to say that he
							approved of my answers as far as they had gone, and to add, that he
							received the observations of the Russian Government relating to the
							neutrality of the United States in the contest between Spain and the
							Independent States of South America amicably; and in return for them
							wished him to express to his Court, the hope of the Government of the
							United States, that Russia would on her part also continue to observe
							the same neutrality. After some conversation the Baron desired me to
							repeat what I had said that he might perfectly understand me— I repeated
							accordingly what I had said. He observed that he should immediately
							prepare a despatch to his Government relating the purport of this
							Conversation, and would send it to my house to morrow, to be perfectly
							sure of its accuracy. Requesting me to make any observations upon it
							that I should think advisable. I promised that I would; and this was
							exactly the course which I told the President I expected the Affair
							would take— I had also received a note from the President just before I
							met the Baron, in which he had suggested the idea, of enquiring of the
							Baron, what was the import of the terms “political principles” in his
							note— I accordingly asked him; he said they were used in the
							Instructions of the Government to him, and he understood them to have
							reference to the right of supremacy of Spain over her Colonies. I had so
							understood them myself, and had not entertained a moments doubt, as to
							their Meaning— The Baron observed I had told him my answer to his Note
							would probably not be of a nature to require a reply; and then he
							reminded me of my engagement to refer it for further advisement whether
							and how the Correspondence should be published— I said I remembered it,
							and still believed my answer to his note would require no reply; but of
							that he would himself judge. I told him the substance of what my answer
							would be—An acknowledgment of the receipt of his Note—a statement that
							we had received and sent Ministers and agents in our intercourse with
							the Independent South-American States, and should continue to do the
							same— Regretting that the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperors</persRef>
							political principles had not yet led his Government to the same
							conclusion— I saw by the Baron’s Countenance that he was not a little
							affected at this statement— He took leave of me however in perfect good
							humour. He was scarcely gone when at near five O’Clock, <persRef
								ref="taylor-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Taylor
								the Consul at Mexico</persRef> came in— I had received a Card of
							invitation from the Citizens of the District of Columbia to dine at
								<persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel at four, with the
							Delegates— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor to call at my
							Office again on Monday— <persRef ref="fudger-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fudger </persRef>also called but I
							could not see him; I requested he would call at my house to-morrow; but
							he left word that he must leave the <pb type="ms" n="153"/>city
							to-morrow. I went in haste to Brown’s Hotel, fearing to be late; but was
							the first of the company there— The Delegates had not adjourned. They
							came in about six O’Clock, a Company of about 120 sat down to table— The
							dinner was jovial, and the volunteer toasts numerous— I gave “the first
							right, and the first duty of Nations—Self dependence, and
							self-improvement.” Its import was not generally understood; and it was
							coldly received— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> were there;
							and their toasts, more direct, to canal Navigation, and pledging the
							Nation to patronize it, were received with pointed applause— Calhoun has
							been canvassing with these delegates the whole three days that they have
							been here— After hearing two or three songs we came away together; and
								<persRef ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Lean</persRef> the Postmaster General took me home, on his way to
							Georgetown where he resides— I received this day so voluminous a Mail,
							that I did not get wholly through reading it, though I sat up till
							Midnight.</p>

							accomplish his end— First by an artful, and deceptive Correspondence; at
							the close of which I explicitly stated to him; in October last year,
							that to entitle Sardinian Vessels with their Cargoes to be put upon the
							footing of our own, under a Proclamation of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef><unclear>by v</unclear>irtue
							of the Act of Congress of 3. March 1815. it would be necessary for him
							to obtain an authentic declaration from the Sardinian Government that
							there are no discriminating duties levied in the Sardinian Dominions to
							the disadvantage of Vessels of the United States— Now after the lapse of
							more than a year, he delivers me a pompous declaration authenticated by
							the <persRef ref="latour-unknown">Marquis de la Tour the Sardinian
								minister of Foreign Affairs</persRef>, and claims a Proclamation
							from the President conformably to the notice I had given— I was not a
							little surprized on reading this Declaration to find that it did not
							assert the non-existence of discriminating duties, upon Sardinian
							shipping in the Sardinian Ports; but only that there was no difference
							of duties upon merchandize, imported whether in Sardinian or American
							Vessels. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Deabbate that this was
							not sufficient to justify the issuing of the Proclamation; and in the
							course of the discussion that ensued, he admitted that there was a
							discriminating Tonnage duty of 20 Sols, levied upon foreign vessels in
							Sardinia, which he said was no inequality, because the foreign Vessels
							made longer voyages, and the Sardinians paid the Tonnage three or four
							times to their once— This way of doing business, I suppose the Italians
							call finesse— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Deabbate that the
							Act of Congress of 3 March 1815. and all its dependencies would expire
							at the end of this year; and that Congress must act upon it, at an early
							period of their approaching Session— The Act might be modified; but it
							would be of no use to abolish the discriminating duties upon Sardinian
							vessels, merely for the term of fifty days that the Law was yet to last—
							Nor could it in any event be done while any discriminating Tonnage duty,
							be it ever so small should be levied upon American vessels in Sardinia.
							He said he believed he might then as well return to Philadelphia
							to-morrow— He had also a project for taking up runaway Seamen which he
							left with me; and he said that American tobacco to the amount of half a
							million of dollars a year, was imported to Sardinia. <persRef
								ref="armstrong-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew
								Armstrong</persRef>, the Commercial Agent at Port au Prince called
							at my Office, and I requested him to call again to-morrow— I took my
							budget of Papers to the President’s and was with him nearly two hours. I
							first reported to him my last conference with the <persRef
								ref="tuyll-diederick">Russian Minister Baron Tuyll</persRef>; and
							read to him the copies of the Baron’s two despatches to his Government
							which he furnished me according to my request— I then suggested the new
							Modification of the answer to the Baron’s Note, which I <pb type="ms"
								n="155"/>proposed; leaving out entirely the expression of regret,
							which he approved— I laid before him a number of papers upon various
							other subjects, the decision upon all which he postponed for the
							present— Among the rest were all the recommendations and applications
							for appointments as Secretary of Legation to the South-American Mission—
							He concluded to see <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brent before he fixed upon his choice— I spoke to him of <persRef

							and of <persRef ref="taylor-william">W. Taylor</persRef> all of whom are
							here waiting to obtain something— He thought nothing could be given to
							Robinson, against whom there are charges of a grave character— He
							believed Robinson must be informed of them; though it was difficult to
							let him know, the persons from whom they came. Armstrong and Taylor
							might he thought be allowed 1000 dollars a year each, one at Port au
							Prince and the other in Mexico— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							came in for a few Minutes, with papers for the President, but soon
							retired again, leaving only papers relating to an ex-cadet. On returning
							to my Office I found <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> there—
							His Anecdote and Epigram upon <persRef ref="harris-levett">L.

							against him had terminated. I told him, entirely to my conviction that
							he had been wronged; and I was confident to that of the President. I
							observed that the Consulate of Buenos-Ayres had been kept to this day
							vacant, for him and the appointment was now at his service if he would
							accept it. He said it would not now suit him, and he must decline it— He
							should leave the City to-morrow Morning, and had some thoughts of going
							again to India, though it would be with much reluctance— He said he had
							lost half his men by the disease called in India the Cholera Morbus, but
							which was a sort of pestilence carrying men off almost always in not

							General, and Governor of the Michigan Territory, he was to receive the
							Salary only of one of them— Lear then asked if he could not receive the
							difference between the Pay of a Brigadier General that he had received,
							and the Governor’s Salary, which he might have had— The difficulty to

							August, enclosing the Correspondence between <persRef
								ref="canning-george">Canning</persRef> and him, and requested their
							opinions on the proposals— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson
							thinks them more important than any thing that has happened since our
							Revolution— He is for acceding to the proposals with a view to pledging
							Great-Britain against the Holy Allies; though he thinks the Island of
							Cuba, would be a valuable and important acquisition to our Union. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s opinions are less decisively
							pronounced, and he thinks as I do, that this movement on the part of
							G.B. is impelled more by her interest than by a principle of general
							Liberty— <persRef ref="catlett-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Catlet</persRef> of Alexandria came to enquire if I would take Bills
							upon Buenos-Ayres— They were not wanted. At one I attended the Cabinet
							Meeting at the President’s. He read a Note from <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> saying he was not well enough to attend— But
							hoped to be out on Monday. <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> were there. <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> absent at Baltimore—
							The subject of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning’s proposals was
							resumed; and I soon found the source of the President’s despondency with
							regard to South-American Affairs— Calhoun is perfectly Moon-struck, by
							the surrender of Cadix, and says the Holy Allies with ten thousand men,
							will restore all Mexico and all South-America to the Spanish dominion— I
							did not deny that they might make a temporary impression for three, four
							or five years, but I no more believe that the holy Allies, will restore
							the Spanish Dominion, upon the American Continents, than that the
							Chimborazzo will <pb type="ms" n="158"/>sink beneath the Ocean— But I
							added if the South-Americans were really in a state to be so easily
							subdued, it would be but a more forcible motive for us to beware of
							involving ourselves in their fate. I set this down as one of Calhoun’s
							extravaganzas— He is for plunging into a War, to prevent that, which if
							his opinion of it is correct we are utterly unable to prevent. He is for
							embarking our Lives and fortunes in a ship which he declares the very
							Rats have abandoned— Calhoun reverts again to his idea of giving
							discretionary power, to our Minister to accede to all Canning’s
							proposals if necessary, and not otherwise— After much discussion, I said
							I thought we should bring the whole answer to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning’s proposals to a test of right and wrong—
							Considering the South-Americans as Independent Nations, they themselves,
							and no other Nation had the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to dispose of
							their condition— <hi rend="italic">We</hi> have no right to dispose of
							them either alone or in conjunction with other Nations— Neither have any
							other Nations the right of disposing of them without their consent— This
							principle will give us a clue, to answer all M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning’s questions with candour and confidence— And I am to
							draught a despatch accordingly— The President then said that he inclined
							to appoint <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								James Brown</persRef> of Louisiana, to go as Minister to France,
							though he had hitherto given him no intimation to that effect. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown’s character and qualifications were
							discussed— Calhoun said he had Genius but was timid. Southard said he
							was indolent— His rhumatism, his Fortune, and <persRef ref="brown-nancy"
								>his showy wife</persRef>, were not forgotten. The President spoke
							of sending an Envoy Extraordinary, with no special destinations but with
							Powers to act as occasion might require with reference to these
							proposals of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, and to any
							emergency, concerning South-America— The ostensible motive for the
							appointment; might be as a Colleague with <persRef key="rush-richard">R.
								Rush</persRef>, in the Negotiations now committed to him alone— The
							measure itself was generally approved, but the selection of the person
							caused much rambling conversation— Calhoun who in all his movements of
							every kind has an eye to himself named <persRef ref="mason-jeremiah"
								>Mason</persRef> of New-Hampshire, <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt"
								>DeWitt Clinton</persRef>, <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Judge
								Thompson</persRef>, <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham</persRef>, and <persRef

								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Governor Woodbury</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard spoke of
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="binney-horace">Binney</persRef>, &amp; <persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">Hopkinson</persRef>— The President named
								<persRef ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef>— The pro and con for them all was set forth—
							Federalism was the principal objection to most of them— The President
							also spoke of <persRef ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sanford</persRef> and <persRef ref="vanness-william"
								>Judge Van Ness</persRef> of New-York and finally said he wished
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison would go. From that moment I
							thought of no other person. I observed the only question, was, whether
							it could be proposed to him— And I urged the President seriously to
							think of it; which he promised he would. I intreated him above all
							things, not to appoint an incompetent person— There are objections to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s going; of which he himself
							and the President are not only the best, but the only proper judges— If
							he would go, there could be no man better suited for the appointment. On

							A.M. from Ecclesiastes 3.11. “He hath made everything beautiful in his

							At the Office— The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							there— He appears to be still perplexed with the British Colonial Trade
							question— The arrangements concerning which had entirely escaped his
							memory— I referred him to my despatch to R. Rush N. 64. of which he has
							a copy, but which he has not read— The President thinks from the tenour
							of the despatches received yesterday from R. Rush, that Canning had
							changed his purpose— That he was less alarmed— That probably some
							inducements had been presented after the triumph of the French in Spain,
							to quiet his apprehensions— My own opinion is confirmed that the alarm
							was affected— That the object was to obtain by a sudden movement a
							premature commitment of the American Government; against any transfer of
							the Island of Cuba to France, or the acquisition of it by ourselves.—
							And failing in that point he has returned to the old Standard of British
							Belligerent Policy— I read to the President, and gave him my draft of a
							despatch to R. Rush— He desired me to write to <persRef
								ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Brown</persRef> of Louisiana, and propose to him the Mission to
							France; and to <persRef ref="larned-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Larned</persRef> of Rhode-Island, for the appointment of
							Secretary of Legation to Chili— <persRef ref="addington-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington</persRef> called at the
							Office, and mentioned that he had private Letters from England
							confirming the accounts in the Newspapers, that British Consular Agents
							had been appointed to the various Ports of the South American
							Governments. I told him I had received further despatches from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, in relation to his Negotiation with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning concerning South American
							affairs—that it had rested where it was. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush not <pb type="ms" n="160"/>feeling himself authorised to accede to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning’s proposals without a
							preliminary recognition by Great Britain, of the Independence of the
							South-American States, and the British Government not yet being prepared
							for that step— I said I could not readily imagine what could withhold
							Great-Britain from the formal recognition, when her measures all implied
							that it had been given and I added that earnestly desirous as we were of
							co-operating with Great-Britain, I saw no other basis for concerted
							operations than that. Addington said that he did not know what the
							motives could be— He thought it very probable, that before my
							Instructions could get out to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush,
							Great-Britain would have acknowledged some one or other of the
							South-American Governments as Independent— Perhaps as possessing
							Colonies herself; and especially as some of her Colonies appeared to be
							in a very bad and turbulent humour she might be less ready to
							acknowledge the Independence of other Colonies— Suppose for instance
							said he that the Island of Cuba, should take advantage of the present
							State of things, and declare itself Independent— The United States might
							have no objection to recognizing that Independence; but with
							Great-Britain having Colonies of her own it might be otherwise— I said
							that the question as to the Independence of Cuba, not having yet arisen;
							I saw no reason for anticipating it for the sake of argument— On the
							existing state of things, the basis for co-operation should be laid; and
							then, whatever Events time might bring forth, it would be easy to
							accommodate a concerted movement to them— At least I supposed
							Great-Britain must be prepared to say that in no Event should Cuba be
							transferred to France— Oh! certainly! said he— <persRef
								ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef>, the Russian Minister
							had written me this Morning a Note requesting an interview; and by
							appointment now came. I therefore deferred to a future day, further
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington— The Baron
							Tuyll, came and read me a despatch from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"
								>Count Nesselrode</persRef> to him, and extracts from two others of
							29 &amp; 30 August and 2. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> last— The
							despatch was merely a statement that the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor Alexander</persRef> was just leaving S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg for a tour of three Months for
							the Inspection of his troops. It appears to guard very anxiously against
							any suspicion that he intended by it any hostile movement— It was
							doubtless a circular chiefly destined for European Courts, and sent pro
							forma here— The first extract was an acknowledgment of the receipt of
							the Baron’s first despatches from hence— High expressions of
							satisfaction at his conduct here, at the reception he had met with; at
							the consent of this Government, to treat of the Northwest Coast question
								<unclear>at</unclear> S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg.
							Intimations that <persRef ref="bagot-charles">Sir Charles
								Bagot</persRef> had also received Powers to treat concerning it on
							the part of Great-Britain; and that <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef> was authorised to
							enter upon the Negotiation during Count Nesselrode’s absence, with the
							Emperor— The second extract was an exposition of principles, relating to
							the affairs of Spain and Portugal— In a tone of passionate exultation at
							the Counter-revolution in Portugal; and the impending success of the
							French army in Spain. <unclear>Au Io</unclear> Triumphe over the fallen
							cause of Revolutions with sturdy promises of determination to keep it
							down; disclaimers of all intention of making conquests; bitter
							complaints of being calumniated; and one paragraph of compunction,
							acknowledging that an Apology is yet due to mankind for the invasion of
							Spain, which it is in the power only of <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii"
								>Ferdinand</persRef>, to furnish by making his people happy— That
							paragraph is a satire upon all the rest of the paper. The Baron left the
							two extracts with me, to be shewn to the President. He assured me that
							he was perfectly satisfied with my answer to his last Note, which he had
							received this Morning; and he spoke with great kindness and good will
							towards us— I told him, I could assure him from the knowledge I had of
							the President’s sentiments that they reposed great personal confidence
							in him— He said he should always endeavour to deserve it.</p>

							in Congress, will hold Caucuses so long as the People will bear them out
							in it by electing him whom they recommend— Nothing will put it down but
							failure of success, and although it is in its essence caballing, I
							consider it as one of the least obnoxious modes of intrigue— It is said
							the intention of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> friends is to
							precipitate a Caucus at the commencement of the ensuing Session of
							Congress, with a view to forestall the movements of the State

							formed in 1816. before the first Election of <persRef key="monroe-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>— This is the

							and recriminations, between Stewart and Prevost— He did not like to
							remove the latter, without giving him an opportunity of self-defence—
							Particularly as he was very poor— I said he ought certainly not to be
							removed without a previous hearing— But I had examined his charges and
							those of the Peruvian Government against Captain Stewart, and found them
							all unsupported by proof and contradicted by the Evidence. I requested

							accounts and some private affairs of his own— He said a half out-fit,
							having as he had heard been allowed to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, for his share in the
							Negotiation of the Convention of 3. July 1815—he thought himself
							entitled to make the same claim— I told him I would mention it for his
							Consideration— He made enquiries if we had any news from Europe, and I
							told him what is now passing in our diplomatic Relations with Great
							Britain and Russia— He made some remarks upon them, full of his usual
							shrewdness and sagacity. I had received a Note from the President,
							requesting me to attend a meeting of the members of the Administration
							at one— The meeting lasted till five— I took with me the draft of my
							despatch to <persRef ref="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> in answer to
								<persRef ref="canning-george">Canning’s</persRef> proposals, with
							the President’s projected Amendments, and my proposal of amendment upon
							amendment— We had a very long discussion upon one phrase, which seemed
							to me to require none at-all. The Sentiment expressed was that although
							we should throw no impediment in the way of an arrangement between Spain
							and her Ex Colonies by <hi rend="italic">amicable Negotiation</hi>, we
							should claim to be treated by the South-Americans upon the footing of
							equal favour with the most favoured Nation— The President had proposed a
							modifying amendment, which seemed to admit that we should not object to
							an arrangement by which special favours or even a restoration of
							authority might be conceded to Spain— To this I strenuously objected, as
							did <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>— The President ultimately acceded to the substance
							of the phrase as I had in the first instance made the draft; but finally
							required that the phraseology of it should be varied— Almost all the
							other amendments proposed by the President <pb type="ms" n="164"/>were
							opposed, principally by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, who most
							explicitly preferred my last substituted paragraph, to the President’s
							projected amendment— The President did not insist upon any of his
							amendments, which were not admitted by general consent; and the final
							paper though considerably varied from my original draft, will be
							conformable to my own views— The Supplementary Instruction, I had not
							finished; but read the part that I had prepared— I mentioned also my
							wish to prepare a paper to be delivered confidentially to <persRef
								ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef>; and the substance of
							which I would in the first instance, express to him in a verbal
							conference— It would refer to the verbal communications recently made by
							him, and to the Sentiments and Dispositions manifested in the Extract of
							a despatch relating to Spanish Affairs, which he lately put into my
							hands— My purpose would be in a moderate and conciliatory manner, but
							with a firm and determined Spirit, to declare our dissent from the
							principles avowed in those communications— To assert those upon which
							our own Government is founded; and while disclaiming all intention of
							attempting to propagate them by force, and all interference with the
							political affairs of Europe, to declare our expectation and hope that
							the European Powers will equally abstain from the attempt to spread
							their principles in the American Hemisphere, or to subjugate by force
							any part of these Continents to their will— The President approved of
							this idea; and then taking up the sketches, that he had prepared for his
							Message read them to us— Its introduction was in a tone of deep
							solemnity; and of high alarm—intimating that this country is menaced by
							imminent and formidable dangers; such as would probably soon call for
							their most vigorous energies, and the closest union— It then proceeded
							to speak of the foreign Affairs, chiefly according to the sketch I had
							given him some days since—but with occasional variations— It then
							alluded to the recent Events in Spain and Portugal, speaking in terms of
							the most pointed reprobation, of the late invasion of Spain by France,
							and of the principles upon which it was undertaken by the open avowal of
							the king of France— It also contained a broad acknowledgment of the
							Greeks as an Independent Nation, and a recommendation to Congress to
							make an appropriation for sending a Minister to them— Of all this M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun declared his approbation— I
							expressed as freely my wish that the President would reconsider the
							whole subject, before he should determine to take that course. I said
							the tone of the Introduction I apprehended would take the Nation by
							surprize, and greatly alarm them. It would come upon them like a Clap of
							thunder— There had never been in the History of this Nation a period of
							so deep calm and tranquility as we now enjoyed— We never were upon the
							whole in a state of peace so profound and secure with all foreign
							Nations as at this time— This Message would be a summons to arms— To
							arms against all Europe; and for objects of policy exclusively
							European—Greece and Spain— It would be as new too in our policy as it
							would be surprizing— For more than thirty years, Europe had been in
							convulsions; every Nation almost of which it is composed alternately
							invading and invaded— Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities had been
							overthrown, Revolutionised and counter-revolutionised; and we had looked
							on, safe in our distance beyond an intervening Ocean, and avowing a
							total forbearance to interfere <pb type="ms" n="165"/>in any of the
							combinations of European Politics. This Message would at once buckle on
							the harness, and throw down the gauntlet to all Europe— It would have
							the air of open defiance to all Europe, and I should not be surprized if
							the first answer to it from Spain, and France, and even Russia, should
							be to break off their diplomatic intercourse with us— I did not expect
							that the quiet which we had enjoyed for six or seven years would last
							much longer— The aspect of things was portentous; but if we must come to
							an issue with Europe, let us keep it off as long as possible— Let us use
							all possible means to carry the opinion of the Nation with us; and the
							opinion of the world— Calhoun said that he thought there was not the
							tranquility that I spoke of: that there was great anxiety in the
							thinking part of the Nation— That there was a general expectation the
							Holy Alliance would employ force against South-America; and that it
							would be proper that the President should sound the alarm to the Nation—
							A time was approaching when all its energies would be needed, and the
							public mind ought to be prepared for it— The President told us
							confidentially that <persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef>
							had written, praying that it might be kept secret, because whatever any
							person wrote there was reported back against him; but that whatever
							might be reported here, we might set it down for certain that France and
							the allies, would support Spain in the attempt to recover her Colonies
							by force— I observed to the President that I put very little reliance on
							any thing written by G. W. Erving— It might or might not eventuate as he
							said— But he knew nothing about the matter, more than was known to all
							the world; and had views of his own in whatever he wrote— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> said little; but inclined towards my view of the
							subject— The President finally said that he would draw up two sketches
							for consideration, conformable to the two different aspects of the
							subject— The President and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun,
							intimated the idea that there was a material difference in the Wars and
							Revolutions which since the year 1789. to this time have been raging in
							Europe; and this last invasion of Spain by France. That this was a more
							direct attack upon the popular principle— And that although no former
							Message ever censured those overthrows and conquests before, yet it
							might be very proper to censure this now— The question however is
							deferred— Eve at home, writing.</p>

								Norton</persRef>; I took the recommendations to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, who directed the commission
							to be immediately made out, which was done, and forwarded under cover to
							the district judge— I took also to the President, the Letter from the

								>Cheves</persRef> and <persRef ref="sewell-henry">Seawell</persRef>,
							and read it to him to take his directions what was to be done concerning

							with the President; but withdrew, on my going in— I left with the
							President, my draft for a second despatch to R. Rush on South-American
							Affairs— And I spoke to him again urging him to abstain from every thing
							in his Message which the holy allies could make a pretext for construing
							into aggression upon them— I said there were Considerations of weight
							which I could not even easily mention, at a cabinet Meeting— If he had
							determined to retire from the public service, at the end of his present
							term; it was now drawing towards a close— It was to be considered now as
							a whole, and a system of Administration, for a definite term of years—
							It would hereafter I believed be looked back to—<hi rend="italic"
								>as</hi><pb type="ms" n="166"/>as the golden age of this Republic,
							and I felt an extreme solicitude that its end might correspond with the
							character of its progress— That the Administration might be delivered
							into the hands of the Successor, whoever he might be, at peace and in
							amity with all the world. If this could not be; if the holy alliance
							were determined to make up an issue with us; it was our policy to meet
							and not to make it— We should retreat to the Wall, before taking to
							arms, and be sure at every step to put them as much as possible in the
							wrong— I said if the Holy Alliance really intended to restore by force
							the Colonies of Spain to her dominion, it was questionable to me whether
							we had not after all been over hasty in acknowledging the South-American
							Independence— It had pledged us now to take ground which we had not felt
							at-all bound to take five years ago. At the Congress of Aix la Chapelle,
							the allies had discussed what they should do with South-America, and we
							had not even thought of interfering with them— If they intend now to
							interpose by force, we shall have as much as we can do to prevent
							them—without going to bid them defiance in the heart of Europe—
							Something had been said yesterday that if the President did not
							recommend the recognition of the Independence of the Greeks, it would be
							pressed in the House of Representatives— What would be <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s</persRef>
							course in this case I could not foresee. But he, the President well
							knew, that at the time, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay so
							urgently pushed for the South American Independence, his main object was
							popularity for himself, and to embarrass the administration. It did not
							appear that this object was now so important to him, and as he had some
							prospect of coming to the succession himself, I should not suppose he
							would wish it encumbered with a quarrel with all Europe— But be that as
							it may, it was infinitely better that the impulse should come from
							Congress, than that it should go from the Executive. Congress are
							responsible for their own Acts— Foreign powers are apt to take less
							notice of them, than of Executive Measures, and if they put us in
							attitudes of hostility with the allies, be the blame upon them— The
							ground that I wish to take is that of earnest remonstrance against the
							interference of the European Powers, by force with South-America; but to
							disclaim all interference on our part with Europe; to make an American
							cause, and adhere inflexibly to that— The President said he had spoken
							of the Greeks and of the Spaniards in his last year’s Message— I said I
							should not object to paragraphs of a like description, in general terms
							and pleging nothing; but I would be specially careful to avoid any thing
							which may be construed as hastily to the Allies. He said he would fully
							consider what he should say, and when prepared with his draft would call
							a meeting of the members of the Administration— I mentioned to him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s claim of a half out-fit— He
							said he had allowed it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, because,
							after the Peace at Ghent he had received no appointment or offer of
							appointment to another Mission. After returning to the Office, I saw
							there M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Brown— He had not received my
							Letter having left Philadelphia to come here the same day that it went
							by the Mail from hence— He had this day seen the President who told him
							that the Letter was to advise him of his appointment to the Mission to
							France. He accepts it and I had a long conversation with him upon the
							subjects which will be embraced in his Instructions— He spoke of the
							indifferent Prospects of the Mission; and they are bad enough—also of
							the bad Season of the year, and the threatening aspects of public
							affairs; all of which was well founded— He thinks he will not be able to
							depart before the commencement of the next year.</p>

							of Mexico, than all the rest of Florida. He says it is a fine and
							spacious harbour, easily susceptible of fortification, and that all our

							passes in sight of it. I recommended young <persRef ref="bourne-george"
								>Bourne</persRef> to the Commodore, for the vacant place in the
							Office of the Navy Commissioners— <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> was here, and
							talked much upon the topics to be touched upon in the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> Message— His views
							coincided entirely with those which I have so earnestly urged upon the
							President; excepting as to the Greeks, to whom he proposes as if he was
							serious, that we should send two or three frigates to assist them in
							destroying the Turkish fleet; and a loan or a subsidy of two Millions of
							Dollars— I told Gallatin that I wished he would talk to the President as
							he had done to me, upon everything except the Greeks—but as to them; I
							said the President had asked me to see and converse with him on
							Saturday, which I had declined on account of the same proposition that
							he had made in a despatch more than a year since, to send a naval force
							to fight with the Turks— He spoke with extreme bitterness of <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, who he says, said to him in the presence of ten
							or twelve persons that, if our claimants upon France failed of obtaining
							indemnity, it was our own fault, in refusing to connect with it the
							claim of France under the 8<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of
							the Louisiana Convention— And that if we did not adjust that claim, it
							was his opinion, France ought to take Louisiana, and that she had a
							strong party there. He told me various anecdotes of other public
							characters in France; and mentioned again his own claim for a half
							outfit, upon the Negotiation in England of the Convention of 3. July
							1815. because it had been allowed to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— I told him of the
							distinction taken in the case by the President; though I thought it
							could not exclude the equity of his claim— At the Office, young Bourne
							and <persRef ref="armstrong-andrew">Armstrong</persRef> came each upon
							his usual errand; I told Bourne that I had recommended him to Commodore
							Rodgers; and Armstrong that I must yet take a few days to be prepared
							for him— <persRef ref="allen-heman2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heman
								Allen</persRef>, the appointed Minister to Chili came; just arrived
							from New-York, and proposing to go the day after to-morrow for Norfolk,

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Larned</persRef>, had been
							appointed Secretary to the Legation, and would bring him to Norfolk his
							definitive Instructions— I called at the President’s, and found M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin with him— He still adhered <pb
								type="ms" n="168"/>to his idea of sending a naval force and a loan
							of money to the Greeks; and as he is neither an Enthusiast nor a fool,
							and knows perfectly well, that no such thing will be done, I look for
							the motives of this strange proposal, and find them not very deeply
							laid— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin still builds Castles in
							the air of popularity, and being under no responsibility for
							consequences, patronizes the Greek cause, for the sake of raising his
							own reputation— His measure will not succeed, and even if it should, all
							the burden and danger of it will bear not upon him but upon the
							administration; and he will be the great champion of Greecian liberty—
							Tis the part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay towards South
							America acted over again— After he withdrew, the president read me his
							paragraphs respecting the Greeks, Spain, Portugal, and South-America— I
							thought them quite unexceptionable, and drawn up altogether in the
							Spirit that I had so urgently pressed on Friday and Saturday— I was
							highly gratified, at the change, and only hope the President will adhere
							to his present views— The President told me, he had only a short minute
							from the Treasury Department, by which it appeared there were on the
								30<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of September last near Nine
							Millions of Dollars in the Treasury— He had not yet examined the drafts

								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> continues convalescent, but was not well enough
							to attend— My proposal was that a paper like that which I had prepared,
							modified as the President should finally direct, be delivered by me to
							the Baron de Tuyll, in the form of an inofficial verbal Note— That I
							should invite him to a conference; then read the paper to him, deliver
							to him a copy of it, and tell him that I was willing to converse with
							him concerning it, if he thought proper. The paper itself was drawn to
							correspond exactly with a paragraph of the President’s Message, which he
							had read me yesterday, and which was entirely conformable to the system
							of policy which I have earnestly recommended for this emergency— It was
							also intended as a firm, spirited and yet conciliatory answer to all the
							communications lately received from the Russian Government, and at the
							same time an unequivocal answer to the proposals made by <persRef
								ref="canning-george">Canning</persRef> to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>— It
							was meant also to be eventually an exposition of the principles of this
							Government, and a brief developement of its political system as
							henceforth to be maintained— Essentially Republican— Maintaining its own
							Independence and respecting that of others— Essentially pacific—
							Studiously avoiding all involvement in the combinations of European
							Politics— Cultivating peace and friendship with the most absolute
							Monarchies <pb type="ms" n="169"/>highly appreciating, and anxiously
							desirous of retaining that of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef>, but declaring that having recognized the
							Independence of the South-American States, we could not see with
							indifference; any attempt by European Powers, by forcible interposition,
							either to restore the Spanish dominion, on the American Continents, or
							to introduce Monarchical principles into those Countries; or to transfer
							any portion of the antient or present American possessions of Spain to
							any other European Power— This paper was read, and thereupon ensued a
							desultory discussion till near five O’Clock, when the President
							adjourned the Meeting till twelve O’Clock to-morrow. Calhoun with many
							professions of diffidence and doubt, but only to prompt discussion,
							questioned whether it would be proper to deliver <hi rend="italic"
								>any</hi> such paper to the Russian Minister— The paper contained
							rather an ostentatious display of Republican Principles; it was making
							up an issue, perhaps too soon with the Holy Alliance. It would perhaps
							be offensive to the Emperor of Russia, and perhaps even to the British
							Government, which would by no means relish so much republicanism— He
							thought it would be sufficient to communicate to Baron Tuyll a copy of
							the paragraph of the President’s Message, to which my paper was adapted—
							The Message was a mere communication to our own People— Foreign powers
							might not feel themselves bound to notice what was said in that— It was
							like a family talking over subjects interesting to them by the fire
							side, among themselves— Many things might be said there without offence,
							even if a stranger should come among them and overhear the conversation,
							which would be offensive, if they went to his house to say them—
							Southard and Wirt both observed, that according to that allusion it was
							Russia, it was the Holy Alliance, who had come to our House to proclaim
							the Virtues and the glories of despotism; and my paper was nothing more
							than an answer to them— Calhoun said he thought my paper went rather
							farther than their’s. I observed that a copy of that paragraph of the
							President’s Message, might suffice for an indication of our principles;
							but I thought it due to the honour and dignity of the Nation, that an
							explicit and direct answer should be given to the communications from
							the Russian Government— After receiving one upon the back of another so
							many broad hints from them, the people of this Country, when they come
							to the knowledge of it will ask what was said in answer to them— The
							answer to the written ratification of the Emperor’s determination not to
							receive any Minister from South-America, was the tamest of all State
							Papers. The first draft of it had been softened, first at a Cabinet
							Meeting—then by an amended draft of the President, and finally by an
							amendment of mine upon that of the President— The answers to the
							notification of the Emperor’s hope and wish that the United States would
							continue their neutrality between Spain and South-America, were merely
							verbal— We had no written vouchers of them, but in the copies
							confidentially given by the Baron to me, of his despatches to his Court
							concerning them— Then came this last Extract of 30. August 1823.
							bearding us to our faces, upon the monarchical principles of the Holy
							Alliance— It was time to tender them an issue— In the last resort this
							was a Cause to be pleaded before the world of Mankind. Our Country, and
							the world would require, that our ground should be distinctly taken, as
							well as resolutely maintained. Now, in my belief was the time for taking
							it; and as I thought the Holy Alliance would not ultimately invade
							South-America, and firmly believed that the Emperor Alexander, did not
							mean to include us or any consideration of us, in his invectives against
							Revolution, I wished to give him an opportunity of disclaiming any such
							intention— I believed the Emperor Alexander was honestly wedded to his
							system— That he was profoundly penetrated with the conviction that he
							was <pb type="ms" n="170"/>labouring for the good of his people, and for
							the welfare of mankind. There was no man living, more sensitive to
							public opinion, as I knew from a multitude of proofs, but which was
							eminently shewn, by the importance which the Government itself attached
							to the editorial Article in the National Intelligencer which at the
							instance of the Baron de Tuyll, I had caused to be inserted, concerning
							the Northwest Coast question— My object in this paper was to appeal much
							to the personal feelings of the Emperor Alexander—to his love of Peace—
							To his religious impressions— To his sensibility to public opinion— To
							his old friendly offices and good-will towards the U. States. I would
							search all these sources of action, and bring him either to a formal
							disavowal of any dispositions unfriendly to the United States, or to an
							express declaration of what his intentions are— Calhoun’s objections
							were not supported, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt made a
							question far more important; and which I had made at a much earlier
							stage of these deliberations— It was whether we shall be warranted in
							taking so broadly the ground of resistance to the interposition of the
							Holy Allies, by force to restore the Spanish Dominion in South-America—
							It is and has been to me a fearful question— It was not now discussed;
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt remarked upon the danger of
							assuming the attitude of menace, without meaning to strike: and asked if
							the Holy Allies <hi rend="italic">should</hi> act in direct hostility
							against South-America, whether this Country would oppose them, by War?—
							My paper and the paragraph would certainly commit us as far as the
							Executive constitutionally could act on this point, and if we take this
							course, I should wish that a joint Resolution of the two Houses of
							Congress should be proposed and adopted to the same purport— But this
							would render it necessary to communicate to them, at least
							confidentially, the existing state of things. The Communications from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, were all at his own request,
							confidential— Those with Baron de Tuyll were yet so; but <hi
								rend="italic">he</hi> was desirous that part of them should be
							published, and I was yet to settle with him whether they should be
							communicated to Congress— My wish was to propose to him that they should
							all be communicated; and also that the substance of them should be
							communicated to <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Greuhm the Prussian Minister</persRef> here; for his
							Court— The <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king of
								Prussia</persRef> being one of the members of the Holy Alliance— The
							President did not finally decide upon the point of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s objection to the delivery of <hi
								rend="italic">any</hi> paper to Baron Tuyll: but retained my draft
							and the statement of the transactions between the Baron and me, to
							resume the Consideration of them to-morrow. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Wirt objected strongly to one paragraph of my draft; which
							he said was a hornet of a paragraph, and he thought would be excessively
							offensive— I said it was the cream of my paper; but I am sure the
							President will not suffer it to pass— The President seemed to entertain
							some apprehension that the Republicanism of my paper, might indispose
							the British Government to a cordial concert of operations with us— He
							said they were in a dilemma, between their anti-jacobin policy; the
							dread of their internal reformers which made them sympathise with the
							Holy Allies, and the necessities of their Commerce and Revenue, with the
							pressure of their debts and taxes, which compelled them to side with
							South-American Independence for the sake of South-American trade— He
							believed they must ultimately take this side; but if we should shock and
							alarm them upon the political side of the question; and the Holy Allies
							could hold out to them any thing to appease the craving of their
							commercial and fiscal interest, they might go back to the Allies—as
							Portugal has gone back—insignificant and despised; but leaving us in the
							lurch, with all Europe arrayed against us— I replied That at all Events
							nothing that we <pb type="ms" n="171"/>should now do would commit us to
							absolute War— That Great-Britain was already committed more than we—
							That the interest of no one of the allied Powers, would be promoted by
							the restoration of South America to Spain; that the interest of each one
							of them was against it, and that if they could possibly agree among
							themselves upon a partition principle, the only possible bait they could
							offer to Great-Britain, for acceding to it was Cuba, which neither they
							nor Spain would consent to give her— That my reliance upon the
							co-operation of Great Britain rested not upon her principles, but her
							interest— This I thought was clear. But that my paper came in conflict
							with no principle which she would dare to maintain— We avowed
							Republicanism, but we disclaimed propagandism; we asserted National
							Independence to which she was already fully pledged— We disavowed all
							interference with European affairs; and my whole paper was drawn up, to
							come in conclusion precisely to the identical declaration of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning himself, and to express our
							concurrence with it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt supported me in these remarks— After
							the adjournment of the meeting, <persRef ref="allen-heman2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Allen</persRef> called at the
							Office. He had a Letter from <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore
								Hull</persRef>, saying he would be ready to sail on or before the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of next Month— He took leave of me,
							intending to go for Norfolk to-morrow— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>26. V:30.</date> Morning occupied on the Journal of yesterday.
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
								Brent</persRef> called, and I gave him directions for the copying of
							certain papers, for me. Received a Note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, advising me to detain
								<persRef ref="allen-heman2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H.
								Allen</persRef> here a few days, to peruse the late despatches from
								<persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, relating to
							South-America— I sent immediately for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Allen, who called on me, and agreed to wait a few days— I desired him to
							call at the Office of the Department, and read there M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s despatches— I attended the
							adjourned Cabinet Meeting at the President’s, from half past 12. four
							hours. At the President’s request, I read the Statement of what has
							passed between <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef> and
							me since the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month and then my
							proposed draught of Observations upon the communications recently
							received from him— The President then read the draught of the
							corresponding paragraph for his Message to Congress—and asked whether it
							should form part of the Message— I took a review of the preceding
							transactions of the Cabinet Meetings: remarking that the present
							questions had originated, in a draft which he had presented merely for
							consideration of an Introduction to the Message of unusual solemnity,
							indicating extraordinary concern and even alarm at the existing state of
							things; coupled with two paragraphs one containing strong and pointed
							censure upon France and the Holy Allies for the invasion of Spain; and
							the other recommending an appropriation for a Minister to send to the
							Greeks and in substance recognizing them as Independent. That the course
							now proposed is substitute for that— And that it is founded upon the
							idea that if an issue must be made up between us and the Holy Alliance,
							it ought to be upon grounds exclusively American— That we should
							separate it from all European concerns—disclaim all intention of
							interfering with these, and make the stand altogether for an American
							Cause. That at the same time the answer to be given to the Russian
							Communications should be used as the means of answering also the
							proposals of <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Canning</persRef>, and of assuming the attitude
							to be maintained by the United States with reference to the designs of
							the Holy Alliance, upon South-America— This being premised I observed
							that the whole of the papers now drawn up were but various parts of one
							system, under consideration; and the only really important question to
							be determined, as it appeared to me, was that yesterday made by <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>,
							and which <pb type="ms" n="172"/>had been incidentally discussed
							before—namely whether we ought at-all to take this attitude as regards
							South-America— Whether we get any advantage by commiting ourselves to a
							course of opposition against the Holy Alliance— My own mind indeed is
							made up that we ought thus far to take this stand; but I thought it
							deserved great deliberation, and ought not to be taken without a full
							and serious estimate of consequences— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt then resumed the objection he had taken yesterday, and freely
							enlarged upon it— He said he did not think this Country would support
							the Government in a War for the Independence of South America— There had
							never been much general excitement in their favour. Some part of the
							People of the interior had felt warmly for them, but it never had been
							general; and never had there been a moment when the People thought of
							supporting them by War— To menace without intending to strike was
							neither consistent with the honour nor the dignity of the Country— It
							was possible that the proposals of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning themselves were traps laid to ensnare us into public
							declarations against the Holy Allies, without intending ever to take
							part against them— That if we were to be so far committed, all the
							documents ought to be communicated to Congress, and they ought to
							manifest their Sentiments in the form of Resolutions, and that the
							Executive ought not to pledge the honour of the Nation to War, without
							taking the sense of the Country with them— <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> supported the
							other view of the question. He said the great object of the measure was
							to detach Great-Britain definitively from the Holy Alliance—
							Great-Britain would not, could not resist them alone, we remaining
							neutral. She would fall eventually into their views, and the
							South-Americans would be subdued— The next step the allies would then
							take would be against ourselves—to put down what had been called the
							first example of successful democratic rebellion— It was probable that
							by taking the stand now, the Holy alliance would be deterred from any
							forcible interposition with South-America; but if not we ought to
							sustain the ground now taken even to the extent of War. There was danger
							in both alternatives— But the immediate danger was light, the contingent
							one to be averted was formidable in the extreme— It was wisdom in this,
							as in many of the occurrences of Life, public and private to incur the
							light hazard for the purpose of warding off the great one— And as this
							was the wise course he had no doubt it would be sustained by the People
							of this Country, if the exigency should require it— They would always
							sustain the wisest course when it was properly explained to them. He did
							believe that the Holy Allies had an ultimate eye to us— That they would
							if not resisted subdue South-America— He had no doubt they would retain
							the Country in subjection by military force— Success would give them
							partizans— Violent parties would arise in this Country, one for and one
							against them; and we should have to fight upon our own shores for our
							own institutions— He was therefore in favour of the President’s Message;
							with the proposed paragraph— But he thought a copy of it might be
							delivered to Baron Tuyll, with notice that it was to be considered as
							the answer to the communications recently received from him. The
							paragraph in the message said in substance the same as the draft of the
							Paper; but the Message was a talk among ourselves, which foreigners
							might be told they have no right to take notice— To say the same thing
							directly to him <pb type="ms" n="173"/>might be offensive— There was
							more developement in my draft— There was an ostentatious display of
							Republican, <hi rend="italic">contrasted</hi> with monarchical
							principles, always shewing the superiority of the former— If he
							consulted his personal inclination, he should be in favour of the draft.
							He had no doubt that our own People would be delighted with it; but he
							believed it would be deeply offensive to the Holy Allies, and also to
							the British Government, who with regard to Monarchical principles would
							sympathize entirely with them— I said with regard to the objections of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, that I considered them of the
							deepest moment— I was glad they had been made, and trusted the President
							would give them full consideration before coming to his definitive
							decision— If they prevailed, neither the paragraph in the message, nor
							my draft would be proper— The draft was prepared precisely to correspond
							with the paragraph in the Message— I did believe however that both would
							be proper and necessary— Not that I supposed that the Holy Alliance, had
							any intention of ultimately attacking us, or meant to establish monarchy
							among us— But if they should really invade South-America, and especially
							Mexico, it was impossible in the nature of things that they should do it
							to restore the old exclusive dominion of Spain— Spain had not, and never
							could again have the physical force to maintain that dominion; and if
							the Countries should be kept in subjugation by the armies of the Allies,
							was it in human absurdity to imagine, that they should waste their blood
							and treasure, to prohibit their own subjects upon pain of death to set
							foot upon those territories? Surely not— If then the Holy Allies, should
							subdue Spanish America, however they might at first set up the Standard
							of Spain, the ultimate result of their undertaking would be to
							recolonize them partitioned out among themselves— Russia might take
							California, Peru, Chili—France Mexico where we know she has been
							intriguing to get a Monarchy under a Prince of the House of Bourbon, as
							well as at Buenos-Ayres— And Great Britain as her last resort, if she
							could not resist this course of things would take at least the Island of
							Cuba, for her share of the scramble. Then what would be our situation.
							England holding Cuba—France Mexico, and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> had told me
							within these four days, that <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde
								de Neuville</persRef>, had said to him in the presence and hearing
							of ten or twelve persons that if we did not yield to the claim of France
							under the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Article of the Louisiana
							Convention, she ought to go and take the Country; and that she had a
							strong party there— The danger therefore was brought to our own doors;
							and I thought we could not too soon take our stand to repel it— There
							was another point of view, which the President had in part suggested,
							and which I thought highly important— Suppose the Holy Allies should
							attack South-America, and Great-Britain should resist them alone, and
							without our co-operation. I thought this not an improbable contingency,
							and I believed in such a struggle the Allies would be defeated and
							Great-Britain would be victorious, by her command of the Sea— But as the
							Independence of the South-Americans would then be only be protected by
							the guaranty of Great-Britain, it would throw them completely into her
							arms, and in the result make them her Colonies instead of those of
							Spain— My opinion was therefore that we must act—promptly and
							decisively— But the act of the Executive could not after all commit the
							Nation to a pledge of War. Nor was War contemplated by the proposals of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning— He had explicitly stated to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush from the beginning that his
							object was merely a concerted expression of Sentiment; <pb type="ms"
								n="174"/>which he supposed would avert the necessity of War; and as
							Great-Britain was not and would not be pledged by any thing that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning had said or proposed to War, so
							would any thing now done by the Executive here, leave Congress free
							hereafter to act or not according as the circumstances of the emergency
							may require— With regard to the point made by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun, my opinion was directly opposite to that which he
							had expressed— The communications from the Russian Minister required a
							direct and explicit answer. A communication of the paragraph in the
							President’s Message would be no answer, and if given <hi rend="italic"
								>as</hi> an answer, would certainly be very inconsistent with the
							position that foreigners have no right to notice it because it was all
							said among ourselves— This would precisely as if a stranger should come
							to me with a formal and insulting display of his principles in the
							management of his family, and his conduct towards his neighbours,
							knowing them to be opposite to mine; and as if I instead of turning upon
							him, and answering him face to face; should turn to my own family, and
							discourse to them upon my principles and conduct with sharp inuendoes
							upon those of the Stranger; and they say to him—there! take that for
							your answer! and yet you have no right to notice it; for it was only
							said to <unclear>my</unclear> own family, and behind your back— I
							thought as the Holy Alliance had come to edify and instruct us, with
							their principles, it was due in candour to them, and in Justice to
							ourselves to return them the compliment. And if the People of our
							Country should hereafter know, as they must, how much good advice the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> has been
							giving us in private; they would not be satisfied to be told, that the
							only return we had made to him for it, was to send him a copy of the
							President’s Message to Congress. I felt the more solicitude that a
							direct and explicit answer should be given him, because the Baron in one
							of his despatches, had intimated that I had expressed not only an
							earnest desire that we might remain on good terms with Russia, but high
							opinions of the Emperor’s Moderation— In my report of the conferences I
							had stated what was said by me at the Conferences, and from which the
							Baron had drawn his inference— I had told him that having while residing
							at his Court witnessed the many acts of friendship for the United States
							of the Emperor Alexander, I had formed sentiments of high respect for
							his character, and even of personal attachment to him. This was true— I
							thought better of him than perhaps any other person at this Meeting; and
							I did not believe there was one word in my draft that would give him
							Offence— The avowal of principles, connected with the disclaimer of
							interference in European Affairs, of Proselytism, and of hostile
							purposes, could not offend him— I thought it most essential— I was
							willing to agree to any modification which might be thought advisable
							but the distinct avowal of principle appeared to me to be absolutely
							required— The paper acknowledged that we were aware the monarchical
							principle of Government was different from ours, but it declared that we
							saw no reason why they should not be at peace with each other, and that
							we earnestly desired that peace— The Emperor’s reply might be that he
							desired equally that Peace— That by the invasion of Spain the allies
							meant to interfere neither with the Liberty nor the Independence of
							Spain. That the Spanish Nation was with them, and that they had only put
							down a faction, originating and supported by military mutiny; which the
							allies would not recognize— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt both declared that they thought a
							distinct and direct answer should be given to the Russian
							Communications— But they scrutinized and objected to many of the details
							of the paper— Wirt referring again to the paragraph which he had
							yesterday called a hornet, said it reminded him of a Virginian, who
							declared, his principle was that if a man gave him a fillip on the nose,
							he would knock him down with a brick bat. Southard objected to the
							admission that we were aware the monarchical <pb type="ms" n="175"
							/>principle of Government differed from ours, after stating that ours
							were principles of Liberty. Independence and Peace— I said that the
							details of the paper were entirely at the disposal of the President—
							That in drawing it up my object had been to make it as close, compact,
							and significant as possible— That every part of it was connected with
							the whole, and that from the first line to the last, I meant all should
							bear upon the declaration with which it concludes—the answer at once to
							Russia and Great-Britain— Southard said he had distinctly perceived that
							was the object of the Paper— The President retained the paper, to
							determine finally upon it to-morrow Morning. He approved the draft of
							the second despatch, prepared for R. Rush, but enquired what was the
							particular meaning of one paragraph in the first. I told him that was
							for me to ask of him, as it was a paragraph in the amendment drawn by
							himself, and in his own words; at which he heartily laughed. He desired
							me however finally so to modify the despatches to R. Rush, so as not to
							refuse co-operating with Great Britain, even if she should yet demur to
							the recognition of South-American Independence. He gave my draft of
							General Instructions to <persRef ref="allen-heman2">H. Allen</persRef> to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, to prepare corresponding
							Instructions to <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore Hull</persRef>— It
							was near five when the meeting broke up— The first part of the Evening I
							was writing journal. The last at Cards above with <persRef

						<p><date>27. VI:30.</date><persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef> brought me this
							morning a Note from the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>,
							with the draft of my observations on the communications recently
							received from the <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Russian
								Minister</persRef>; advising the omission, of all the paragraphs to
							which objection had been made at the Cabinet Meetings; and requesting me
							to see the Baron de Tuyll immediately— I directed a copy to be made of
							the paper omitting all the passages marked by the President for
							omission, and desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent, to write a
							Note in my name to the Baron requesting him to call at the Office of the
							Department at three O’Clock— In the meantime I went to the President’s,
							and took the draft of my Statement of what has passed between me and the
							Baron since the 16<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of October— I told the
							President that I had directed the copy to be made out, of the
							Observations, conformably to his direction— That I cheerfully gave up
							all the passages marked for omission, excepting one; and that was the
							second paragraph of the paper, containing the exposition of our
							principles— That paragraph was in my own estimation, the heart of the
							paper— All the rest was only a series of deductions from it— The paper
							received from Baron Tuyll, and to which the Observations were intended
							for an answer, was professedly an exposition of Principles— I had
							thought it should be met directly by an exposition of ours. This was
							done, in three lines, in the paragraph in the question— The first
							paragraph of my paper stated the fact that the Government of the United
							States was Republican. The second; what the fundamental principles of
							this Government were—referring them all, to <hi rend="italic"
								>Liberty</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Independence</hi>—<hi rend="italic"
								>Peace</hi>— These were the principles, from which all the remainder
							of the paper were drawn— Without them the rest was a fabric without a
							foundation. The positions taken in the paragraph were true— I could not
							possibly believe they would give offence to anyone— I was sure they
							would not to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>,
							unless he had determined to invade South-America; and if he had, this
							paper which was to be our protest against it, could not too distinctly
							set forth the <hi rend="italic">principles</hi> of our opposition to his
							design— The object of the paragraph was to set those principles in the
							broadest and boldest relief— To compress into one sentence, the
							foundation upon which the mind and heart at once could repose, for our
							justification of the stand we are taking against the Holy Alliance, in
							the face of our Country and of Mankind— I had much confidence in the
							effect of that paragraph; first as persuasion to the Emperor Alexander,
								<pb type="ms" n="176"/>and if that failed as our manifesto to the
							world— I added by way of apology for the solicitude that I felt on this
							subject, that I considered this as the most important paper that ever
							went from my hands— That in this, as in every thing I wrote, in
							discharge of the Office that I held, I was the Agent of his
							Administration; the general responsibility of which rested upon him— But
							that having so long served himself in the Department, I need not say to
							him that besides that general responsibility, there was a peculiar one
							resting upon each head of a department for the papers issued from his
							own office, and this was my motive for wishing to retain a paragraph,
							which I considered as containing the Soul of the document to which it
							belonged— I should only say further that after making these
							observations, I should cheerfully acquiesce in his decision— He admitted
							that there was a peculiar responsibility upon me for the paper, but said
							he had thought the exposition of principles was sufficiently clear, from
							the part of the paper proposed to be retained. That there had been
							apprehensions that this paragraph might give offence, appearing as a
							direct avowal of principles contrary to those acted upon by the holy
							allies, and thus <hi rend="italic">implying</hi> censure upon them— That
							the crisis was a great one, and it was all-important that the measures
							now taken should be adopted with all possible unanimity. That if however
							I would send over to him the original draft of the paper, he would again
							examine it and let me know his final opinion with regard to the
							readmission of the paragraph. I returned to the Office, and sent him the
							draft, the copy having been made with the paragraph omitted. <persRef
								ref="allen-heman2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Allen</persRef>
							the Minister to Chili came and had some conversation with me, upon the
							despatches from <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef> which he had read— I communicated to him
							the substance of the present interchange of <hi rend="italic"
								>opinions</hi>, with Russia, concerning South-America— <persRef
								ref="rankin-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rankin</persRef> of Mississippi; and <persRef ref="mckee-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kee</persRef>, a new member of the
							House from Alabama, called for a visit— At 3. O’Clock Baron Tuyll came,
							before, I had received my draft back from the President— I told him that
							according to our agreement, I had sent to enquire with regard to the
							publication of the two Notes which had passed between us, what were his
							definitive wishes— That the Session of Congress was about to commence,
							and if he wished it our two notes would be communicated to them with the
							President’s Message— That we should prefer this course, and even that
							the whole substance of what had passed at our verbal conferences, and
							the extract which he had communicated to me dated 30. August, with some
							observations upon the whole which I was directed to read and deliver to
							him now, should be thus made known to Congress and the Public. But in
							this respect we should take the course most agreeable to him— He said
							that he did not see any objection to the communication and publication
							of the two Notes; but with regard to the rest, perhaps his Government
							might not wish that it should be made public— The note of 1. September,
							extract might be called even more than confidential; and he would thank
							me, if after the President shall have done with it, I would return it to
							him— The extract sent him of 30. August was in its express terms to be
								<hi rend="italic">confidentially</hi> used; and as the publication
							would in all probability produce excitement, and occasion public obloquy
							not only upon his Government, but upon the President’s administration
							itself, he believed it would be on the whole best not to publish them;
							but would be glad to take a day or two further to consider of it. As to
							a publication by him, as I had observed to him, foreign Ministers, by
							the freedom of the Press, had the power to avail themselves of it; but
							he should make no use of that expedient— I said that with regard to the
							effect of publication to produce animadversions upon his Government, I
							wished to leave it entirely to his own consideration. I had no doubt it
							would excite censure upon the Administration, but for that we were
							prepared. We knew it would come upon any thing we should do, and we knew
							the extent of its power. We <pb type="ms" n="177"/>wished therefore that
							he should take no account whatever of that, as we should prefer the
							publication of the whole. While we were at this stage of the
							conversation, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent called me out and
							gave me a note from the President returning my original draft—expressing
							the apprehension that the paragraph of principles contained a <hi
								rend="italic">direct </hi>attack upon the Holy allies; by a
							statement of principles which they had violated—but yet consenting that
							I should reinsert the paragraph on account of the importance that I
							attached to it— I returned to the Baron, and read him the copy of my
							observations as it had been made, omitting the contested paragraph— And
							I told him that I should furnish him a copy of it in the course of the
							day— He thanked me for the communication, of which he said he should
							immediately send a copy to his Court. With regard to speculation upon
							what might be done or intended concerning South American Affairs, he
							could foretell nothing because he could foresee nothing— His
							instructions said nothing to him of it. But of the generally friendly
							dispositions of the Emperor towards the United States he was perfectly
							sure— The United States were a Republic— It was clear, that in a
							Republic, Republican principles must prevail— Between the first
							principles of Republican and Monarchical Government, it was not
							necessary nor could it be useful to enter upon a discussion— It was one
							of the most difficult questions of public Law; about which it was not
							probable that the opinions of men would ever be brought to agree— But
							that difference of principle did not necessarily involve hostile
							collision between them— The imperial Government distinguished clearly
							between a Republic like that of the United States, and rebellions
							founded on revolts against legitimate authority. What he complaine of
							was, that in the minds of many persons here, and in the representations
							of others this distinction was confounded— That no credit was given to
							his government for it; and that a disbelief of its being recognized, was
							inculcated— As to the communication and publication of the papers he
							would now say that he wished none of them should be published— I had
							told him that if the two Notes alone should be communicated, and some
							member of Congress should accidentally hear that any thing else had
							passed, there would probably be a Resolution of one or the other House
							calling for it— And where asking for such a Resolution was sufficient to
							obtain its adoption, and might draw forth all the papers that had
							passed, he preferred that no part of it should be communicated— It might
							in some sort personally implicate himself, with his own Government. He
							had indeed done nothing that he could not fully justify. But he had not
							been specially instructed, to address an official Note to this
							Government, even upon the Resolution of the Emperor, not to receive any
							South-American Agents— He had thought it the best mode of making the
							Emperor’s determination known: and with the same view he had informed
							the other members of the Corps Diplomatique residing here that he had
							addressed such a Note to me— He should deem this a sufficient execution
							of the Instructions to give publicity to the Emperor’s decision— I told
							him we should in that case consider all that had passed as yet
							confidential, and he might be assured that his confidence should in no
							case be abused— It was possible that members of Congress might get some
							intimation of what had been done; particularly as there had been
							communications between us and Great Britain also relating to
							South-America— But if such Resolution as I had suggested might pass,
							should be adopted, there was usually reserved an exception of all such
							information, as the President might think it improper to communicate;
							and nothing would be given which would compromit him— He said that after
							receiving the copy of my observations; perhaps something would occur to
							him, on which he should be glad to confer with me again; in which case
							he would ask for another interview— I told him I should always be happy
							to receive him— Soon after he left me <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> came in, to
							ask if I had delivered to the President his Letter, claiming a
							half-outfit, upon the Negotiation of the Convention of 3. July 1815.
							because it had been allowed to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— In the hurry of our
							late business, it had not been taken to the President, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent having left the Office it could not
							now be found. Gallatin entered into conversation with me on public
							affairs, and told me he had been with the President, who had read to
							him, my observations on the late communications from Baron Tuyll. He had
							seen nothing objectionable in them except one paragraph, which he
							thought would certainly be offensive to the Emperor; because it <pb
								type="ms" n="178"/>contained a direct censure upon what he had done;
							by an exposition of principles with which he would not agree— Liberty,
							being nothing to him; and as to Independence, it was his habit to meddle
							and interfere with every thing— Ever since the restoration of the
							Bourbons; there was nothing, even the smallest details in which his
							Ambassadors did not interfere, in France. They had destroyed the
								<persRef ref="richelieu-armand">Duke of Richelieu</persRef>, by
							making him change the Election Law, against his Will: and he had even
							interfered here, to advise us not to take Florida— The Emperor Alexander
							had at one time inclined to the liberal opinions— But that was now much
							changed— In 1814—<persRef ref="canning-george">Canning</persRef>
							answering some smart speech of <persRef ref="stael-anne">Madame de
								Stael’s</persRef> said to her—“you had that from your Jacobin friend
							the Emperor of Russia”— This was reported within 24 hours to the
							Emperor; to whom some explanatory apology was made— But now the
							Emperor’s prejudices are quite of a different character. The alteration
							was said to have been effected by the murder of <persRef
								ref="kotzebue-august">Kotzebue</persRef>— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin that I had pleaded hard with the
							President for the paragraph, which I thought altogether essential to the
							paper, but that I had read the paper without the paragraph, to Baron
							Tuyll— I went between five and six, again to the President’s, and told
							him of the interview, I had had with the Baron, and that I had read the
							paper to him, with omission of the paragraph—and I reported to him the
							substance of all that had passed between the Baron and me— He desired me
							to see the Baron again, and tell him that if there should be a call of
							Congress, concerning his correspondence and conferes with me, it would
							be answered by a Report from me, which should be shewn to him before it
							is sent in— The President asked me also to request M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen the appointed Minister to Chili—
								<unclear>He</unclear> calls upon him tomorrow morning— <persRef
								ref="mcknight-anna">Miss Ann M’Knight</persRef> dined, and spends
							the Night here— This Evening <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

								<persRef ref="allen-heman2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H.

							Norfolk— Having seen the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							this Morning. At the Office, came the <persRef ref="menou-charles">Count
								de Menou</persRef>, Chargé d’Affaires from France— Speaking of the
							Convention of 24. June 1822. which is for two years, and longer until
							either party shall give to the other six months notice, of its intention
							to put an end to it; he asked if in case the French Government should
							conclude to give that notice, it must be given here— I said no doubt. It
							must be given <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the Government—here if by
							France— At Paris, if by us. He said he had no reason to suppose that the
							French Government intended to give that Notice: but the question had
							occured to him this Morning— He spoke also of a claim belonging to a
							Prince of Luxemburg, and others upon the State of South-Carolina; of
							which part payment has been mare; but there are residual payments to be
							made to several individuals who cannot be ascertained for want of
							vouchers— The claim originated in the South-Carolina frigate, during the
							revolutionary War. In the year 1807. the Legislature of South-Carolina
							made provision for the payment, and it was paid in part; this act the
							Count shewed me— But about two years since they passed an Act
							withdrawing the fund which had been appropriated for the remainder— So
								<persRef ref="hayne-robert">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Hayne</persRef> the Senator from South-Carolina had told him this
							morning— The <persRef ref="chateaubriand-francois">Viscount de

							the State of South-Carolina, would pay over the money to the French
							Government, on their undertaking to satisfy all the <pb type="ms"
								n="179"/>claimants and to give the State a discharge in full— The
							Count enquired whether the Government of the United States would
							recommend this arrangement to the State of South-Carolina— I said I
							would take the directions of the President concerning it; and he might
							perhaps authorize me to send to the <persRef ref="wilson-john3">Governor
								of South-Carolina</persRef>, any Note which the Count should write
							me upon the subject— The Count said he had heard it rumoured that
								<persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brown</persRef> of Louisiana was appointed Minister to France, and
							asked if it was true— I said it was, and the Count expressed great
							satisfaction at the choice— <persRef ref="buchanan-mckean">M<hi

							Philadelphia, brought me a Letter of recommendation from <persRef

								ref="addington-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addington</persRef> came to speak of a Note, which he wrote me a few
							days since upon a long standing subject of complaint against our duties
							upon rolled iron— I told him that the Note was before the President—
							That we should endeavour to obtain from Congress the modification
							desired rather from a disposition to give the most liberal construction
							to the Convention, than from a full conviction of the correctness of
								<persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning’s</persRef> argument— We had also much conversation upon the
							subject of the Colonial Intercourse, and less upon the South-American
							topic— He said <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef> had
							only read to him the despatch he had received from his Government
							announcing the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							determination not to receive Agents from South-America— He also read me
							a Letter from the <persRef ref="buchanan-james3">British Consul at
								New-York</persRef>, enquiring what he was to do, in cases of British
							Seamen, who entrapped, by intoxication, to declare themselves American
							Citizens, and then enlisted into our service, and afterwards wished to
							be discharged. Addington said that he had answered him, he should do
							nothing. For two reasons—first because a man, who even when drunk would
							renounce his Country, could deserve no after-interference in his favour;
							and secondly because such a man’s declaration, when sober, was no better
							than his declaration to the contrary, drunk— But said Addington, to get
							rid of the importunities of a meddlesome, tetchy, brouillon of a Consul,
							if in such cases there were means privately of discharging such men, he
							would consider it as a favour. I said I would speak of it to the
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>— That
							we had no desire to engage or to retain British Sailors in our service;
							but in such cases as he alluded to the principal difficulty would be in
							ascertaining the facts— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> called
							at the Office, and spoke to me of <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew

								Decatur’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary
								Hellen</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail
								Adams</persRef> went and dined with her— I wrote in the Evening,
							till the pen dropp’d from my hand, with drowsiness— <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> was here part of the
							Evening, just arrived from New-York. He says there were this afternoon
							120 seats of members of the House already taken, and he had no doubt
							there were 150 members in the City— This is earlier than usual. We had
							about two hours of conversation upon various political topics; the
							recent Election in the State of New-York—the impending election of
							Speaker of the House of Representatives; and the more distant
							Presidential Election— He spoke especially of the Election of a
							Vice-President, and intimated that <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford’s</persRef> friends had in view for that Office <persRef
								ref="yates-joseph">Governor Yates</persRef> of New-York, who desired
							it— I asked him what was to be done with <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tompkins</persRef>, who had not
							declined— He seemed to think that after eight years service; it was <hi
								rend="italic">Common Law</hi>, that the Vice-Presidency, as well as
							the chief magistracy should change hands— And he said that as he came
							through the City of New-York, he heard that he was in prison, for 10000
							dollars at the suit of <persRef ref="munro-jay">Peter Jay
								Munro</persRef>— It was for money that Munro had been compelled to
							pay as bondsman or endorser for Tompkins; but he understood it was
							probable the affair would be adjusted— No doubt, it was desirable that
							some provision should be made for the comfortable support of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tompkins, but the character of the State,
							and of the Nation was too much at stake for his re-election to the
							office of Vice-President— It was possible perhaps not improbable that
							there should be three candidates for the Presidency to be chosen by the
							House of Representatives; and no majority be found practicable for
							either of them— In which case the Executive Government must be
							administered by the Vice-President, though he knew not <pb type="ms"
								n="180"/>whether for a whole Presidential term or only until a new
							Election for President could be held— I told him I had seen a paragraph
							in the Richmond Enquirer; stating that there was a plan to that effect
							on foot, and that the Vice-President thus to be chosen had been named to
							them. This was all that I knew of the matter— But there would be so
							great inconvenience in devolving upon the Vice-President the Executive
							power, from mere inability to choose a President, that if the case
							should occur of three Candidates, as he had supposed, and no majority
							could be formed for either, I should expect one of them would ultimately
							withdraw— He said neither of them could withdraw— As he could not
							prevent those who adhered to him from voting for him. I said that if the
							case was supposable that I should be one of them, and should have of the
							three the smallest number of the electoral votes, I should not only
							think it my duty to withdraw, but to declare that if elected, I would
							not accept—rather than that the election should fail. We had also much
							conversation upon the approaching choice of Speaker, and the various
							contingencies of Taylor’s competition with <persRef key="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="barbour-philip">Barbour</persRef> and
							perhaps <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>— He did not know
							whether Clay intended to stand as a Candidate, or decline—and if he
							should stand, whether he, Taylor, should stand against him, or decline—
							I could give him no information, but only told him that if he should
							stand, he would have my best wishes for his success— He said about one
							half the delegation from New-York in the House, were personally and
							politically his friends: the other half were also personally friendly to
							him; but would vote as <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van-Buren</persRef> would prescribe.
							He said also that Barbour’s friends were sanguine for his success in the
							hope of deterring Clay from offering, by a shew of competition.</p>

							Hickey that he must apply again to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Caldwell for the original, and if it could not be found, and there was a

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar’s</persRef> two Letters of
							complaint from Peru, against <persRef ref="stewart-charles">Captain

							the Office— I told him that having received his first Letter at Boston,
							the President being in Virginia, it had not been in my power immediately
							to answer him— That on receiving the second here I had prepared a draft
							of an answer, and on submitting it to the President, he had thought it
							would be best that I should first see and personally converse with him
							upon it— I then read him the draft of my Letter, which after setting
							forth the friendly dispositions of this Government to all the
							South-American Nations, and particularly to the Republic of Colombia,
							enquired whether the Colombian Government held itself responsible for
							the acts of the Government of Peru, of which the United States, or their
							Citizens have cause to complain— He said immediately that he thought
							not— I observed that we had received a <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>
							complaint from the Government of Peru, against Captain Stewart, which we
							should directly answer— That we had proofs the complaint was unfounded,
							and had causes of complaint against the Governments of Peru and Chili—
							He said that his Instructions were, merely to transmit the papers,
							containing the complaints without entering into any discussion about <pb
								type="ms" n="181"/>them. That the Minister of State of Peru had
							written to him, saying that a Minister from Peru to the United States
							would soon be appointed, and in the mean time requesting him to
							communicate the documents of complaint against Captain Stewart— There
							was a Treaty of Alliance between Colombia, and Peru, by virtue of which
								<persRef ref="bolivar-simon">General Bolivar</persRef> with his army
							was at Lima: and that was the interest which Colombia had in the
							complaint— But he was sensible he was not the person through whom the
							complaint should be made, as he was not the Minister of Peru, and he had
							so written to his Government: nor should he do any thing further in the
							case— I told him I had heard of the Treaty between Colombia, and Peru,
							that he had mentioned; and that it had also been concluded with Chili,
							and was proposed to Buenos-Ayres; and <persRef ref="todd-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef> had understood <persRef
								ref="gual-pedro">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gual</persRef> to
							say that he, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar, would communicate
							it immediately after his arrival in this Country— He said he would
							communicate it—and he gave me the Report made by the Colombian Minister
							of Foreign Affairs, D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gual, to the
							Congress, in May last, and read to me a passage in it relating to the U.
							States, and the project of a Treaty of Commerce with them— He said the
							Colombian Government were desirous of concluding such a Treaty with us,
							but the only question was of the <hi rend="italic">place</hi>, where it
							should be made. They were desirous chiefly, for the advantage of the
							example in Europe, that it might be negotiated at Bogota. And he added
							that the Swedish Government had sent last winter <persRef
								ref="lorich-severin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lorich</persRef>
							there, with proposals for a commercial negotiation— I told him that the
							late <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Torres</persRef>, in his Notes requesting the acknowledgement of the
							Independence of the Republic of Colombia, had also formally proposed the
							negotiation of a Treaty of Commerce, and as it was usual that the Treaty
							should be held at the residence of the Government to which it is
							proposed, we had expected it would be negotiated here— I read to him the
							passage in the Note of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres, which
							proposed the Treaty— But I said we were not tenacious of making it here;
							and <persRef ref="anderson-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> had a full-power, and Instructions for
							negotiating at Bogota— But as the proposal for the Treaty came from
							thence, it would be acceptable to know what the ideas of the Colombian
							Government were with regard to the details of the Treaty— He said he had
							a project of a Treaty which he would send me— He spoke also of the
							misunderstanding which has arisen between D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Gual and Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Todd, with much
							apparent regret— Said that in 1818. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Irvine had been as an agent of this Government at Angostura, and had
							written some very offensive Letters to General Bolivar— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd’s correspondence had assumed much of
							the character of that of <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Irvine</persRef>— That copies of all
							the correspondence had been transmitted to him, but he had been
							instructed to make no complaint concerning it— There was one paper among
							the rest however, which seemed very singular— An Address from Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Todd to the <persRef
								ref="santander-francisco">Vice-President Santander</persRef>,
							expressed thus. C. S. Todd as a Citizen of the United States requests an
							exequatur for a Consul— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd, being an
							Agent of the Government of the United States, could not with propriety
							make a demand as a private citizen; and it was irregular for him to make
							any demand otherwise, than through the Minister of foreign Affairs— I
							told him I greatly regretted these unpleasant occurrences between D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual and Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Todd— That upon the arrival of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Anderson
							I hoped they would all terminate as thenceforward M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd would hold no more official
							correspondence with the Colombian Government— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd had thought D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Gual was unfavourably disposed towards the United States,
							particularly in the transactions relating to the repeal of the
							discriminating duty upon merchandise, 7 1/2 per Cent higher upon
							importations from America, than from Europe— I then related to him the
							statements of obstacles, raised by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual,
							to this repeal, as reported by Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Todd,
							and his reasons alledged for applying to a different channel of
							communication with the Vice-President— He said he did not know what
							motive D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual could have for being
							unfriendly to the United States— That for himself he had been so fully
							convinced that the discriminating duty had been a mere error in the
							drawing up of the Law, that he had written to <persRef
								ref="soublette-carlos">General Soublette</persRef>, requesting him
							to supersede even by anticipation the levying of the extra duty upon
							merchandize from the United States, which he had accordingly done— And
							he was happy to observe that the <pb type="ms" n="182"/>trade from the
							United States to Colombia, was rapidly increasing— I then spoke to him
							of the Negotiation between <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> recently commenced, and of the manifestations of
							the disposition of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef>, regarding South-America— And I told him he would
							see by the President’s Message to Congress, the deep interest we were
							taking in the maintenance of their Independence— And <persRef
								ref="ravenga-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ravenga</persRef>
							would inform his Government how earnestly we were pressing the
							acknowledgment of it by Great Britain— He said he had received a Letter
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ravenga requesting him to offer me
							his thanks for the Instructions to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush,
							in consequence of which he had so earnestly befriended him— He spoke of
							the Colombian Loan, which had proved so disastrous in London, and had
							caused the imprisonment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ravenga— And
							asked me whether I thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush could,
							notwithstanding his public character act as an arbitrator, with <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring</persRef> as had been reported— I said I knew not enough of
							the particulars of the case to form an opinion upon it— He said that
							politically speaking he thought the loan ought to be ratified and fully
							paid; but that considered economically <persRef ref="zea-francisco">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea</persRef>, had been egregiously
							taken in. As to the Holy Alliance, if they should attack Colombia, he
							had no doubt his Country would maintain her Independence; but although
							the army would be rather gratified than displeased with the continuance
							of the War, the Country would suffer by it most severely— The Spirit of
							Independence he was sure could not be put down by the United power of
							all Europe— The <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron de Tuyll</persRef>
							called next, and said he came in consequence of the invitation I had
							given him to make any observations that might occur to him, upon the
							paper that I had delivered to him. He had brought it back with a paper
							marking certain alterations, and one omission which he wished might be
							made before he should forward it to his Government. He apologized for
							having written in English the alterations that he desired, which he said
							was as if he should ask <persRef ref="chateaubriand-francois">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Chateaubriant</persRef> to alter a
							paper written by him in French— He had first thought of writing in
							French his proposed alterations; but the idiom of the languages being
							different, he could not so well have adapted the expressions to his
							ideas. I took the papers and told him I would do every thing in my power
							to accommodate his wishes. The changes that he desires are, a softening
							of certain expressions that bear hard upon the Government of Spain in
							South-America—and which place in the same line a deprecation of the
							Emperors hostility to the United States and their Institutions, and of
							his interference between Spain and South America— The Baron said that he
							was so perfectly sure of the Emperor’s friendly dispositions to the U.
							States, and that he had no hostility to their Institutions, that upon
							the mere expression of a doubt concerning them, his Government might
							suppose that he had not done justice to their Sentiments in this
							respect— But as to South-America, it was not in his power to speak; for
							he really did not know what the views of his Government were; having
							received no Instructions whatever concerning them— The <persRef
								ref="menou-charles">Count de Menou</persRef> came again upon the
							subject of the claim against the State of South Carolina; and left with
							me the draught of a Note, which he proposed to send me concerning it;
							which he said however he intended to abridge— I had a visit from
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef>, at the Office; and
							Evening visits at home from <persRef ref="staughton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Staughton</persRef>, President of the
							College, and from <persRef ref="rice-luther">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> L. Rice</persRef>. Also from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> F. C. Gray</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>30. VI:45.</date> The last Evening was engrossed by Company. This
							morning I wrote part of the Journal of yesterday, but could not finish
							it— <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> called on me to shew me a Letter, from a young
							man named <persRef ref="dashiell-unknown">Dashiell</persRef>, reading
							Law with <persRef ref="cocke-john">General Cocke</persRef> of Tennessee,
							to a <persRef ref="madan-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madan</persRef> of this City. (an Extract)— Heard Mass at the
							Catholic Church, and the Te Deum, on the Election of the <persRef
								ref="leo-xii">Pope, Leo the twelfth</persRef>. It was dismal Cold—
								<persRef ref="matthews-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Matthews</persRef> the Clergyman, on announcing the <pb type="ms"
								n="183"/>Te Deum, said it was a song of Jubile, originally composed
							upon the conversion of <persRef ref="staustin">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Austin</persRef> by <persRef ref="stambrose">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Ambrose</persRef>, jointly by them
							both in Alternate verses; and ever since used by the Church upon
							occasions of great and joyful solemnity. After Church, I called at
								<persRef ref="strother-john">Strother’s</persRef> and saw there
								<persRef ref="garnett-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Garnett</persRef>, member of the House from Virginia— Attended the
							afternoon service at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>. A Stranger preached from Psalm 97.1.
							[“]The Lord Reigneth; let the Earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles
							be glad thereof.”— This evening there was a drunken fellow, who fell
							into a fit real or pretended before the door of my house— I had him
							taken in, and sent for <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Huntt</persRef>, who thought his fits
							real and gave him laudanum. After he came to I sent him over to the
							tavern for a lodging, but they would not take him in— About midnight he
							came back and repeated the scene, and finding it ineffectual, knocked
							for sometime at the front door of the house. <persRef ref="gray-francis"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. C. Gray</persRef> spent part
							of the Evening here—and <persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dwight</persRef>, member of the
							House, just arrived; together With <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E.
								Wyer</persRef>— Gray was about leaving the city this Night to return
							to Boston— Dwight had much to say upon politics, and particularly upon
							the late Election in New-York.</p>
