							also it was an innovation; excepting as to the Contigent expenses of
							foreign Intercourse. But the innovation consists only in this, that now
							a regular account of all the other Disbursements under the direction of
							the Department of State, is kept at the Department itself as well as at
							the Treasury, while the disbursements were formerly made and no account
							of them kept, but at the Treasury. The draft to which M<hi

							which he was received to the next room I had a long conversation with

							the Convention of 12 July 1822. and upon the Suppression of the
							Slave-trade— Also upon the general proposition for negotiation upon
							various points which I have in contemplation— I told him that my answer
							to his last Note upon the Suppression of the Slave-trade was before the
							President for Consideration, and gave him the general outlines of my
							plan— He appeared to be uneasy at the idea, that in my reply the subject
							of impressment would be discussed, and said he hoped in the disposition
							between the two Governments so strongly tending towards conciliation,
							whatever was of an irritating character might be avoided. He intimated
							as in candour, that the proposition to Great-Britain to pass a Law,
							would excite some feeling; and that in proposing to treat on the
							subjects of maritime Law, the form of suggestion that Great-Britain
							might have changed her principles would be less acceptable, than if it
							were made in general terms— I observed that in all her Negotiations for
							this suppression of the Slave trade, Great Britain not only asked the
							Powers with whom she treated to pass Laws; but made it a matter of
							express Stipulation in the Treaties—and in supposing that she might now
							view more favourably than heretofore the interests of neutrality, I had

								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef> present—<persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							absent— My project of a Convention for the suppression of the
							Slave-trade; answer to <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef>, and Instruction to
								<persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> were first considered.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun started objections on various grounds— Crawford to
							the argument in the Letter to Canning against the right of Search, which
							he said was completely given up in the project of Convention, and
							therefore the Argument might be represented by the British as a mere
							Declamation, against a practice which the project essentially conceded—
							This objection had weight, and I had been fully aware of it in drawing
							up the papers— But two objects were to be aimed at in the papers— One
							fully to justify the repugnance which we have heretofore manifested
							against the right of search as practiced by Great-Britain in War; the
							other to carry in to effect the Resolution of the House of
							Representatives, recommending negotiation to obtain the recognition of
							the Slave-trade, to be Piracy by the Law of Nations— To Piracy by the
							Law of Nations, Search is incident of course, since wherever there is a
							right to <hi rend="italic">capture</hi> there must be a right to search.
							The end desired by the Resolution of the House of Representatives cannot
							be obtained without conceding <pb type="ms" n="85"/>the right so far of
							search, and all that is left us is to keep it still inflexibly with in
							the Class of belligerent rights, as exercised only against Pirates, the
							enemies of all mankind. It was therefore that in my project of
							Convention, the first Article assumes as a fact that both parties have
							declared the Slave-trade Piracy, and my Instructions to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush are not to offer it, but after an Act
							of Parliament, declaring the Slave-trade to be Piracy. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s objection was to the admission
							of the right of capture by foreign Officers at-all; as weakening us upon
							the general objection to conceding the right of search— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson, did not think the right of
							search conceded in the project at all— The search for Pirates, had, he
							said absolutely nothing in common with the search of neutral vessels—
							Much discussion which I cannot record. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun thought we should at once say we will never concede the right of
							Search for Slaves, unless Britain will renounce search for her Seamen in
							our vessels in War— I said I was willing to make one the Condition of
							the other— It was finally understood by the President that the project
							much as drafted should be proposed, provided the British make the
							Offence Capital, by act of Parliament; and not be communicated in detail
							to the British Government without that. Crawford hinted at an additional
							guard, that lists of the vessels authorised to capture the Slave-traders
							should be mutually furnished— But it would be very inconvenient to us,
							as Instructions of capture are issued to all our Cruizers— The project
							is to go, but the Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning is to
							be modified. Upon the subject of the average value of the Slaves carried
							away and to be paid for, it was determined that we have not the
							necessary information, and that it must be left to be fixed by the
							Commissioners or otherwise according to the Convention. After the other
							members of the administration had withdrawn, I requested of the
							President to mark the passages of the Draft to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning, which he would have omitted—for which purpose be
							kept the papers— <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> dined at

						<p><date>20. V:30.</date> Swam with <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef>; an hour and a quarter. Nearly down to the mouth
							of the Tyber. Note from the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> to call at his house— He read over the part of
							the Draft of my reply to <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> which he thinks
							should be sent, and suggested the substance of a substitute for what he
							would omit— I told him all my motives for writing the draft as it was,
							and among the rest, that of exhibiting to the people of this Country and
							to the world, the real grounds of objection to the right of Search— I
							reminded him particularly of the appearance, that in Congress a
							combination of parties, was endeavouring to turn this into a party
							question; They had twice reported against the opinion of the Executive;
							and from the Names of the persons mentioned to me by <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mercer</persRef>, as willing to support his project, I was satisfied
							that views unfriendly to his administration, and personally so to me,
							were mingling themselves with this subject— It had appeared to me that
							an exhibition of the grounds upon which the aversion of this Government
							to conceding the right of search was founded would at once serve for its
							justification, and guard against the prevalence of a disposition in
							Congress to counteract the views of the Executive— The President said he
							was aware of this tendency to an opposition in the House; and that he
							wished the whole of that part of my draft to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning which he proposed to omit, should be inserted in the
							Instruction to <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef>— It would all be fully justified in the
							Sentiments of this Country; but in urging upon Great Britain her
							adoption <pb type="ms" n="86"/>of our plan instead of her own, he wished
							to avoid every thing which by irritating them might give the British
							Ministers the opportunity of imputing insincerity or ill-will to us— He
							wished to gain over to our views <persRef ref="wilberforce-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilberforce</persRef> and his party,
							and to discard for that purpose all that by touching their national
							pride, would turn them against us— By addressing to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, that part of my reply to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, the whole will in proper time be
							communicated to Congress, and it will there have all its effect without
							giving any cause of complaint to the British Ministry. I requested him
							to mark with a pencil the part of my draft which he would wish to have
							transferred, and to sketch what he would have substituted in the reply
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning; which he promised he would— I
							told him that my whole project had been merely formed for his
							Consideration, to carry into effect the Resolution of the House of
							Representatives, and to meet the urgent pressure of the British
							Government, concerning the Slave-trade. My object was to give all the
							aid in my power to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> measures, and I wished not
							one line of my writing to go forth that should not have his hearty
							approbation— The consequence of this <hi rend="italic">distribution</hi>
							of my reply to Canning, is that it is incomplete—a half reply to
							himself, and half, addressed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							where it seems inappropriate— No use of it could be made by him in
							England, for the same reason that it is not to be addressed to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning here—for his own conviction it can
							neither be necessary nor of any use; and to send it to England merely
							that it may be hereafter communicated to Congress, is taking a route
							more circuitous than appears to be necessary— The President approved the
							whole of the Draft of Instruction upon the Northern boundary— At the
							Office, <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef> came again
							to press for a Newspaper Paragraph about the Russian Ukase, and brought
							a Washington Gazette; with a paragraph, taken from the Boston Centinel,
							purporting to be a Letter from Washington, which the Baron thought would
							be annoying to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>— He said
							the Emperor entered much into the Spirit of the age— And was solicitous
							to stand fair in public opinion— I took the paper and told him I would
							prepare a paragraph on the subject— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning came to ask me to fix a time to receive him to present <persRef
								ref="addington-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addington</persRef>, as Charge d’Affaires. I enquired when he
							intended to leave the City— He said next Tuesday— I fixed Monday at 2
							O’Clock to receive him. He asked if I had any further communications to
							make to him respecting the Instructions for Negotiation that I proposed
							transmitting to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush— I told him of the
							French fishery question, the subject and situation of which I explained
							to him at large— I had not mentioned it to him before— He then took from
							his pocket a written minute of my first Conversations with him
							concerning these proposed Negotiations, which he read over to me with a
							view to ascertain its correctness— I made several remarks upon it, and
							we were led into a long further Conversation concerning it— From the
							view that he had taken of all my remarks he seemed desirous of
							considering it as a proposal to Great-Britain for an Alliance with the
							United States— This I told him distinctly that it was not— He had in his
							minute mentioned the remark with which I had almost commenced these
							Conferences, that I considered the European Alliance as virtually
							dissolved— I observed that my expressions might have been as strong as
							that; but their meaning was limited by the general object of the
							Conversation— I had meant to say it was virtually dissolved so far as
							Great-Britain was a party to it— I did not mean to say <pb type="ms"
								n="87"/>I thought it dissolved as to the Continental Powers— I
							wished I could think it was. But Great-Britain had separated herself
							from the Counsels and Measures of the Alliance. She avowed the
							principles, which were emphatically those of this Country; and she
							disapproved the principles of the alliance which this Country abhorred—
							This coincidence of principle connected with the great changes in the
							affairs of the world passing before us, seemed to me a suitable occasion
							for the United States and Great Britain to compare their ideas and
							purposes together with a view to the accommodation of great interests
							upon which they had heretofore differed— The minute had also noted my
							remark that it had always been the policy of the United States to keep
							aloof from the European system of Politics; but had omitted the
							observation made at the same time, that this had also been the policy of
							Europe. I said that the first part of this position taken by itself
							might import an unsocial and sulky Spirit on the part of the United
							States, which I did not intend to apply to them, and which in fact did
							not belong to them. It had been quite as much the policy of Europe to
							keep us aloof, as it had been ours to keep aloof from them—perhaps more
							so. With regard to the Slave-trade for instance— They had been for the
							last five years closely negotiating with all Europe and at the same time
							with us. When they had concluded their European Treaties, they invited
							our accession to them: when they laid their papers before Parliament we
							obtained sight of them— But while they were negotiating not a lisp of
							any thing that passed had ever been communicated to us. In all this we
							had acquiesced; because it fell in with our own policy— Had it been
							otherwise we should have intimated freely our expectation that the
							proceedings of the allies relating to the Slave-trade should be
							communicated to us while they were in deliberation, and not after they
							have been closed— We were yet to hear from them what had passed relating
							to the Slave-trade, at Verona. To all this M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning had little to reply— But he said my observations had
							all imported that the basis of Negotiation was to be a change of
							principle on the part of Great-Britain— But it could hardly be expected
							that a Great Nation should change its principles. Negotiation must be
							founded upon compromise; and concession must be the price of concession—
							He had understood my ultimate intention to be to bring the United States
							and Great-Britain into a more intimate connection of policy than they
							had been in heretofore; but I had not entered upon particulars. Perhaps
							something might depend upon them— I said that my own ideas heretofore
							had been confined to the general view— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush’s Instructions would be rather to consult, than to propose— To ask
							whether the British Government think as we do that this is a suitable
							time for negotiating again upon topics concerning which we had not
							heretofore been able to agree— Our proposals may depend upon the manner
							in which this overture will be received— If Great Britain has undergone
							no change of opinions with regard to maritime and neutral Law, her
							Minister has only to say that he thinks no profitable result would come
							from a negotiation concerning them at this time. My belief was that upon
							all the maritime questions except impressment Great-Britain would now
							maintain our principles— She had lately done so in issuing reprizals
							against the blockade of Morales— He said Great Britain had never
							maintained a different principle; all her measures departing from it in
							the late Wars, having been expressly founded upon retaliation— I said
							very well. The question was whether she would now stipulate the
							principle that she avows— I foresaw nothing in which she would want
							concession, unless upon impressment; and as to that I had but a word to
							say— So long as Britain should remain neutral there was no occasion for
							any agreement upon the subject— But it weighed inexpressibly <pb
								type="ms" n="88"/>upon my mind; it would be included among the
							subjects for negotiation to be proposed by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush— I could only say that if Great-Britain still adhered
							to her former views concerning it, and insisted upon continuing the
							practice of taking men— If she would not abandon the practice of
							beginning by the exercise of force, my wish was that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning would say so, and decline treating
							about it— Then if Britain should engage in War, she might avoid the
							conflict by Instructions to her naval Officers— My hope would rely upon
							that. For if impressment of our men was to continue my belief was that
							we should meet it by War, as long as this Country could be kept afloat
							above the Sea— He said they disclaimed the right of taking any other
							than British Subjects— But said I you actually take others, and when the
							late War broke out turned over thousands of impressed Americans to
							Dartmoor prison, after offering them the alternative of fighting against
							their own Country— He said I was growing warm. I replied, if I could but
							prevail upon one British Minister to put himself and his Country for a
							moment in our place on this question, I should be sure of success—
							However, if the British Government should decline treating of this
							concern, it would only be for them to say so— There were materials
							enough for the Negotiation without resorting to this— With regard to
							South-America, and the Islands of Cuba and Porto-Rico I said it appeared
							from the published Diplomatic papers, and from <persRef
								ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
								Canning’s</persRef> speeches in Parliament, that France at least was
							to make no conquests in this Hemisphere— He said he believed the
							expressions were “the late Spanish Colonies”— I said that taking all the
							documents together they included also Cuba and Porto-Rico— He spoke to
							me of the Speech to the President lately made by <persRef
								ref="salazar-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Salazar</persRef>, and now published— I told him the manner in which
							the Speech was made, and observed that Salazar had done justice to the
							disinterested policy of the United States in the recognition of South
							American Independence— Canning said he had observed it, but asked about
							the deputies from St. Salvador of Guatimala— I said I had heard nothing
							of them except what was in the Newspapers—which was true, but which
							Canning scarcely seemed to credit. They are at Philadelphia; one of them
							said to be sick— Since the republican Revolution in Mexico, and the
							prospects of a federative Government there, one of those deputies has
							been despatched to Mexico, and I have supposed they would suspend their
							proposals for Union with this Country till they could consult for a
							Union under the federal system with Mexico— I have given the substance
							of this Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Canning,
							deeming it important. Evening at home— Rain after a long drouth.</p>

							had it in contemplation to recommend to the Legislature to pass a Law,
							authorising the choice of Electors for President and Vice-President to
							be made by the People— By general ticket. He said when the Legislature
							should assemble next January, it would be known in a week, who the
							majority will be for— Then the majority will be for retaining the choice
							in their own hands, and the minority for going to the People— But it
							would save the necessity of an extra session of the Legislature, and the
							Election might be held at the same time with that of members for the
							then ensuing Legislature and of members for the next Congress— Almost
							all the elective Offices in New-York have been given by the New
							Constitution to the People, and the People would have more influence
							over the next Presidential Election than they ever had before— I had
							heard something about this D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw, and
							understood him the better for it— At the Office, <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">W. W. Seaton</persRef> came to solicit again
							employment for <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Little</persRef>— I called at the <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> for which he had
							prepared a substitute— And if necessary hereafter to lay the papers

							assented— I dined alone, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams with
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> went out to Bladensburg. George

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Unwin Addington</persRef>
							as Charge d’Affaires from Great-Britain from the time of his own
							embarking— He spoke of the average value of the Slaves again, and I told
							him the President had upon consultation with the members of the
							administration concluded to leave it to be settled by the Commissioners.
							He then asked me if it might be expected that in the course of the
							Summer I should be prepared to make to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Addington, a distinct proposition, as to the Northern boundary— I said I
							should not. We should first wish to ascertain whether the British
							Government would negotiate upon this subject, or not— He said he had
							understood me as admitting that if the British Government should insist
							on it, we should be bound to make a distinct proposition— I answered I
							had, on the condition that Great-Britain would agree to negotiate
							concerning it and not otherwise. We did not intend merely to make a
							proposition for Great Britain to accept or reject, and then resort at
							once to the arbitrator— If she would agree to negotiate we would then
							make a proposition. But it would be necessary then to come to some
							agreement as to the Map to be used. The Commissioners had reported no
							map, and yet the Report of the British Commissioner referred directly to
							a Map which had been rejected— He said the British Commissioner had
							offered to send out Surveyors again to ascertain the correctness of the
							map; and he thought this ought to have been done— I said the offer was
							made when it was impossible it should be accepted. It proposed a
							prolongation of the Commission for years, with no prospect of a better
							result than before— My own impression was that the Commissioners ought
							rather to have broken up <pb type="ms" n="91"/>the Commission, and made
							their reports four or five years sooner than they did, instead of so
							much later— He was disposed to blame our Commissioner— We had a profound
							impression that the conduct of their Commissioner had been wrong—
							Instead of settling the disputed question he had made it ten times more
							difficult than it had ever been— He had raised pretensions never dreamt
							of, and with the identical map used by the Negotiators of the Peace of
							1782 before him, pencil-marked by them; upon the question where the line
							intended by them was, he had reported a Book with 500 pages of sophistry
							to prove that they meant a line more than a hundred Miles distant from
							the place marked by themselves— It was impossible to think of such a
							proceeding with coolness. But at all events, wherever the blame might
							be, so the fact was—no map was reported; and if we should go before the
							arbitrator, we should begin by protesting against the admission of the
							map to which the British Commissioner’s Report refers; unless the map of
							our Surveyor should also be admitted— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning waved a further discussion of the subject, and took leave— He is
							to depart to-morrow. I shall probably see him no more. He is a proud,
							high-tempered Englishman, of good but not extraordinary parts; stubborn
							and punctilious, with a disposition to be overbearing, which I have
							often been compelled to check in its own way. He is of all the foreign
							Ministers with whom I have had occasion to treat, the man who has most
							severely tried my temper— Yet he has been long in the Diplomatic career,
							and treated with Governments of the most opposite characters— He has
							however a great respect for his word; and there is nothing false about
							him— This is an excellent quality for a negotiator— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning is a man of forms; studious of
							courtesy, and tenacious of private morals. As a diplomatic man his great
							want is suppleness, and his great virtue is sincerity— I finished the
							Reply to his Letter of 8 April last on the Slave-trade— <persRef
								ref="stone-henry">Stone</persRef> the Engraver came about a Plate
							for the Patent-Office— Evening walk with <persRef ref="adams-george"

								ref="smith-richard2">Major Smith</persRef> in a duel, two years
							ago— They went out to fight in Prince George’s County Maryland; but by
							mistaking the boundary line, fought within the district. When it was

							the last term of the Court, in November— It has lain over till now, and
							he came expecting a sentence of <pb type="ms" n="92"/>imprisonment in
							half an hour, and having an invincible repugnance to going to jail. I
							told him there must be some written application— He brought a

							whether he had in any case given orders for a noli prosequi, but desired
							me to ascertain the fact from the records; and if there was a precedent,

							found none, but there were remissions before sentence passed; and I had
