							chamber and his son <persRef ref="cruft-edward2">Edward</persRef>, a boy
							of ten or eleven years of age, afflicted with a disease which threatens
							to cripple him for life— I paid a visit also to <persRef
								ref="dawes-thomas">judge Dawes</persRef>, a man who has been useful,
							and amiable in his day; but whose declining years are not happy— He has
							been oppressed in his circumstances by a numerous family, and now
								<persRef ref="dawes-margaret">his wife</persRef>, always an
							excellent and lovely woman has so lost her hearing that they can

								<persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General H. A. S. Dearborn’s</persRef>

								ref="blake-george">George Blake</persRef>, upon a decision of
								<persRef ref="johnson-william">Judge Johnson</persRef> of the U.S.
							Supreme Court, pronouncing an Act of the Legislature of South-Carolina

							temper, that it became painful, and necessary to change the topic— It
							was the act prohibiting free persons of Colour from coming or being
							brought into the State as sailors, upon penalties among which are their
							being sold as Slaves— Crowninshield claimed my promise made two years
							ago that I would dine with him at Salem, and I engaged to go next
							Wednesday. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee engaged me to go and
							lodge at his house— I had a conversation in the garden with M<hi

							lately— I expressed a strong wish that they would resume the purpose and
							accomplish it. Urging the essential usefulness of such an Establishment—
							The honour of the University; the credit of the Country— The advancement
							of Science— President Kirkland, turning to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gray, said he hoped, there would be the encouragement, of
							those who possessed the means, of promoting this object; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray, in general terms expressed a
							willingness to give his assistance to it— From M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gray’s we went out to a splendid Ball, given by <persRef
								ref="lyman-mary">Miss Lyman</persRef> at Waltham— Miss Lyman is the
							beauty of this region, and <persRef ref="lyman-theodore2">her
								father</persRef> one of the wealthiest men of Massachusetts or of
							the Union. It is said he has spent 150000 dollars upon this Country
							Seat, which is a little Palace— The party was very numerous; the dancing
							elegant; the Music charming, the supper sumptuous— All Magnificent and
							more princely than Republican— The dancers were all of the next
							Generation to mine— Children of my contemporaries and Juniors. Sons and
							daughters of those with whom I had often danced, when they were the
							Sparklers of the Ball room. This metamorphosis <pb type="ms" n="128"
							/>from a blooming Belle into a Mama, seems thus upon a return home after
							many years of absence, as if it had been the effect of one day— It was
							near one in the Morning when we got back to our Lodgings at Boston.</p>

							Eustis is as he always was an <pb type="ms" n="129"/>eternal talker of
							Nothings. From his half-ideas, a tolerable inference can be drawn of his

							and <persRef ref="gray-unknown5">his father’s</persRef> taken by a
							piratical privateer from Porto-Rico— General Hull came to urge a claim
							for Salary as Governor of the Territory of Michigan in 1812. additional
							to the pay of a Major General, which he received at the same time. He
							urged various reasons for its payment, of which he is no doubt in great
							want— I told him I would again represent his claim to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> upon my return to the City of
							Washington. He asked me also upon what grounds the American
							Plenipotentiaries at Ghent had declared that the American Government had
							disapproved his proclamation issued upon his entering Canada— I said it
							was from the assurance of <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi

							of Fitchburg— It is a correspondence between my father and William

							contains a number of Letters written at those respective times by my
							father with his characteristic frankness, and under the excitement of
							different feelings at the different periods— The malignity of the
							publication consists in its being now made for the purpose of injuring
							me, by exciting personal enmities against me among leading men of both
							parties, and their families and friends— There is an introduction of
							venomous bitterness, well written and attributed to the pen of <persRef

								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"

							received a Letter from <persRef ref="bates-george">D<hi

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse</persRef> wrote me that
							Governor Eustis was making efforts well meant no doubt, but if so, very
							injudicious, to suppress the publication— The newspapers of M<hi

							the secret of the Mine that was to blow me up. And since I have been
							here the publication has been letting out whiffs of smoke from day to

							I am, sound wind and limb; neither better nor worse for the Cunningham

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date. -->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The Month has been devoted to the enjoyment of my
							friends; and consequently to dissipation—between Boston, Salem and
							Quincy— Without regular employment—in a perpetual tumult of visits and
							parties at Boston, and chiefly in devotion to <persRef ref="adams-john"
								>my father</persRef> here— The waste of time—the want of interesting
							occupation, and the recourse to industrious trifling have marked almost
							equally this interval— I receive almost daily packets from Washington
							where <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef>, and several other Clerks in the Department of State
							have been taken sick, and whither I feel that I must hasten my return— I
							have been made sensible of the great difficulty that I shall find, when
							removed from the Public Service, to fix upon an employment which shall
							fill up my time usefully, and intensely engage my attention— Let me hope
							that it will not be wanting— My enquiries into the “short and simple
							annals” of my ancestors here, have been not entirely fruitless— Four
							Generations of them preceding my father have been here; and yet all of
							them that remains are the town and parish records of their births,
							marriages, and deaths. In the space of one full century before the birth
							of my father, how much of human action, endurance and enjoyment had my
							forefathers shared since their first settlement in this spot, and of
							which not a trace remains— Of the 88 years since his birth, how much
							belongs to the history of the World; and of the time to come, during the
							remnant of my days, what is to be the use, to any portion of mankind?
							Lord, teach me so to number them, that I may apply my heart unto
							Wisdom.—</p>
