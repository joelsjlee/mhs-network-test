								Middleton</persRef>— But he relied that the Russian Government would
							include in the Negotiation a claim of indemnities, to the owners of the
							vessel turned off from the N.W. Coast by the Russian Frigate Apollo— The
							Baron urged that this claim should be separately and confidentially
							made— I said we should wish to treat in the most conciliatory manner
							possible on this subject— I should answer his Note on the proposal to
							negotiate, and had no doubt the President would consent that the claim
							of indemnity should be separately <pb type="ms" n="38"/>made— He urged
							that I should not address it at-all to him, but through M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton to Count Nesselrode, to whom he
							would write to say that such a claim must be expected— He asked if I
							could without impropriety tell him the object of <persRef
								ref="randall-thomas">Randall’s</persRef> Mission to Porto-Rico. I
							told him to procure evidence of claims to indemnity for sufferers under
							the decree of <persRef ref="morales-francisco">Morales</persRef> of 15
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1821—to obtain the Florida
							Documents, at the Havanna, and to correspond with our naval Officers for
							the suppression of Pirates. I told him also of the British circular
							disclaiming declaration about Cuba— At the President’s. Told him of my
							conferences with Tuyll this day and <persRef ref="canning-stratford"
								>Canning</persRef> yesterday. Proposal to him to recommend to
							Congress at their next Session, the Establishment of a Military Post at
							Columbia river— He desired me to send round the Russian Minister’s Note

							Gave <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> Baron

								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> is absent— The Russian North-West
							Coast claim discussed and proposed negotiation at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg— Agreed to negotiate. Great
							diversity of opinion as to terms— Crawford is for agreeing to an English
							boundary at 49. North—leaving the Russian boundary to be settled between
							them and England. I proposed that P.U.S. should authorise instructions
							to our Squadron in the Pacific to protect the trade, and recommend to
							Congress the establishment of a Military Post at Columbia river. Calhoun
							thinks if any Post is established it must be strong enough to repel a
							possible Russian invasion— At least a regiment. I think two companies
							would be enough. Crawford one Battalion. Crawford thinks the Executive
							has no Constitutional power to protect the trade without an act of
							Congress. Calhoun thinks the right doubtful. Thompson <pb type="ms"
								n="39"/>and I think it clear— Crawford thinks there is not a great
							interest to protect. From these diversities I am to prepare the answer
							to <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef>— The Meeting
							broke up about six— Evening at home—dull.</p>
