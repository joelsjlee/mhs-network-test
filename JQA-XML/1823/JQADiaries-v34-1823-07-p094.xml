									>r</hi> George Hay</persRef> was this morning at my house, with

							be allowed to employ other agents or Council; and whether he might
							accept any compensation from individuals— I said I presumed he might

							determine, whom and in what manner they would hear the claims— As to the

							receive compensation from individual claimants I did not feel myself
							competent to give an opinion. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay spoke
							in terms of great severity of <persRef ref="ritchie-thomas"
								>Ritchie</persRef>, the Editor of the Richmond Enquirer; and said he
							was the most unprincipled fellow upon Earth, whose whole Efforts would
							be to work himself into the side of the majority. He was now
							endeavouring to buy up the Newspaper lately established in Richmond
							against him, the Virginia Times— The Richmond Enquirer has been for
							several years the political barometer of the State of Virginia— I

							Admonition, rebuke, and toleration. afternoon text from Psalm 99.1. “The
							Lord reigneth; let the people tremble”—a commination. I finished the
							draft of Instructions to <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>,
							on the North-west Coast question— We dined late. In the evening I heard
								<persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>; from Revelations 6.12.13.14. [“]And I beheld, when
							he had opened the sixth seal; and lo, there was a great earthquake; and
							the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as
							blood;—and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
							casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind—and the
							Heaven departed as a scrowl when it is rolled together; and every

							to a house upon the shore, beyond which we were to pass, that we had
							ascended very little above where we had left our clothes, and that the
							current of the tide was insensibly carrying us into the middle of the
							river— We continued struggling against the tide about twenty minutes
							longer, without apparently gaining a foot upon the tide— I then turned
							back and in fifteen minutes landed at the rock where I had left my
							Clothes, upon which in the interval the tide had so much encroached,
							that it began <pb type="ms" n="99"/>to wet them and in another half hour
							would have soaked them through, or floated them away. We had been an
							hour and five minutes in the water, without touching ground, and before
							turning back, I began to find myself weary— At my house <persRef
								ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef> came about the books he

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams’s</persRef> came to
							request me to purchase Mills in this neighbourhood which have belonged
							to him, and upon which he says he has spent near sixty thousand dollars;
							but which he has conveyed in trust, for a debt to the Bank of Columbia—
							The debt is 20000 dollars; and they are willing to receive payment of it
							by yearly instalments in five years— But to set the Mills at Work, from
							ten to twelve thousand dollars more are necessary as capital, to
							purchase wheat, and pay the charges of the establishment— G. Johnson can
							raise no part of this money, and unless he can make some other
							arrangement with the Bank before next Thursday, they will rent out the
							Mills as their property and turn him adrift upon the world— He urged me
							to buy the Mills for 20000 dollars—to furnish from 10 to 12000 dollars
							to set and keep them constantly at work— To put them under his
							management for such portion of the profits as I shall think proper; and
							reserve to him the right of repurchasing half the Estate on his paying
							ten thousand dollars— I have taken time for consideration of this
							proposal, to the acceptance of which many motives, all just and virtuous
							urge me; but which I cannot accept but at great hazard, and with deep
							stakes to myself and my family— I promised to answer definitively before
							next Thursday— At the Office, I met <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">C.
								Hughes</persRef>, who goes to-morrow for Baltimore— He claims a
							second Outfit as Charge d’Affaires; and wished to have a demand made,

							he declined— The <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron de

								<persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>, and the
								<persRef ref="menou-charles">Count de Menou</persRef>, left a note

									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, and professing a readiness to
							negotiate, concerning the claims of our Citizens, and concerning that of
							France under the Louisiana Treaty— I told Menou, that we should not

							had been exhausted— The views of the American Government concerning it
							had been fully set forth, and were not changed— If France had anything
							further to say upon it, we should always be ready to give it due
							consideration; but could not connect it with our claims in Negotiation—
							I said this the more freely, because I knew that M<hi rend="superscript"

							sent to the Senate; although the President is confident that it was.
							After this Discovery the President sent a nomination to the Senate, of
							Miller as Governor, from the expiration of his former Commission; but
							the Senate confirmed only the nomination, without retrospect. So that

							this Morning; from Zechariah 14.9. “And the Lord shall be king over all

							and he came to my house, and took a sheet of the draft of Instructions
							which I am preparing for <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>,

								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>—from John 5.14—“Behold, thou art made whole: sin no

							94—8.9.10. “Understand; ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
							will ye be wise?— He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that
							formed the eye, shall he not see?— He that chastiseth the heathen, shall
							not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?” An
							eloquent encomium upon the Psalms, and the omnipotence of God— I visited

						<p><date>28. V:30.</date> A <persRef ref="scott-j">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> J. S. Scott</persRef> came to the Office, soliciting to
							be employed as a Clerk, or on some business for which occasional aid of
							copying is required. I called at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> with the Draft of Instructions to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, to accompany the project of a
							Convention to regulate neutral, and Belligerent rights in time of War.
							The President had suggested a single alteration, in the Draft of a
							Convention which I had sent him on Saturday— <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> came in, while
							I was reading to the President the draft of the Instruction; and after I
							had finished, started several doubts as to the propriety of proposing
							this project at-all. He was confident it would not be accepted by
							Great-Britain; and I have no expectation that it will, at this time— But
							my object is to propose it to Russia, and France, and to all the
							maritime Powers of Europe, as well as to Great-Britain! We discussed for
							some time its expediency; I appealed to the primitive policy of this
							Country as exemplified in the first Treaty with Prussia. I said the Seed
							was then first sown; and had born a single plant, which the fury of the
							revolutionary tempest had since swept away. I thought the present a
							moment eminently auspicious for sowing the same seed a second time; and
							although I had no hope, it would now take root in England, I had the
							most cheering confidence, that it would ultimately bear a harvest of
							happiness to mankind and of glory to this Union— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun still suggested doubts, but no positive objections,
							and the President directed me to send the draft of the Articles round to
							the members of the administration, and to call a Meeting of them for
							to-morrow at one. I was not surprized at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun’s doubts— My plan involves nothing less than a Revolution in the
							Laws of War— A great amelioration in the condition of man— Is it the
							dream of a visionary? or is it the great and practicable conception of a
							benefactor of mankind? I believe it the latter, and I believe this to be
							precisely the time for proposing it to the world— Should it even fail,
							it will be honourable to have proposed it— Founded on Justice, Humanity
							and Benevelence, it can in no Event bear bitter fruits— <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> is recovering slowly from his

									>r</hi> D. Brent</persRef> called upon me this morning with
								<persRef ref="walsh-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Walsh</persRef> of Baltimore— The meeting at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> was delayed about an hour
							by a very heavy thunder Shower. <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> was absent from it,
							from indisposition— The draft of a Convention was read, and discussed—
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> still intimated doubts as to the expediency of
							proposing it; but more faintly than yesterday. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> made no express objection, but declared his full
							conviction, that Great-Britain would accept no part of it which it would
							be useful or desirable to us that she should accept. He also objected to
							some of the details, and suggested alterations in several of the
							Articles; some of which the President approved— His chief objection was
							to the Article, which authorizes the punishment of persons taking
							Commissions for privateering from foreign Powers as Pirates— Though we
							have it already in almost every one of our Treaties. But in this
							objection he was alone— Calhoun doubted whether by proposing the whole
							Convention at once, we might not fail of obtaining what we might perhaps
							obtain if presented singly, an arrangement of the impressment question.
							But Crawford thought Great-Britain would never settle the impressment
							question by Treaty— She would let it die a natural death, by abstaining
							to issue orders to her naval Officers to impress men <pb type="ms"
								n="109"/>from our vessels— <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> declared himself in
							the most explicit manner, in favour of my whole project; and after the
							meeting was over, the President directed me to forward by express to
								<persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> at New York, the whole Letter of Instruction, as it
							was, and the whole draft of a Convention with one alteration suggested
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— I had sent to <persRef
								ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef> requesting him to call
							at my Office at four O’Clock, and I found him there on my return from
							the President’s— I told him that besides the subject of the North-west
							Coast question, <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Middleton</persRef> would be instructed to communicate
							with the imperial Government upon two other very important subjects—that
							of constituting the Slave-trade piracy by the Law of Nations, and that
							of the regulation of neutral and belligerent rights— I explained to him
							briefly and in general terms the principles upon which <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was
							authorised to negotiate in England, upon both these points; and observed
							to him that the President proposed to present the same principles for
							Negotiation with Russia. I added that I had sent for him to give him
							notice of this, that he might have the opportunity of first
							communicating it to his Government— He thanked me in terms of the
							warmest acknowledgment; and appeared to be exceedingly gratified at the
							substance of our proposals in both cases. He asked me whether he should
							yet have time to prepare a despatch to go by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hughes— And said he should wish to have an opportunity of
							shewing it to me before sending it. I told him I should send my
							despatches by an express, to go early to-morrow Morning for New-York— If
							he would write his despatch and send it to me at any time this Evening
							before Midnight, I would deliver it in charge of the express. I should
							be grateful for the perusal of it, if he would send it to me open. He
							accordingly sent me about ten this Evening a despatch containing a
							succinct account of our interview, with the request that after reading,
							and if necessary correcting it, I would send it back to him to seal up;
							as I did. He sent it again about midnight, sealed and directed to

								>King</persRef> the Painter— The important labour of the Month has

							opened my Soul to the hope, though with trembling— In the course of this
							month also I have made a disposal of a large portion of my private
							property which may have great influence upon the remainder of my days—
							This too cannot prosper, but with the blessing of Heaven which I
