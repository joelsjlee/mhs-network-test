						<dateline><hi rend="italic">Monday 1. December 1823.</hi></dateline>
						<p><date>1. VII.</date> This was the day of the meeting of the first Session
							of the eighteenth Congress. <persRef ref="gaillard-john">J.
								Gaillard</persRef> took the Chair as President of the Senate; and
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> was elected Speaker
							of the House of Representatives, having 139 votes and <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Philip P. Barbour</persRef> 42. <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> declined standing as a
							Candidate. <persRef ref="edwards-weldon">Weldon N. Edwards</persRef> of
							North Carolina, called with <persRef ref="spaight-richard">R. D.
								Spaight</persRef> of the same State—both members of the House—
								<persRef ref="johnson-george">George Johnson</persRef> was here;
							going to Alexandria— I sent by him a note and money to <persRef
								ref="hellen-adelaide">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> A.
								Hellen</persRef>— Transferred 500 dollars of <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">T. B. Johnson’s</persRef> Metropolis Bank
							Stock, and 500 of <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen’s</persRef> to
							the Columbian College— At the Office there came a <persRef
								ref="harvey-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harvey</persRef>
							from New-York, and a <persRef ref="malcomson-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Malcomson</persRef> a Scotchman; with
							Letters from <persRef ref="colden-cadwallader">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Colden</persRef>, and <persRef ref="emmet-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Emmet</persRef>—and wanting certified
							copies of two Sections in the Constitution of the United States, and two
							of the Judiciary Act of 24 Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1789. to
							be used in a judicial Court in Scotland, upon some question of an
							insolvency— We examined the original Constitution and judiciary act, and
							I directed the copies to be made.— The <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick"
								>Baron de Tuyll, Russian Minister,</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron de Stackelberg Swedish Chargé
								d’Affaires</persRef>, came and announced to me the decease at 5
							O’Clock this morning, of <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frederic Greuhm</persRef>, Minister
							Resident from Prussia— They said they had been to his house, had sealed
							his papers, and caused them to be transported to the House of the Baron
							de Tuyll. Of all which they should give information to their respective
							Ministers at Berlin to be communicated to the Prussian Government. They
							now came to give the same notice to this Government and to ask me if I
							would favour them with my advice respecting the interment of the
							deceased. I said it must depend on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greuhm’s family, where he should be buried— Whether at Georgetown or at
							the grave-yard in Washington, where the members of Congress are
							interred— If the latter an application for the purpose to the City
							authorities would be necessary which I would readily make if they
							desired; and I was assured the Government of the United States, would be
							solicitous to <pb type="ms" n="184"/>shew every mark of respect on the
							occasion that was due as well to the personal character of the deceased,
							as to the station that he held— I called at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and consulted him, with
							regard to what should be done.— It is the first instance of the decease
							of a foreign Minister at the Seat of Government, since the Existence of
							the Union— The President thought some respectful notice of the funeral
							due from the Government— And it occurred as proper, that the President
							should send his Carriage, and that the Heads of Departments should
							attend— Whether it should be noticed by the two houses of Congress was
							the next question— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> came in while I was there, and on
							consultation it was advised that I should this Evening see M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gaillard the President of the Senate and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay Speaker of the House, and confer
							with them on what they might think the houses would be disposed to do—
								<persRef ref="mcilvaine-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Ilvaine</persRef> the Senator from New-Jersey, and <persRef
								ref="mcilvaine-charles">his Son the Georgetown Clergyman</persRef>
							called together at my Office— The father was at the time of his Election
							U.S. District Attorney in New-Jersey; and this morning resigned his
							Office into the hands of the President— <persRef ref="addington-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington</persRef> came and
							conversed upon the long standing subject of the duties on rolled and
							hammered iron— Also upon general political topics, and the Colonial
							intercourse— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> was at the
							Office. After dinner I called first on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gaillard, President of the Senate at <persRef ref="timms-unknown"
								>Tims’s</persRef>. I found there with him, <persRef
								ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickerson</persRef> of New-Jersey—<persRef ref="bell-samuel"
								>Bell</persRef> of New Hampshire and <persRef ref="chandler-john"
								>Chandler</persRef> and <persRef ref="holmes-john">Holmes</persRef>
							of Maine— After some conversation, they agreed that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gaillard should to-morrow Morning
							informally mention to the Senators, the decease of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm, and they should consider whether
							formally or informally they should attend his funeral— I then went to
								<persRef ref="davis-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis’s</persRef>, and there saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay; who mentioned a strong disposition to do any thing that might be
							proper to shew respect to the deceased and his Government— Thence I
							called at <persRef ref="carbery-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carbery</persRef> the Mayor’s. He was not at home, but I afterwards
							met him, and he came to my house— He understood that a grave should be
							allowed to be dug for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm, in the
							navy-yard ground; as was requested by Barons Tuyll and Stackelberg— I
							had received a Note from them, to that effect. Stackelberg and <persRef
								ref="petry-jean">Petry</persRef> spent most of the Evening at my
							house.</p>

							This absorbed the morning— Two notes reciprocally passed between the

								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Stackelberg</persRef> with me, concerning
							the funeral of <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript"

							place, the day after to-morrow morning at eleven O’Clock, from <persRef
								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie’s</persRef>
							Church in F. Street; to which place the corpse will be previously
							transported— They desired also that <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold</persRef>, the Marshal of the
							District might be requested to attend for the preservation of order— I
							sent for the Marshal who very readily agreed to attend, and to give his
							assistance for making all the necessary arrangements— They had drawn up
							an order of procession, to which we made with their assent some
							modifications— I called at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>Presidents</persRef>, and stated to him the question, how <persRef
								ref="salazar-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Salazar</persRef> the Minister from the Republic of Colombia, was to
							be considered on this occasion— <hi rend="italic">We</hi> could not
							invite him to attend; and they would certainly not— While I was at the
							Presidents, <persRef ref="parrott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parrott</persRef> of N. Hampshire; and several other members of both
							houses <pb type="ms" n="185"/>came in. Dined at the <persRef
								ref="petry-jean">French Consul General Petry’s</persRef>— He had
							expected the arrival this day of his successor, <persRef
								ref="durantstandre-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durant
								Saint André</persRef>; but he did not come— Heads of Departments,
							and the foreign Corps Diplomatique were there— I spoke to Baron
							Stackelberg, and afterwards to Baron Tuyll, about M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar, the Colombian Minister, to
							enquire if they intended to invite him to attend the funeral tomorrow—
							They said it was de toute impossibilité, and reasoned very gravely with
							me to prove it— In the Evening I called again upon <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>; and
							afterwards upon <persRef ref="gaillard-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gaillard</persRef> to inform them of the arrangements
							made for the funeral of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm— They said
							it was probable the two Houses would adjourn over the day; without
							public assignment of the reason— But Clay said he did not know but there
							might be a debate in the House upon it. He entered also into
							conversation upon the Message, which he said seemed to be the work of
							several hands— And that the War and Navy Departments made a magnificent
							figure in it; as well as the Post-Office.— I said there was an account
							of a full treasury; and much concerning foreign Affairs, which was
							within the business of the Department of State— He said yes, and the
							part relating to foreign affairs, was he thought the best part of the
							Message— He thought the Government had weakened itself and the tone of
							the Country, by withholding so long the acknowledgment of the
							South-American Independence: and he believed even a War for it against
							all Europe including even England, would be advantageous to us— I told
							him I believed a War for South-American Independence might be
							inevitable, and under certain circumstances might be expedient, but that
							I viewed War in a very different light from him— As necessarily placing
							high interests of different portions of the Union in conflict with each
							other; and thereby imminently endangering the Union itself— Not a
							successful War, he said— But a successful War to be sure created a
							military influence, and power, which he considered as the greatest
							danger of War— He said he had thoughts of offering a Resolution, to
							declare this Country an Asylum for all fugitives from oppression; and to
							connect with it a proposal for modifying the naturalization Law, to make
							it more easily attainable— The foreigners in New-York, are petitioning
							Congress to that effect, and Clay will turn his liberality towards them
							to account. It was near eleven in the Evening when I got home— <persRef

							several of the minute particulars of the funeral arrangements for

							Europe but which they wished to accommodate altogether to impressions of
							propriety, prevailing here— One proposal was that <persRef

							Cushion, preceding the hearse, the ribband and cross of the order of the
							red Eagle, of the third Class of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greuhm was a knight— Another question was whether the Corps diplomatique
							should attend in full dressed embroidered Uniforms, or merely in black
							Clothes— Another who it would be proper should attend as pall-bearers— I
							advised them not to carry <pb type="ms" n="186"/>the Cushion with the
							ribbon and Cross; for if they did there would be a danger that the
							people would take them for Freemasons— That they should rather go in
							black clothes than in full dress Uniforms; and that the pall bearers
							should all be members of the Diplomatic Corps.— I called at the
							President’s—while I was there <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi

							quite alarmed lest the paragraph of the President’s Message relating to

							privateering— He seemed to wish that an explanatory and commendatory

							said <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>r</hi> Southard on our return to his Office at the Navy Department—
