							whether it did not contain some free sentiments respecting the British

							published, <hi rend="italic">at least while he remained in public

							have sent it for publication unless it were because it contained some
							compliments to himself.— At dinner, there was much amusing Conversation
							between him and D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill; though
							altogether desultory— There was as usual a dissertation upon Wines; not
							very edifying— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson said that the
								<hi rend="italic">Epicurean</hi> philosophy came nearest to the
							truth, in his opinion, of any antient system of philosophy— But that it
							had been misunderstood and misrepresented— He wished the work of
								<persRef ref="gassendi-pierre">Gassendi</persRef> concerning it had
							been translated— It was the only accurate account of it extant— I
							mentioned <persRef ref="lucretiuscarus-titus">Lucretius</persRef>— He
							said that was only a part—only the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>
							philosophy— But the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> philosophy was only to

								<persRef ref="fulton-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Fulton’s</persRef> Steam-Boat as an invention of great importance—to
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson assenting added—and I
							think his Torpedoes a valuable invention too— He then enlarged upon the
							certainty of their Effect, and adverted to some of the obvious
							objections against them, which he contended were not conclusive— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill’s conversation was very various,
							of chemistry—of Geography—and of natural philosophy—of
							oils—grasses—beasts—birds—petrifactions and incrustations—<persRef

								ref="humboldt-alexander">Humboldt</persRef>—<persRef

							knows a little of every thing and is communicative of what he
							knows—which makes me delight in his Company— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Jefferson said that he had always been extremely fond of
							Agriculture, and knew nothing about it; but the person who united with
							other Science the greatest agricultural knowledge of any man he knew was
								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Madison</persRef>— He was the best farmer in the world.— On the
							whole it was one of the <hi rend="italic">agreeable</hi> dinners I have

								Bradley</persRef> had two or three additional Sections to offer,
							which with modifications were agreed to, as was my bill, and all to be

							of the Sub-Committee, and with some alterations ordered me to report it—
							I gave it accordingly to the Clerks, to be copied by to-morrow morning—
							Through the whole of this transaction I have had some difficulty to
							steer my way— I moved the first Resolution which has issued in this Bill
								<pb n="319" type="ms"/>the day after the <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">President’s</persRef> Message at the
							Commencement of the Session, merely to put the Senate upon some work—for
							I knew they would otherwise do nothing but what should come from the
							house— I was obliged to leave it three or four days for
							consideration—and when the Committee was appointed I was made its
							Chairman— But Bradley not happening to be on the Committee (though of
							five) immediately felt his pride piqued, and he determined to take the
							business out of my hands— So that some days after he moved for a new
							Committee, substantially upon the same subject, though varied in form,
							(a practice often used when the Chairman of a Committee of importance
							happens to be a federalist) and he took an opportunity to move this
							Resolution when I was not in the house— From the moment it was made, I
							saw its motive and object, but I saw that to attempt resistance against
							it was vain— So perfectly similar was it to my Resolution in substance
							that it was noticed by a number of members, and he finally professed
							that he meant its reference to the <hi rend="italic">same</hi>
							Committee— I then moved the addition of two members to the Committee
							that he might be one of the number— When the Committee met he opposed
							the first principle upon which I wished the bill to be formed, and
							prevailed.— He then proposed successively his own measures, most of
							which were adopted, and eventually I did scarcely any thing more than
							draw the Bill— Even this however he has violently contested, and having
							drawn a mere proviso, upon the same principle in substance to one which
							I had drawn, and the Committee having finally given the preference to
							mine, he broke into a passion, and told them he would vote against the
							whole bill; and would not vote upon any of the subsequent Sections— I
							believe his purpose is to defeat the whole; and he has introduced some
							Sections which he knows will be violently opposed, with the intention
							that they shall first fail, and then he will fly from the whole, with
							great disgust at the <hi rend="italic">want of Energy</hi>, in the

							misdemeanor by a Grand Jury, before the Circuit Court of the United
							States for the District of Virginia, last August— But after the failure
							of the Bills against <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burr</persRef>, a Noli
							Prosequi was entered by the District Attorney on the Bills against
							Smith— As the members came in the Circumstance of his arrival and
							intention to take his seat was mentioned, and produced considerable
							agitation among them— <persRef ref="mitchill-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill</persRef> who had conversed
							with him produced a Certificate of the Noli Prosequi from the Clerk of
							the Court, which he had given him to be shewn, and at his desire he
							mentioned Smith’s regret that he had not had an opportunity for a trial,
							to demonstrate his Innocence— A general reluctance against his taking
							his seat now appeared, which was communicated to him, but as he did not
							reply that he would refrain from it— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Mitchill immediately after the Journals were read moved to adjourn— It
							was first agreed to adjourn over to Monday—the D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> then renewed the motion to adjourn— <persRef
								ref="maclay-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Maclay</persRef>, requested him to withdraw his motion, which he did—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Maclay then moved a Resolution for a
							Committee to enquire and report whether John Smith ought not to be
							expelled for his connection with Burr’s conspiracy— A long debate arose,
							upon the form of the Resolution— <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pope</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thruston-buckner">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Thruston</persRef> of Kentucky, <persRef ref="jones-george">M<hi

								ref="white-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="hillhouse-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Hillhouse</persRef> all proposed amendments or substitutes; and
								<persRef ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> moved that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
							Resolutions proposed should be referr’d to a Committee to enquire and
							report whether any thing further should be done— Several attempts were
							made to adjourn, but failed— The debate continued untill half past two,
							when M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Thruston’s Resolution, with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones’s Amendment was adopted and a
							Committee of seven appointed— Of this Committee to my great regret I was
							chairman, according to the practice which prevails on the choice of the
							Senate’s Committee’s That is, the member having the greatest number of
							votes, is first named and as such is Chairman— The Senate then
							immediately adjourned— I assembled the Committee, to take their
							directions, and moved that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Maclay should
							be chosen chairman as the original Resolution upon the subject came
							first from him— The Committee however refused to vary from the ordinary
							practice— It was so late, that the Committee took no other order, but
							that to adjourn untill to-morrow morning 10. O’Clock. the Committee
							consists of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Maclay, <persRef
								ref="franklin-jesse">Franklin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">Smith</persRef> of Maryland, Pope, Thruston and
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Anderson</persRef>, with myself—
							Before I left the Capitol, the <persRef ref="smith-samuel">Editor of the
								National Intelligencer</persRef> came to me and enquired whether the
							proceedings of the Committee would be in public—for in that case he
							should wish to attend, and perhaps take minutes— I told him that I could
							not answer for them, but would mention it to-morrow Morning to the
							Committee and inform him of their determination there— In the House of
							Representatives, a petition was presented from the merchants of
							Philadelphia for the repeal of the non-importation Act; which occasioned
							also there as one of the members told me a very ardent debate— The same
							petition was presented and read in Senate; but nothing was done with it—
							I spent the Evening at home; reading documents and writing.</p>
