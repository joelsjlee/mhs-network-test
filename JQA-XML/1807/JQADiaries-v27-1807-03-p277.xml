								ref="gregg-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gregg</persRef>
							from the House were sent with the usual notification of the recess to
							the <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef>— He was not as
							usual at the closing of the Sessions, in the Committee room at the
							Capitol, being detained by indisposition at his own house— The joint
							Committee, excepting M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gregg, went in a
							Carriage together, and carried eight or ten bills for his signature—
							After he had done this, he said he had expected to receive this Evening
							the Treaty, lately signed by <persRef ref="monroe-james;pinkney-william"
								>our Ministers</persRef> with the <persRef
								ref="eden-william2;fox-henry">Commissioners of
								Great-Britain</persRef>, at London; but it had not arrived— He had
							however seen a Copy received this afternoon by <persRef
								ref="erskine-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Erskine</persRef>, which he had been so obliging as to lend him—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill said we had been requested
							by several members of the Senate, who had heard of this copy received by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Erskine, to enquire whether there
							would probably be a call of the Senate, at an early day, to consider the
							Treaty; as some of them would in that case prefer to remain here— The
							President replied in emphatic tone: “certainly not”— He then added that
							there were two things either of which would prevent him from troubling
							the Senate with the consideration of this Treaty— The one was that it
							contained no satisfactory Article respecting the impressment of men from
							our ships—not even what they had offered, at a previous stage of the
							Negotiation; and the other was a declaration delivered by the British
							Commissioners at the time when the Treaty was signed, purporting that
							the <persRef ref="george-iii">King</persRef> reserved the right of
							retaliating, against the decree of the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>French Emperor</persRef> of 21. November last; unless the United
							States should resist it— This the President said would involve us in the
							War, and compel us to make a common Cause with Great-Britain; and the
							only way he could account for our Ministers having signed such a Treaty,
							with such Circumstances, was by supposing that in the first panic of the
							french imperial decree they had concluded a war would be inevitable, and
							that we must make a common Cause with England. He should however
							continue amicable negotiation with England, and continue the suspension
							of the non-importation act— And instructions had been sent in January to
							our Ministers, which he supposed they had by this time received, to give
							notice, even if they should have signed the Treaty without the Article
							to protect our Seamen from impressment, that it would not be ratified,
							and to renew the Negotiation— The Members of the Committee returned to
							the Capitol; but I walk’d home which I reached not much before Midnight—
							The <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson;pope-eliza;hellen-adelaide"
								>young Ladies</persRef> soon after came in from a party at <persRef
								ref="erskine-frances">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>

						<p><date>18. </date>We found it very difficult this morning to crowd all
							into the Stage, which was a very old and crazy Carriage— After breaking
							part of the tackle, and being detained half an hour to repair it before
							we got out of Providence, we cross’d the Sea-Conk river, in a
							flat-bottom’d boat, at the place where the middle bridge was, of the
							three which were lately swept away by the floods and Ice—we came in to
							the Turnpike road about seven miles on this side of the river— All our
							trunks lashed behind the Carriage were twice lost from it by the
							unskillfulness of the driver, and the second time the latch of the lock
							upon my trunk was broken, and all the contents of the trunk, books and
							clothing were thrown out into the mud, in the middle of the road— The
							trunk was still held to the carriage by the rope fastened to one of its
							handles, and dragg’d upwards of a mile along the road before we
							discovered the accident— By the length of time lost, in recovering the
							trunks, and my clothes &amp; books, we were so detained that it was 4.
							in the afternoon before we reached the house at Wrentham where we dined—
							Here however we obtained a better Carriage— At Dedham we attempted, but
							without success to procure a carriage for <persRef key="smith-abigail"
								>my Sister</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-john;dewindt-caroline"
								>her children</persRef> to go to Quincy— About 9. O’Clock at Night
