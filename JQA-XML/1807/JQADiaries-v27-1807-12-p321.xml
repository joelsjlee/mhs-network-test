							the unfitness of the man,—the indelicacy to the House of

							Cause, and the injustice to our present Clerks in putting him in a

							there would be any— That he would take care it should not injure any of
							our present clerks, and Van Zandt would share his salary with <persRef

							in Negotiation, so long as the <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"

							then moved that the Philadelphia petition which has lain several days on

							Government— It occasioned a debate of two hours, when the petition was
							referr’d, on yeas and nays taken 16. to 13— After this came on a new
							Amendment reported by the Committee to the Potowmac Bridge, which was
							debated untill the adjournment without coming to a decision— I

							tell— There was no other opposition in Committee— Some question was made
							whether we should report a Resolution or a Bill— The last was concluded
							on; and as we thought it would be necessary to found some other measures

							Randolph had refused to meet him, alledging that he considered Wilkinson
							as on a level with <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Aaron Burr</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="dunbaugh-jacob">Serjeant Dunbaugh</persRef>— That
							Wilkinson had replied by a very bitter, recriminating letter, which was

							the newspapers— He said further that there was somebody to testify that
							Randolph had once been horse-whip’d, and in short that they were going
							to <hi rend="italic">Run him down</hi>.— I told him I was very sorry for
							it.</p>

							attended, and the reports were read— A debate first arose on the

								Hillhouse</persRef> opposed— Then some debate on reading Smith’s
							answers to the Committee’s questions, which Hillhouse very strenuously

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The whole of this month I have
							been so much engaged upon Committees and their business that I have been
							obliged entirely to forego the continuation of my lectures— I rise
							generally with the Sun, or a little before— Read or write untill 9.
							Breakfast and walk to the Capitol, where I am very much occupied untill
							four— Walk home—dine, and pass the Evening in my chamber reading public
							papers or writing untill 9. at Night. Supper below—bed, about eleven—
							Occasionally spending an Evening abroad.</p>
						<p>I have more than abundant reason to be thankful for the blessings of
							Providence during the past year; which has been perhaps the most
							prosperous year of my life; and the least checkered with unpropitious
							Events— After passing its two earliest months here, in March I returned
							home, and resumed my residence in Boston— There I pass’d the Summer, and
							was bless’d in the birth of a <persRef key="adams-charles2">third
								son</persRef>, who has hitherto had health beyond the common portion
							of an infant— <persRef ref="adams-george;adams-john2">My other
								children</persRef> though of more slender Constitutions, have also
							been preserved to us, as have <persRef ref="adams-john;adams-abigail">my
								parents</persRef> and other near relations— On the return of the
							Congressional Meeting, with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and infant boy, I came safely here where we have
							since remained.— My private affairs have been improving, though I have
							contracted a large debt, which it must be my constant, and unwearied
							care to discharge— My own health with some slight interruptions has been
							greater than I had known for many years— My general consideration among
							my fellow-citizens, though not marked by any new public testimonial in
							the course of the year, has been to my observation apparently rising.
							During the present Session of the Senate my standing in that body has
							been singular— Apparently so distinguished, as to have excited
							jealousies, with little more real influence than heretofore— The usual
							principal leading characters of the Senate have been absent altogether
							or principally this Session— <persRef ref="tracy-uriah">Tracy</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="baldwin-abraham">Baldwin</persRef> are no more—
								<persRef ref="giles-william">Giles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef> have not yet appeared— <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">Smith</persRef> of Maryland has been absent
							nearly half the time— The leading members have been <persRef
								ref="bradley-stephen">Bradley</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">Anderson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mitchill-samuel">Mitchill</persRef>, with whom in respect of
							the business of Committees I have been much associated— On most of the
							great national questions now under discussion, my sense of duty leads me
							to support the administration, and I find myself of course in opposition
							to the federalists in general— But I have no Communication with the
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef> other than that
							in the regular order of business in Senate— In this state of things my
							situation calls in a peculiar manner for prudence; my political
							prospects are declining, and as my term of Service draws near its close,
							I am constantly approaching to the certainty of being restored to the
							situation of a private citizen— For this Event however, I hope to have
							my mind sufficiently prepared— In the mean time I implore that Spirit
							from whom every good and perfect gift descends to enable me to render
							essential Service to my Country, and that I may never be governed in my
							public conduct by any consideration other than that of my duty.</p>
