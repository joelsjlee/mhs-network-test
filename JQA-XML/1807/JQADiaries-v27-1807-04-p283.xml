							addition of three new members— There were two before— I was immediately
							placed upon the additional Committee. The Resolutions being revised and
							amended were unanimously agreed to— A Motion then was made that they

							Moderator chosen—viz—myself— The motions for the signing and publishing
							the Resolutions then pass’d, and the meeting was adjourned to Sunday
							Evening— It was about 10 at Night before I got home—</p>
