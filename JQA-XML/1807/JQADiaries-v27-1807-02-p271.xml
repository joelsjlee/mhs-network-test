							the <persRef ref="tucker-thomas">Treasurer</persRef>, for the amount of
							the annual appropriation, and agreed to meet again Monday morning— A
							Bill respecting the Louisiana land-titles was debated with various
							Amendments reported by a Committee; all of which were eventually
							rejected and the Bill pass’d to the third reading, with a single
							amendment of a clerical error, which had crept into the engross’d bill
							as it came from the House of Representatives engross’d— About 4.
							O’Clock, <persRef ref="turner-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Turner</persRef> of N. Carolina, moved that when the <pb n="277"
								type="ms"/>Senate should adjourn, it might be to meet to-morrow,
							(Sunday.) which being objected to, he said that his only reason for
							making the motion was that he expected a Bill would be sent from the
							House of Representatives, repealing the Salt duties, and continuing the
							Mediterranean fund, and unless the Senate should meet to-morrow, it
							would be in the power of any one member to prevent the passage of the
							Bill, by objecting against its being read more than once in the same
							day— After some debate, it was agreed to meet again at seven O’Clock
							this Evening, instead of to-morrow— By invitation of <persRef
								ref="pickering-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pickering</persRef>, and <persRef ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy</persRef> I went and dined with
							them— At 7. in the Evening we met again, and did little more than make a
							Quorum— We sat untill about 9. O’Clock— The House also met at 7. And
							soon took up their Salt-Bill, but there was no prospect of their passing
							it before Midnight— After several motions in Senate to adjourn had
							failed, <persRef ref="maclay-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Maclay</persRef> renewed the motion for sitting to-morrow; which was
							debated with some earnestness; but on a call for the yeas and nays the
							motion was abandoned, and the Senate adjourned untill Monday morning— It
							rained so heavily that I could not walk home; nor could I procure a
							Hackney Coach, either at the Capitol or at <persRef ref="stelle-pontius"
								>Stelle’s</persRef> Hotel— I went into the House of Representatives,
							where I found them, debating upon the salt-bill— <persRef
								ref="wheaton-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Wheaton</persRef>, their Serjeant at Arms, offered to give me a seat
							in his Carriage, home, if I would wait untill their adjournment— They
							sat untill half-past one in the Morning; <persRef ref="randolph-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. Randolph</persRef>
							continually making motions and calling for the yeas and nays, untill he
							could not obtain one fifth of the members to support him in asking for
							them— When the question upon the passage of the bill came to be taken
							there was not a quorum within the bar— Several fruitless attempts were
							made to call in absent members— At length after counting the members
							several times, the <persRef ref="varnum-joseph">Speaker</persRef>
							appointed <persRef ref="blount-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Blount</persRef> and <persRef ref="masters-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Masters</persRef>, (one of each side,
							as he said) as tellers; and they then returned seventy one members,
							which with the Speaker made a Quorum, and the Bill was pass’d— They then
							immediately adjourned— I rode home with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Wheaton and <persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Cutts</persRef>—who both said there was not actually a Quorum when
							the question was taken— It was about 2. in the morning when I got
							home.</p>
