							dinner again in my chamber untill dusk— Walk an hour in the Mall or
							elsewhere— Sup between 9 and 10 at Night— Bed about 11.— Fridays at
							Cambridge— This is the regular course; but the exceptions are more
							numerous than the rule. My house and my Time have been beset with
							Company the greatest part of the month, and a variety of occupations
							abroad has absorbed a large portion of my hours— My Cambridge duties
							have never been intermitted and this day the Senior Class leaves
							College— I have declined all dissipation and invitations of amusement
							when possible, but still waste Time inexcusably.— George’s lessons the
							last fortnight have been lost.</p>
