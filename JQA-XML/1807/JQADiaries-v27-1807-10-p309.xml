							always as a subordinate member— The merely laborious duties have been
							readily assigned to me, and as readily undertaken and discharged— My
							success has been more frequent the opposition than in carrying any
							proposition of my own, and I hope I have been instrumental in arresting
							many unadvised purposes and projects.— Though as to the general policy
							of the Country, I have been uniformly in a small, and constantly
							decreasing minority, my opinions and votes have been much oftener in
							unison with the Administration than with their opponents: and I have met
							with at least as much opposition from my party friends as from their
							adversaries— I believe, more— I know not that I have made any personal
							enemies, now in Senate; nor can I flatter myself with having acquired
							any personal friends— There have been hitherto two, <persRef
								ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="plumer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Plumer</persRef>, upon whom I could rely, but it has pleased
							Providence to remove one of them by Death, and the changes of political
							party have removed the other— With the warmest wish to render real
							service to the public according to the measure of my ability, the path
							which Prudence prescribes to me under the circumstances of the time is
							to undertake little, to content myself with the regular attendance which
							is the duty of every member, and to restrain rather than indulge the
							propensities to debate.</p>
