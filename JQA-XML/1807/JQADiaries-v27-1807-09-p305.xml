							written by somebody else. This letter which was from <persRef
								ref="pope-eliza">Eliza Johnson</persRef>, he secretly took, and
							carried over to her— My Foster, finding it in the hands of some person
							in his family, brought it to me himself— George’s expedient was much
							like that of <persRef ref="thomaspipes">Pipes</persRef>, in Peregrine
							Pickle— His associations of ideas are numerous, and often eccentric—
							They appear to be always just as far as his knowledge extends— His
							absurdities arise from Conclusions drawn under ignorance, and therefore
							with neglect of material parts of the premises— I heard <persRef
								ref="buckminster-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Buckminster</persRef> both parts of this day.— His text was from
							Proverbs XVI.9. A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the L<hi
								rend="small-caps">ord</hi> directeth his steps. The Sermon, which
							extended through both Services, was a Comment upon the Vanity of human
							wishes, and the superior beneficence of Providence— The train of thought
							was precisely that of <persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="johnson-samuel">Johnson</persRef>— The Sentiments were
							new dress’d, in very handsome attire— His composition is highly
							animated, and ornamented; his Imagination splendid and lively— His style
							sufficiently polished, and his delivery duly accented, emphatic and
							paused. That his pronunciation is elaborate appeared from a
							self-correction which he made in reading the Psalm. The lines were—</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Fear <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, ye Saints, and you shall then</l>
							<l>Have nothing else to fear.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>He read the first line half through, accenting only the first syllable
							Fear—he then stopp’d in the middle of the verse, and repeated from the
							beginning Fear <hi rend="italic">him</hi> ye Saints &amp;c—and yet he
							did not in the second line accent either <hi rend="italic">else</hi> or
								<hi rend="italic">to</hi>; both of which I think should be accented,
							to complete the antithesis— His Doctrine, did not altogether correspond
							with my opinions— To inculcate that nothing, or next to nothing of our
							happiness in this world depends upon ourselves, is not, I believe,
							either moral or religious truth— Nor is it at all a cheering theory.—
							His prayers were quite original in thought and expression— That of the
							afternoon appeared to have been written— He baptiz’d three children—two
							of them <persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> H.
								G. Otis’s</persRef> youngest boys <persRef ref="otis-william"
								>William Foster</persRef> and <persRef ref="otis-alleyne2"
								>Alleyne</persRef>. His performance of this duty was also peculiar
							to himself; and his prayer connected it well with his Sermon. My <hi
								rend="italic"><persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef></hi>
							<pb n="308" type="ms"/>George dined, and pass’d the afternoon, after
							Church, at <persRef ref="gardner-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gardner’s</persRef>, with <persRef ref="gardner-john2;gardner-sally"
								>his children</persRef>— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
