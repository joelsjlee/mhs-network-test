						<p>Morning visit from the <persRef ref="matthews-william">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Matthews</persRef>, with the <persRef ref="rese-frederick">Roman
								Catholic Bishop of Detroit</persRef>— The Bishop is acquainted with
								<persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Boyd</persRef>, and <persRef ref="boyd-harriet">his family</persRef>
							at Green Bay—and was also acquainted with <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas B.
								Johnson</persRef> some years ago at Rome. The Bishop had called me
							out from my Seat in the House a few days since, and said he wished to
							have it in his power, on his return to Michigan, to inform Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Boyd and his family that he had seen
							their relations here— I had invited him to come to my house, and
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> came down and conversed with him
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthews, Priest of the Roman
							Catholic Church here— The business that occupied the House was the army
							and Indian and Navy Appropriation Bills.— The first was passed without
							debate and almost without observation— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> made a set Speech, avowedly not for the House but
							for home consumption—not against the Indian Appropriation Bill, but
							against our treatment of the Indians, an exhausted and altogether
							useless theme of declamation. Yet it gave rise to a sharp debate in
							which <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="glascock-thomas">Glascock</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="holsey-hopkins">Holsey</persRef> and above all the new member
							from Georgia <persRef ref="alford-julius">Alford</persRef>, came down
							with the tomahawk and scalping knife arguments, upon Cushing, and
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="grennell-george">Grennell</persRef>— Alford has been himself in
							the Indian wars; lives within 25 Miles of the Indian borders, and could
							not conceive how any man could have any sympathy with Indians— He said
							he was much indisposed, and was not in voice or else he would give the
							house a specimen of the War-whoops. He declared himself an opposition
							man; but that the Government in their treatment of the Indians were not
							to blame— Adjourned about 5— I wrote an address to the Petitioners for
							the abolition of Slavery and the Slave trade in the District of
							Columbia, from <hi rend="strikethrough">to</hi> the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts
							for publication in the Quincy Patriot.</p>

							but which had a second Section altogether of a public nature, which
								<persRef ref="huntsman-adam">Huntsman</persRef> moved to refer to

							Commerce with a bill abolishing Protections for American Seamen, and to
							furnish them with Passports—read twice and referred to the Committee of
