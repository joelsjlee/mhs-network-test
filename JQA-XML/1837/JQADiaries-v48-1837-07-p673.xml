						<p>At ten O’Clock this morning I left home with <persRef

							engaged for us two Seats in the ordinary Stage, but the Committee of

						<p>I delivered an Oration before the inhabitants of the town of
							Newbury-Port, at their request on the anniversary of our National
							Independence.— From the time of my arrival in the town last evening,
							Chaos is the only word to express what I have seen and felt.— <persRef

							lives with <persRef ref="cushing-john3;cushing-elizabeth">his father and

							Cushing is a widower without children, and <persRef
								ref="cushing-caroline">his wife</persRef> was a daughter of judge
							Wilde— The firing of guns began at Midnight, and continued all night,

							this morning <persRef ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Coleman</persRef> came and took me in a Chaise down into Water
							Street—where I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing standing
							upon a Platform and delivering an address to the eminent members of the
							fire department, drawn up in a line in front of him— He very soon
							concluded, and descending from the Platform—introduced me to them—
							Walked in procession with them; to a building belonging to them; where
							there was a table served with a cold collation.— I gave them a toast in
							lemonade. The fire department of Newbury-Port—always prepared for duty,
							may they never be needed to perform it— I then returned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing’s and shortly after proceeded to
							join the procession formed in high Street— I walked between <persRef
								ref="fox-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thomas B.

							of the first Congregational Church, and <persRef ref="cross-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Cross</persRef>, the reader of
							the Declaration of Independence— The procession was very large, and with
							it were several hundreds of children of the Public Schools, male and
							female— The march and countermarch, traversing many of the Streets of
							the town, took a long hour— The meeting house is some way westward of
							the market square, where it was when I resided at Newbury-Port. It was
							crowded with auditors as full as it could hold—hundreds could not obtain
							admission— There was music instrumental <pb n="676" type="ms"/>and
							vocal—4. Stanza’s of <persRef ref="paine-robert4">R. T.
								Paine’s</persRef> Song of Adams and Liberty were sung— Prayer, by
								Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Thomas B. Fox. Then an Anthem—next
							The Declaration of Independence was read by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Robert Cross of Amesbury— The 194<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Hymn of <persRef ref="belknap-jeremy">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Belknap’s</persRef> collection. O’er
							mountain-tops, the mount of God— In Latter days shall rise— This was
							performed at my request, and immediately preceded the delivery of my
							Oration which occupied an hour and a half—listened to with deep
							attention and occasional applause— The Hallelujah Chorus Anthem Chorus,
							and the Benediction Chorus closed the performances at half past two
							O’Clock—as I descended the pulpit in a small room adjoining the Church
							an old Lady came to me and shook hands with me saying she was now
							satisfied that I was a Christian, of which she had entertained doubts— I
							then returned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushings house and
							dined, with a company of 12 gentlemen, entertained by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing, consisting of the members of the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morse</persRef> the Minister of
							the Episcopal-church here, who married the <persRef
								ref="morse-elizabeth">widow</persRef> of <persRef ref="tyng-dudley"

							whom I saw when I passed through the town in September 1833. died about
							two Months since; and in his professional labours he is superseded by
							his Colleague, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Andrews reminded me that I had first
							introduced him as a preacher at Newbury-Port, and travelled with him
							from <persRef ref="dana-francis">judge Dana’s</persRef> house at
							Cambridge.— About 9. in the Evening I went to the Soiree, or party at
							the town Hall where a number of Ladies and Gentlemen were introduced to
							me.— I took a seat between two young women—one of whom asked me, if I
							knew <persRef ref="bartlett-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Bartlett</persRef>, I said yes, surely. She said he is my

							<persRef ref="cushing-john3">father</persRef> is an old Sea Captain and

							commander of the boat in which we were rowed up from the Ship Horace to
								<persRef ref="isaacson-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Isaacson’s</persRef>— This morning a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> from Dover,
							New-Hampshire, came, and sat with me half an hour— He said he had
							removed from Newbury-Port to Dover in January 1787. and had ever since
							lived at Dover— He came now merely from curiosity to see me— <persRef
								ref="deford-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Ford</persRef>
							called twice and spoke about the printing of my Oration yesterday
							delivered and of which he said they should request a copy for the press—
							But as I might perhaps wish to take a copyright of it, they thought of
							leaving the printing to be done by my own direction— I said that if the
							inhabitants of that town felt any interest in having it printed here, I
							should conform entirely to their wishes; but otherwise I should be glad
							to have it done, under my immediate revision That I had never taken out
							a copyright, for any discourse delivered in public, and should take none
							now— But should only bespeak a number of copies to give away— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing asked me also to write out for the
							press my answer to the address of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
							Ford, on the green at Newbury; as his address had been requested for
							publication— After Breakfast, we took leave of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cushing, and at a quarter before nine left Newbury-Port,
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> and myself in an
							extra Stage and four horses provided by the Committee of arrangements,
							and in which we returned through Ipswich Beverley, and Salem to Boston,
							where crossing in the Winisimet Steam ferryboat we arrived just after

							Matthew 17.1. [“]And after six days, Jesus taketh <persRef ref="peter"

							did shine as the Sun, and his raiment was white as the light.” And in
							the afternoon from John 7.46. “The Officers answered, never man spake
							like this man.” Both these Sermons were discourses were panegyrical upon
							the character, and life of Jesus Christ That of the afternoon was most
							pleasing to me— The transfiguration was a miracle the necessity for
							which is not explained—a separate and sacred preternatural manifestation
							of Christ to three of the Apostles merely as would seem for their
							personal satisfaction. The afternoon Sermon shewing how the conduct and
							sayings of Jesus were superior to those of the rest of mankind was very
							impressive and affecting. I read the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>

						<p>A wasted day— Much of the morning lost in strolling over the orchard back

								Lunt</persRef>, this morning from Ephesians 3.19.—that ye might be

							“Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea are mighty in power?” the
							text of the afternoon was one, from which a discourse of deep impression
							was to be expected; but it was not equal to many others of M<hi

								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> from Acts 24. 25. the

								<persRef ref="drusilla">Drusilla</persRef> made up for all other
							deficiencies. There is no other of the Sermons of Saurin superior if
							there is one equal to it— The duty of a Christian preacher, to reprove
							the vices of powerful men, is set forth in this discourse in all its
							glory, and all its dangers— The example of Paul, <hi

							before Felix upon the very depravities of which Felix himself was
							guilty— Upon Justice, Temperance and Judgment to come— It is perhaps not

							as a lawyer, upon bequests of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston to
							the town of Princeton— The Town is also a Parish; and there is a

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis thinks should be settled by an

							shall not be taxed— A condition which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Davis thinks the donor had no right to prescribe, it being contrary to
							Law, and therefore that a breach of the condition will not operate a
							forfeiture of the grant. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis proposes
							that a third account should be settled by the Executors before the judge

							will hold his Court in Quincy a fortnight from to-morrow, Tuesday the

							save a transplanted peach tree and seedling wild plumtree growing there—

							nearly dead but reviving transplanted peach tree, surrounded by about 40
							puny seedling apple-trees, 2 pears, and two Hickories— For a bushel

								ref="espy-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James P.

								ref="newton-isaac">Newtonian</persRef> discovery of
							gravitation—reducing all the atmospheric phenomena of storms to one
							principle, by means of which he thinks the gravity, the continuance and
							the direction of Storms summer and winter may be calculated— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Espy has made many observations, but is in
							want of means to make many more, and the aid of Congress to provide the
							funds— He told me that <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Sergeant</persRef> had promised
							to introduce the subject to the consideration of the House of
							Representatives, at the approaching Session, and I assured him that I
							should readily afford any assistance in my power to any proposition
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant might offer— The substance
							of the theory is that storms are conflicts of clouds driven in opposite
							directions from a circumference to a centre— <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah Adams

							There were two light thunder Showers, one about Sunset the other between
							9 and 10 in the Evening. Copious rains— I sleep so little in the night

							I agreed to go next Tuesday Morning, if the weather proves fair to the

							would pay me the balance due on his agreement with me for the wood— At
							the Office of the Quincy Patriot, I exchanged several numbers, so as to
							make my file compleat except the 4 numbers for January— On Wednesday
							last there was a Meeting at Dorchester, at which an Anti-Texas
							Convention of delegates from all the towns in the 12<hi

							be held at Quincy, before the meeting of Congress—and a Resolution was

								<persRef ref="blanchard-hw">H. W. Blanchard</persRef> of Dorchester

							I advised Wednesday the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> or Thursday the
								24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August— My next call was upon
								<persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> L.

								Lunt</persRef>, this morning from 2. Corinthians 10.12—but they,
							measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves <hi
								rend="strikethrough">with</hi> among themselves are not wise— The
							doctrines was that wisdom consists in assuming for measurement and
							comparison out of ourselves, and that for the true Christian, the
							standard is Jes<unclear>us</unclear> Christ himself—or in other words,
							that religion is the standard— This position was maintained with great
							power, and with great variety of illustration— In the afternoon the
							Sermon was from Romans 10.3. [“]For they, being ignorant of God’s
							righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
							have not submitted themselves, unto the righteousness of God.” Too
							nearly the same subject as that of the morning— The righteousness
							recommended was that of Faith— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave
							notice that the Communion would be administered next Sunday, and a
							collection taken up in the afternoon to form a parish library, for which
							contributions of books were also solicited— I read the 7<hi
