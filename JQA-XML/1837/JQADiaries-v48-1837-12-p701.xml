                            Formal notice was immediately given, by a member of a meeting of all the

                            the services I had rendered, and my kindness to the Church— And their

                            agreed to meet again Next Thursday— H.R.U.S— The Journal had disfigured

                            to state the facts correctly—but his motion was rejected— <persRef

                            which was carried 136 to 65. and after a Speech, he moved the previous

                            said the motion was not in order—that the only answer could be given was
                            aye or no. I moved that my motion might be entered on the Journal with
                            the decision of the Speaker that it was not in order—to which he made no
                            answer— A motion then was made to go into Committee of the whole on the

                            refused and the motion was laid on the table—but my answer was entered

                            Resolution, till he said that if the question ever came to the issue of
                            War, the Southern people would march into New-England and conquer it— I
                            said, I had no doubt they would if they could, and that it was what they
                            were now struggling for with all their might— I told him that I entered
                            my Resolution on the Journal because I meant his name should go down to
                            posterity, damned to everlasting fame— He forced a smile and said we
                            should then go down together— I replied precisely—side by side—that was
                            what I intended— So conscious was he of the odious character of his
                            Resolution that he dared not resect these remarks—but he dared not
                            object to Boon’s motion to lay mine on the table; which precisely
                            answered my purpose of having my answer entered upon the Journal. He
                            soon after rose from his seat and left the House.— Reports from the
                            Committees were then called for, which occupied more than an hour— I
                            moved from the Committee of Manufactures that the Report of the
                            Committee made at the last Winter’s Session should be recommitted, which
                            was ordered.— Private business taken up— Committee of the whole—

                            Immediately after dinner I received three Letters by the express mail—

                            to him, announcing the sudden, and almost instantaneous death of

                            immediately after dinner— I went immediately with the Letters to <pb

                            the company of other lodgers there, communicated to him the melancholy
                            tidings of the Letters and asked him to go with me to M<hi

                            the calamity— I found him in his chamber on his bed in the deepest
                            affliction— He asked me to read to him the Letters which I had received
                            for him which I did; and they renewed his sobbing and moaning and tender
                            lamentations at his bereavement— Governor Lincoln advised him to go off
                            to Baltimore this Night and went after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            John Reed to engage him to go with him— While Governor Lincoln was gone,
                            I took the first opportunity to remind him of the arrangements necessary
                            to prepare for his departure— He then left his bed and looked over some
                            papers which he gave to me to look to during his absence—and others
                            which he reserved for Governor Lincoln— The Governor soon returned with
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed who said he would go with
                            Phillips— They were to start at ten O’Clock in the open mail waggon—for
                            Baltimore— I left them about 8. and came home but could not write—this

                            from Acts 24.25. [“]And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance and

                            Petition— I drew up accordingly a sketch of an address to the People of

                            boasts of being the only person who ever refused that Office. Fendall

                            the people on their side— I watched the reading of the Journal, and

                            the House refused that— I then spoke against the reference to the
                            Committee of Foreign Relations till the House was deserted— When the
                            question was taken the vote was 60 to 33. no Quorum— The House adjourned
                            and it was near 4. O’Clock. Wind and Tide are against me, on this
                            subject, and between the thirst of the Slave holders for Texas, and the

                            Resolution was adopted ordering the Committee of Accounts to cause to be

                            Notes, and which he accidentally threw into the fire— The members are

                            making Dividends while their specie payments are suspended— Their reason
                            assigned is that the Charters of all the District Banks will expire next
                            July— I did not think proper to make a debate upon this point, and
                            suffered the committee to be discharged without opposition. <persRef

                            Committee of the whole on the Message, but was not supported. The order
                            of the day was the question upon the reference to the Committee of
                            Foreign Relations, of the Petition from the New-York Peace Society—
                                <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> apparently under
                            great embarrassment retracted all his assertions made on Tuesday,
                            denying that there had been any decree of the Mexican Legislature,
                            proposing eventually the reference of the disputes between us and them
                            to the arbitration of a friendly power— He now with a multitude of
                            apologies for the irregularity of his proceeding, produced a translation
                            of the Mexican Decree itself—dated the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            of May last; and communicated to this Government on the 23<hi
                                rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this Month that is the day after his
                            denial of its existence in the House— There was a second Article of the
                            decree authorizing the Government in the Event of the final denial of
                            Justice by the United States, to close the Ports of Mexico against our
                            Commerce, and to prohibit the use of our manufactures— Howard dwelt much
                            upon this as a proof of a hostile Spirit on the part of Mexico, and
                            charged the petitioners with suppressing this part of the decree— I
                            answered him, and insisted on my objections to the Committee of Foreign
                            Affairs, as unfit to have this Petition referred to them— I said that
                            the changes in the Committee made it only the more objectionable—and
                            referred particularly to <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef> of
                            South-Carolina, and <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> of
                            Virginia, both of whom had been put upon the Committee as if for the
                            express purpose of plunging the Country into a War with Mexico— Patton
                            was absent and Legare who was present, complained that I should
                            personally designate him— I replied that for the personal and private
                            character of both the Gentlemen, I entertained high respect, but as it
                            had been urged in answer to my objection to the Committee, that a
                            majority of them were not <pb n="718" type="ms"/>the same with those who
                            made the Report last Winter, I was obliged to shew that the change had
                            only rendered the Committee more objectionable— I asked for the yeas and
                            nays upon the reference to the Committee of Foreign Affairs; and they
                            were for the reference 117 to 55. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
                                >Cushing</persRef>, a member of the Committee voted for it— I told
                            him I should require a report and if the Majority would not make one,
                            the Minority might. In this whole debate I have had no support, from a
                            single member of any party— I asked leave to offer a Call upon the
                                <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> upon what Act of
                            the House of Representatives in the last Congress, it had appeared that
                            they concurred in the opinion of the late President that the State of
                            our Relations with Mexico would have justified, then a resort to arms:
                            but this was denied— I moved that the Memorial of the New-York Peace
                            Society should be printed— The <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Speaker</persRef> said, the Gentleman from Massachusetts asks leave
                            to make a motion— Objection was made of course— I asked if the motion
                            was not matter of right— He said it would have been before the
                            commitment. I had made the motion before the commitment; but in the
                            protracted debate on the question of commitment I had forgotten to
                            insist upon having the question of printing taken with it— This trickery
                            at every step taken with regard to the Petition from the Peace Society
                            shews how annoying it is to the War projects of the Administration.</p>

                            he had it with an order to print endorsed upon it— I consented
                            therefore, that to precede the debate he should give only a synopsis of
                            it— I told him however that I believed he was mistaken, about the order
                            for printing; but he insisted he was not— He wanted all the three parts
                            to print the whole debate in one day’s paper; but I had accidentally
                            left the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and 3<hi rend="superscript"

                            consumed in receiving Petitions, Memorials and Resolutions— I presented

                            having declared my opinion that the Resolution to lay all such Petitions
                            was Unconstitutional, null and void, I should submit to it only as to
                            physical force— I should leave the House therefore <pb n="720" type="ms"
                            />to dispose of the Petitions, as they pleased, and they were all laid
                            on the table— The Anti-Texas Memorials and Petitions were all laid upon
                            the table successively. I stated that I had a Petition for the repeal of

                            on the table and ordered to be printed— The Call for Petitions was
                            carried through the States and Territories—and after 3. the House
                            adjourned— I enquired of <persRef ref="franklin-walter">M<hi
