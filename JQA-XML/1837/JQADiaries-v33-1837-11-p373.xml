						<p>Cold Night and Morning—so finger pinching that it robs me of my best
							writing time— Young <persRef ref="franzoni-john">Franzoni</persRef> was
							here, with another young man named <persRef ref="u">Kelly</persRef>,
							both printers, and in want of employment— Kelly said that the hard times
							affected the printing business very much; the merchants having far less
							printing work to be done than when business was so prosperous— He said
							he expected to be employed in <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton’s</persRef> Office in December— I told Franzoni that I knew
							not of any public office vacant to which I could recommend him; but that
							if an opportunity should present itself by which I could serve him I
							would do it with pleasure— <persRef ref="willard-simon">Simon
								Willard</persRef> the Clock maker came, and said he was here to put
							up a Clock which he had made for the Supreme Court of the United States,
							and thought he must call to see me, and remind me of that old Clock, the
							first that he ever made, and which when I was President was one of the
							first things in the world that I remembered— I told him it was yet
							standing in the chamber entry of my house at Quincy, and was now the
							best time piece I ever knew, not excepting a pocket Chronometer made for
							me by <persRef ref="french-santiago">French</persRef> the first
							Chronometer maker in the world, which I took from my pocket and shewed
							him.— That when at Quincy, I regularly wound up the Clock every Sunday
							Morning; but that it now wanted repair—a new suspension of the weights;
							and when he got home, I wished he would go out and repair it— He said he
							would— He is now 85 years old and his name is on the face of the Clock,
							dated Lexington 1774— He shewed me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef>, about of his own age, dated 22. October,
							cautioning him against self-exposure at his time of life, on this
							journey— I was detained till Noon before I could go, for a second
							sitting to <persRef ref="towle-eunice">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Towle</persRef>, who will make a hideous object of me— The third
							sitting is to be this day week— Thence I went to the Congress library,
							and took out the volume of <persRef ref="bacon-francis"
								>Bacon’s</persRef> Essays— I examined the catalogue of <persRef
								ref="actaeon">Actaeon’s</persRef> hounds in <persRef
								ref="banier-antoine">Banier’s</persRef> French translation of the
							Metamorphoses—two folio volumes with beautiful figures by <persRef
								ref="picart-bernard">Picart</persRef>— I examined the Catalogue also
							in the Delphin Edition. The Commentator gives the significancy of the
							Greek names of the dogs, but says that the Post has blundered in making
							them too long— That sportsmen always give their dogs short names—
							Generally of one syllable— This is good criticism; but applies only to a
							part of <persRef ref="ovid">Ovid’s</persRef> dogs. I suppose the
							Catalogue is imitated from the names of the frogs and mice in <persRef
								ref="homer">Homer’s</persRef> Batrachomuomachia— <persRef
								ref="allen-nathan">Nathan Allen</persRef>, the husband of the
								<persRef ref="allen-dorcas">woman</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u;allen-maria">children</persRef> sold last week, came this
							evening with the subscription paper, to pay <persRef ref="birch-james"
								>Birch</persRef> for them— They are now in the Jail waiting for this
							money to be raised to have them delivered over to the Husband and
							father— I subscribed fifty dollars to be paid if the sum be made up to
							complete the purchase— I enquired of Allen, apparently an active, but
							very ignorant man, how Dorcas came to be the property of <persRef
								ref="orme-rezin">Rezin Orme</persRef>; he said some people thought
							she was not— She had originally belonged to a woman in Baltimore named
								<persRef ref="u">Emery</persRef>, who married <persRef
								ref="davis-gideon">Gideon Davis</persRef>. on her death bed she made
							Davis promise that he would give Dorcas her freedom—but Davis never did—
							He married a <persRef ref="orme-maria">second wife</persRef>
							named<space/>belonging <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
							<pb n="374" type="ms"/>Georgetown— Davis himself died without
							emancipating Dorcas and his widow—married Rezin Orme—who sold her and
								<persRef ref="u;u">her four children</persRef>— Dorcas is subject to
							epileptic fits very violent after which she is sick ten or twelve days—
							She has been repeatedly sold and turned back on account of these fits,
							and often turned upon her husband’s hands to be maintained and doctored
							at his charge, because her owners would not incur the expence— The
							eldest of the surviving girls is 12 years old, and named Maria—the
							youngest 9. He says he shall easily find a place for Maria, who is a
							smart child— It is very doubtful whether I have not imprudently engaged
							myself in this matter, which I must pursue further— The emancipation of
							the woman and children is not yet secured— I finished the draught of my
							Speech of 14. October—but was obliged to close the Evening soon after
							nine.</p>

						<p>I had postponed until yesterday the making of a fire in the dining room,
							and began with the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of November— This
							may be considered as the Law of the climate at this place— Casual fires,
							chiefly morning and evening, a few days in October— Steady fires from
							the first of November.— April in the Spring corresponds with October in
							Autumn I had a morning visit from <persRef ref="munroe-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Munroe</persRef>, an old
							co-temporary, whom I have known upwards of 30 years, and who for 25 of
							them was Postmaster, of this city. The late <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> dismissed him, and
							he has fallen into hypocondriac habits for want of occupation— He raised
							a family of five or six children two of whom he has lost in an
							afflictive manner— <persRef ref="munroe-thomas2">His eldest
								son</persRef> of a venturous and romantic disposition, went at the
							age of 19 or 20 to Russia and entered the service of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>. He was treated there
							very courteously, obtained a Lieutenant’s Commission in the army, and
							afterwards an appointment as Aid de Camp of the <persRef
								ref="constantine2">Grand-duke Constantine</persRef>— He served in
							the War against Turkey but four or five years since took a typhus fever,
							from which he partially recovered, but lingered a long five or six
							months and died.— An amiable <persRef ref="munroe-frances"
								>daughter</persRef> married to a <persRef ref="ramsay-george">young
								man</persRef> of the Ramsey family, but living in her fathers house,
							two years ago last Spring, died of a puerperal fever leaving an <persRef
								ref="munroe-francis">infant</persRef> to his care. <persRef
								ref="munroe-fanny">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							was at the time for months after dangerously ill and is yet in infirm
							health— These afflictions have broken him down, and he is suffering as
							he says from what is commonly called blue devils— He could not describe
							the symptoms of his complaint; but asked me whether I had ever
							experienced the like; and whether I could prescribe a remedy for his
							disease— I told him that I knew what it was that I had occasionally been
							afflicted with it; always when I had nothing to do—never at any other
							time— Intense occupation was a never failing cure, and it was therefore
							principle and habit with me, to keep myself always busy—with serious
							affairs as much as possible— With trifles, for exercise, variety and
							relaxation— As to a remedy for him <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
							<pb n="375" type="ms"/>asked him if he had tried riding on horseback?
							sometimes, and with good effect— Had he visited the watering places?
							Yes—for many years in succession—but he was obliged now to economize,
							and could not afford the expence? Had he sought cheerful company? he
							could not endure company, and was often annoyed even by visitors in his
							family— I told him my materia medica was exhausted—exercise, active
							exercise—open air, temperance, cheerful company and above all constant
							employment of body or mind were all the remedies I knew for the blue
							devils— He said that was precisely what his doctors had told him, and
							what he fully believed to be true— He said his case was not so bad as
							that of <persRef ref="herbert-john2">John C. Herbert</persRef> of Prince
							George’s County—many years a member of Congress—formerly a warm friend
							of my administration, but since an equally warm Jackson man— He has
							taken it into his head that he is starving to death with want, and has
							actually been seen naked in the woods— He thinks it above all hard, that
							General Jackson never gave him an Office— A very respectable man,
							monomaniac, for fear of poverty— I compassionate the case of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Munroe— Wretchedness in old age, (68) from
							misfortunes, and a lack of fortitude to bear them— Want of occupation,
							and of energy to make it for himself— I called at <persRef
								ref="dyer-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dyer’s</persRef>
							auction room—to enquire about <persRef ref="allen-dorcas">Dorcas
								Allen</persRef> and <persRef ref="u;allen-maria">her
								children</persRef>— Dyer had been misinformed that they would be
							liberated by the giving of a note to a man who would lend <persRef
								ref="allen-nathan">Allen</persRef> the money, which <persRef
								ref="key-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Key</persRef> was
							to endorse— He said the woman and children were <hi rend="italic"
								>not</hi> at the Jail, and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Key
							had gone to <persRef ref="orme-maria">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Orme</persRef>, in her sick chamber, she having been lately
							confined; and had frightened her so by threatening her with the Law that
							it was not expected she would live— He pronounced a panegyric upon
								<persRef ref="orme-rezin">Orme</persRef>, who he said was one of the
							best and most respectable men in the world— And as to the Slaves, he had
							a right to sell them—they were his property— I asked him by what
							authority he had sold them— He said by <persRef ref="birch-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Birch’s</persRef>—that he had not
							asked him for any proof that they were his—he had trusted to his word— I
							said I understood they were not Orme’s property— He said they were his
							by his wife— I said I had heard they were not his wife’s— Well, he said
							he had heard so too— They were really part of <persRef
								ref="davis-gideon">Gideon Davis’s</persRef> Estate— He died
							insolvent, and they belonged to his creditors, and if he was one of them
							he would claim them as such— Here then is another danger to which these
							unhappy beings are subjected— If their freedom from Birch’s sale should
							be purchased, they might still be reclaimed by Davis’s creditors. I went
							to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and told <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef>
							that I expected to bring him the Manuscript of my Speech to-morrow— He
							said he should not be at the Office on Saturday. While I was there,
								<persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Matthew S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
								Clair Clarke</persRef> came in— I was telling Seaton that I had

								<persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler’s</persRef> surprize at meeting me walking in the rain—
							Clarke said he would tell me what <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt"
								>Stackelberg</persRef> had once said of me when I was president— He
							said [“]M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams is a Shentleman— When I
							meet him walking in the morning shust after taylight, when I am going
							home from a place where perhaps I ought not to have peen, he passes by
							and tont see me—put if I jouce to meet him in the mittle of the tay, he
							holds out his hant and says Ha! Baron, hour to ye too— That’s a man who
							knows when he should see a shentleman, and when he should not.”— Poor
							Stackelberg—a brave, honest kind hearted, dissolute man, ruined by
							dissipated habits and gambling.— He exposed his <hi rend="italic"

							<pb n="376" type="ms"/>life together with my dear departed son <persRef

						<p>I received a distressing Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>, directed to me at Baltimore with directions to
							forward it to me here if I should not be there. It was written partly
							last Sunday evening, when he says <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>his mother</persRef> was ready to leave home upon her journey to
							come here, but there was a prospect of a storm which might delay her
							departure; and partly Monday Morning when he says she was less well, and
							leaves it doubtful what day she would come on. I fear she was very ill.—
							The discomposure occasioned by this intelligence disabled me from
							completing the manuscript of my Speech by adjustment of it to the
								<persRef ref="otis-james2">Reporter’s</persRef> Notes— I took it
							however to the Intelligencer Office, thinking that the first part of it
							might be printed on Monday Morning, and was in a sufficient state of
							preparation. <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> had told me,
							that they must divide it into two of the daily papers, to have it all in
							the Country paper— Seaton was not at the Office— I went to the Office of
							the Franklin Insurance Company and found <persRef ref="bradley-abraham"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley</persRef>— He had the
							Policy, on <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary’s</persRef> House, where we
							live corner of I. and 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Streets. Square
							185 ready—4000 dollars for one year from the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of this Month—for which I paid 12 dollars and 1. for the
							policy— I took the Policy and gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bradley a check on the Bank of Washington for the money— I leave my own
							houses in the city yet uninsured, but could not suffer Mary’s longer to
							remain so— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley shewed me the Report
							ready to be made to the board of Directors, recommending a dividend of 8
							per Cent for the last half year—2 per cent less than several of the
							preceding dividends, on account of the fire which destroyed Washington’s
							House and shop last June—upon which they had two policys—one for 10000
							dollars and one for 3000—they paid the smallest as a total loss,—and
							compounded for the largest by paying 8000— There were very strong
							suspicions that the fire was kindled for the insurance; but no competent
							proof— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley shewed me also a blank
							policy of the Manhattan company variant somewhat from that now used by
							the Franklin Company and which he said the Directors of the Franklin
							Company thought of adopting— It engages the company only to the amount
							of the proved interest of the assured— I returned to the Intelligencer
							Office, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton, soon afterwards came
							in— We arranged the manuscript of my Speech, with the Reporter’s Notes
							so that half of it may be printed on Monday—but on returning home I
							found that I had not taken with me this morning my tabular Statement,
							the most important part of the Speech— I took it to the Intelligencer
							Office immediately after dinner, and found Seaton still there. I took
							back with me my Manuscript and the part of the Reporter’s Notes, still
							to be adjusted to it, and was engaged the whole evening in splicing them
							together but did not finish— I received an invitation from <persRef
								ref="forsyth-clara">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef> to a sociable party to-morrow evening.</p>

							necessary to establish the claim of the late <persRef

							called also at <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> Register
							Office— He had promised to publish the whole Speech; which I requested
							him to do in the Register of next Saturday—which he said he would or in
							a Supplement— I then went to the Capitol, and in the Congress Library
							spent a couple of hours in examining the Athenian Letters, by the
							brothers <persRef ref="yorke-philip;yorke-charles">Philip and Charles
								Yorke</persRef> and others in 1741— I found them so deeply

							atonement— They also take exception to a stranger’s leaving the Church
							between the Sermon, and the administration of the communion— So I
							thought best to leave it before the service began— I went to the
							Unitarian Church, where I found <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge
								Cranch</persRef>, in the seat under the pulpit reading prayers, and
							afterwards a Sermon from Romans 13.11.— [“]And that, knowing the time,
							that now it is high time to awake out of sleep”—without the remainder of
							the verse. As they have no regular Pastor, they have adopted the forms
							of prayer used at the Stone Chapel in Boston— Of which there were small
							pamphlets in the pews— The judge’s discourse was short and well written—
							He considered Sin, as the sleep of the Soul, and pursued the figure as
							far as it would go— <persRef ref="cranch-anna">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Cranch</persRef>, and <persRef ref="greenleaf-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Greenleaf</persRef> were
							there. I then went to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and
							revised the proof slips of five columns of my Speech of the evening of
							14. October— I have called it a Speech on Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs and
							Adverbs, with reference to one of <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng’s</persRef> rude interruptions, saying that he could not
							pass the Night in discussing Nouns and Pronouns, Verbs and Adverbs with
							the Gentleman from Massachusetts.— <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton</persRef> is afraid of this caption, and says he must insert
							a Note to say it is not of their invention, to which I readily agreed— I
							use it to draw attention to the Speech, the details of which are
							tediously dry, with a continual reference to figures.— I have hopes that
							the oddity of the title will excite curiosity to read; and that it will
							also draw public attention to the wretchedly loose manner in which the
							acts of Congress are drawn up.— This is one of the worst that ever
							appeared on the Statute Book— Seaton’s alarm however is not without
							foundation, and the experiment is hazardous— He said the remainder of
							the Speech was all in type; and the proof would be ready for my revisal,
							to-morrow at Noon— After dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church, and heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the
								24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and preach
							from Isaiah 11.2. “And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the
							spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
							spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord. 3 And shall make him
							of quick Understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge
							after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his
							ears.”— The text was long, but the discourse was short.— In the evening
							I spent <hi rend="italic">half</hi>
							<pb n="379" type="ms"/>half an hour at <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S.

						<p>Received a Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>;

							says he decided to send for <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi

								ref="adams-abigail4;adams-louisa3;adams-john17;adams-charles7">his
								family</persRef> into Boston—but having to go out to Quincy,
							Wednesday Evening to deliver a second Lecture at the Lyceum, he passed
							the Night at my house, and returned to Boston Thursday Morning.— His
							mother was then so much better that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Holbrook favoured the ïdea of her leaving home this day— It is
							remarkable that while the weather was so beautiful here the first half
							of the last week, Charles says it was so bad there, that the delay to
							the departure of my family was immaterial— The first part of my Speech
							of 14. October, was published in the National Intelligencer of this
							Morning— The proof for the remainder of the Speech to be printed
							to-morrow, was sent to me immediately after breakfast; and the Note
							appended to the Speech, about one P.M— The revisal occupied me, the
							whole morning, and I took the note as revised to the Intelligencer
							Office, where I saw <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef>— I had thought of
							bespeaking 50 copies of the Speech in pamphlet form; but doubting
							whether after all, it will excite much attention, and whether I do not
							greatly over estimate its interest to the very few readers of long
							speeches, I concluded only to bespeak 6 copies of the tri-weekly
							Intelligencer of to-morrow which will contain the whole— I passed an
							hour from the dusk of Evening at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S. Smith’s</persRef>.— He

						<p>The remainder of my Speech, upon Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs and Adverbs, (a
							perilous name) was published in the Daily National Intelligencer, and
							the whole Speech in the tri-weekly paper. It is by the care I have taken
							more correctly printed than I believe any production of mine, ever was
							before— I called at the Intelligencer Office and bespoke of <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef>
							half a dozen copies of the tri-weekly Paper, which I sent off by this
							Evening’s Mail.— Seaton mentioned to me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="king-john4">John P. King</persRef> a Senator from Georgia, who
							made the most powerful Speech against the Sub-treasury Bill that was
							delivered in the Senate, and whom they are now tearing to pieces in
							Georgia for apostasy to his party— Among the other ingenious devices to
							run him down, they have resorted to a forgery, a pretended marginal note
							upon the Intelligencer, containing his Speech, attributed to the Editors
							of the Intelligencer and saying that it was not the Speech delivered but
							softened down all the personalities against <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>; and charging it as
							cowardice in King, for which he was despised by the federalists— This is
							a party artifice, to decry the man, to counteract the force of the
							Speech— King has such a pack of hounds at his heels, for the most
							spirited and ablest speech of the Session, that he has announced his
							intention to resign his Seat in the Senate.— I called at <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> Register Office, but he was
							not there— One of his workmen told me however that they were at work
							upon my speech, for publication, in the next Saturday’s Register— I
							found at the Office a Boston daily Advertiser, containing Letters from a
								<persRef ref="atwill-winthrop">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Atwill</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="jackson-william2">William
								Jackson</persRef>, to <persRef ref="everett-edward">Governor Edward

							heretofore expressed upon Slavery; but he is explicit enough now, and
							will lose very few, if any votes this year for his anti-abolitionism— It
							will give him trouble hereafter— I received at the Franklin Insurance
							Office, a dividend of 506:80. eight per Cent, for the a last half-year,
							which I deposited in the Bank of Washington. I met <persRef

							<pb n="382" type="ms"/>accept a conditional engagement from me to

								<persRef ref="collamore-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anthony Collamore</persRef> of Pembroke, enclosing two to <persRef

							Seaton</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Key came in while I was

							Dorcas Allen and her children will be free, if they should be purchased
							from <persRef ref="birch-james">Birch</persRef>— By the Law of the

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Key said the Corporation of
							Washington were the only creditors of Davis, and it was not likely they
							would ever disturb the purchase from Birch— Seaton asked me for the
							manuscript of my Speech on the deposit postponement Bill—for early
							to-morrow morning— The day was absorbed by avocations— Afternoon visit
							from <persRef ref="whitcomb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James

							opinions, and he said he should wish to have further conversations with

						<p>I sent this morning, by a man who came from <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> the manuscript
							of <persRef ref="otis-james2">Otis’s</persRef> portion of my Speech on
							the deposit postponement Bill—which I had revised—and I added a
							preliminary advertisement, necessary to shew the state of the question
							when I spoke. In the morning I heard at the Presbyterian Church <persRef
								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from Psalm 103:13. “Like as a father pitieth his
							children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.”— The relation between
							God and man, likened to that between a father and his child is the most
							amiable aspect in which religion can be presented to the heart— It is
							not the most congenial to the calvinistic creed which rather exhibits
							God as an inexorable judge— But it is with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fowler as with other Presbyterian divines, whom I have
							known— The benevolence of his nature works at cross purposes with his
							doctrinal faith— He is a tender-hearted man, and appears delighted to
							expound any passage in Scripture which exhibits the Deity with parental
							affections towards mankind— <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> and her Son <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">Thomas</persRef> dined with us— I had called at
							the Intelligencer Office, and seen both Gales and <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>. I gave them the manuscript of
								<persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansberry</persRef> containing his
							report of the remainder of my Speech revised by myself, with a
							connecting paragraph between his report and that of Otis and a
							supplementary paragraph at the close— Stansberry’s report is very
							imperfect— He is a very good reporter when he intends to be so; but when
							I first came into the House, he was laying every member, who took part
							in the debates, and who would submit to the tax under contribution for
							reporting his Speeches; and he claimed the same tribute from me— I gave
							him some trifle, upon his allegation that it was a customary gratuity
							paid him by others; but after the first Congress in which I sat as a
							member of the House, I declined giving him any thing more.— Others did
							the same. But since that time he has very seldom reported <hi
								rend="italic">any</hi> speech of mine, and when he did, has never
							done me justice— At the late Session, Otis and he were joint <hi
								rend="italic">reporters</hi>
							<pb n="385" type="ms"/>reporters for the National Intelligencer, and
							relieved each other hour and hour— Otis took the first hour of my speech
							on the postponement Bill, and Stansberry the remainder— There was so
							much reference in it to figures and numbers, that perhaps no reporter
							could have taken it very correctly, but Stansberry’s portion of the work
							required more correction, than that of his Associate— Gales told me that
							the proof, of the whole Speech, would be ready for me, if I would call
							at the Office about noon to morrow, for publication on Tuesday. While I
							was there <persRef ref="featherstonhaugh-george">M<hi rend="superscript"

							read the service, for the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after

								Allen</persRef> were here this morning— He had not yet made up the
							subscription for the balance between 330 and 475 dollars— <persRef
								ref="smith-walter">General Walter Smith</persRef> of Georgetown
							having promised to endorse Allen’s note for the former sum, if he could
							procure the remainder to pay <persRef ref="birch-james">Birch</persRef>
							for a Bill of Sale of the woman and the <persRef ref="u;allen-maria">two

							Will, and that by the Will the woman and children were bequeathed to
								<persRef ref="orme-maria">Davis’s wife</persRef>, and therefore
								<persRef ref="orme-rezin">her second <hi rend="strikethrough"
									>wife</hi> husband</persRef> had an undoubted right to sell
							them— I told him that whenever the Bill of sale should be ready, I would
							give the check for 50 dollars which I had promised— He came again twice
							in the course of the day—once while I was out, and again after I
							returned— He then told me that Birch had again taken the two children,
							and put them into the jail; and would carry them away, if the money was
							not paid— That General Smith now said, if I would pay the fifty dollars,
							he would undertake with the other subscriptions, to pay the whole sum
							and take the bill of sale.— He repeated that General Smith was entirely
							satisfied with the validity of Birch’s title, and that he had the right
							to make the sale— I then gave him the check for 50 dollars in Bills
							payable in Bills at the Bank of Washington to Walter Smith Esq<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> or his order; and told him when the affair
							should be completed to bring me the Bill of sale that I may see it— I
							could pursue the question of Birch’s title no further, without becoming
							liable to the imputation of shrinking from my own promise, and
							prevaricating upon the performance of my engagement— Yet I still doubt
							the legality of the sale to Birch, and whether the complete emancipation
							of the woman and children will be effected— I could not take the course
							of the Law, for <persRef ref="key-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Key</persRef> told me that if upon a writ of Habeas
							Corpus Birch’s title <pb n="386" type="ms"/>title should be disproved,
							still as they were slaves they could not be discharged— Such is the
							condition of things in these shambles of human flesh, that I could not
							now expose this whole horrible transaction, but at the hazard of my
							life— Any attempt to set aside this purchase for illegality would be
							stigmatized as mean and <hi rend="italic">dishonourable</hi>— Iniquity
							must have its whole range— I therefore made the promise of 50 dollars,
							for their emancipation, and have now paid it, without even being sure of
							effecting it—rather than attempt, to bereave the man-robber of his
							spoils— I went to the Office of the National Intelligencer, saw <persRef

							of the vote passing to the third reading, the Bill to postpone the

							published to-morrow Morning, and will occupy not more than three Columns
							and an half of the paper. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton gave me

						<p>Rain all night and snow this morning, which was my signal for having a
							fire made again in my writing chamber— I have this Season, for health
							and for economy adopted a rule to keep that chamber as cool as I can
							bear it, and write without discomfort; that is without benumbed fingers;
							and have discontinued it, whenever the mildness of the weather or the
							warmth of the Sun made it unnecessary— I have omitted, which I ought not
							to have done to keep account of the number of days, upon which I have
							had fire kindled in it, but it does not exceed fourteen, and I therefore
							assume that the average time for making fire in <hi rend="italic"
								>this</hi> chamber is the first of November, and not before—and that
							its average continuance should be to the first of April—between those
							two days there will be very few if any days when fire can be spared— In
							the months of October and of April, fires must be occasional—about half
							the time; so as a general result the time necessary for keeping a fire
							in a chamber with a Southern exposure, in this Climate is from the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October to the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April—half the year.— But unless care
							is taken for the constant admission of the Sun it will be wanted at

							printed, and referred to a Committee for a report— But I enquired
							whether his objection extended to the traveling of the Mails on Sunday—
							He said <hi rend="italic">no</hi>—he considered that as desperate— But
							great licentiousness, particularly in the country towns and villages,
							resulted from allowing the Post-Offices on Sundays— They were the resort
							of idlers, intemperate and dissolute persons; and they held out an
							example too apt to be followed by mechanics, traders, tradesmen and
							shop-keepers, to keep their shops open and make the day a day of
							ordinary labour. I said I had not been aware of any Law requiring the
							Post-Offices to be kept always open <pb n="388" type="ms"/>open, and
							that in the town where I reside, it is not in fact open on Sundays— In
							the principal cities, the speedy conveyance and prompt receipt of their
							Letters was important to so many men of business, I supposed it would be
							impossible to alter the arrangements for despatching and distributing
							the Letters by the Mail; and for effecting any change whatever, I
							thought there would be little prospect of success, for any single
							Petitioner, or Memorialist. If he should conclude to present a Memorial,
							I could only promise him for myself, that I would vote, for its being

							oblivion— The Son and Grandson of <persRef
								ref="burr-aaron2;edwards-jonathan">two able and eminent calvinistic

							before he was three years old, and with them appears to have lost all

								<persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos Kendall</persRef>— But in his
							purposes of reform he assumed a principle which did by no means suit
							them, and that was removals should be made only for moral, or official
							misconduct, or open abuse of the Administration, and that it should be
							applied equally, to individuals of their own party, as well as to
							others— He offered to the club a resolution to that effect, to the
							Hickory Club, which he says was almost unanimously rejected. In his
							pamphlet already published, called a Chapter of Sketches on Finance D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Mayo has disclosed a curious history of
							the transactions of this Hickory Club; but of the whole pamphlet the
							most curious part is a Letter to President Jackson from himself,—under
							the secret of the Masonic cypher, dated 2 December 1830. containing a
							detailed account of <persRef ref="houston-samuel">Samuel
								Houston’s</persRef> conspiracy against Texas at that time— And D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayo shewed me this morning a confidential
							Letter from President Jackson, in his own hand-writing to <persRef
								ref="fulton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fulton</persRef>, then Secretary of the Territory of Arkansas, and now a
							Senator from that State, dated 10. December 1830. sternly denouncing
							this project against Texas, and instructing him by all the means in his
							power to defeat and break it up— These papers the D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> told me, were all returned to him, from
							President Jackson in 1836—at his own request—and among was he supposed
							by mistake this original Letter from Jackson—but whether it had ever
							been sent to Fulton he did not know, and doubted: but he referred to it
							as a demonstration of the duplicity of Jackson’s administration, with
							regard to the relations of the Country with Mexico and Texas— It is so,
							and proves that Jackson’s bold and dashing character was nevertheless
							capable of double-dealing, worthy of <persRef ref="ferdinandofaragon"

							<pb n="390" type="ms"/>or of <persRef ref="tiberius">Tiberius

							ingredients of that character— I told him I would take one of his books
							but from my peculiar position, could have no agency whatever in
							promoting its publication— He had another document, like which he said
							there were unfortunately too many. It was a record of testimony of 12 or

							During the first and long Session of which he was in very bad

								Kingsbury</persRef> came, and took back his draught of a memorial to
							Congress— It prays for the repeal of a part of one section of the
							Post-Office Law, enacted in 1810 and again in 1825. which requires that
							the Post-Offices should be kept open for the delivery of Letters every
							day of the week— His argument is that this commands labour on the
							Sabbath, in direct contradiction to the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Commandment, and to the institution of the Christian Sabbath.— The
							memorial is long and well written, and strongly reasoned. He assumes
							that the People of the United States are a Christian People by
							profession and therefore bound by the Laws of Christianity which forbid
							labour on the Sabbath— And gives in proof the frequent instances of
							proclamations by the Revolutionary Congress for fast days, and days of
							Thanksgiving. It alleges also the moral influences of a strict
							observance of the Sabbath, and the licentiousness encouraged and
							promoted by the disregard of it, thus sanctioned by the authority of the
							Law— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kingsbury that I was myself
							an observer of the Sabbath, and in the general practice of attending on
							public worship, twice every Sunday— But I thought there might be some
							question, as to the accuracy of his definition of the term labour— It
							might be denied that the mere keeping of the Post-Office open, and
							delivery of Letters on Sunday was <hi rend="italic">labour</hi>— I said
							he was aware that in antient days, as well as among different
							denominations of Christians in modern ages there had been great
							diversities and oppositions of opinion and practice with regard to this
							commandment and its application— I cited the case of the massacre of the
							Jewish army mentioned in the book of the Maccabees because they held it
							unlawful to fight on the Sabbath-day <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
							<pb n="393" type="ms"/>and their decree that thenceforward they would
							fight in battle, if attacked, on the Sabbath, (1 Macabees 2.41) I cited
							also the saying of Jesus Christ, when he was reproached, because his
							disciples plucked the grain—that the Sabbath was made for man, and not
							Man for the Sabbath— And his reference to the case of <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef>, who had taken the shew bread, which it
							was lawful only for the Priests to eat— I spoke also of the Roman
							Catholic understanding which devotes to recreation amusements and Sports
							all the portions of this day except those devoted to public worship— And
							I added that in my own opinion I could hardly consider the mere keeping
							open of the post-office, and the delivery of Letters as labour forbidden
							by the Law of the Sabbath—Jewish or Christian— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Kingsbury took these observations kindly without being
							satisfied by them— I told him that if he chose to have his memorial
							presented I would give him every aid in my power to have it printed and
							referred to a Committee; but doubted whether the house would treat it so
							kindly— I advised him to have it presented in fair copies to both to the
							House and to the Senate— That to the House, by the Member from his own
							District, of Cleveland, who he said was <persRef ref="allen-john3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John W. Allen</persRef>— And I advised
							him to suggest to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen to move the
							reference of the memorial to the Post-Office, or the judiciary
							Committee—rather to the latter, if he could ascertain that <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef>
							the Chairman was favourable to the object— I walked round the Capitol
							for exercise, before dinner— <persRef

						<p>There was a riotous assemblage of people, perhaps 300 in number with a
							Cannon, who went round last Night to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President’s</persRef> House, and the House of some of the Heads of
							Departments, discharged their cannon, and made much disturbance, in
							celebration of the whig victories in the late elections; especially in
							the State of New-York— I heard little of it myself, though it once
							awaked me out of sleep; and I knew not what it was— This effervescence
							of popular feeling is too common, and too little discountenanced by any
							of the predominating parties—both of them use the populace to glorify
							their triumphs and to depress their enemies; and both of them suffer for
							it in turn— The most atrocious case of mob rioting whichever disgraced
							this Country happened on the Night of the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this Month at Alton in the State of Illinois, where a
							man by the name of <persRef ref="lovejoy-elijah">Lovejoy</persRef>, one
							of the leading abolitionists of the time has been striving to establish
							a Newspaper— Three times he had imported printing presses in the place;
							and three times they had been destroyed by mobs, and once or twice, the
							Offices in which they were placed— The fourth time, the press was
							imported, and deposited in a Merchant’s warehouse— The mob assembled in
							the Night; surrounded the warehouse, and demanded that the press should
							be delivered up to them. It was refused— They assailed the house with
							musquetry—forced their way into it; set fire to the roof of the
							building; shot Lovejoy dead—wounded several others, till the press was
							delivered up to them, which they broke to pieces and threw into the
							river— One of the assailants also by the name of <persRef
								ref="bishop-lyman">Bishop</persRef> was also killed in the affray—
							This Lovejoy wrote me a Letter last January, which I answered in April—
							He was a man of strong religious, consciencious feeling, deeply
							indignant at what he deemed the vices and crimes of the age— Such men
							are often fated to be martyrs, and he has fallen a martyr to the <hi
								rend="italic">cause</hi>
							<pb n="394" type="ms"/>cause of human freedom— I went and sat again to
								<persRef ref="towle-eunice">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Towle</persRef> for my portrait. <persRef ref="towle-nathaniel">Her

							Department building— Saw <persRef ref="smith-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> S. H. Smith</persRef> also at his
							house, and he spoke to me about the whig Charivari, of last Night— The
							Summer which for the last week had returned closed this evening, with a
							distant lightening cloud and a miniature hurricane— I answered a Letter
							from <persRef ref="shurtleff-roswell">R. Shurtliff</persRef>—inviting me
							in the name of two united Literary Societies at Dartmouth College,
							Hanover, New-Hampshire, to deliver an Address before them, the day
							before their next commencement—which I decline—and a Letter from
								<persRef ref="gregory-sherlock">S. S. Gregory</persRef> at Sand

								>Governor Edward Everett’s</persRef> Address to the Massachusetts

							all his occasional discourses are— There is annexed to it a hymn by
								<persRef ref="pierpont-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pierpont</persRef>, scarcely less beautiful— The radical idea both

						<p>The change of climate by the sweeping gale of last Evening, which
							continued furious through the Night, and brought a clear sky and
							Northwestern frost this morning was very great— It was the transition
							from Summer to Winter in twelve hours— But the Sun kept my chamber warm,
							and I needed no fire in it till the Evening, and then had one for not
							more than half an hour.— I consumed much of the morning in reading
								<persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Preston’s</persRef> Speech in the Senate, on the Sub-treasury, or
							divorce of Bank and State Bill—a strong, solid, argumentative speech;
							brilliant with imagery, and not overcharged with ornament— Scrupulously
							respectful to his Colleague <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef>, and yet exposing in a clear light his Phaetontic
							course— There is an involuntary train of reasoning running through it in
							favour of a Bank of the United States, without the moral courage to avow
							the conclusion to which it tends—a complacency to the State Banks, ill
							deserved by them, and the radical weakness of the Speech— A capillary
							tube of nullification scarcely perceptible, but imparting poison to all
							the wholesome waters of the stream. It is one of those Speeches, of
							which multitudes are delivered almost every day in both Houses of
							Congress— Full of Eloquence—dazzling with beauty, sparkling with
							Wit—radiant with sentiment, beaming with philosophy, and yet radically
							defective in the basement story of moral principle— Ardent Patriotism,
							generous feeling, benevolent sentiment, elegant language, literature,
							courtesy, all the charms of eloquence are here, but the foundation of
							all wisdom, moral principle is wanting. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Preston approves and applauds the suspension of Specie payments by the
							Banks, an act of flagrant immorality <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
							<pb n="395" type="ms"/>in itself—perhaps excusable from necessity, but
							even then only so far as that necessity is not imputable to themselves.
							The suspension of Specie payments is a breach of faith—a general
							violation of promises, and a dissolution of the right of property, the
							foundation of human Society. A little leaven leveaneth the whole lump. I
							walked round the Capitol before dinner, and resumed the biographical
							sketch. The <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">two
								children</persRef> dined at their aunt <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">Smith’s</persRef>— In the evening I
							read two or three chapters in <persRef ref="davis-matthew">M. L.
								Davis’s</persRef> Memoirs of the Life of <persRef ref="burr-aaron"
								>Aaron Burr</persRef>. There is something romantic in his Canada
							campaign with <persRef ref="arnold-benedict">Arnold</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="montgomery-richard">Montgomery</persRef>— He seems to
							have had a passion for high adventure; an inflexible will, and
							invincible perseverance in pursuing it; but no judgment in adapting his
							means to his ends; and a capricious levity in passing from an object
							obtained to one unattainable— Ambition of military fame. Ambition of
							conquest over female virtue was the duplicate ruling passion of his
							life— His headstrong obstinacy in going with Arnold to Canada, might
							have been admirable if dictated by pure and devoted patriotism, but the

						<p>The cold weather continues, and a few flakes of snow floating in the
							atmosphere, heralded a storm which passed away for this time. We had
							declined the invitation to dine with <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President Van Buren</persRef>, and excepting my daily walk before
							dinner round the Capitol, I passed the remainder of the day and Evening
							at home— Morning visit from <persRef ref="hulme-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hulme</persRef> of Philadelphia, who
							had heretofore ha with me some communications on the subject of
							Astrology— Of these he said nothing now— But he was not satisfied with
							the whig victories at New-York, and thought they portended no
							improvement in the condition of the country— He said there was now a
							large excess of importations over the exportations, and that large
							orders had been sent to Europe for the importation of grain— I fear
							there is too much foundation of fact for these opinions—and that there
							will be no resumption of Specie payments by the banks, so long as there
							is any importation of grain— Two operations I believe are indispensable
							for the restoration of credit— 1. A great reduction of Bank paper. 2. A
							Bank of the United States— The reduction of Bank paper has not been
							attempted, in any place where the Banks have been allowed to continue
							making dividends— In New-York, where they are prohibited the Banks have
							largely reduced their liabilities, and are anxious to resume Specie
							payments— Hulme who is a native of England told me that he had observed
							to a warm whig in Philadelphia, that he believed nothing but a
							non-importation act would restore prosperity to the Country; to which
							the whig answered that the only non-<hi rend="italic">importation</hi>
							<pb n="396" type="ms"/>importation act that was needed was of men.—
							Returning from my walk I met <persRef ref="mayo-robert">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayo</persRef>, who told me that he
							had been to Baltimore, and seen <persRef ref="lucas-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lucas</persRef> the printer who had
							immediately agreed to print his book of six years residence at
							Washington; and that it would be forthwith printed— I received a
							petition dated the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October, signed
							by 36 women at a place called Juliet, Will County, in the State of
							Illinois, near the spot where <persRef ref="lovejoy-elijah">E. P.
								Lovejoy</persRef> a few days after was murdered. It prays for the
							abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade in the District of Columbia. I
							read this Evening a few chapters in the Memoirs of <persRef
								ref="burr-aaron">Aaron Burr</persRef>— There is an account of his
							saving <persRef ref="silliman-gold">Silliman’s</persRef> brigade in the
							retreat from Long-Island in 1776. which affects very seriously the
							reputation of <persRef ref="knox-henry2">General Knox</persRef>—and who
							is there living to defend him? It is very difficult to tell what is
							history in the details of our revolutionary War—but so it is of many of
							the events passing before us— In the controversy which arose from the
							battle of Monmouth, Burr, took the side of <persRef ref="lee-charles"
								>Lee</persRef>, and he was of the party of Lee and <persRef
								ref="gates-horatio">Gates</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>— When appointed
							Lieutenant Colonel of <persRef ref="malcolm-william">Malcolm’s</persRef>
							Regiment, he wrote an impertinent Letter to General Washington accepting
							the appointment, but complaining that others his juniors had been
							promoted before him— He suffered so much in his health in consequence of
							the excessive heat and fatigue at and after the battle of Monmouth, that
							he asked for a furlough to be without pay—but not to lose his rank—
							Washington granted the furlough but declined to withdraw his pay— He
							preferred to remain in active service; and was stationed at West-Point,
							for the superinspection of the neutral ground. His accounts of the
							scouting parties are scarcely credible— This part of his Life however is
							very interesting—</p>

						<p><date>25— VI. </date>Saturday. </p>
						<p>The morning was so cold that I could not write— I betook myself to
							reading <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass’s</persRef> Discourse
							delivered before the American Historical Society on the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1836— The Society was formed
							on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October 1835. as the
							anniversary of the discovery of Guanahani—S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Salvedor—Cat-Island, and the Western Hemisphere by <persRef
								ref="columbus-christopher">Columbus</persRef>—but they make no
							allowance for the change of the Calendar.— The objects of the Society
							declared in the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Article of its
							Constitution are “to discover, procure and preserve whatever may relate
							to the Natural, Civil, Literary and Ecclesiastical History of America in
							general, and of the United States in particular[”]— This introductory
							Discourse was delivered by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass, then
							Secretary of War, and President of the Society—a second and similar
							Discourse was delivered at the second annual meeting of the Society, on
							the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January last by <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Levi Woodbury</persRef>; then and now Secretary
							of the Treasury— They are both works of very considerable, though
							unequal merit, and although the latter has been very severely
							criticized.— I have been invited and very earnestly urged to deliver the
							next anniversary Discourse, and have declined, from a thorough
							conviction that I have not time to prepare such a one, as I should be
							willing to commit to the public ear <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
							<pb n="397" type="ms"/>and eye— But the purpose of this Society is good—
							These anniversary Discourses if properly composed may be made eminently
							useful— They tend to the improvement of the public mind— If I can
							contribute but one mite to that intellectual banquet which this
							Institution tenders annually to the fathers of the Land, here assembled,
							I ought not to withhold it— I have therefore an earnest desire to
							deliver this Discourse, and have promised, if the Society will provide
							themselves with another Orator for the next anniversary Meeting, I will
							use every exertion in my power to be prepared with a Discourse for that
							of the succeeding year— I come to this determination with trembling
							hope— I have little confidence in my own powers for this species of
							Composition; and the two preceding discourses, especially the first, are
							of an order, to fall beneath which would be not only inexpressibly
							mortifying, but would injure the cause, which I have it nearest my heart
							to promote— In coming to the determination to undertake the task, my
							first object was to examine critically what has been said by my
							predecessors, and for that purpose, I read this morning the Discourse of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass— I must read and analyse it
							again—but in looking over my papers this morning, I found a fragment of
							an Essay which I wrote fourteen or fifteen years ago, and left almost in
							embryo, which will serve for a basis of my proposed Discourse— I gave
								<persRef ref="towle-eunice">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Towle</persRef> another sitting this morning, and she said she would
							ask only for one more, which I promised for next Wednesday. <persRef
								ref="kent-joseph">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Kent</persRef>, some time Governor of Maryland, and but now a
							Senator of the United States, one of the salt of the Earth, was killed
							yesterday, by a fall from his Horse, riding on his farm about 7. miles
							from this City— He was one of the best and most amiable of men— A man
							met me in the Street and stop’d me to say that he must have fallen in a
							fit of apoplexy; for that he was seen to fall, when his horse was going
							in a quiet and moderate pace. My eldest granddaughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> was unwell this day so that
							the reading of the <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">children</persRef> to
							me in the Bible was again interrupted— In the Evening I read further in
							the Memoirs of <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Aaron Burr</persRef>, to the
							time when he was compelled by ill health to resign his Commission in the
							army 10. March 1779. He appears to have been a very good partizan
							Officer—but there are several Letters and Certificates in his favour
							addressed to <persRef ref="morris-richard">Commodore Valentine
								Morris</persRef> in 1814. of the most extravagant character— That of
								<persRef ref="platt-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Richard Platt</persRef>, says that many people and he among the rest
							believed that Burr had supernatural sources of information.— The
							marvellous kills the probable.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef> continues unwell— I took
								<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> with me this morning
							to the Presbyterian church where <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> preached from 2.
							Corinthians 2.15. [“]For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in
							them that are saved, and in them that perish— 16. To the one we are the
							savour of Death unto Death; and to the other the savour of life unto
							life— And who is sufficient for these things.” The last clause was
							omitted from the text.— The thought is one of the difficulties of
								<persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul’s</persRef>
							writings— A sweet savour of Christ in them that perish—a sweet savour of
							Death unto Death, needs explanation to convey the thought. But the
							meaning seems to be that the Gospel Ministry when unsuccessful becomes
							itself <pb n="398" type="ms"/>itself an instrument of destruction— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler preached with great earnestness,
							and made warm appeals to the impenitent of his congregation— That man is
							a vicious, wicked animal, is the fundamental doctrine of the Christian
							religion— That he cannot save himself from eternal punishment is the
							doctrine of the Catholic churches and of <persRef ref="calvin-john"
								>Calvin</persRef>.— If he cannot save himself he is not a
							responsible being— That is the conclusion of Justice—and a conclusion
							from which I could not escape if I would— The Mission of Christ was to
							teach all mankind the way to Salvation— His death, an ignominious death,
							was necessary to the universal spread of his doctrine— He died for
							mankind as Curtius died for his Country— As <persRef ref="codrus"
								>Codrus</persRef> died for his people— In this sense I can believe
							the doctrine of the atonement and in no other—Christ died as a man—not
							as God; and although his death was attended with peculiar circumstances
							of horror, it was after all but death, which the Stoic of Greece and
							Rome denied to be an evil, and which the Indian Savage inflicts and
							defies with equal indifference. In the same sense the Christian doctrine
							may be a savour of death unto death unto them that perish; but death is
							only the termination of existence upon earth, and what the apostle means
							by perishing is still undefined— After dinner I attended at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church alone— A stranger preached,
							and there were two young Ladies, strangers, in my pew— The service was
							for the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and the
							text was from 2. Kings 7.3. And there were four leprous men, at the
							entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here
							until we die? 4. If we say, we will enter into the City, then the famine
							is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here we die
							also— Here the text stop’d— The remainder of the verse is— Now therefore
							come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians; if they save us
							alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.— The whole
							of the two verses would not have suited the doctrine of the preacher,
							which was that Christians should apply to themselves the reasoning of
							the four lepers, and instead of sitting still until they die resort to
							the truths of the gospel for their salvation— The Sermon was well
							written; and with the exception of some flourishes of elegant
							gesticulation, well delivered— I had a visit from a <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hammon</persRef> of New-Bedford;
							merely from curiosity. The <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-louisa-catherine">Ladies</persRef> with Fanny
							went to <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye’s</persRef>, where their Son <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas
								B. J. Frye</persRef> is laid up with a swelling of the arm,
							threatening an abscess.— In the Evening I read further in the Memoirs of
								<persRef ref="burr-aaron">Aaron Burr</persRef>, from the time of his
							leaving the army untill his marriage with <persRef ref="burr-theodosia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Theodosia Prevost</persRef> in
							April 1832— In the interval he studied Law— <persRef ref="davis-matthew"
								>Davis</persRef> says from 16 to 20 hours a day, which is a thumper—
							Was admitted to the bar, and commenced the practice at Albany. There is
							very little narrative, and nothing of much interest in the
							correspondence— Letters from <persRef ref="paterson-william">William
								Patterson</persRef>, <persRef ref="troup-robert2">Robert
								Troup</persRef>, <persRef ref="colt-peter">Peter Colt</persRef>, and
							some others— Those of Troup, pourtraying his own distresses from poverty
							are the most affecting— The love-Letters between Burr and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Prevost are mawkish— Hers are upon the
							whole the best—</p>

						<p>Disqualifying cold in the morning— I read <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury’s</persRef> Discourse
							before the American Historical Society— Much inferior to that of
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cass</persRef>— A very common-place panegyric upon our National
							Literary character: dressed up in new phrases, obscure almost
							throughout— Thoughts that would be bold if they dared, but always hedged
							in by qualifications and after thoughts, forming a style so complex that
							no one can understand it— The most remarkable example of it is in the
							passage where arguments are urged against the abolition of Slavery. They
							are muffled up in so many folds that it is scarce possible to make out
							what it means. Yet there are a multitude of small thoughts, strung
							together upon a coarse and vulgar string so as to make a show not with
							out brilliancy— He works with infinite labour to show why we are not so
							eminent in literary composition as the Englishmen of the other
							hemisphere—and finishes by giving no good reason at all— Old <persRef
								ref="carusi-gaetano">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carusi</persRef>
							came, and asked me for a Letter of recommendation to <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>,
							Secretary of State— I asked him what he wanted it for— He told me that
							he wanted it to obtain the appointment of Consul of the United States at
							Naples— Carusi is himself a Neapolitan by birth, between 60 and 70 years
							of age, when <persRef ref="morris-richard">Captain R. V.
								Morris</persRef> of our Navy, brought home with him, as one of a
							band of Music, from a Mediterranean Cruise— He settled here and has
							brought up a large family of children, and acquired an affluent Estate.
							He said <persRef ref="hammett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hammett</persRef>, who has been many years Consul at Naples was
							dead; and that he himself had claims to inheritance of property in that
							Country, which required his presence to make them effective— There was
							to be sure no salary attached to the Office, but it would give him the
							means of asserting his rights with more efficiency— I said to him that
							he knew M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth as well as he knew me—
							That my recommendation would rather disserve than serve him, and that I
							was not upon terms with the administration to recommend to them any one
							for public office— I had a further reason for refusing which I did not
							communicate to him. Which was that without knowing any special fact
							against him, I hear no very good report of his character— I walked round
							the Capitol before dinner; and stop’d at <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Force’s</persRef> office to enquire if
							he had <persRef ref="adair-james">Adair’s</persRef> History of the North

							answered a Letter from my Co-Executors of <persRef ref="boylston-ward"

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alicia Boylston</persRef>, and

							November, on the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring and C<hi

							to his sister Mary and for a certificate of Stock in the Bank of

							returned the day before yesterday, from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							her, and left it with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye— I called at

							was there. At <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> Register

							published in the Register’s Office they should be— He told me also of a
							recent Letter of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef>
							upon the sub-treasury scheme, but could not find it— There is one from
								<persRef ref="cheves-langdon">Langdon Cheves</persRef> in the

								>Reuben’s</persRef> Letters to Martin Van Buren, and my two Speeches
							on the Mississippi election— At <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi

								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cass’s</persRef> Discourse gave me the first idea that I had of its
							existence— Force himself a Printer by trade, is one of the most
							indefatigable antiquarians in the world. He is now Mayor of the City of

							his acquaintance so assiduously as I ought to have done— I answered a
							Letter yesterday received from <persRef ref="gilmor-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Gilmor</persRef> of Baltimore,
							and it consumed the leisure of the day— It was <hi rend="italic">on</hi>

							at Baltimore, commemorating his appointment as Commander in Chief of the

							Whitcomb’s project of obtaining for him the office of Collector of the
							Customs at Boston. Lincoln is very anxious to get the Office, but says
							he is an opponent of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">present
								administration</persRef>, and that he can make no compromise of the
							freedom of his opinions— He says he has always been a warm and steady
							friend to me through good report and evil report—and seems inclined to
							write to me on the subject— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitcomb
							enquired if he might answer that this would be agreeable to me— I said
							certainly. He might assure M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln of my
							personal respect and regard; and of my willingness to render him any
							service in my power— But it would be fitting he should know that there
							was not perhaps in either house of Congress a member more opposed—not
							only to the administration, but to all its present measures; not only to
							the President of the United States, but in a special manner to the
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							and his management of the revenue and finances— I had felt it my duty to
							assail them openly, unequivocally and without reserve, in two Speeches
							at the late Session of Congress; both of which had been published— It
							was therefore obvious that in the first place I could not with propriety
							or self-respect ask any favour of the present Administration, and
							especially of the Secretary of the Treasury and secondly if I should
							recommend any person to him for an office, that my recommendation would
							operate as an effectual exclusion of the candidate whom I should favour—
							It was known that during the whole of the last Administration I had not
							been upon speaking terms with the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>— Though I had served him more than any other
							living man ever did—and though I supported his administration, at the
							hazard of my own political destruction, and effected for him at a moment
								<hi rend="italic">when</hi>
							<pb n="402" type="ms"/>when his own friends were deserting him, what no
							other member of Congress ever accomplished for him, an unanimous vote of
							the House of Representatives to support him in his quarrel with
							France—though I supported him in other very critical periods of his
							administration, my return from him was, insult, indignity and Slander.—
							It was not so between me and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren.
							My relations with him had never been unfriendly; and now I occasionally
							visited him— But his leading friends in the House of Representatives
							sided against me in the deadly onset upon me last Winter from the South;
							and I had in vain tendered the Olive branch to him and them at the late
							Session, by the office to vote for the measures of relief to the
							administration if they would give a pledge for the payment of the fourth
							instalment of the deposits on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							January 1839. by appropriating the money for it— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Whitcomb said he believed there must and would be soon a
							change in the policy of the administration; though he did hear that
							there had been since the close of the late Session, and still continued
							an active correspondence between <persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C.
								Calhoun</persRef> and President Van Buren— He said he had taken the
							Liberty to say, and to write to <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickerson</persRef>, the only member
							of the Cabinet with whom he had a personal acquaintance, that unless the
							Administration should give more countenance to the old republican party
							in Massachusetts, they would lose all their friends there— However that
							may be, there is not a symptom of a change in the policy of the
							administration— I gave the last sitting to <persRef ref="towle-eunice"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Towle</persRef> for my
							Portrait, which she has not yet quite finished— A strong but not a
							pleasing likeness— Call at the National Intelligencer Office.— <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>
							gave me for perusal the manuscript of the Speech of <persRef
								ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxed Loomis</persRef> on the Mississippi
							election— <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. P.
								Todd</persRef>
							<persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> son came this afternoon, and left with me a
							collection of Manuscript Letters from the late <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>
							upon Constitutional questions— I have taken from the Congress Library
							and am looking into <persRef ref="mcculloch-john">M’Culloch’s</persRef>
							Edition of <persRef ref="smith-adam">Smith’s</persRef> Wealth of
							Nations—and this evening I continued reading the Memoirs of <persRef
								ref="burr-aaron">A. Burr</persRef>—till the time of the death of
								<persRef ref="burr-theodosia">his wife</persRef> 31. March 1794.— A
							few of her Letters are given— But none that discover much character— His
							correspondence with <persRef ref="alston-theodosia">his
								daughter</persRef> begins in the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							year of her age, and the Letters from him are frequent— He was extremely
							anxious about her education, and had her taught Greek, Latin—French,
							Music, and dancing, and arithmetic and elegant manners, but no religion
							or morals— She reads <persRef ref="lucian">Lucian</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="homer">Homer</persRef> and <persRef ref="terence"
								>Terence</persRef>, but not the Bible.</p>

						<p>I am endeavouring to finish the biographical sketch of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef> for my father but my subject
							swells as I proceed, and here is the Session of Congress again close at
							hand. <persRef ref="cherry-gw">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W.
								Cherry</persRef> was here again this morning, and I had a long
							conversation with him upon his project of Colonization— He is one of the
							most <hi rend="italic">benevolent</hi>
							<pb n="403" type="ms"/>benevolent visionaries, of that fraudulent
							charitable institution the Colonization Society— His plan is to raise a
							fund for purchasing a number of Slaves, and locating them in small
							villages where they may in a given time purchase their freedom by their
							own labour— I freely gave my opinion to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cherry that the whole colonization project was an abortion— That as a
							system of eventual emancipation of the Slaves of this Country, it was
							not only impracticable, but demonstrated to be so— That as a scheme for
							relieving the Slave States of free Negroes, its moral aspect was not
							comely, and it was equally impracticable. I held this opinion when the
							existence of the Colonization Society was first made known to me in
							September 1817. every day’s experience had confirmed me in it, from that
							time to this— I have never taken any part against the colonization
							Society— But I never joined it—never attended any of its meetings, and
							never believed in its usefulness— I observed that by the very last
							accounts published by the Society itself, it appeared that even now,
							after twenty years of continual migration to the settlements it appeared
							they were starving for want of bread; with a fertile soil, and a
							Latitude close upon the equator— And the cause assigned of it is that
							the colonists waste their time in idleness and will not work— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cherry had little to say in reply to this,
							but he took my remarks in kindness, and thanked me for the attention
							that I had given to his plan in the African Repository, which I returned
							to him.— I called at the Department of State and enquired of <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>,
							if there was upon its files a Letter from <persRef ref="austin-moses"
								>Moses Austin</persRef> the first settler from the United States in
							Texas to me, written between 1819 and 1822— He said he would have search
							made, and let me know— I spoke of the note received from him last
							Monday, and of my answer. He said that in the correspondence with the
							Mexican Government, concerning the improper publication of <persRef
								ref="gorostiza-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gorostiza</persRef>, they had alleged that the American
							Commissioners at Ghent, had made some such publication— He thought it
							was in consequence of something said in debate by <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> at
							the late Session of Congress— I called at the Treasury Department, but
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodbury</persRef> was with the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef>— At the Congress Library and took out the trial
							of <persRef ref="preston-thomas">Captain Preston</persRef> and the
							Soldiers for the Boston Massacre of 5. March 1770. Towards Evening I
							visited <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben;smith-catherine-johnson"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef>, and afterwards finished reading
							the first Volume of the Memoir of <persRef ref="burr-aaron"
								>Burr</persRef>— It brings him down to the Marriage of <persRef
								ref="alston-theodosia">his daughter</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="alston-joseph">Joseph Alston</persRef> of South-Carolina in
							1801—and to that singularly contested election of that year between
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef> and him—
							That is told in the second Volume.</p>
