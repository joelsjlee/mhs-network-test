                            5.28. “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming in the which all that
                            are in the graves shall hear his voice, 29 and shall come forth; they
                            that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have
                            done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” A solemn, awful and
                            cheering text— All the hopes and all the fears of the human race are
                            included in it— The promise and the menace of a future life are there.
                            The hour is coming— The literal import of the words would seem to be
                            that there should be one hour of general resurrection and judgment for
                            all the dead—and that this shall not be till the earth itself shall be
                            destroyed, and the human race extinguished— Other <hi rend="italic"

                            Observe also that the salvation and the damnation, are both to be
                            wrought not by Faith, but by works— The reward is for them that have <hi

                            evil— It is not faith in creeds, but righteous action that constitutes
                            the claim to the resurrection of life— This is a copious theme— <persRef

                            grave import— Schley demands that two citizens of Maine should be

                            Dunlap answers that he is no abolitionist, and will carry into full
                            effect the Constitutional provision for the restitution of fugitive
                            Slaves— But that the case is not made out, for surrendering citizens of
                            Maine. Schley replies—insists that the case is made out, and threatens
                            War— I was occupied part of the Evening, in comparing the Statements in
                            the Treasury Documents, of the amounts of deposits due to the States;
                            and of actual deposits in the Western Banks.</p>

                            many were this day presented, but none by me— <persRef

                            received by the Speaker and I gave my reasons for proposing it; which
                            were chiefly the wasteful expenditure of public monies by an extra
                            Session, unnecessary, and solely for the personal accommodation of the

                            said the Petition had been received, and communicated to the inculpated

                            charges.— They denied the neglect; but said nothing of the alleged

                            Committee— He answered it would be strange if some of them had not been

                            admission that none of the Petitions, had been read—and then commented

                            and the reference of which to the Committee was the only right upon

                            answer me— I said I would, if he would renew the motion after finishing
                            his Speech— This he said he would not do— I then withdrew my motion
                            unconditionally—and he replied— Bitterly enough, and boastful of his own

                            become due.— Not in order— R. B. Rhett’s amendment was then rejected— A

                            to fix their compensations.— <persRef ref="dawson-william"
                                >Dawson</persRef> moved to restrict the number of additional clerks
                            to four, and their Salaries not to exceed 1200 a year, which Cambreleng
                            accepted— <persRef ref="rives-francis">Rives</persRef> of Virginia moved
                            an Amendment that Treasury Notes should be without interest—this, after
                            some discussion was rejected 56 to 91. <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
                                >Underwood</persRef> moved as a substitute for the Bill, one

                            rejected 80 to 91— So was Dunn’s amendment, without acount— <persRef

                            adjusting the Balances due by the late deposit Banks—rejected 78 to 96—
                            Wise said he would take a Woodpecker’s tap, at this hollow beech tree;
                            and moved as an amendment a differently modified, and much better
                            Bill—he supported it by one of the best Speeches that he ever made, but
                            it was rejected— Sundry other amendments were moved and rejected, all
                            but one, by Cambreleng to exclude the Bank of the United States, from
                            the power of paying their debt in the Treasury Notes, which was adopted—
                            The Committee finally rose and reported the Bill to the House— Adjourned

                        <p>I find it very difficult to reach the House before the <persRef

                            precisely at ten O’Clock— The prayer of the <persRef

                            minutes—the reading of the Journal seldom takes more than three, and by
                            five minutes after ten the Speaker plunges into the business of the
                            day.— While Petitions were received every morning, and I had multitudes
                            of them to present, a necessity was imposed upon me to be there at the
                            stroke of the Clock, and I was there. Since the expiration of the 30
                            days, leaving only one day in the week for the receipt of Petitions, my
                            punctuality has almost insensibly to myself fallen off, and this morning
                            I found <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef>, Chairman of the
                            judiciary Committee, moving that the Committee of the whole should be
                            discharged from the Bill to continue the expiring Laws, that it might be
                            taken up, and passed in the House, which was done— <persRef
                                ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> presented a petition from 37 Ladies
                            and Gentlemen of Halifax County Virginia, praying Congress to furnish

                            relating to slavery, thereby giving a direction to their minds
                            calculated to make them good matrons, and averting the evils with which
                            the fanaticism of the Eastern States threaten the people of the South.—
                            It was received and laid on the table— I propose to notice it hereafter—
                            Wise’s Resolution of enquiry into the causes, conduct and cost of the

                            objected to giving the Committee power to send persons and papers, and

                            read two Letters which he had received, exposing and naming the parties
                            to an enormous fraud— Howard made a pretty classical allusion to the
                            subterraneous and re-appearing fountain Arethusa— Glascock frothed out a
                            panegyric upon <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>,
                            especially for his veto upon the recharter of the Bank— <persRef
                                ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> called for the
                            orders of the day— I wanted to turn the edge of Howard’s classical
                            weapon against himself, which I could not do if the debate should go
                            over till to-morrow— I asked Cambreleng to withdraw his call for the
                            orders for a few minutes— He refused. Calls from all quarters of the
                            House urged me to “go on”— I took a vote of the House, which 92 to 84.
                            gave me the floor— After thanking the House for their permission to
                            address them, I complimented Howard upon his allusion to the river
                            Arethusa; the reappearance of which I said I hailed with joy—but that I
                            nought say with the <persRef ref="virgil">Roman Poet</persRef></p>

                                type="ms"/>I then in a speech of about 20 minutes, exposed the
                            unfitness of the Military Committee, with reference to party divisions,
                            and to sectional interests for this investigation; and urged also the
                            necessity of an appointment of the Committee by ballot— Cambreleng
                            called again for the orders of the day. The Speaker laid before the

                            Menefee’s Speech struck me, as the strongest that has been made on this

                            in the Executive Document 154 of the last Session, and saw that they
                            proved, the necessity of a Congressional investigation of the whole
                            subject— I called at the office of the Commissioner of Pensions, with
                            Letters from <persRef ref="collamore-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            the Journal I asked and obtained leave to make an explanation— Then
                            referring to the enquiry which I had made yesterday, whether any Message
                            had ever been received from the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">late
                                President</persRef>, upon the reference to him of the investigation

                            no answer was given, I said I had been afterwards informed that there
                            had been a Message from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
                                >President</persRef> to the House on the subject communicated at the

                            which I had never seen— That I had now seen and partly read it, and it
                            had convinced me more than ever of the necessity of a thorough
                            Congressional investigation <hi rend="italic">of</hi>

                            was then taken up, and there was sparring between him and <persRef
                                ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef>, Chairman of the Military
                            Committee who replied to my Speech of yesterday, and endeavoured to
                            justify the composition of the Military Committee, and the practice of
                            the Speaker in the appointment of all Committees. M’Kay is a very
                            sensible, well meaning, timid man, forever struggling between an anxious
                            desire to correct abuses, and a shivering terror of being cast off by
                            his party— He wants the reputation at once of a stern reformer of
                            abuses, and a stubborn adherent to the democracy, and the
                            administration; these two obstinacies crossing each other’s path,
                            produce a result of duplicity between his professions and his conduct—
                            He inveighs in private conversation against the abuses of the
                            administration, like a <persRef ref="catoyounger">Cato</persRef>— He
                            defends the administration in his Speeches as if he was groom of the
                            stole. In objecting to the Military Committee yesterday, I paid him a
                            compliment for his vigilant care of the Treasury and his zeal for the
                            purity of the administration— He came to my seat this morning and most
                            earnestly intreated me to write out for publication what I had said of
                            him, but complained that my quotation from <persRef ref="virgil"
                                >Virgil</persRef>, with its application to the Military Committee
                            was excessively severe— Wise handled him more roughly to-day, till
                                <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> called for
                            the orders, and the Treasury Note Bill— <persRef ref="rhett-robert">R.

                            voracious nullifier, into a painted administration butterfly, modified
                            again his proposed amendment— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of

                            tiresome conservative who poured forth a basen of milk and water
                            democracy tinged with a scruple of Arsenic— Halstead of New-Jersey, a
                            whig pepper corn replied to Bronson, and quoted Latin verses, without
                            translating them, till the recess, during which I made out a comparative
                            statement from the Treasury returns of the balances, due from the late

                            and tedious debate then followed upon sundry amendments successively
                            proposed by Rhett, and Wise; who was for restricting the power of the
                            Secretary of the Treasury to issue the Notes, I thought beyond reason—he
                            called for the <hi rend="italic">yeas</hi>
                            <pb n="343" type="ms"/>yeas and nays; which were 96 to 118.— I voted in
                            the negative. Rhett finally moved a reconsideration of the vote, by
                            which <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood’s</persRef> amendment
                            for selling the Bank Bonds was yesterday rejected. The vote upon this by
                            yeas and nays was 110 to 113.— Underwood then proposed another amendment
                            limiting the issue of Treasury Notes to three Millions, and a half, if
                            the Bank Bonds can be sold at par, within three Months. <persRef

                            of Texas and against Slavery, with several thousand signatures were
                            presented by other members— I retain a considerable number, to present
                            them at the Winter Session. The <persRef ref="polk-james"

                            pay their Bills held by him, on demand, in Specie. That an injunction
                            had issued from the District Court to stay his proceedings against the
                            Bank, and he prays that the Charter may be declared forfeited— <persRef

                            on the table, which was done— <persRef ref="mercer-charles"
                                >Mercer</persRef>, from the select Committee on the Rules, made a
                            final report, of two new rules—the first that the hour of every motion

                            some debate, was rejected— <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"

                            rejected by yeas and nays. 96 to 109—a succession of amendments ensued,

                            advance, was discussed and finally forced through, but the previous

                                >Cambreleng</persRef>. I thought it should have been by Bill, but
                            the House paid no attention to my suggestion— The object of the
                            Resolution is to save members of Congress from the payment of Postage,
                            on Letters sent to them, by the Express Mail— Committee of the whole on
                            the state of the Union— The Divorce, or Sub-treasury Bill from the
                            Senate, was called up, not by Cambreleng, but by Pickens of
                            South-Carolina, who made in support of it a prepared Speech of two hours
                            with which he has been swelling like a Cock-turkey, ever since <persRef

                            commencement of this Session— Pickens is a fixture to the House of
                            Calhoun, and Van Buren bought him with Calhoun— Cambreleng, tickles his
                            Vanity by pushing him forward as the champion of this Bill, and saving
                            himself the trouble and the odium of this task—which indeed he could not
                            have performed himself— Pickens is a coarse sample of the South-Carolina
                            school of Orator Statesmen—pompous, flashy and shallow— <persRef
                                ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef> is another—much more polished;
                            better educated and better disciplined— A fine speaker; a brilliant
                            scholar; but yet a shallow bottom— He opposed the taking up of this
                            Bill; but it was carried against him— Pickens’s speech was a jumble of
                            indigested political economy, of abuse upon <persRef
                                ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> for his war against the
                            Bank—of abuse repeated from Calhoun, upon Banks, banking, and the
                            Bank—of South-Carolina nullification, of Slave-driving autocrasy and of
                            ranting radicalism— He said if the abolitionists of the North would
                            preach insurrection to the Southern Slaves he would retort upon them by
                            preaching insurrection to the labourers against the Capitalists of the
                            North— He said he supposed he should pass for a Loco foco; but he had
                            recently heard it said that <persRef ref="milton-john">John
                                Milton</persRef> was a Loco foco— Then he passed a panegyric upon
                            John Milton, as the intrepid supporter of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >rights</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, and concluded that if John Milton was a
                            Loco-foco, he was content to be called so too— All this was delivered
                            with an air of authority, and a tone of dogmatism, as if he was speaking
                            to his Slaves.— When he sat down there was a pause— As if every body was
                            afraid to encounter him.— At last <persRef ref="garland-james">James
                                Garland</persRef> said that he would offer his substitute Bill, and
                            make a Speech upon it to-morrow— <persRef ref="phillips-stephen"
                                >Phillips</persRef> moved to lay this bill aside, and take up that
                            for authorising a further suspension of payment upon duty bonds—
                            Cambreleng agreed to this, and moved an amendment granting the same
                            credit of nine months, given by the first Section of the Bill to
                            outstanding bonds, to all future bonds from the first day of this Month
                            for one year— <persRef ref="titus-obadiah">Obadiah Titus</persRef> a

                            Cambreleng’s amendment was adopted, and the Bill passed its second and
                            third reading— Then came, in Committee of the whole on the state of the

                            to 70— Past 6 O’Clock— I got home at 7. and had an evening visit from

                            Southwest of the Mississippi— The Resolution was adopted this morning,
                            and will furnish a very curious document— <persRef ref="chapman-reuben"
                                >Chapman</persRef> of Alabama, offered a Resolution of instruction

                            upon the immediate appointment of the Committee, and I replied at full

                                >Cambreleng</persRef> called for the orders of the day— A bill from

                            bonds, passed through all its Stages, without opposition or examination—
                            Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. <persRef
                                ref="smith-francis">F. O. J. Smith</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef
                                ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> immediately called for the
                            divorce or Sub-treasury bill— <persRef ref="garland-james"
                                >Garland’s</persRef> substitute was read, and <persRef
                                ref="hoffman-josiah">Ogden Hoffman</persRef> of New-York, made a
                            splendid speech in answer to that of Pickens made yesterday, and against
                            the bill. Hoffman’s eloquence is diffusive—full of imagery and
                            classical, historical and poetical allusions— His language is elevated,
                            grammatically and rhetorically correct, and his elocution fluent. His
                            pronunciation, is of the English school; so that one of the members
                            asked me, if he was not an Englishman— He was followed by <persRef
                                ref="hunter-robert">R. M. T. Hunter</persRef> a young member from
                            Virginia in favour of the bill, and he by <persRef ref="mason-james3"
                                >James M. Mason</persRef>—also from <hi rend="italic">Virginia</hi>
                            <pb n="347" type="ms"/>Virginia, a son of <persRef ref="mason-john"
                                >General John Mason</persRef> of Georgetown, against it and in
                            favour of Garland’s substitute. He spoke till the recess—and concluded
                            after the Chair was resumed— He spoke for the party called the
                            conservatives or in other words the State-Bank party— He is ready,
                            confident, plausible, fluent; but not very deep— I spent the time of the
                            recess in computations of the amount of balances in the late deposit
                            State banks—tedious but necessary drudgery— At the evening Session after
                            Mason closed, <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> made a
                            Speech, in support of an amendment which he intends to propose— It
                            differs little from that of Garland, but Robertson agrees with no one—
                            He is exclusively tenacious of his own ideas— He has always amendments
                            of his own to propose, and they never find support from any one else— He
                            never carries any thing, and wastes more paper in offering amendments
                            and having them printed, than any other man in the House— Garland
                            followed him in a second Speech for his own substitute, and shortly
                            after 7. at <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes’s</persRef> motion the
                            Committee rose, and the House adjourned. A little before Sunset, I was
                            called from my seat, to speak with a strong, healthy, and good looking
                            old man, whom I did not immediately recognize, but who hailed me, as the
                            Class of 87. and who finally named himself— It was <persRef
                                ref="hunnewell-walter">Walter Hunnewell</persRef>— I think I have
                            not seen him since the day when we were graduated, Masters of Arts, in
                            July 1790— He told me he had been residing ever since that time, a
                            practicing physician at Watertown; and until now had never been for ten
                            days at once absent from that place— He introduced to me his son in law,
                            named <persRef ref="underwood-john">Underwood</persRef>, who was with
                            him, and who I understood was a Contractor with the Government— They
                            were going off immediately; and he was returning homeward— The only
                            person, in the House, whom he asked me to point out to him was Wise.</p>

                                <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, to
                            report at the next Session a list of all the defaulting receivers,
                            collectors and depositors of the public money, since the first of
                            January 1834— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> from
                            the Committee of Claims, obtained leave, to sit if necessary during the
                            sittings of the House— The Florida War investigation returned, and
                                <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> explained— He moves to
                            have it postponed until the Winter Session, and then referred to the
                            Committee on the expenditures of the War Department; a majority of whom
                            he said were of the opposition— I replied to M’Kay, and gave a History
                            of the composition of the Committee of Manufactures at the first and
                            second Session of the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress, and of
                            the utter insignificancy of that Committee ever since— And I shewed the
                            uselessness of the reference of this investigation to the Committee on
                            the Expenditures of the War Department— <persRef ref="williams-lewis"

                            removed to another Committee which was noticed by Whittlesey.— Bond
                            presented a statement of the Appropriations for the suppression of
                            Indian hostilities, since the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of Jan<hi

                            the Department of State, shewing the necessity of a watchful eye over
                            incipient abuses, and perhaps, accounting for his removal from the
                            Committee— The Sub-treasury Bill came up, as the order of the day—in
                            committee of the whole on the Union, <persRef ref="smith-francis"
                                >Smith</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
                                Garland</persRef> of Louisiana, attempted without success, to get up
                            the bill for adjusting the balances of the late deposit Banks— <persRef
                                ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia, made a flabby
                            speech in support of the Bill— Haynes is a Doctor, but this Session has
                            puffed himself up into a self-conceit of Statesmanship, and fancies
                            himself the Main Stay of the administration. <persRef
                                ref="calhoun-william">Calhoun</persRef> of Massachusetts followed in
                            a very sensible, temperate speech against the bill, chiefly repelling
                            without retorting, the malevolence of <persRef ref="pickens-francis"

                            the Bill, and for a Bank of the United States— He was interrupted by the
                            recess which I occupied in copying a Letter to <persRef

                                >Cushman</persRef> began a formal speech of self-justification for
                            his habitual practice of moving the previous question— <persRef
                                ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> however called him
                            to order, and said, that, if he persisted, he would start the previous
                            question upon <hi rend="italic">him</hi>— A hearty laugh of the house
                            ensued, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope rose to continue his
                            Speech— It was often amusing and sometimes instructive in details—never
                            wasting in words, and occasionally sprightly, but wanting in connection,
                            and shewing no approach towards the sight of Land— After speaking
                            without discontinuance, at least for two hours, he sunk down exhausted
                            into his chair, without finishing— A motion was made for the Committee
                            to rise, but W. Cost Johnson, agreed with him and by the tacit leave of
                            the House to take the floor in his place, reserving to M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope the right of concluding his Speech
                            to-morrow Morning; and Johnson then proceeded in a speech of at least
                            two hours, full of sarcasm, drollery, sound sense, generous sympathies,
                            intrepid spirit, moral philosophy, and idle humours, such as I believe
                            was never before delivered in a deliberative Assembly— <persRef
                                ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef> then moved the Committee to rise,
                            but they refused. Garland’s substitute was rejected 73 to 90— <persRef
                                ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> moved another— A Bill in nine

                            98 to 89— Whittlesey from the Committee of Claims reported a Bill to

                            the month of next January— I was unwilling to decline, and yet unable to
                            say whether I should be able to perform the task— I finally asked them
                            to allow me a few weeks to ascertain if it would be in my power to
                            comply with their request, to which they <hi rend="italic">readily</hi>

                            and mules of volunteers in this Seminole War— It was driven through all

                            discussion laid on the table— I spoke in favour of its postponement, and
                            alluded to the notorious circulation of small bills from other States in
                            the City of New-York, in open defiance of the Law of the State— And I
                            told the members that if they now passed this Bill, it would either be a

                            delivered one of the most eloquent Speeches of two hours, ever
                            pronounced in that Hall—against the Bill—asking for time—dealing
                            altogether in generalities—descanting upon the march of intellect—the
                            progressive improvement in the condition of mankind—the wonders effected
                            by the modern system of credit, and the Steam-engine— He glanced
                            obscurely at the subject of Slavery, and dashed away from it as if
                            between fear and shame to speak about it at-all— He contrasted the
                            condition of this Country with that of Europe, and with regard to the
                            progress of improvement— Quoted a number of recent English writers on
                            political economy, and referred to his own observations during his late
                            residence and travels in Europe— Legare has not the ideal form of an
                            Orator— Short—thick; with a head disproportioned in size to his body a
                            fattish, ugly, but intelligent face, dark complexion and slightly
                            limping left foot— But his voice is strong—his enunciation distinct
                            though rapid— His action not graceful; but energetic—his intonations
                            alternately high and low; and his command of language copious, and
                            ornamental— He is like <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef>
                            rather of the English than the American School, and will surely rank
                            among the distinguished Orators of the Nation— He was followed by
                                <persRef ref="naylor-charles">Charles Naylor</persRef> in a burst of
                            feeling against Pickens’s threat yesterday that he would preach
                            insurrection, to the labourers against the capitalists of the North—
                            Naylor was soon interrupted by the recess, which I passed as usual, in
                            the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, with half a dozen small
                            crackers, and a glass of water— After the recess, Naylor finished his
                            Speech, and was succeeded by <persRef ref="moore-ely">Ely
                                Moore</persRef>, the Prince of the working men, who as he did once
                            in the last Congress began with a thundering <persRef ref="cade-john"

                            speech, and in the course of half an hour, broke down—sunk almost
                            lifeless into his chair, and was carried home to be bled— Moore is a
                            very handsome man, six feet high, well formed, with a bold, keen, and
                            piercing eye, a prepossessing countenance, a rather courteous
                            deportment, a strong, clear, impressive voice, a good command of
                            language, and fluent elocution— His object was to reply <hi

                            <pb n="350" type="ms"/>to Naylor, who had said that he was himself a
                            labourer, and spoke for the working men— Moore said he had not spoken
                            their sentiments— That <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, Moore, knew them well—
                            That he had been the founder of their National Association, and was the
                            President of their Convention— That he was in correspondence with the
                            leading men of their party throughout the Union, and he could assure the
                            House that nine out of ten, he believed ninety-nine out of a hundred of
                            them were against the Banks, against the Banking system, and in favour
                            of this bill— Moore’s vain boasting told his secret— In all the ordinary
                            business of the Session, he was and is a servile tool of the executive—
                            Takes no part in the debates and votes with the standing
                            majority—occasionally changing his vote upon finding he has mistaken how
                            the majority would vote Twice he has attempted a great effort, to bring
                            out his whole system of insurrection against the rich, and twice he has
                            broken down— If his strength were equal to his will he would be a very
                            dangerous man— As it is, he is a very unsafe one— <persRef
                                ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> replied to <persRef
                                ref="pickens-francis">Pickens’s</persRef> threat of leading a
                            Northern insurrection; with great force: quoting from a former Speech of
                            Pickens, characterising the party at the head of which he now proposed
                            to place himself, as profligate, unprincipled and detestable. Cushing
                            said if there was to be an alliance between the Slave holders of the
                            South, and the Loco foco’s of the North, it would not be an alliance
                            between equals but of masters and Slaves. <persRef
                                ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> made then his Speech
                            for the Bill; consisting of bitter complaints against the opposition for
                            obstructing the business of the government, and refusing all relief to
                            the people, in their distress—and of vapid repetition of old hacknied
                            abuse against the Bank of the United States— He gave two or three sharp
                            cuts at Hoffman, as a deserter from the Tammany Hall, after enjoying by
                            their favour an undue portion of the spoils, and said he should have
                            learnt better lessons in the Navy of the United States. Hoffman replied
                            in a half hour of the most tremendous invective that ever was uttered—as
                            he was speaking the members from all parts of the house, gathered till
                            they formed a perfect ring round him and Cambreleng, listening with
                            intense interest, so that in that usually confused and noisy hall, a pin
                            might have been heard to drop— Cambreleng, cowered under the
                            castigation, and implored his mercy— Hoffman immediately replied that in
                            that altered tone he should find him far more accessible, than in the
                            one previously assumed, and let himself off, as <persRef ref="uncletoby"
                                >uncle Toby Shandy</persRef> let off the fly. A shout of applause
                            burst forth from the galleries as he closed— I told Hoffman that I had
                            prepared for a settlement of accounts with Cambreleng myself—but that he
                            had settled all my balances with him as well as his own— I could not
                            call a dead man to account— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>
                            then took the floor for a speech of four hours; after which, Dawson’s
                            amendment was rejected— The Committee rose and reported the Bill, and at
                            a quarter of an hour after Midnight the House adjourned— <persRef

                            conservatives, as they are now called, who made an apologetic speech to
                            the effect that he wanted time to consult his constituents. Said the
                            measure of the subtreasury as a democratic one was new—public opinion
                            concerning it had not been fully pronounced— The Albany Argus had not
                            yet laid down the Law—upon this subject; the County Convention had not
                            specifically approved it. There was no immediate necessity for it— He
                            wished to go home and learn the will of his constituents, and would then
                            return and yield prompt obedience to it.— He then renewed the motion to
                            lay the Bill on the table— There was a call of the House, and after
                            several dilatory motions taken by yeas and nays 230 members answered to
                            their names. Just as the question was about to be taken, <persRef
                                ref="lewis-dixon">Lewis</persRef> of Alabama, intreated Clark to
                            withdraw his motion, that he might offer an amendment to the Bill— Lewis
                            asked that his amendment might be read— The <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Speaker</persRef> not withstanding a remonstrance from <persRef

                            The yeas and nays were taken and the bill was laid on the table, by a
                            vote of 120 to 107. Clark alone of the New-York conservatives voting
                            with the yeas.— Lewis now moved his amendment again but was declared out
                            of order— He moved to adjourn, which being rejected, he again claimed
                            the admission of his amendment, other business having intervened, but
                            the Speaker did not consider a rejected motion to adjourn as new
                            business.— <persRef ref="griffin-john">Griffin</persRef> of

                            by Lewis to the consideration of the House, was substantially that of

                                <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> in the Chair, and

                            the chairman allowed to be discussed both at once— <persRef
                                ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> made a long and

                            He was interrupted by the recess, which takes off prodigiously from the
                            effect of a Speech. I retired to the chamber of the Committee of
                            manufactures and wrote a Letter to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
                                >my wife</persRef>— I have found this so agreeable, and <hi

                            single exception of the day when by the invitation of Elisha Whittlesey,
                            I went and dined with him at his lodgings. Five or six small crackers
                            and a glass of water, give me a sumptuous dinner— I consume an hour and
                            a quarter in writing a Letter, and the time passes like a flash of
                            lightening— I am calm and composed for the Evening Session; and far
                            better prepared for taking part in any debate than after the most
                            temperate dinner at home or abroad— Of all this I had a signal proof
                            this day— After the recess Governor Lincoln concluded his Speech—
                                <persRef ref="martin-joshua2">Martin</persRef> of Alabama, next
                            spoke, in favour of Johnson’s amendment, and wishing to add to it, that
                            the banks which belonged exclusively to the States, should not be
                            required to give security for the protracted payments. I then took the
                            floor, and in a Speech of upwards of two hours, exposed the true
                            character of the Bill, and of that to which it is a supplement, in all
                            their iniquity and fraud— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
                                >Cambreleng</persRef> was utterly unable to explain even the meaning
                            of the Bill— I made free use of the computations which I had drawn up
                            from the Reports of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
                                Treasury</persRef>, and minutely scrutinized the Bill in all its
                            parts, and denounced the bargain made in the face of the House, between
                            Cambreleng and the members of the debtor States, procuring their votes
                            for the postponement bill, by promising them increased indulgence for
                            their banks upon this— Cambreleng, who could not answer me, kept up a
                            continual succession of interruptions and calls to order, in despite of
                            which I went through, with constant attention from the house, and not a
                            mark of impatience, except from Cambreleng— When I finished he moved to
                            lay the Bill aside and take up the appropriation Bill which was done—
                            Wise moved to strike out an item of ten thousand dollars for the
                            expenses of <persRef key="rush-richard">Richard Rush’s</persRef> agency,
                            in obtaining payment of the Smithsonian bequest— Cambreleng and <persRef

                            Committee of Ways and Means, at the last Session of Congress had
                            attempted to palm upon me the responsibility of proposing this
                            appropriation, which I had flatly refused— Cambreleng was now obliged to
                            propose it himself— Wise’s motion did not succeed but he afterwards
                            moved in the house to reduce the appropriation to 5000 dollars and
                            succeeded— Cambreleng as usual had nothing to say, in defence of the
                            appropriation, but that Wise and I had voted for the Bill establishing
                            the agency. Wise announced that the gold, provided for the payment of
                            the members of Congress was run out, and <persRef ref="johnson-william2"
                                >W. Cost Johnson</persRef> wasted an hour in idle and humorous
                            invective upon the Secretary of the Treasury for promising to pay the
                            members in gold or silver and now putting them off with bank rags—
                            Johnson who was under <persRef ref="comte-almaviva">Count
                                Almaviva’s</persRef> ivresse de gentilhomme, consumed so much time,
                            that Elisha Whittlesey finally rose and implored him to let the business
                            of the House proceed; Johnson answered him with much profession of
                            deference, and polite ridicule— <persRef ref="bynum-jesse"
                                >Bynum</persRef> got a formal Letter from the Sergeant at arms,

                            the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> time and passed. A resolution came
                            from the Senate, suspending for this Session the 16<hi

                            constant threats throughout the day; of calling up that Bill again, till
                            this extinguisher was put over it— While the House was thus engaged <hi

                            adjusting the balances of the late deposit Banks, which was carried— The
                            House then went into Committee of the whole on the Union, and took up
                            the Bill making an appropriation of 1600000 dollars for the suppression
                            of Indian hostilities, which passed through the Committee without one
                            word of debate— The New-York fire bill came next— <persRef

                            bill, smuggled out of the Committee of the whole on the Union, by Smiths
                            motion, was taken up in the house— Johnson of Louisiana’s amendment,

                            was carried 77 to 54 and the instant it had passed Cambreleng started
                            the previous Question; cutting off A. Loomis’s amendment for the payment
                            of interest; and the Bill passed to a third reading. <persRef

                            and nays, on the passage of the Bill which were refused— <persRef

                            literally crammed through the House. Meanwhile the Appropriation Bill
                            had returned from the Senate with three amendments, two of which after
                            some desultory conversation were agreed to, and the third non-concurred—
                            The New-York fire bill, was finally laid aside— The deposit bank balance
                            bill, came back from the Senate, concurring in the amendment of the
                            House, with a further amendment, providing for the payment of interest
                            on the balances to be paid by the defaulting banks. This was in
                            substance the amendment which had been proposed by Loomis— It defeated
                            the project of the members from the debtor States, and they were for
                            disagreeing to this amendment, under a confidence that if the Bill could
                            be sent back the Senate would recede from their amendment as they
                            certainly would have done— Loomis of New-York without complaining of the
                            manner in which his amendment had been treated, but with moderation
                            amounting to timidity, moved to postpone the consideration of the Bill,
                            to the first Monday in December; but Pope and <persRef
                                ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> of Kentucky, and other
                            members from the debtor States, appealed to his compassion in behalf of
                            the defaulting banks; and he withdrew his motion— The question upon
                            concurrence with the amendment was put and a majority of the votes
                            present was against it—but there was no Quorum in the House— Wise called
                            for a count, and the number present was only 83.— Wise objected to
                            acting without a quorum, and said there was none in the Senate— Howard
                            moved that a vote of non-concurrence, so that there might be a
                            conference between the two Houses— I said the House was not in a
                            condition either to concur or non-concur. It was Sunday morning, and I
                            would move to adjourn; but was willing the question upon non concurrence
                            should first be put, to ascertain what number of members there were
                            present— The vote to non-concur was 61 to 23— <persRef ref="mckim-isaac"
                                >M’Kim</persRef> then moved to adjourn— Wise called for the yeas and
                            nays, which were, not to adjourn 38 to 50. Cambreleng said it would take
                            too much time and put the absent members to too much trouble to carry
                            through a Call of the House— But the Officers of the House must take
                            care to keep a Quorum of members in the City to be here on Monday

                            of the Senate, it was better to pass a vote of non-concurrence, which
                            would leave the question just where it was, before the absent members
                            went away— The snake is as subtle as the old Serpent of Eden— If his
                            compeers would have supported him he would have called that vote of 61
                            to 22 a vote of the house, because the affirmatives were a <hi

                            <hi rend="italic">quorum</hi>. But they were not so resolute— Haynes
                            said he could not consent to do business with the knowledge that there
                            was no Quorum present— Lewis of Alabama moved a call of the House— I
                            said I would consent to do no business without a Quorum— This Bill was
                            the price of the deposit postponement Bill—stipulated by a most indecent
                            bargain then made in the face of the House, and then properly
                            stigmatized— I would sit such should be the pleasure of the majority of
                            members present till Monday Morning, but for one, would do no business
                            with only eighty odd members present— Haynes moved to adjourn; which was
                            carried without a division at half-past one, Sunday Morning, and I
                            walked by fine Moonlight two miles home; which I reached fresh, and very
                            little fatigued at a quarter past two— About a quarter of an hour before
                            the adjournment, Governor Lincoln, who had been two or three hours
                            absent, returned to the House— He said he was going off in the Cars, in
                            the morning.</p>

                            various causes unable to entertain company at dinner, much to my sorrow;
                            for one of the choicest enjoyments of this life to me is the practice of
                            liberal hospitality— But the death of my dear and ever lamented Son

                            of the delegation and me have deprived me of the means, and even of the

                            <pb n="355" type="ms"/>By the continual evolution of political opinions,
                            and passions, I happen at this moment, to be again upon terms of good
                            understanding and good fellowship with them all—and I have taken the
                            opportunity afforded me by this momentary calm, and this extraordinary
                            Session of inviting them all to dine with me— It may be the last time I
                            shall ever have the opportunity of meeting my political associates and
                            adversaries in the intercourse of mutual goodwill, at the social
                            board—and for this purpose I have been obliged to take the Sunday, the
                            rest of the week being wholly absorbed by public duties— It has deprived
                            me of the power of attendance on public worship in the afternoon; which
                            I have regretted, but could not avoid— I called this Evening and spent

                        <p>The House of Representatives met at 8 O’Clock this morning. The Senate at

                            Immediately after the reading of the Journal, <persRef
                                ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> moved to dispense
                            with the usual orders of the day, and take up the amendment of the

                            balances with the late deposit Banks— They had now no possible chance of
                            carrying the Bill without concurring with the amendment of the Senate—
                            The tactics of Saturday Night were accordingly invested, and the motion
                            now was to <hi rend="italic">concur</hi> with it— This I vehemently
                            opposed, not from objection to the amendment, but to prevent the passage
                            of the Bill, and I again exposed the shameless bargain made in the face
                            of the House between Cambreleng, and the Southwestern members, in which
                            to secure their votes for the deposit postponement Bill, he promised
                            this increased indulgence to their delinquent Banks— <persRef

                            suggestions, and each of them asked if I meant <hi rend="italic"
                                >him</hi>— I answered that I referred to no individual member, but
                            to what had taken place in the face of the House, and had been
                            signalized at the time, by <persRef ref="dawson-william"
                                >Dawson</persRef> of Georgia, and by <persRef ref="mason-samson"
                                >Mason</persRef> of Ohio— I was time after time interrupted and
                            called to order by Cambreleng, and the <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Speaker</persRef> decided that it was out of order to refer in the
                            House to what had taken place in the Committee of the whole— I then said
                            I would put a case, and suppose a Legislative body, elsewhere—any
                            where—in the moon if the Speaker pleased, and I would tell what had
                            occurred in that imaginary assembly—and I told it all— I then recurred
                            to what had passed last Saturday evening in the house, and laid open
                            that scene of iniquity— Cambreleng and the Speaker interrupting me at
                            every second word— I went through however, and then said that was my
                            disclosures were apparently so very disagreeable to the chairman of the
                            Committee of Ways and Means, and to the Speaker I would forbear to
                            continue them—the Speaker said they were not disagreeable to him, but he
                            was bound to execute his duty as he understood it— I said I had no doubt
                            of that—but that unfortunately for me, on this and many other occasions
                            he understood his duty very differently from my understanding of it— I
                            reviewed the conduct of Cambreleng throughout the whole of this Session,
                            and shewed its duplicity, its incapacity, its overbearing insolence; and
                            at last said that out of tenderness to the Chairman of the Committee of
                            Ways and Means I would say no more— He said I was fit to be a member of
                            that Legislative Assembly in the moon, which I had imagined, and called
                            for the previous Question— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln moved

                                >Palmer</persRef> of New-York offered also an amendment which he
                            intends to move to the same Bill, authorising the <persRef

                            State Banks as special depositories of the public monies, whenever they
                            exceed in any one place 50000 dollars— Thomas from the joint Committee
                            reported that they had waited on the President of the United States who
                            informed them, that he had no further communication to make, and
                            tendered his good wishes to the members of both Houses, and at ten
                            O’Clock A.M. the Speaker adjourned the House to the first Monday of

                            this morning, some of which he said he had not been able to hear— I told
                            him that it would be impossible for me to do this immediately; but the
                            Atlas must refer to the National Intelligencer, where my remarks on
                            Saturday Night and this morning would be published revised by myself—

                            and asked me, if I would write for him a circular to his Constituents;
                            intimating that it was his intention to resign his Seat, and not come to
                            Congress again; I told him, I believed it would be impossible without
                            some allowance of time; but I would do it with pleasure if I could— He
                            asked where I lodged— I told him at my own house, where I should be
                            happy to see him at his own convenience— He said it had not been his
                            intention to invite himself to my house, but seemed desirous to converse
                            with me further— He has been a warm supporter of the <persRef

                            from the merchants Bank at Boston for 35 dollars— I asked for an order
                            upon that same Bank for the same sum— They could not give it, because
                            they were in debt to that Bank, but they gave me an order on the
                            Commonwealth’s bank, which I enclosed and forwarded. I presented the
                            Speaker’s order for 744 dollars for my pay at this Session, and asked
                            for gold, but they said they had none. I then said, I would keep the
                            order a few days longer.— I came home and sat down to write. After

                            misfortune and the principal cause of his ruin was an incapacity to do
                            business, and a want of persevering attention to what was to be done.
                            Facility of character, and avarice, qualities more frequently combined
                            than may generally be supposed, contributed their share to his
                            misfortunes; and now there is danger that his claims will fall through

                            they are not yet ready. I went into the Library, and consulted the

                            Washington, for 250 dollars—a drop in the bucket— M<hi

                            the corner of the President’s Square— On examining <persRef

                            minutes of my Speech last Saturday Evening I find it will be necessary
                            for me to write it out entirely, and I employed this Evening in revising
                            the tabular Statement of the portions of the 4<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> instalment due to the several States compared with the
                            balances due from the late deposit Banks— This tabular statement formed
                            the basis of my whole argument; and as there was a continual recurrence
                            to arithmetical sums compared together it would have been impossible for
                            a reporter far better qualified than Otis, to have taken it down
                            correctly as I spoke.</p>

                        <p>Intense Summer— I called at the Bank of the Metropolis, and entered as a
                            special deposit, the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker’s</persRef> check
                            for my pay— Then at the Bank of Washington, where I deposited <persRef

                            check. Then at the Office of the National Intelligencer where I saw

                            immediately went out— Featherstonhaugh was apparently much incensed
                            against Mason, whom after he went out he charged with gross injustice to
                            him for urging him to travel with him in the Cherokee Nation, and then
                            making him pay half the expence of the Carriage— I wanted to consult the
                            Register of debates in March 1834. for a passage in a Speech of mine, on
                            the removal of the deposits, and I found it, under date of 17 March p.
                            3011— Early this evening <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J.

                            woman, a friend of the bride, were all the company present— The ceremony
                            performed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler was short—beginning
                            with a prayer—not naming either of the parties, but calling them M<hi

                            pronounced the nuptial vows—using the formula of love, honour and obey
                            for the woman, and closing with that deeply solemn injunction— I
                            pronounce you man and wife, and those whom God hath joined, let not man
                            put asunder.— I had some conversation with M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Fowler, who told me that he had been spending some weeks in
                            Virginia, during which <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi

                            had a pew there, and expressed a strong wish that the two Churches, D<hi

                            united in one.— He spoke also of the dissensions in the presbyterian
                            church, but said there was a flattering prospect of their being
                            healed.</p>

                                    >r</hi> Huntt</persRef>— He looks like a living skeleton, but
                            says his health has been very much improved by a late excursion to the
                            red sulphur Springs in Virginia— I went out in search of the residence
                            of <persRef ref="whitcomb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
                                Whitcomb</persRef> the Commissioner of the general Land-Office, but
                            did not find it— He paid me a visit last Spring shortly after he came
                            into the Office, introduced by <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi

                            day from <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>
                            a copy of his Address to the Philermenian Society of Brown University,
                            at Providence the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month— I had
                            been invited to deliver the Address, on this occasion, which I had
                            fortunately declined; for as it was the day of the Meeting of Congress
                            at their late Session, I could not have <hi rend="italic">performed</hi>
                            <pb n="360" type="ms"/>performed the engagement, if I had undertaken it—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s Address is upon the moral
                            character of the Literature of the last and present century, and was so
                            deeply interesting that after once looking into it, I could not lay it
                            aside, till I had gone wholly through it— Upon the whole it is an

                            subject is not profound— He does not even name <persRef

                                <persRef ref="burke-edmund">Burke</persRef>— He compares only the
                            Literature of the last have of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            with that of the first part of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            century, not yet half expired— The idea of the comparison is ingenious,
                            and it is treated with an excellent moral purpose. Examining the subject
                            more closely it may be doubted whether the moral character of Literature
                            at this time is so much improved over that of the last Century as he
                            supposes— The philosophy of the French and German Schools is perhaps not
                            more Christian, than that of Voltaire, certainly not so much so as that
                            of <persRef ref="rousseau-jean">Rousseau</persRef>— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett urges that the peaceable and
                            bloodless character of the revolutionary movements at this time, in
                            France and England, is attributable to this purified morality of their
                            Literature— There may be something in this— At least it deserves further
                            meditation— The conclusion of the Discourse, is an eloquent and pathetic
                            address to the young men, the members of the Society, exhorting them to
                            adhere through life to the promotion and improvement of this pure moral
                            principle; closing with the inscription on the Labarum of <persRef

                            Washington, and drew a check upon the Bank of the Metropolis for the
                            specie that I had deposited there— The Bank of Washington has resumed
                            payment in specie of its own bills.— The Bank of the Metropolis has not
                            and cannot— I have no confidence in the common honesty of its managers,
                            and am unwilling to trust them with a special deposit— There was an
                            advertisement in the Intelligencer this morning, that Treaties with the
                            Sioux and the Sacs of the Missouri would be signed this morning at 11.
                            O’Clock; and one with the Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi at 1.
                            O’Clock. and that a general council would be held at 3. O’Clock. The
                            meetings to be at the Church in F. Street— I went out near one
                            O’Clock—stop’d at the Church, but found none of the Indian diplomacy
                            there— Returning from the Bank of Washington, I stop’d again; there were
                            some women and children in the pews, waiting to see the Show, but none
                            of the contracting parties— I came home; took an early dinner and soon
                            after 3. O’Clock returned to the Church— It was then crowded and two or
                            more of the tribes of Indians were seated on a stage floored over the
                            tops of the pews from the pulpit to the front pews— They were at the
                            right and left hand of the Secretary of War, <persRef
                                ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef>, who was standing in the
                            centre in front of the pulpit, and investing the Chiefs one after the

                            each of them suspended by a blue silk <hi rend="italic">ribband</hi>
                            <pb n="361" type="ms"/>ribband— After which he made them a short
                            farewell Speech; exhorting them to go home and keep the Peace with one
                            another—expressing his pleasure at the conclusion of the Treaties with
                            them; at their having stipulated for education and agricultural
                            instruction—that a difficulty between the Sacs and Foxes and the
                            Winebagoes had been amicably settled—and he promised that the
                            engagements stipulated with them on his part should all be faithfully
                            performed— As he spoke Sentence by Sentence, two Interpreters, one on
                            each side explained to the respective tribes—Sacs and Foxes of the
                            Mississippi, Sioux, Sacs and Ioways of the Missouri, and Winebagoes 74.
                            in number, what he said; and each sentence was received with the usual
                            Indian grunt— They then all successively shook hands with the Secretary
                            of War and went away— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pointsett’s manner,
                            like his discourse was cold, stiff and formal— <persRef ref="coxe-ws">W.

                            for a Speech to Indian chiefs than Pointsett. I came home, and went to

                            always be aristocratic—that democracy of numbers and literature were
                            self-contradictory— Among the interpreters of these Winebago Indians was

                            account is as marvelous as the stories of the Cock-lane Ghost, the
                            Miracles at the tomb of the Abbé Paris, or the Salem witcheries of the
                                17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Century. The substance of the
                            story is, that by the effect of certain cabalistic motions of a

                            lulled into profound sleep, and in that condition, is by the power of

                            Capron magnetized this young Lady into a profound sleep, in nine minutes
                            of time; first making her walk in sleep about the house, and look at
                            pictures with the back of her head turned to them— He next put her into
                            a state of Clairvoyance, and then delivered her over to M<hi

                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone’s narrative is much
                            interspersed with argument to prove that he could not have been deceived
                            or imposed upon— There is an appendix of additional evidence of the
                            wonders of animal magnetism, which within a few months past has been
                            exciting a degree of public attention somewhat alarming— I am
                            apprehensive that there is danger of some great imposture’s being
                            imposed upon the public credulity, and I cannot but meditate upon the
                            fact, that the existence of this mysterious power of animal magnetism,
                            has maintained itself in the minds of multitudes, more than have a

                            of the human mind; and one of those in which the natural progress is
                            from weakness to frailty—from frailty to vice—from Vice to Crime, and
                            from crime to public calamity— Stone’s pamphlet is portentous— My

                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye, what this advertisement meant— He
                            seemed not to like to speak of it, but said the woman had been sold with
                            her children to be sent to the South, and separated from <persRef
                                ref="allen-nathan">her husband</persRef>—that she had killed two of
                            her children, by cutting their throats, and cut her own to kill herself,
                            but in that had failed— That she had been tried at Alexandria, for the
                            murder of her children, and acquitted on the ground of insanity— And
                            that this sale now, was by the purchaser, at the expense of the seller,
                            upon the warranty that she <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
                            <pb n="363" type="ms"/>was sound in body and mind— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye brought me ten numbers of <persRef
                                ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> Register, which had been sent
                            to his house while I was absent last Summer, and of which I had obtained
                            another set, supposing that they had been stopped during the recess— I
                            took them to Niles’s Register Office, but he was not there— I called at
                            the Office of the National Intelligencer and saw <persRef
                                ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Seaton</persRef>—enquired of him concerning the advertisement of the
                            Sale of Slaves, in the paper of this morning. He answered with
                            reluctance, and told me the same story that I had heard from M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye—adding that there was something very
                            bad about it, but without telling me what it was— It is a case of
                            Conscience with me, whether my duty requires or forbids me to pursue the
                            enquiry in this case—to ascertain all the facts, and to expose them in
                            all their turpitude to the world— The prohibition of the internal
                            Slave-trade is within the Constitutional power of Congress, and in my
                            opinion is among their incumbent duties— I have gone as far upon this
                            article, the abolition of Slavery, as the public opinion of the free
                            portion of the Union will bear—and so far that scarcely a slave holding
                            member of the House dares to vote with me, upon any question— I have as
                            yet been thoroughly sustained in my own State; but one step further, and
                            I hazard my own standing and influence there; my own final overthrow,
                            and the cause of Liberty itself for indefinite time—certainly for more
                            than my remnant of life.— Were there in the House one member capable of
                            taking the lead in this cause of universal emancipation, which is moving
                            onward in the world, and in this country, I would withdraw from the
                            contest, which will rage with increasing fury, as it draws to its
                            crisis, but for the management of which my age, infirmities and
                            approaching end totally disqualify <hi rend="italic">me</hi>— There is
                            no such man in the House— Seaton told me that he would publish my Speech
                            of the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at 82.— The weather
                            has been several days very fine, but at high Summer heat. This morning I
                            visited <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Madison</persRef>, who has come to take up her residence in this
                            city— I had not seen her since March 1809.— The depredations of time are
                            not so perceptible in her personal appearance, as might be expected— She
                            is a woman of placid, equable temperament, and less susceptible of
                            laceration by the scourges of the world abroad, than most others— The
                            term of <persRef ref="madison-james">her husband’s</persRef> presidency
                            was tempestuous, and turbulent; but he weathered the storm by that
                            equanimity which carried him also through an eventful period, and a
                            boisterous age— The two closing years of his presidency terminated his
                            political life, with honour—and tranquility—eminently successful in its
                            general result, and glorious individually to him— The succeeding twenty
                            years <hi rend="italic">she</hi>
                            <pb n="364" type="ms"/>she has passed in retirement—so long as he lived,
                            with him, and now upwards of a year since his decease— She intended to
                            have removed to this place last Autumn, but was prevented by an
                            inflammatory disease in her eyes, from which she has almost wholly
                            recovered— There is no trace of it in her appearance now. <persRef

                            and <persRef ref="forrest-sarah2">Sally Forrest</persRef> were there—A

                            girl, who came with her from Virginia— I went next to the Pension
                            Office, and on my way saw the procession of the fire companies, from
                            Georgetown to the Navy yard, passing through, and coming out from the
                            President’s yard— It was respectable; but the procession of the fire
                            companies in Boston, which I had seen when <persRef ref="everett-edward"
                                >Edward Everett</persRef> delivered his Eulogy on <persRef

                            of the splendour of this— They understand all ceremonials of popular

                            globe— For Military displays— S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

                            order for making out his Commission— The doctor said he thought some
                            further information might be found in the papers of General Washington
                            at the Department of State— I went there accordingly and saw <persRef

                            The name of General Thomas was immediately found in the first muster
                            roll of General Washington’s army at Cambridge, in July 1775. and M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth promised to have the papers
                            thoroughly examined for any further evidence which they may contain,
                            relating to Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas, and to write me a
                            note of the result. I conversed also with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Forsyth upon our relations with Mexico, which are still very precarious.
                            A Mexican Envoy Extraordinary <persRef ref="martinez-francisco"
                                >Francisco Pizarro Martinez</persRef> arrived here a few days since,
                            with a <persRef ref="bassave-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Basave</persRef>, and a <persRef ref="cos-am">M<hi

                            in the same way— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth told me that the
                            Minister had not been received. He further told me, that <persRef
                                ref="ellis-powhatan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Powhatan

                            until some disavowal should be made by the Mexican Government, of the
                            outrageous conduct of <persRef ref="gorostiza-manuel">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Gorostiza</persRef>, upon his leaving
                            this Country— I asked him, if it was his publication of the
                            correspondence— He said, partly that— But the latest accounts he said
                            from Mexico were, the marching of a body of troops, against <persRef
                                ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa-Anna</persRef>, who was intrenched
                            somewhere with 600 men.— He spoke too of <persRef ref="dickson-james"
                                >Dickson</persRef>, or Montezuma the second, the adventurer whose
                            project was to put himself of the Mexican Indians and march from
                            California, to Mexico— There are contradictory accounts in the
                            Newspapers of his having been killed, and of his being actually on his
                            march— Forsyth spoke also laughingly, about <persRef

                            Forsyth it was probable I might be obliged to make another call for

                            communicate— There is a film of obscurity and a squint of duplicity over

                        <p>Day of <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> marriage— I
                            received a distressing Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
                                >my wife</persRef>— She and three of the children were ill— It gave
                            me a bitter heartache— I answered her Letter and sent her an order upon
                                <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef>— <persRef
                                ref="u">Harvey</persRef> was here about his bill for Coal, and I
                            asked him to wait a couple of weeks.— In the Pennsylvania avenue I met
                                <persRef ref="everett-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Everett</persRef> of Virginia, who during the latter part of
                                <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Monroe’s</persRef> administration was his private Secretary— I had
                            not seen him for several years, and thought I had heard he was gone to
                            Europe; but he told me he had not been out of Virginia— I stopped at the
                            Franklin Insurance Co<hi rend="superscript">y:</hi> Office, and ordered
                            a Policy of Insurance to be made out in the name of <persRef

                            think it safe for her to neglect it longer— I sat about an hour to
                                <persRef ref="towle-eunice">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Towle</persRef> for my portrait and she requested a second sitting
                            for this day week.— She says she was a pupil of <persRef
                                ref="harding-chester">Harding’s</persRef>, but she is of a lower
                            order of skill as an artist. Her likenesses are strong, but they have
                            the sign post hardness of outline— I went to the Capitol-Office of the
                                <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef> of the House of
                            Representatives— <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Burch</persRef> there— He was occupied in correcting the
                            proof of the last sheet of the Journal of the House at the last Session—
                            I took out two papers left of those which had accompanied the petition
                            of the late <persRef ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>,
                            presented by me in June 1836. He had withdrawn his petition and the
                            other papers, but these had been accidentally left— One of them was a
                            very long list of witnesses, whom he wished to have summoned as
                            witnesses to his claim— I took these papers to <persRef
                                ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis
                                Johnson</persRef>, the administrator upon William Otis’s estate, and
                            advised him with regard to the preparation of a petition to be presented
                            at the next Session of Congress. I called twice at the Exchange Office
                            of <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse</persRef>, and there first
                            saw <persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> R.
                                Cutts</persRef> and afterwards Major Nourse himself, who had just
                            returned from Philadelphia— Met there also <persRef ref="brodhead-john"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John C. Brodhead</persRef>, a
                            member of Congress from New-York—and in the Street I met <persRef

                            member of the House, who told me he remained here during the recess,
                            because he had not time to go home and come back for the Winter Session—
                            I called at the dusk of Evening at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S. Smith’s</persRef>, and
                            spent an hour with them— In the Evening task of writing out my speech
                            upon Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs and Adverbs, I was overpowered by
                            drowsiness, and forced to suspend the labour till to-morrow. In these
                            turns I drop into sleep with the pen in my hands—</p>

                        <p>After a long succession of dry and beautiful weather, and a week
                            resembling the last week in July more than the fourth week in October,
                            the change has come in rain, though not cold the whole of this day—
                            Morning visit from <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Fendall</persRef>, who said there was to be this Evening
                            a Meeting of the American Historical Society, and he wished to be
                            enabled to inform them whether I could engage to deliver their annual
                            address in January.— I told him, I could not yet positively say— My
                            engagements were yet such, that I had not <hi rend="italic">time</hi>
                            <pb n="366" type="ms"/>time so much as to survey the subject— It would
                            be safest for the Society to assume that it will not be in my power to
                            comply with their invitation, and to provide themselves with another
                            Orator— But I was very unwilling positively to decline— If they would
                            wait a week or ten days longer, and then receive my answer I would in
                            the mean time make up definitively my mind— He promised at all events to
                            send me the Constitution of the Society and the two preceding annual
                            Addresses by <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governors Cass</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Woodbury</persRef>, which if I do
                            undertake the charge it will be necessary for me to peruse— I incline
                            strongly to deliver this address; but my labour of the head and of the
                            hand is slow—during the Session of Congress, this Diary, in despite of
                            every possible exertion of mine, to keep it up, ran twelve days in
                            arrear— From the hour of the adjournment my morning task has been to
                            retrieve the record, and that is not yet completed though within two
                            days of it— At the same time my evening labour, is to write out my
                            speech of Saturday the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> on the Bill for
                            adjusting the remaining balances due by the late deposit Banks— Eight
                            hours at least of each day, I sit pen in hand, engaged upon these two
                            works, and at my age, Nature will bear no more. Newspapers, Letters,
                            exercise; food, sleep, and overstrained weariness consume the remaining
                            sixteen hours, and I bless an ever merciful Providence that my health
                            and cheerfulness are yet preserved.— Last evening, I was forced by
                            irresistible drowsiness to leave my nightly task half finished and go to
                            bed— The foul weather of this day enabled me to redeem what I then lost—
                            I omitted the usual exercise of the morning, but at the dusk of evening
                            walked in the rain, to the National Intelligencer Office; but <persRef
                                ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef>
                            was not there— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall spoke to me of
                                <persRef ref="causten-james">James H. Causten’s</persRef> Memorial
                            against the President and Directors of the Bank of the Metropolis; and
                            of the injunction issued by <persRef ref="thruston-buckner">Judge
                                Thruston</persRef>, to Causten and <persRef ref="causten-james2">his
                                Son</persRef>, to stay proceedings, on writs issued by <persRef

                            Peace against the Bank, for refusing payment of their bills— He said he
                            was counsel for the younger Causten— That <persRef ref="vanness-john">J.
                                P. Van Ness</persRef> the President of the Bank of the Metropolis
                            had applied first to <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge
                                Cranch</persRef> for the injunction, but he would not grant it— He
                            then applied to judge Thruston who did grant it; but he expected the
                            injunction would be dissolved— He said that one of the reasons assigned
                            by the Bill of the Bank was that the Magistrate who issued the writ,
                            upon the 5 dollar bills had no jurisdiction, and that he supposed the
                            ground of this was that Corporations were not liable to process by
                            attachment but only by summons—and if this plea is available, the banks
                            of the District, are not amenable to any tribunal for sums of less than
                            50 dollars— This is to be remembered.</p>

                        <p>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, which greatly
                            relieved me from an oppressive burden of distress— She says that both
                            children are better— That they propose, if the weather will permit to
                            leave Quincy next Monday— That she may stop one day at New-York to wait
                            for <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>, who is
                            at Fishkill landing, and is coming on with her; and that she hopes to
                            meet me at Baltimore— I walked to the Capitol—part of the way with
                                <persRef ref="watterston-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Watterston</persRef>, with whom I fell in.— He spoke to me of the
                            Southern Confederation, or Convention held at<space/>in Georgia, the
                            proceedings of which, he said were in the Merchant, <persRef

                            office of the Clerk of the House, I saw <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi

                            House for the last Session, is not yet received— Nor was the original
                            Memorial from Halifax Virginia, there.— I looked over a file of the
                            Documents of the last Session, and was surprized to find one Memorial
                            praying for a National Bank, reprinted I believe 20 times over, because
                            it came totidem verbis from so many different places— I wish to examine
                            the file to prepare for the approaching Session of Congress which may
                            probably be my last political trial in this world— I look towards it, as
                            towards a crisis in the affairs of the human race; and in the events of
                            which my last appearance upon the stage of action is to be had, and for
                            all efficient operation I am to close the drama with the day— Whatever
                            of life may be afterwards allotted to me by a merciful Providence must
                            be to glide down the stream, under the guidance of others— On my way
                            home I stop’d at the Office of the National Intelligencer and saw
                                <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Seaton</persRef>— I saw there too the Janus-face Merchant, and
                            Reformer—published by Duff Green, at the same time in Baltimore, by the
                            name of the Merchant, and here, by that of the Reformer— And I read the

                            South-Carolina at its head which is to divide this Union into a Northern
                            a Southern and a Western Confederacy, with Texas and a fourth part of
                            Mexico, annexed to the confederacy of the South— The movement of

                            obviously combined with this project, which is offensive as regards the

                            Abolition of Slavery.— The National Intelligencer of this day contains

                            will contain fifteen columns of the paper; and is the first great Speech
                            that Mercer has made for the last ten years— Mine on the bill for
                            adjusting the balances with the Banks, is substantially upon the same
                            subject— It is less elaborate than his and will occupy not more than two
                            thirds so much space of the paper— The present the question upon the two

                            postponement of the instalment— I spent an hour of the Evening with

                                Smith</persRef> was here twice: first in the morning, when I gave

                            any record or file of papers received from my late brother <persRef

                            he came again, and said there was no trace on the records or on the

                            of those names. I received a Letter from <hi rend="italic">Richard</hi>

                            had been murdered— That is, he had been shot in the head in a duel, and
                            by harsh usage in transporting him, in a march of the troops, he had
                            died under the operation— There has already been something of this in
                            the Newspapers— I received also a Letter from <persRef

                            There was in the National Intelligencer of this morning an Advertisement
                            again of the Sale of a <persRef ref="allen-dorcas">Woman</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="allen-maria;u">two children</persRef>, at 11. O’Clock—
                            I went between 11 and 12 O’Clock to the room, the woman and children,
                            girls of 7 and 9 years of age were there, the woman weeping and wailing
                            most piteously. I enquired of <persRef ref="dyer-edward">Dyer</persRef>
                            if they were sold— He said no— That they had been sold last Monday, and
                            bought in by the <persRef ref="allen-nathan">husband</persRef> of the
                            woman who was free, and a waiter at <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
                                >Gadsby’s</persRef>—he had bought them in for 475 dollars, but was
                            unable to raise the money, which was the reason why they were to be sold
                            again— They were waiting for the man, who was endeavouring to procure by
                            subscription, upon his own engagement to repay the money, the means of
                            paying for his purchase last Monday— <persRef ref="key-francis">M<hi

                            I learnt from Dyer, that the woman had been the Slave of a <persRef
                                ref="u">white woman</persRef> who had married a man named <persRef

                            a Clerk in the War Department— That this white woman had died, and had
                            before her death, promised Dorcas her freedom— That on her death bed,
                            she had made her husband Davis promise her that he would emancipate
                            Dorcas— That he did actually liberate her, but gave her no papers— That
                            she lived twelve or fifteen years at large—married, and had four
                            children— That in the meantime Davis married a <persRef ref="orme-maria"
                                >second wife</persRef>, and afterwards died without granting to
                            Dorcas her papers of freedom— That Davis’s widow, married a man by the
                            name of <persRef ref="orme-rezin">Rezin Orme</persRef>, and that he sold
                            Dorcas and <persRef ref="u;u">her four children</persRef>, on the 22<hi
                                rend="superscript">d.</hi> of August last for 700 dollars to
                                <persRef ref="birch-james">Birch</persRef> who is an agent for the
                            negro Slave-traders at Alexandria— That Dorcas and her four children,
                            were on the same day removed to one of the Slave prisons in Alexandria—
                            That in the Night of that day, she killed the two youngest of her
                            children, one a boy four years of age, and the other a girl under twelve
                            months— That she attempted to kill the other two, but was prevented;
                            their screaming having roused some person in the house, who went into
                            the cell where she was confined, and took her surviving children from
                            her— That she was tried at Alexandria for the murder of her two children
                            and was acquitted by the Jury, on the ground of insanity— These were
                            stated as the facts, and it was said to be doubtful whether Rezin Orme,
                            had any right to sell them at all. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Key
                            made some enquiries about Orme, who it was said had left the District,
                            and was not to be found—and about M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Orme,
                            who he said was under obligations to him; but who Dyer said had shut
                            herself up in her chamber and would be seen by no person on the subject.

                            <pb n="369" type="ms"/>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Key called me out
                            of the Auction room to speak in private with me on the subject; he said
                            he thought a subscription might be raised to enable Allen to pay for the
                            purchase of his wife, and children; and I told him I would give fifty
                            dollars towards it— I then called upon <persRef ref="cranch-william"
                                >judge Cranch</persRef> at his Office in the City Hall—and enquired
                            of him concerning the trial of this woman at Alexandria— He read to me
                            his Notes at the trial— There were two Indictments against her; one for
                            the murder of each of her children— She was tried only upon one— That of
                            the boy— The evidence of her killing them was complete— The defence was
                            insanity— Not the slightest evidence of insanity at the time, except the
                            mere fact of her killing the children— There was evidence of her being
                            subject to fits, which sometimes lasted an hour— That she is passionate,
                            and violent, and some times wild in her talk— The jury acquitted her as
                            insane— The prosecutor entered a noli prosequi upon the second
                            indictment— Upon being asked why she had killed her children, she said
                            they were in Heaven—that if they had lived she did not know what would
                            have become of them— That her mistress had been wrong—that her mistress
                            was a methodist; and so she was herself— There was no evidence before
                            the court, of any thing, preceding the acts for which she was tried— I
                            enquired of the judge concerning the case between the <persRef
                                ref="causten-james;causten-james2">Causten’s</persRef>, and the bank
                            of the Metropolis— He said <persRef ref="vanness-john">Van
                                Ness</persRef> had applied to him for an injunction which he had
                            refused; believing that there was no equity for Chancery interposition,
                            in the case— Van Ness had afterwards applied to <persRef
                                ref="thruston-buckner">judge Thruston</persRef>, who granted the
                            injunction; but told judge Cranch that when he granted it, he did not
                            know it had been refused by him— He said that if Justices of the Peace
                            had no jurisdiction in pleas of debt against corporations, the
                            jurisdiction even for debts under 50 dollars, must remain with the
                            Circuit Court. The judge said he had declined conversing with Causten
                            upon the subject— I asked the judge his opinion upon the expediency of
                            abolishing imprisonment for debt in the district— He said it was
                            virtually abolished by the facility of obtaining a release in cases of
                            insolvency— I spoke of the sale of free Negroes for jail fees— He said
                            there was great need of a revision of the Laws respecting runaway
                            negroes— He gave me his copy, with marginal annotations of <persRef

                                >d.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, omitting the absolution.— His Sermon,
                            a very good one was from 1. Kings 18.21. [“]And <persRef ref="elijah"
                                >Elijah</persRef> came unto all the People and said,— How long halt
                            ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if <persRef
                                ref="baal">Baal</persRef>, then follow him. And the people answered
                            him not a word”— He gave out only the question omitting the first and
                            last part of the verse— But he related the story of the contest between
                            Elijah and the priests of Baal, and its issue, with great spirit, and a
                            wonderful story it is— The confidence with which Elijah proposes the
                            trial—the readiness with which it is accepted by the Priests of Baal—
                            The sincerity with which they appear to have expected that Baal would
                            vindicate his claim to Godhead— The insulting mockery of Elijah,
                            standing alone against the 450 prophets of Baal, and the 400 prophets of
                            the groves—the slaughter of the 450 false prophets by the single hand of
                            Elijah;—every one of these incidents is as marvelous, and as remote from
                            any possibility of the present age, as the miraculous fire from Heaven
                            which consumed the altar at the command of Elijah— At the present day,
                            no Christian Minister would dare to propose as the test of the truth of
                            his religion, the performance of a miracle— No one would dare accept
                            such a proposal if made to him by the Priest of another religion— The
                            true religion is not tested by the performance of miracles, and it must
                            be admitted that when it was, the miracles were never followed by any
                            permanent effect upon the belief or practice of the People— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller’s discourse was a powerful argument
                            against the folly and wickedness of halting between two opinions—a great
                            weakness in morals and politics, as it is a sin in religion— The weather
                            was so cold that I was obliged to have a fire made this evening in my

                            was last Saturday referred, at his proposal, with an agreement that if

                            received months ago the Letter to the Editors of the Globe,
                            Intelligencer and others of 25. April 1837. with the copy of the Letter

                            last Friday he had received duplicates of the same Letters— That they
                            had published nothing in the National Intelligencer on the
                            subject—because the Globe had published the Letters, because the young
                            man appeared to have died in consequence of a duel; because this was but
                            one of daily hundreds of proofs that the Texians were no better than a
                            lawless banditti, and because if they were to publish the Letters, the
                            parties accused in Texas might answer in the same style with the
                            complaint and involve the paper in a very unprofitable and useless
                            controversy— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton I was not yet

                        <p>A cold night again; and unsound repose— Like <persRef ref="david"
                                >David</persRef> in his old age, though they cover me with clothes I
                            get no heat— <persRef ref="franzoni-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >rs</hi> Franzoni</persRef> came this morning and requested my
                            influence to obtain a place in one of the public Offices for <persRef
                                ref="franzoni-john">her son</persRef>— She is the widow of an
                                <persRef ref="franzoni-carlo">Italian Sculptor</persRef>, once an
                            artist at the Capitol, and one of the most skilful among them— He lived
                            in a house adjoining that of <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Daniel
                                Brent</persRef> in which I then resided, and died very suddenly one
                            morning in 1819. or 20. to the extreme distress and consternation of
                            this woman and her family— I saw him dead in his house, within half an
                            hour after he expired— I was under the impression that she had returned
                            to Europe, but she has not; and this Son of hers an infant between two
                            and three years of age then, is now a man of 21. She says he has been
                            brought up as a printer at Philadelphia—that he writes well, and is
                            capable of performing the duties of a Clerk in any of the public <hi
                                rend="italic">Offices</hi>
                            <pb n="372" type="ms"/>Offices; and that her chief dependence for
                            support is upon him— I asked her to send him to me to morrow morning,
                            that I may talk with him, and said if an opportunity should present
                            itself in which I can serve him, I would do so. <persRef ref="gurley-r"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. R. Gurley</persRef> a
                            Secretary of the Colonization Society likewise called upon me. He
                            mentioned that he had it in Contemplation to set up here a periodical
                            journal partly religious and partly political, but chiefly to promote
                            the objects and views of the Colonization Society— He professed at the
                            same time an unqualified approbation of my course in Congress, upon the
                            subject of Texas and of the right of petition— I told him that I was
                            much gratified at having the assurance of his approbation upon my
                            conduct, on trying questions— That my own views, with regard to the
                            abolition of Slavery throughout the United States, concurred more with
                            those which I understood to be avowed by the leading members of the
                            Colonization Society, than with those of the Abolition and Anti-Slavery
                            Societies in General— But that to be frank and candid with him, I did
                            not think it possible that a paper, to be conducted on the principles
                            which he had exposed could be sustained within this place. It would be,
                            as the Colonization Society itself is obnoxious to both the opposite
                            parties—to the abolitionists, and to the Slave-holders— I believed there
                            would henceforth be no middle term between them— After a long
                            conversation with him, which more fully confirmed me in these opinions,
                            he left me, apparently not convinced by my remarks, but admitting that
                            he had little to say in reply to them— He has recently returned from a
                            residence for a considerable time in Georgia, and much intercourse with
                            the other Southern States— He gave me an account of the opinions
                            generally prevailing among them, corresponding with the impressions
                            which I had previously entertained— But he said the members of Congress
                            from the Southern States did not exactly represent the feelings of their
                            constituents, and particularly of the religious portion of them— Of this
                            I was well aware— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gurley asked me for a
                            copy of my Oration at Newbury-Port, and of my Speech of 25. May 1836. on
                            the Rations or Texas Question, both of which I gave him— Walk to the
                            Capitol— Met <persRef ref="hall-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            for my advice which I gave him. Met also <persRef ref="wyer-edward"
                                >Edward Wyer</persRef>, who promised me again a budget of Speeches,
                            and told me that of all vulgar men in this world, the most vulgar man in
                            his judgment was the <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Vice President of
                                the United States</persRef>— Wyer is doorkeeper to the Senate— At

                                    >r</hi> Frost</persRef>, who gave me a copy of the Journals of
                            the House at the last Session; and the original Anti-Abolition Memorial
                            from Halifax Virginia.— I did not go out after dinner, but continued
                            writing and examining documents till eleven at night endeavouring in
                            vain to finish my Speech</p>
