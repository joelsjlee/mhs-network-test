							returned with <persRef ref="brooks-sidney">her husband</persRef> from a
							three years tour in Europe— The <persRef ref="adams-john3">midshipman
								John Quincy</persRef> was here this morning— A man by the name of
								<persRef ref="hooker-daniel">Daniel Hooker</persRef> from Goshen
							Vermont was here to enquire about the right of collateral relations to
							bounty Lands for revolutionary Soldier services— He said his uncle
								<persRef ref="hooker-john2">John Hooker</persRef>, enlisted for the
							War in 1777. in the Connecticut line— And he shewed me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="gordon-william5">W. Gordon</persRef> of the War
							Department to <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>
							dated in February last, stating that the name of John Hooker was
							transferred in 1781 to the invalid regiment; that it did not appear that
							he had served till the close of the revolutionary war, and was therefore
							not entitled to bounty Lands. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
							Hooker said that in 1810 <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> had given
							a power of Attorney to another man named Hooker to procure a Patent for
							the land to which his brothers service had been entitled; that Hooker
							the Attorney had said that the land was located, but he knew not what
							had become of him. That <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef> had promised to make
							enquiries for himself the <persRef ref="whitcomb-james">Commissioner of
								the general Land Office</persRef>, but acknowledged to him that he
							had not done it— He was dissatisfied with Everett and Slade; said that
							in his town, they were friends of Liberty and talked of the Government’s
							cheating people out of their property— I answered him sharply on this
							observation, and told him that by his own Story, if he had been cheated
							out of his property it was not by the Government— But I said if he
							wished me to make enquiries for him at the Land Office I would do so and
							write to him the result which he said he would thank me to do. He
							thanked me also for making the offer— The <persRef ref="may-samuel"

							of Congress, and censuring the disregard <pb n="665" type="ms"/>by

								Lunt</persRef> this morning from Matthew 23.30. [“]For in the
							resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as
							the angels of God in heaven.”—and in the afternoon from Romans 4:18.
							“Who against hope, believed in hope.” The first of these Discourses was
							on the probable condition of our existence in the world to come— The
							second upon hope arising from despair, both, very interesting
							Sermons—but of the condition of our existence in a future state, we are
							so destitute excepting from what we find in the new Testament, that we
							can form no conception of it. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> came out from
							Boston, and dined and spent the day with us— I read the second Sermon of
							the tenth Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> upon
