						<p>The first time for more than forty years I have suffered a total breach
							in my Diary for several weeks— At one of the most trying periods of my
							life— The Journals of the House of Representatives of the United States,
							my Letter Book, and my Addresses to my Constituents the Inhabitants of
							the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of
							Massachusetts must supply the vacancy. This morning <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J. Frye</persRef>, who had passed the Night
							here; returned to his College. I spent the morning in writing, and in
							packing up books to be sent to Quincy— Walked to the Capitol— At the
							Office of the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk of the House of
								Representatives</persRef>— <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burch</persRef> is ill, and has been
							confined to his house ever since the close of the Session of Congress.
								<persRef ref="johnson-robert2">R. Johnson</persRef> was not there—
							They have not yet printed the Journal of the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January. At the Library— Met <persRef
								ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard Jarvis</persRef> there, who stays on
							account of his and <persRef ref="jarvis-mary">his wife’s</persRef>
							infirm state of health—and <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Taliaferro</persRef>, member of
							the late House of Representatives from Virginia— He is here on account
							of the recent decease of <persRef ref="u">his niece of the same
								name</persRef>— I saw at the Capitol two Casts of Statues by
								<persRef ref="pettrich-ferdinand">Pedrich</persRef>, called sleeping
							Innocence, and the fisherman’s daughter— An Article shewn me by Jarvis
							in the New-York Mirror, charging the Committee on Paintings with
							ignorance for the selection of Artists to paint the pannels of the
							Rotundo, mentioned the History of Painting and Painters by the <persRef
								ref="lanzi-luigi">Abbate Lanzi</persRef> translated by <persRef
								ref="roscoe-thomas">Thomas Roscoe</persRef>—at which I looked— I
							read also the conclusion of <persRef ref="mathias-thomas"
								>Matthias’s</persRef> Edition of <persRef ref="gray-thomas"
								>Gray’s</persRef> works— Walked home <persRef ref="adams-john3"
								>Midshipman John Quincy Adams 2<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi></persRef> arrived this day from Norfolk— About three weeks
							since he returned in the Potowmac frigate <persRef
								ref="nicholson-joseph3">Captain J. J. Nicholson</persRef> from the
							Mediterranean— Evening at Whist. I met this day in the Street <persRef
								ref="rogers-lloyd">Lloyd N. Rogers</persRef> of Baltimore in the
							Street, who spoke to me of <persRef ref="rogers-edmund">his
								Son</persRef>, now at Cambridge University—</p>

						<p>We packed up several trunks, Chests and boxes, and sent them on board the

							the State, making enquiries in behalf of an old Revolutionary Soldier
							named <persRef ref="munroe-shubael">Shubael Munroe</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards took the minutes, and sent me an
							answer in the course of the day, the substance of which I wrote to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan— His Letter had remained just two

								ref="smith-joshua2">Joshua Smith</persRef> of Hanson, and enclosed
							to him copies received from the Pension Office upon which one <persRef
								ref="u">Josselyn</persRef> had obtained a Pension— This Letter was
							likewise two Months old. further I answered a Letter from <persRef
								ref="elmsley-john">J. Elmsley</persRef> at Toronto upper Canada
							enquiring about payment of the bequest to <persRef ref="elmsley-mary"
								>his mother</persRef>, in the Will of her brother <persRef

								Curtis</persRef>, my Co-Executor, to whom I had sent Elmsley’s

							Hill— Stop’d at the Franklin Insurance Office, where I found the Cashier
							or Secretary, <persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bradley</persRef>— Mentioned to him the cause of the

								Whittlesey’s</persRef> error on hearing the Bill which had passed in
							the Senate, in supposing that a Section of it gave the company banking
							powers. He made the objection, and debate arising a motion was made and
							carried, to lay the Bill on the Table— Bradley said the dividend in May
							unless some heavy-loss should intervene, would not be less than it was
							last November. Just after dinner <persRef ref="hall-joseph6">M<hi

								<persRef ref="bartlett-bailey">Bailey Bartlett</persRef> of
							Haverhill, a passed Midshipman in the Navy— M<hi rend="superscript"

							afterwards was put down as of 1833. He thinks this a grievance, and
							wants my intercession with the <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">Secretary

							Secretary of the Navy, in his favour, though it will be to no purpose—

							my only serious occupation has been answering Letters which had
							accumulated in arrears on my hands— My relaxation from toil has been to
							visit the Pension Office in behalf of claimants for Revolutionary
							Services or their widows. I spent two or three hours of every day for
							one week with <persRef ref="powers-hiram">Hiram Powers</persRef> a
							Sculptor who has taken a model in clay for my bust— I have attended two

							and the other of <persRef ref="mclene-jeremiah">Jeremiah

							District of Massachusetts to be published in the Quincy Patriot, and all
							this has contribute to divert my mind from sorrows and troubles which
							otherwise would have rendered me wretched without relief.</p>
