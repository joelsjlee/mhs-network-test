						<p>There was a thunder gust last evening shortly before midnight,
							contradicting the proverb that the month of March goes out like a Lamb:
							and this morning was cold and blustering more like the first of March
							than of April— <persRef ref="powers-hiram">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Powers</persRef> had called at my house yesterday and
							requested that I would give him a short final sitting for my bust. I
							went accordingly at nine O’Clock this morning, and he gave the last
							touches to his waste mould of clay; taken from the soil of this city;
							and which he says is the best moulding clay in the world— This is
							probably the last time that a counterfeit presentment of me will be made
							in this world; and likenesses enough of my face and person will be left
							to survive me— My likeness has been taken in the course of my life by
							sixteen Painters, five Sculptors, and one medalist— <persRef
								ref="stuart-gilbert">Stweart</persRef>, <persRef ref="king-charles2"
								>King</persRef>, <persRef ref="harding-chester">Harding</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="durand-asher">Durand</persRef> have painted me twice.—
							My face has been copied in my sixteenth and my seventieth year— They
							show what I am, and what I was. <persRef ref="cranch-john">John
								Cranch</persRef> was with Powers— From his studio, I went to the
							Library at the Capitol, where I met <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard"
								>Leonard Jarvis</persRef> late a member of the House of
							Representatives from Maine, but who declined a re-election to the <hi
								rend="italic">25</hi><hi rend="superscript italic">th</hi>
							<pb n="232" type="ms"/>25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress, and
							who remains here an invalid waiting for permission from his physician to
							travel northward home— I had some conversation with him— We disagree in
							almost all our opinions; but are yet upon terms like those of <persRef
								ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> with <persRef ref="walmisley-gilbert">Gilbert
								Walmsley</persRef>. He said to me that <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">S. L. Southard</persRef> while Secretary of
							the Navy had purchased of <persRef ref="newton-thomas">Thomas
								Newton</persRef> lands no otherwise described in the Deed than as in
							the neighbourhood of the Navy hospital at Norfolk, for which he had paid
							Newton 8000 dollars, and for which he thought Southard ought to be
							impeached. I told Jarvis that I knew nothing of the facts; but that I
							had such confidence in the integrity of Southard and of Newton, that I
							would stake any thing upon the issue that no wrong to the public had
							been done by the contract whatever— I went into the Law Library chamber,
							and examined the act of Parliament 5. <persRef ref="george-iv">George
								4</persRef>. C. 113 containing the revised British code for the
							abolition of the Slave-trade; and the Treaties of Great-Britain then
							existing with Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands for the suppression of
							the trade— I read also the decision of <persRef ref="scott-william">Lord
								Stowell</persRef> in the case of the Slave, <persRef
								ref="james-grace">Grace</persRef>, in the second volume of <persRef
								ref="haggard-john">Haggart’s</persRef> Admiralty Reports— These are
							both cited in <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Van Buren’s</persRef> Note to <persRef
								ref="temple-henry">Lord Palmerston</persRef>, on the case of the
							Slaves liberated at New-Providence, after the wreck of the Comet— The
							British Slave-emancipation Acts I cannot find in the Library— The
							decision of Lord Stowell in the case of the Slave Grace, is very
							remarkable— He gives a history of the abolition of Slavery in England
							effected by the mere fiat of <persRef ref="murray-william">Lord
								Mansfield</persRef> in the case of the Negro <persRef
								ref="somerset-james">Somersett</persRef> only 22 years after a
							directly contrary decision by <persRef ref="yorke-philip">Lord
								Hardwick</persRef>— Lord Stowell leans hard against the decision of
							Lord Mansfield, though he dares not reverse it; and he absolutely
							ridicules the boast of Britons that the soil of their Country will not
							bear the foot of a Slave— The whole tenour of his argument is
							anti-abolitionist, and was adapted to discountenance the progress of the
							abolitionist Spirit in England, which nevertheless very soon after that
							judgment accomplished the emancipation Laws in the British West-India
							Colonies— This was forced upon the British Government by the
							irresistible current of public opinion; and this decision of Lord
							Stowell’s was among the last struggles against it— The decision was,
							that although a West-India Slave, landing in England, was emancipated
							while residing there, yet by being carried back to the land of Slavery,
							she was restored to her servitude and to her master— I returned home
							about an hour before dinner. After dinner there came <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitcomb</persRef>, heretofore a subaltern Custom-house Officer at
							Boston, and persevering applicant for an Office here— He had <hi

							<pb n="233" type="ms"/>removed to the State of Vermont, where he had
							purchased a farm; but is now offered a Clerkship under <persRef
								ref="parris-albion">Albion K. Parris</persRef>, sometime Governor of
							the State of Maine, but now first Auditor of the Treasury— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitcomb said he came to thank me, for
							having recommended him a year or two ago, for an appointment under the
							Commissioner of the general Land-Office— He enquired if <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef> was here, and said he was not at Boston when he
							came through there this day fortnight— A man by the name of <persRef
								ref="u">Shea</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, from
							Baltimore, came with a subscription paper for a volume of Poems, to
							which I declined to put my name— He asked me then to accept the volume,
							which I also declined— <persRef ref="bartlett-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Bartlett</persRef> came, and I
							went with him to the House of <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickerson</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Navy, to whom he submitted his claim to be restored to the year
							1832. instead of 1833 for his rank as passed midshipman— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickerson took his papers and said he
							would consider his claim— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J.

						<p>Heard this morning at the Presbyterian Church <persRef
								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from Isaiah 53.6.—“and the Lord hath laid on him
							the iniquity of us all.” A discourse thoroughly calvinistical upon the
							doctrine of vicarious atonement by sacrifice of blood. A doctrine to me
							so utterly senseless and absurd, that I cannot without effort sit and
							hear it preached with Patience— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler
							brought in the whole story of the Levitical laws of atonement and the
							goat Hazazel, which the children had been reading to me this morning;
							but the ceremonial of sending the scape-goat into the wilderness laden
							with all the sins of the People was merely symbolical; as a supplication
							of forgiveness for past transgressions, by a people who had no
							conception of any other than temporal punishments— How the scape-goat
							Hazazel, can be construed into a type of the sufferings and death of
							Jesus, not only for all past but for all future sins to the end of the
							world is to me incomprehensible and odious. To punish one man for the
							committed sins of another is revolting enough to the natural sense of
							Justice; but that a man crucified two thousand years ago, for preaching
							glory to God and Peace on Earth, and immortal life to man, should have
							been punished for my sins committed two thousand years after his death
							is such a confusion of all moral principle that I marvel, how it should
							ever have entered into the brain of any human being. The whole
							calvinistic doctrine of atonement, is a libel upon human reason—
								<persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert Buchanan</persRef> came in
							from Baltimore, where he has been spending a week, and dined with us; as
							did his brother <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J. Frye</persRef>.
							After dinner I went with <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef> to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s

								>r</hi>
							<pb n="234" type="ms"/><persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the
							first Sunday after Easter, and preach from Isaiah 57—“the high and lofty
							one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy”—part of a verse— The
							Sermon was upon Eternity; and it was an occasional Sermon upon the death
							of <persRef ref="ramsay-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								William Ramsay</persRef>, who died very suddenly yesterday morning a
							few days after child bearing.— It was much like all the rest of M<hi

								ref="smylie-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> James
								Smylie</persRef> late stated Clerk of the Presbytery of Mississippi,
							author of book in defence of Slavery to which this Letter is an answer—
							I have read scarcely any thing upon this controversy, and am quite
							incompetent to discuss it myself.— I come to the conclusion, without
							examining the premises.— I have an abhorrence of Slavery; but how bad it
							is no one can imagine without understanding the details— Smylie defends
							Slavery as an institution sanctioned by the Scriptures.— But the
							extermination of the Canaanitish Nations was also sanctioned by the
							Scriptures— The punishment of death was prescribed for a multitude of
							what we should consider very trivial offences— The theory of the rights
							of man was then utterly unknown— And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
							Smith shews that the servitude of that time was a milder condition than
							the Slavery of the present age and of this Country— This subject of
							Slavery, to my great sorrow and mortification is absorbing all my
							faculties.</p>

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard

							with the British Government a Treaty, in which is included indemnity for
							the Slaves taken from the Comet, Encomium and Enterprize was premature—
							That the Government here had no advice of the conclusion of such a
							Treaty— Notwithstanding which I have no doubt that such a Treaty is
							expected, and think there is a great probability that it will be
							obtained.— A delay of six years in giving an answer to demands arising
							from the execution of a Law, is proof satisfactory that there was no
							good answer to give; and this inability to meet a claim, is a

						<p>It was my intention to have spent two or three hours of this morning in
							the Library of Congress, but I was disappointed first by sundry calls of
							business and a necessary visit to the bank of the Metropolis, and then
							by answering a Letter also upon business received yesterday from
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>— My only walk for
							exercise was after dinner, and towards evening twilight, round the seven
							buildings cold and cheerless. <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull
								Adams</persRef> left us immediately after dinner, to take the
							rail-way Cars for Baltimore; and thence the Steamboat to Norfolk on his
							way to Savannah— There came an Irishman from <persRef ref="force-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Force</persRef> the Mayor
							of the City, to shew me a remonstrance to be signed by many inhabitants
							of the City against the building now in process of erection for the
							Departments of State and of the Treasury, and which they complain will
							block up F. Street, and obstruct the view in the Pennsylvania Avenue,
							from the Capitol down to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President’s</persRef> house— The strange part of the business is
							that the building is already built up nine or ten feet from the ground
							at a very heavy expense, and that the only alternative now is to
							persevere, or to pull down and rebuild in another direction. After
							dinner <persRef ref="causin-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Causin</persRef> called upon me, and said that <persRef
								ref="otis-william3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Otis</persRef> who has been nearly a whole year confined in the
							prison of this City for debt was now in such a state of health with a
							rhumatism, that unless shortly removed from the jail he would die— That
							he had finally consented to call his creditors together to make over his
							property to trustees for their benefit, and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Causin wished me to call at the prison, and advise him to
							agree to their terms— He said that the Marshal had given directions that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis should be supplied with every
							thing necessary for his comfort that could be furnished him there; and
							that he was attended by two men, a black and a white man, his fellow
							prisoners in the same chamber to nurse him— But in that confinement and
							with that atmosphere he was perishing, and unless liberated could not
							long survive— I told D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Causin that I had
							been last week to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis, and would go
							and see him again; and advise him to make the assignment necessary to
							obtain his liberation— <persRef ref="baker-harriet">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Martin Baker</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">her daughter</persRef> were here to ask my advise
							how they were to proceed to prove that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Baker’s father <persRef ref="weissenfels-frederick">Col<hi

							of the <hi rend="italic">Revolutionary</hi>
							<pb n="236" type="ms"/>Revolutionary War; a fact of which I have no

							they had possessed a Letter from <persRef ref="vancortlandt-philip"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Van Cortland</persRef> under
							whom Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Weissenfels served, attesting all
							his service, but it had been put into the hands of the late <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>, and not returned,
							and they now had nothing but a copy— <persRef ref="baker-john">M<hi

								<persRef ref="hunter-alexander2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>New Moon— Sun eclipsed invisible— Snow all the morning which melted as it
							fell, with cheerless chilly weather. <persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor</persRef> sent me a note
							requesting me to call at her house which I did— She and her daughter
								<persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef> had the Journals and Letter Books of her deceased
							Son <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor</persRef>, of which they
							wish to make a pecuniary speculation by selling them to a bookseller for
							publication— She wanted me to write an introduction or preliminary
							discourse, which I willingly agreed to do; but she did not like to part
							with her manuscripts—only part of them at a time so that the publication
							may be made in successive volumes, one at a time— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart read to me two passages from the
							journal—one a picturesque description of the cordillares from one of
							their summits the other a musing of moral reflections upon the death of
							an old Peruvian at the age of nearly one hundred years— While at M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor’s I was sent for to return to my

								<persRef ref="persico-luigi">Luigi Persico</persRef>, who has

							for a group of two Statues—<persRef ref="columbus-christopher"
								>Columbus</persRef> and the Indian, for which he is to receive 4000
							dollars a year for four successive years, and 5000 dollars the 5<hi

							to embark as soon as possible for Italy.— He said he had given to the
								<persRef ref="meehan-john">Librarian of Congress</persRef> the order
							to keep my bust subject to my order, but as I declined accepting it, he
							would write to the Librarian, requesting him to retain it in the
							Library, and request the acceptance of it by Congress to be kept there.
							He took leave of me with grateful affection expressing the hope to see
							me again upon his return five years hence—of which the omniscient eye

							when the papers had all been drawn up by <persRef ref="brent-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. L. Brent</persRef>, and ready
							for execution—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis had changed his mind
							and declined executing them— He was now however very ill, and was
							desirous of seeing me— I told him I was going to see him in consequence
							of a call upon me by <persRef ref="causin-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Causin</persRef>— I went accordingly
							to the prison and saw him—he was very weak, much emaciated, and his
							countenance much changed since I saw him the week before last— I told
							him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson had called upon me, and
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Causin, who thought it indispensable
							that he should be removed from the prison to a more comfortable place—
							He asked my advice what to do, and I advised him immediately to execute
							the deed of trust to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson, who bears a
							very good character; and I urged him to have it done forthwith so that
							he might be removed to a suitable lodging before the end of the week. He
							expressed a wish that I would consent to be his trustee, which I told
							him I would be with pleasure, but that I could render him better service
							by pressing his claim at the next Session of Congress as a member, which
							I could not do if I should be his trustee— He finally consented to <hi
								rend="italic">make</hi>
							<pb n="238" type="ms"/>make the assignment to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Johnson, and requested me to call at his shop in the
							Pennsylvania avenue, and let him know. I went to the Capitol and
							enquired at the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk’s</persRef> Office,
							for the printed document of <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William
								Tudor’s</persRef> correspondence from Peru; but it had not yet come
							from the Printers Office— I got the sheets of the Journal containing the
							last days of January, and the first week in February beyond which the
							printing has not yet reached— <persRef ref="johnson-robert2"
								>Johnson</persRef> was gone to Baltimore, and <persRef
								ref="burch-samuel">Burch</persRef> is yet confined to his house but
							convalescent— I went into the Library and spent an hour and a half there
							in searching <persRef ref="pope-alexander">Pope’s</persRef> works for
								<persRef ref="concanen-matthew">Matthew Concanen</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="charteris-francis">Francis Chartres</persRef>, types
							of <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Roger B. Taney</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="whitney-reuben">Reuben M. Whitney</persRef>.— I found
							Concanen in the Dunciad, but could not find the epitaph upon Chartres—
							It seems that Pope found it dangerous to speak too roughly of Chartres—
							Returning home I called at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis
							Johnson’s house and informed him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Otis had consented to execute the deed of trust to him, and he promised
							to set about it immediately.— <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert
								Buchanan</persRef> and <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J.
								Frye</persRef> dined with us— <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart</persRef> came in after
							dinner with another posthumous claim of allowance upon the accounts in
							Peru of William Tudor and left with me a book of expences upon which he
							had entered certain charges for traveling expences, which she wishes to
							have claimed at the Department of State. Robert Buchanan and Thomas J.
							Frye spent the evening here— They had cards below, but I passed the
							Evening in my chamber, writing.</p>

						<p>Finished the Letter to <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef>, and wrote one to a Committee of the Phoenix
							Society of Hamilton College at Clinton in the State of New-York, the
							object of which Society is stated to be the improvement of its members
							in every species of Literature— The Committee inform me that I have been
							elected an honorary member of the Society, and with my answer of
							acceptance I have added some observations on its declared object— There
							are at this time in the United States eighty three universities and
							colleges. 13. of which are in New-England, six in New-York— Ten besides
							the Girard college in Pennsylvania, and nine in the State of Ohio. The
							oldest of them all is Harvard University, which in its organization is
							the model from which most of the others have been adopted— At almost all
							of them select Societies among the Students are formed of which the Phi
							Beta Kappa is the prototype— This institution has had an extraordinary
							influence upon the Literature and History of the Country— Many of these
							select Societies of Students elect honorary members <hi rend="italic"
								>and</hi>
							<pb n="239" type="ms"/>and several of them have done me that honour—
							Among the rest this Phoenix Society— But I am an unworthy member of them
							all; for I have done nothing for any of them; and really do not know to
							which of them I belong— I had a long morning visit from <persRef
								ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef>, in which we had much conversation about the
							colonization Society— He has engaged some person to negotiate the affair
							of the fugitive Slave from Alexandria, concerning whom I have an
							unanswered Letter from <persRef ref="gilpin-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Gilpin</persRef> of
							Philadelphia. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall left with me two
							numbers of the Liberia Herald, a monthly newspaper, printed at Monrovia—
							I called twice at the Office of the Secretary of War, and the second
							time, found <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef>— I had a Letter from <persRef ref="smith-mace"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mace Smith</persRef> renewing
							the solicitation for a warrant of Cadet, for his Son <persRef

							only 14 years of age the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next
							Month. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett declined, and said by the
							regulations of the Department no Cadet could be admitted under 16. years
							of age, and he must be nominated by the member of the House of
							Representatives from the Congressional District to which he belongs. I
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett if it was true that
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">A. Stevenson</persRef> had concluded
							a Treaty with the British Government—he said they had no knowledge of it

								>William Otis</persRef> died in prison this afternoon. I did not

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson went yesterday to have the

						<p>I read this morning in the Manuscripts of <persRef ref="madison-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> the Report of
							the Speech of <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander
								Hamilton</persRef>, in the Convention of 1787. upon presenting <hi
								rend="italic">his</hi> plan for a Constitution of the United States—
							The Speech occupied a whole day, and was of great ability— The plan was
							theoretically better than that which was adopted— But energetic and
							approaching the British Constitution far closer, and such as the public
							Opinions of that day never would have tolerated— Still less would it be
							endured by the democratic spirit of the present age, far more democratic
							than that— For after half a <hi rend="italic">century</hi>
							<pb n="240" type="ms"/>century of inextinguishable wars between the
							democracy of the European race and its Monarchy and Aristocracy, the
							democracy is yet in the ascendant and gaining victory after victory over
							the porcelain of the race— If Hamilton were now living he would not dare
							in an assembly of Americans, even with closed doors to avow the opinions
							of this Speech, or to present such a plan even as a speculation— I
							called at <persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lewis Johnson’s</persRef> but he was not at home— I then went to the
								<persRef ref="hunter-alexander2">Marshal’s</persRef> Office at the
							City-Hall to enquire concerning the <persRef ref="otis-william3"
								>unfortunate man</persRef> who died yesterday at the prison— I
							learnt that his disease had been of long standing—contracted before his
							confinement, though that has probably hastened his decease— The Marshal
							had made all the necessary arrangements for his interment which was
							fixed for this afternoon—between 70 and 80. dollars were found in his
							pocket-book, which with his trunk of papers and effects were sealed up
							and in charge of the Marshal’s deputy— A coroner’s inquest had been held
							over his body— I went over to the prison, and saw his corpse laid out,
							on the same bed where I had conversed with him the day before yesterday—
							The gaoler told me that before his decease the consolations and
							encouragements of religion had been administered to him by <persRef
								ref="noble-mason">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Noble</persRef>,
							Minister of the first Presbyterian Church. That he retained his Senses
							to the last moment, and died twenty minutes before six O’Clock yesterday
							afternoon— I called at <persRef ref="powers-hiram">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Powers’s</persRef> studio, and saw the
							busts in plaister which he has taken including that of <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Gaines</persRef> and my own. Thence I went to the Library of
							Congress, and spent an hour with <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope</persRef>— I found the epitaph of <persRef
								ref="charteris-francis">Chartres</persRef>, which is in a Note to

								<persRef ref="somerset-james">Somersett</persRef>, but found the

							late professor of the German language at Harvard University, now an

							“Let him that stole steal no more; but rather let him labour, working
							with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him
							that needeth.” Three progressive virtues—Honesty, Industry—Charity <hi

							<pb n="241" type="ms"/>a well divided and earnestly argued plain and

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Follen though a native German, speaking

							He gave notice that the first of a course of lectures upon the Unitarian

							After dinner I went with <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my

							John’s Church and heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>, from Numbers 6.23.
							“Speak unto <persRef ref="aaron">Aaron</persRef>, and unto his sons,
							saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto
							them. 24 The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: 25. The Lord make his face
							shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; 26. The Lord lift up his
							countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. 27. And they shall put my
							name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.” There was
							something peculiar in this Sermon— It was upon the efficacy of a
							blessing pronounced in a certain form of words: an idea to which this
							express injunction of God to <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> does
							countenance— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley urged also the
							efficacy of the form of blessing used in the episcopal church in
							dismissing the congregation— And he assured them that the absolution and
							remission of sins prescribed in the book of common prayer, was effectual
							for the remission of the sins of all true penitents— I did not consider
							this as a claim of the Ministers of the Episcopal church, though it is
							an article of faith among the roman catholics— The Ministers of the
							Episcopal Church declare and pronounce that God absolveth all those who
							are truly penitent; but it is the penitence that obtains absolution and
							not the proclamation of it by the Priest. It is perhaps even too much
							for man to say, that God pardoneth and absolveth, <hi rend="italic"
								>all</hi> those who truly repent— Man may and ought to pray that all
							true penitent may be pardoned—but pardon belongs to God alone; and the
							Priest cannot know to whom it will, or will not be extended— I had more
							than two months since, received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="palfrey-john">Professor John G. Palfrey</persRef>, at
							Cambridge, proposing to me to write an Article to be published in the
							North-American Review, upon international Copy-rights I do not feel
							prepared to undertake such an Essay— The whole theory and doctrine of
							copy rights being exceedingly loose and unsettled— I answered D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Palfrey’s Letter, this day, and opened
							some of the sources of discussion upon international copy-right which is
							encumbered with considerable difficulties— I have not absolutely
							declined writing the Article, but have asked for more time and
							consultation. There is certainly an equitable claim of compensation to
							eminent foreign authors, but the right of property in thought must be
							confined within narrow limits— I packed up this evening my trunk for my
							unwilling journey to Baltimore to-morrow.</p>

						<p>At half past 9. O’Clock this morning with my nephew <persRef

							the Railway Cars, and a quarter before twelve at Noon, landed at
							Baltimore we immediately came to <persRef ref="barnum-david"
								>Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel, where I took a bed chamber— I enquired
							immediately for the Court-house, and upon being directed to it went and
							found a City Court in Session, and <persRef ref="johnson-reverdy"
								>Reverdy Johnson</persRef> arguing a cause— Upon enquiring further I
							found the place where the Circuit Court of the United States holds their
							Sessions, but the Court had already adjourned— I then went to the Office
							of the Chronicle Newspaper, where they sent for <persRef
								ref="leakin-sheppard">General Leakin</persRef> the former editor of
							the paper, and when he came, he gave me a printed slip from the
							Chronicle of 21. July 1832—being the article which <persRef
								ref="whitney-reuben">Reuben M. Whitney</persRef>, charges as
							libellous, and for which his damages are laid at fifty thousand dollars.
							The Article charges him directly with perjury, founded upon his
							testimony and the counter testimony of the Officers of the bank before
							the Committee of investigation of the House of Representatives, at
							Philadelphia in April 1832— I enquired if I might expect to be examined
							and released to-morrow.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leakin told me
							he would consult with his counsel and see me this Evening— Returning to
							Barnum’s I found <persRef ref="rogers-lloyd">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lloyd N. Rogers</persRef> there, and he spent half an
							hour with me in my chamber— I dined at the Ordinary with about 80
							strangers at one table— After dinner I found the house of <persRef
								ref="brooks-gorham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gorham
								Brooks</persRef>, having met him in the street as I was seeking it—
							He turned back with me, and made an hour’s visit to <persRef

							both invited me to come and lodge at their House, and I told them that
							if I should remain here longer than to-morrow, I should perhaps accept
							their invitation— I returned to my chamber at Barnum’s; wrote to
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>—read the
							introductory chapter to <persRef ref="tucker-george">George
								Tucker’s</persRef> life of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas

							the other room being crowded with 130 persons, the accession of about
							fifty being of travellers arriving from North and South since dinner—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnum himself being absent in
							North-Carolina— At half past eight in the Evening M<hi

							Partner, <persRef ref="meredith-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Meredith</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>his
							Council came, and I conversed with them on the prospects of the time
							when the trial will come on— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meredith
							said it could not possibly be to-morrow, nor probably any day this week—
							He said also that the parties on both sides were anxious for a trial and
							the counsel on both sides had asked the court to fix a day for the
							trial, which the Court had refused— I finally agreed to stay here till
							to-morrow afternoon— To attend the Court to-morrow Morning when another
							effort may be made to fix a day for the <pb n="243" type="ms"/>trial,
							and if that should fail, I return to Washington to morrow evening, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meredith will send me notice a day in
							advance, when I must attend again— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Meredith promised to call on me at 10 O’Clock to-morrow Morning—
								<persRef ref="gay-peyton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Payton
								Gay</persRef> called on me, while I was engaged with these

							Adams, that <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef>, and <persRef

								>John Quincy Adams</persRef> for Philadelphia, going on to Quincy,
							and <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert Buchanan</persRef> to
							Annapolis— At 10 O’Clock <persRef ref="meredith-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Meredith</persRef> called and I went
							with him to the Circuit Court of the United States held by <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Roger B. Taney</persRef>, now Chief Justice
							of the United States, and <persRef ref="heath-upton">Upton

								ref="leakin-sheppard">Leakin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="barnes-samuel">Barnes</persRef> the parties were not ready for

							should be brought on if possible next week, if possible on Monday, but
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meredith thought my testimony would
							probably not be required before Wednesday. I determined therefore to
							return to Washington this Evening— On leaving the Court-house I went
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meredith to his house, where he gave
							me to read a manuscript copy of a Letter from the late <persRef
								ref="lee-henry3">Major Henry Lee</persRef> to a friend of his named
								<persRef ref="brown-richard">Brown</persRef> in Virginia, whom he
							requests to send a copy of it to <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Tyler</persRef> then a member of
							the Senate of the United States from Virginia.— Henry Lee an abandoned
							and scarified character, but a writer of very considerable talent and
							power, had in reward for treachery to me, and libels against me, and of
							sycophancy to the late <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef>, been appointed by him during the recess of the
							Senate, Consul General of the United States at Algiers in 1829. Upon his
							nomination to the Senate, he had been rejected for profligacy of
							character, and chiefly by the influence of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tyler— In the interval he had been at Algiers; was there
							when the City was taken by the French army, and was said to have made a
							profitable speculation of his official privilege in covering property
							with the aegis of Neutrality— This has however has been contradicted— On
							being displaced from his office, he went to Paris and lived there till
							in January last he died; it is said of the grippe or influenza— In Paris
							he pursued the occupation of a man of Letters, publishing pamphlets of
							criticism and controversy, among which one attack upon my Eulogy on
								<persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>; which he sent to the
							Editor of the New-York American <persRef ref="king-charles">Charles
								King</persRef>— King a man under greater personal obligations to me
							than any man living, published Lee’s lampoon, and then wrote me that the
							columns of his paper were open to me, if I chose to answer <hi
								rend="italic">Henry Lee</hi>— But <hi rend="italic">among</hi>
							<pb n="244" type="ms"/>among Lee’s literary labours was a life of
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</persRef>, of
							which he had published one volume and had another in preparation—a work
							of great promise and small performance, making of Napoleon an idol— This
							Letter to Brown was evidently intended for publication— It had been
							preceded by a Letter demanding directly or indirectly of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler his <hi rend="italic">reasons</hi>
							for voting against Lee’s appointment of Consul to Algiers— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler had denied his right to make this
							enquiry, but had assigned Lee’s vicious character as his motive for
							voting against his appointment. This Letter is Lee’s reply to that
							answer of Tyler— He assumes that the only ground of Tyler’s objection to
							his character was that he had committed adultery with <persRef
								ref="lee-anne">his wife’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="mccarty-elizabeth">sister</persRef>— He then affirms that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler had been a constant,
							undeviating, devoted admirer and supporter of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef> throughout life;
							thinking him not only qualified but pre-eminently entitled to the
							highest office of the Nation, and had pronounced upon him after his
							death an enthusiastic panegyric; yet Thomas Jefferson for twelve years
							in succession had exerted all his faculties, being himself a married
							man, to debauch <persRef ref="walker-elizabeth3">the wife</persRef> of
							his most intimate friend <persRef ref="walker-john4">John
								Walker</persRef>; abusing for that purpose of the opportunities
							afforded him by sacred and confidential trusts— He affirms morever that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson had several coloured
							children by <persRef ref="hemings-sally">his own Slaves</persRef>— And
							he concludes that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler’s double measure
							of morality between Jefferson attempts at seduction, and his Lee’s
							accomplished purpose, arose merely from Jefferson’s failure, and his own
							success— The Letter is of ten folio pages, and written in the most
							ambitious style; as if he was all the time studying to write elegant
							periods— He says that he has all the facts detailed in Jefferson’s own
							handwriting, in correspondence with <persRef ref="lee-henry2">his
								father</persRef>, who undertook to reconcile Jefferson with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Walker
							and succeeded— This unlucky episode in the life of Jefferson, was used
							against him by the federalists in his life time as much as they

							it opened to him an entirely new view of the Scriptures— I believe this
							is the case with many others, and that I should do well to write a
							Dissertation or Lyceum Lecture upon it. The Scriptures represent man, as
							having at his creation a Law prescribed to him by his Creator— He is
							placed in Eden thereto remain in a happy state of connubial felicity,
							upon one condition— This is not a covenant, but a Law— The consent of
								<persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef> was not required to this
							Law—there is permission given him to subsist upon the fruit of all the
							trees, excepting one—but no promise is made to him; no covenant
							contracted with him— He violates the condition imposed upon him, and
							suffers expulsion from Paradise— There is no mention of a Covenant till
							after the Deluge, but immediately after that there is a Covenant,
							express and formal with <persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>— This however
							is of a general character, and Noah himself by his curse upon <persRef
								ref="ham">Ham</persRef>, deprived one third part of his descendants
							of the benefit of it. But the Covenants with <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef> are the most remarkable both for their solemnity
							and for their import— They were covenants <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
							<pb n="246" type="ms"/>of Religion and of Government— The first was at
							Sichem—Gen: 12.7. the second at Bethel—Gen. 13.14— The third and most
							solemn covenant is related in the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							chapter with all its particulars and specially stated, in the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse— The 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> is related in the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Chapter when Abraham was 99 years of age; and the covenant was sealed by
							the rite of circumcision— In the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							chapter—verses 17.18 the covenant is again renewed, after the call for
							the sacrifice of <persRef ref="isaac">Isaac</persRef> and its release.

								>Matthias’s</persRef> Edition of <persRef ref="gray-thomas"
								>Gray’s</persRef> works, and wandered over it till the clock struck
							three and warned me to depart— I found in it the analysis of the

							some of his Letters to <persRef ref="gray-dorothy">his mother</persRef>,

								<persRef ref="west-richard">West</persRef>; and mused over that

							written, in a Letter to West, who died just before he should have
							received it— I have literary tastes peculiar to myself, and the
							correctness of which I distrust, because they differ from the general
							voice— There is no Lyric Poet of antient or modern times, who so deeply

							continues unwell, and kept her chamber, and her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, was confined the whole day
							to her bed— I attended Church alone— In the morning at the Presbyterian
							Church where <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fowler</persRef> preached from Galatians 3.13. “Christ
							hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for
							us.”—another, and I hope the last of a series of discourses upon the
							doctrine of the atonement—vicarious punishment— I grow more and more
							impatient under this argumentation ad absurdum. That Christ should have
							died to atone for the sins of mankind before his birth and sufferings is
							intelligible, and as figuratively spoken is undoubtedly true— But that
							he should have died to atone for all the sins committed after his death
							to the end of the world, is giving the lie to all the faculties of human
							reason— And the more earnest and intense the sincerity of the preacher
							of such tenets appears the more manifest he makes the impotence of the
							rational faculty in man— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler
							entertains no doubts respecting this Article of his creed— He urged it
							with the most implicit faith—but one sample of his reasoning will serve
							for all the rest—in maintaining with the most fervent anxiety, that only
							a small portion of mankind could be saved he quoted John 17.9. “I pray
							not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are
							thine.”— This certainly has the appearance of selection, and I was
							ruminating upon the force of this authority when M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Fowler to prove the universal goodness of God, quoted John
							3.16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son,
							&amp;c—and the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse says—For God sent
							not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world
							through him might be saved— The first Epistle of John 2.2 is still
							stronger—“And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours
							only, but also for the sins of the whole world”— The weight of authority
							is therefore entirely against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler’s
							argument of Selection— But perhaps the word world in these passages is
							used in different senses— In the last of the passages it evidently means
							all mankind—but the world that was to be saved; the whole world for
							whose sins he is the propitiation consists only of those who repent and
								<pb n="249" type="ms"/>and believe his holy Gospel— Repentance and
							Faith are the conditions of Salvation by Christ, and that was the
							doctrine preached by the Apostles to their cotemporaries; sinners to be
							converted— The atonement of Christ for the sins of men, is figurative
							and metaphorical language, adopted from the Jewish sacrifices of the
							Passover— Christ is the paschal lamb; but it would be more rational to
							say that Christians worship a sheep—because Christ is called the lamb of
							God, than it is to say that my sins have been forgiven before they were
							committed, because Jesus was crucified at Jerusalem more than eighteen
							hundred years ago— According to the Levitical Law, the sacrifice of a
							lamb, made atonement for sin— That is to say, after the sacrifice, there
							was to be no further temporal punishment— There was no hereafter in the
							Law of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>— Christ proclaimed the
							immortality of the Soul, and rewards and punishments after death— This
							doctrine indirectly demolished the whole system of the Mosaic Law, and
							for this Christ died upon the cross— So then as the paschal lamb, was an
							atonement for sins before committed, and released the Sinner who offered
							it, from further temporal punishment, so Jesus having died to establish
							the doctrine of immortal life and future retribution, is by analogy said
							to have substituted himself for the paschal lamb, and thus to have taken
							away the sins of the world.— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read Prayers, for the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday after Easter and preached
							from Zechariah 12.10. “And I will pour upon the house of <persRef

							the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look upon me,
							whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth
							for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in
							bitterness for his first born.” This last idea was the ruling one in his
							own mind; and he alluded feelingly to his own loss of a Son, sometime—
							How bitterly did his text bring to my Soul the repeated loss of mine!—
							After Church I went and visited <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi

							speaking, verses.— The thought struck me this morning of writing an
							Acrostic, on the word Autograph— I actually wrote two and finding the
							word to consist of nine Letters, it naturally led me to the nine lined
							Stanza of <persRef ref="spencer-edmund">Spenser’s</persRef> Fairy Queen,
							which I had never before attempted— But in the second of my Acrostics
							the word Phrenology presented itself to me, and then there was room for
							imagination far beyond my reach— I wrote however two more Stanzas and
							left the subject scarcely entered upon— I received from the Engineer
							Office of the War Department a Warrant for conditional admission to the
							Military Academy at West-Point as a Cadet, of <persRef
								ref="tower-zealous">Zealous B. Tower</persRef>, son of <persRef

							I enclosed it to his father; and answered also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="browne-o">O. H. Browne</persRef> of Rome in the State of
							New-York, proposing to publish a Volume of Eulogies— <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas B. J. Frye</persRef> came in last
							Evening after we had retired. Slept here and breakfasted with us this
							morning— I attended this day two funerals— The first at Noon, that of
								<persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Chauncey’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>, from <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Latimer’s</persRef> House— There was
							a numerous collection of Carriages, <persRef

								>all the heads of Departments</persRef> except <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>,
							and many Ladies— There was no performance of religious rites at the
							House, and I did not go with the procession of Carriages to the grave.
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Latimers house, is that in which the
							late <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War, Lewis Cass</persRef>
							resided, and the rooms where the attendants at the funeral were
							received, were the same where a little more than one year ago, in March
							1836 I was at a splendid diplomatic dinner— It was the last time that I
							had been in the rooms; and many changes have since happened— The
							contemplation was more suitable to the occasion than cheering— I came
							home; dined and at 4 in the afternoon went and attended the funeral of
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Joseph Anderson</persRef>, with whose
							life many recollections were associated— He was a native of
							Pennsylvania, born in 1757— At the age of 19. in 1776 entered the army
							as a lieutenant at the commencement of the revolutionary War—served
							through the whole Revolution during which he rose to the rank of Major—
							After the War he removed to the State of Delaware and practiced Law—in
							February 1791. he was appointed by <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>President Washington</persRef> one of the Judges of the
							Southwestern Territory; and when that became the State of Tennessee in
							1797. he was elected one of her first Senators in the Senate of the
							United States—from that time till March 1815 he continued in that
							station; and then was appointed by <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, first Comptroller
							of the Treasury— This Office he held upwards of twenty years untill
							early in last Summer— He had then a stroke of palsy, which disabled him
							for the remainder of his days— He resigned his Office and he lived with
							his son <persRef ref="anderson-william">William</persRef> in this City—
							About a week since he had an attack of the gravel, which he had no
							strength of <pb n="251" type="ms"/>strength of Constitution left to
							resist, and under which he expired yesterday morning in the eightieth
							year of his age— I served with him five years in the Senate of the
							United States from 1803 to 1808. during the latter part of which he was
							one of my confidential friends and correspondents— The correspondence
							continued some time after I left the Senate— When I returned from Europe
							in 1817, he was first comptroller of the Treasury—he retained that place
							through <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe’s</persRef> administration and mine, and nearly seven years
							of that of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>— He
							was a plain, laborious, honest man; a fluent and agreeable, but not a
							powerful public Speaker— A mind a little above the average capacity of
							men with moderate education, and not much— As comptroller of the
							Treasury he had sunk into little more than a drudge, and had grown
							heavy, as he grew old— I had not seen him since his retirement, and knew
							not that he was in the City, till this Morning’s Intelligencer announced
							his decease— The Coffin was left open as he was lying in it, and I saw
							the ruin of a face long so familiar and so friendly to me. <persRef
								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie</persRef>
							delivered a pious exhortation and a fervent prayer over it— Most of the
							subordinate Officers of the Government were there, but none of the heads
							of Department. Several women; not known to me— I followed the herse and
							the procession of Carriages to the grave; and saw the coffin deposited
							in his last home— The weather was chilling. I got home about Sunset, and
							wrote in the Evening— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">two children</persRef>
							are still confined to the chamber, and were visited by <persRef

						<p>I answered a Letter from <persRef ref="whittier-john">John G.
								Whittier</persRef> inviting me on the part of the managers of the
							Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, to attend the meeting of the
							New-England Anti-Slavery Convention at Boston, to be held on the last
							Tuesday of May. I have not absolutely declined to attend, but have
							assigned reasons for not attending which will probably be decisive to my
							own mind— Upon this subject of Anti-Slavery, my principles and my
							position make it necessary for me to be more circumspect in my conduct
							than belongs to my Nature— I have therefore already committed
							indiscretions of which all the political parties avail themselves to
							proscribe me in the public opinion— The most insignificant error of
							conduct in me at this time would be my irredeemable ruin in this world,
							and both the ruling political parties are watching with intense anxiety
							for some overt act by me, to set the whole pack of their hireling
							Presses upon me. It is also to be considered that at this time the most
							dangerous of all the subjects for public contention is the Slavery
							question— In the South it is a perpetual agony of conscious guilt and
							terror, attempting to disguise itself under sophistical argumentation
							and braggart menaces. In the North, the People favour the whites and
							fear the blacks of the South— The Politicians count the South because
							they want their votes— The abolitionists are gathering themselves into
							Societies increasing their numbers and thriving upon persecution— But in
							proportion as they increase in numbers and in zeal they kindle the
							opposition against themselves into a flame; and the Passions of the
							Populace, are all engaged against them— The exposure through which I
							passed at the late Session of Congress was greater than I could have
							imagined possible: and having <hi rend="italic">escaped</hi>
							<pb n="252" type="ms"/>escaped from that fiery furnace, it behooves me
							well to consider my ways before I put myself in the way of being cast
							into it again— On the other hand may God preserve me from the craven
							Spirit of shrinking from danger in the discharge of my duty— Between
							these two errors let me pursue the path of rectitude unmov’d, and put my
							trust in God.— I called this morning at the Office of the Secretary of
							State— <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef> was not there; but I left the Letters of <persRef
								ref="herkimer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

								>Chief Clerk</persRef> for enquiry concerning the papers of the

								Jarvis</persRef> and walked with him nearly to the Capitol— While we
							were at dinner two persons called upon me on visits merely of curiosity—
							One from Poughkeepsie New-York named <persRef ref="u">Palen</persRef>—
							The other from Port Tobacco who did not tell me his name— At Evening

						<p>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="meredith-jonathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. Meredith</persRef> of
							Baltimore, written on Tuesday afternoon, notifying me that I need not
							hurry myself to attend the United States Circuit Court there, as the
							case of <persRef ref="whitney-reuben">Whitney</persRef> vs <persRef
								ref="leakin-sheppard">Leakin</persRef> would not come on before
							Friday, and perhaps not till next Monday; and promising to write me
							again in a day or two. <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall</persRef> was here to renew a
							request for an accommodation which it is not in my power to make, and
							which I was reluctantly compelled to decline— In reviewing my files of
							papers, I found two Letters requiring information at the Treasury
							Department which I had overlooked— I took them and left them with the
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury</persRef>— One was from
								<persRef ref="nye-nelson">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B.
								Nye</persRef> of Wareham, soliciting some interposition of the
							Secretary to relieve the merchants and Shipmasters at Wareham from the
							necessity of going 15 Miles to New-Bedford to enter their vessels at the
							Custom House— There is a Petition which was before Congress at both
							their Sessions, from Wareham, to be made a Port of Entry; and a section
							to that effect was introduced into the Custom-house Bill, but it was not
							reached in the business of the house. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nye
							wrote to me requesting me to enquire if the Secretary of the Treasury
							could not appoint a deputy collector at Wareham with power to enter
							vessels there— I read the Petition and the Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury, who said a deputy collector was
							in some places appointed, and said if I would leave the Papers, he would
							examine the subject and send me an answer.— The other Letter was from
								<persRef ref="ellis-william2">William Ellis</persRef> of Dedham,
							making enquiries in behalf of a family there by the name of <persRef
								ref="u">Guild</persRef>; having some claim to prize money from the
							proceeds of captures made by <persRef ref="jones-john-paul">Paul
								Jones</persRef> and his squadron in 1779— It appears there was a sum
							paid into the Treasury many years ago for the benefit of those captors;
							and in the naval appropriation bill of the last Session, an
							appropriation was made, which the Secretary of <pb n="253" type="ms"/>of
							the Treasury was required to pay to such legal representatives of the
							claimants as should substantiate their right to a part of the proceeds—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury took M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ellis’s Letter, which he said he would refer to the <persRef
								ref="harrison-richard">first auditor</persRef> and make me
							acquainted with the result— I then walked to the Capitol and visited the
							Library. It was past two and I had but a short time to remain there— I
							found there the second Volume of the English translation of <persRef
								ref="tocqueville-alexis">de Tocqueville’s</persRef> work upon
							democracy in the United States, over several chapters of which I cast my
							eyes— Tocqueville observed much more of what he saw in the United
							States, than most other European travellers; but I soon found that he
							had observed many things very superficially. At three the hour of
							closing the library came and I walked home— <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S.
								Smith</persRef> came in after dinner— I walked round the square and
							the six Buildings; and we had cards in the Evening— I began the answer
							to a Letter from <persRef ref="hayward-elijah">Elijah Hayward</persRef>,
							of Columbus. Ohio, heretofore Commissioner of the general Land Office.
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary’s</persRef> cough continues very

						<p><persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> was here again this morning
							and brought me sundry unsettled Bills— I gave him a certificate of

							They have lived with us three years; and left us the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month, the day that I went to
							Baltimore— They are English: the woman of an excellent character, and so
							useful as an attendant and occasional Nurse to <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, that we both lament
							the loss of her service— Wilson himself is a man of good faculties, and
							mechanical faculties more than common—but proud, self-conceited, and
							sometimes disrespectful; though he has never been so to me— Change of
							Servants is always very disagreeable to me, and in the course of my
							life, I have had occasion to turn away few— But the relation between
							Master and Servant, is one of the most controversial conditions of human
							existence— It is difficult for the parties to discharge their respective
							duties to each other; and I must say that in my experience of life, the
							character of a good master has appeared to me to be more rare than that
							of a good Servant.— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was here this morning; looking better
							than when I saw him last Sunday at his house; but with a fearful cough
							upon him, and spitting of blood— I finished my Letter to <persRef
								ref="hayward-elijah">Elijah Hayward</persRef>, and wrote one in
							answer to an old one received from <persRef ref="thayer-a">A. W.
								Thayer</persRef> at Philadelphia— During the Session of Congress I
							received so many Letters of enquiries to be made at the Departments,
							besides the multitudes with abolition petitions, that I had scarcely
							time to read and file many of them. I could not possibly keep my files
							in regular order. I filed them from time to time, and left them on my
							table— Since the close of the Session of Congress I have been constantly
							occupied in ovehawling them; assorting them in alphabetical files;
							making the desired enquiries at the Departments, and answering the
							Letters— I am coming to the fiftieth day of this labour and found a
							Letter from <persRef ref="beard-alexander">Alexander Beard</persRef>,
							dated at Rome in the <hi rend="italic">State</hi>
							<pb n="254" type="ms"/>State of New-York, asking information of me,
							whether his mother, being a widow of a revolutionary pensioner, is
							entitled to a Pension, and requesting an answer by return of the mail— I
							received this Letter dated the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							February on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of that month, in the
							midst of my troubles in the House—put it upon file, and there it has
							escaped my attention till this day— I took it and left it with <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Edwards</persRef>, the Commissioner of Pensions, requesting him to
							enable me to answer it— I then walked round the Capitol, and in walking
							composed a Sonnet— This is an easy exercise, and the most convenient
							form for autographs and albums— I have several Letters on hand from
							strangers requesting these; and am often at great loss how to answer
							them— Too many remain unanswered— My difficulty is barrenness of
							Imagination— One poetical idea, is enough for a Sonnet; but when I
							compare together those that I have written at different times, I am
							humiliated on finding how unconsciously, my thoughts always run, in one
							narrow channel— Among my musings of this day, I was analyzing the
							sentiment, the versification and the Poetry, of the song “When the
							Fancy-stirring bowl” admiring its exquisite beauty, shuddering at its
							licentious morality, and envying the powers of its author.— What
							creative imagery! what delicacy of expression to convey thoughts of the
							coarsest sensuality! what embellishments of drunkenness and lust! what a
							veil of tenderness, and benevolence cast over their nakedness! what
							graphic description! and what adaptation of sense to sound, in the
							greatest harmony of numbers— The English language swarms with beautiful
							Songs; but this is one of the most charming of them all. <persRef

							respecting an application for a Pension of a man named <persRef
								ref="tryon-salmon">Salmon Tryon</persRef>— It has remained

							of a Letter from Tryon himself to <persRef ref="taylor-frank"
								>Taylor</persRef> the bookseller in this City, so insulting to the
								<persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of Pensions</persRef>, an
							excellent, and most faithful Officer, that I had neglected it as
							deserving no answer— But I took it this morning to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, and left it with him, asking some
							explanation of the facts. In the course of the day I received his
							answers, both relating to this case, and to the Letter from <persRef
								ref="beard-alexander">Alexander Beard</persRef>— Tryon’s claim for a
							Pension was founded on his having been keeper of a Jail during the

								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, upon the
							application of <persRef ref="nye-nelson">B. Nye</persRef> of
							Wareham—unfavourable—and a Note from <persRef ref="dayton-aaron">M<hi

							without success. <persRef ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi

							making a colossal Statue of <persRef ref="john">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> John the Evangelist</persRef>, for the pediment of a
							new Roman Catholic Church that they are building there— I asked him if
							the Statue was of Marble? He said <hi rend="italic">no</hi>— <pb n="255"
								type="ms"/>no—but of a material much harder than marble, a
							composition of the <hi rend="italic">Cement</hi> used in the building of
							the canal, with some other ingredients of his own choice— The
							composition was so much harder than marble that by working upon it only
							a few weeks, he had worn out a hammer, which he had used for years
							before in working upon marble, without wasting it at all, so that he had
							now been obliged to procure a new one— He said he intended to take out a
							Patent for his composition—but he had also discovered about eight miles
							from Frederick and within three miles of the Baltimore and
							Ohio-Rail-way, a quarry of the finest marble he had ever beheld—far
							superior to that of Carrara—white as snow, of the finest grain, and
							without a speck— And the rock instead of being buried under ground, rose
							several feet above it— That he had purchased four Acres of the Land
							bearing this marble, from which he could easily procure blocks of
							various sizes, as he might occasionally want them— He said he was now
							employed by the <persRef ref="noland-william">Commissioner of the Public
								Buildings</persRef>, for various works of Sculpture, upon the
							Treasury and Patent-Offices now under construction and at the Capitol— I
							have some need of Faith to credit his wonderful discoveries of a cement
							much harder than marble, and of a quarry of marble far superior to that
							of Carrara— He spoke of the two Busts of me by <persRef
								ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="powers-hiram">Powers</persRef>—preferring the latter— I
							answered a Letter from <persRef ref="pitkin-timothy">M<hi

							in my Eulogy on <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>. I
							found it necessary to recur to some old documents of 1805–6– and 7.—part
							of them I found in <persRef ref="waite-thomas">Waite’s</persRef> State

							for my set of the Edition of State Papers published by Gales and

						<p>Rainy day— I attended the morning service at the Presbyterian Church, and
							heard <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from James 4:13 [“]Go to, now, ye that say, To-day
							or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and
							buy and sell, and get gain; 14. Whereas ye know now what shall be on the
							morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a
							little time, and then vanisheth away. 15. For that ye ought to say, If
							the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that. 16. But now ye
							rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. 17. Therefore to
							him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler discoursed suitably upon this text
							to a very slender auditory, and it gave me much to meditate upon—as the
							time is hourly approaching when I must be called to my account—and I was
							thus occupied a considerable part of the day— There was no afternoon
							service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church; and the rain
							was so heavy that I did not go out— But I wrote an answer to the Letter
							from <persRef ref="nye-nelson">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> D.
								Nye</persRef> of Wareham which had been two Months on my file, and
							read some pages of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Madison’s</persRef> report of the Speeches in the
							federal Convention of 1787.— I was remarkably struck with the
							proposition and Speech of <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin</persRef> on the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June.— They had been debating then
							nearly two Months, and appeared to approach no result. The perpetually
							recurring Jealousy was between the large and the small States— The 15.
							Resolutions proposed by <persRef ref="randolph-edmund">Edmund
								Randolph</persRef> had formed the text of all the discussions. They
							were the germ of the Constitution as finally adopted— Then came the plan
							of <persRef ref="paterson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patterson</persRef> of New-Jersey; which was to retain the old
							Confederation and Congress with some additional powers— This was the
							plan of the small States— Then the plan of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef>, with a President and
							Senate during good behaviour; a negative upon State Laws, and the
							Governors of the States appointed by the National Executive— The manner
							in which Hamilton introduced his plan, was indirect and hesitating; the
							characteristics of his mind and conduct— He expressly stated that he did
							not offer it as a subject for deliberation, but merely to convey his
							ideas of what was the best Government for this Country— Yet he supported
							it by a Speech which occupied a whole day; and he explicitly declared
							that neither the plan founded upon Edmund Randolph’s Resolutions, nor
							the plan of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson was satisfactory to
							him— Afterwards came <persRef ref="martin-luther">Luther
								Martin</persRef>, who made a Speech of a day and a half to maintain
							the Sovereignty of the States, and against proportional representation,
							and against a Legislature in two branches. The proportional
							representation was after long and obstinate resistance carried for one
							branch— It was contended for with equal tenacity in the other when D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin moved that they should have
							prayers performed every morning; calling upon the clergymen of the
							several Churches of the City in turn— It was a singular proposition to
							be made, after the Convention had been sitting nearly two Months, and
							the Doctor’s <hi rend="italic">Speech</hi>
							<pb n="257" type="ms"/>Speech was still more remarkable— He was then
							upwards of eighty years of age and he died within three years after— In
							this speech he declared with great solemnity his belief that God governs
							in the affairs of men— At an earlier period of his life he had certainly
							been a skeptic. His motion was seconded by <persRef ref="sherman-roger"
								>Roger Sherman</persRef>—but was opposed by Hamilton and others and
							finally evaded by an adjournment— It had perhaps a good effect as an
							admonition of mutual concessions and conciliation to all the
							members.</p>

						<p>We had intermitted making fires in my Cabinet and in our bed chamber, for
							the last ten days, but the weather has become so cold that we could no
							longer dispense entirely with them— The thermometer in my chamber
							ranging from 50 to 55—but the inconvenience of the anthracite coal is,
							that with it, you can have no small fires— It must burn intensely or
							goes out— I suffered considerably this day from cold— I answered a
							Letter received on the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February last
							from <persRef ref="grimke-sarah">Sarah M. Grimké</persRef> written at
							New-York, and containing enquiries concerning the Coastwise Slave-trade—
							The size of the vessels, and the number of the Slaves that they carry
							with them— This is the last of the long standing Letters upon my files
							which accumulated during the late Session of Congress, and which I have
							been constantly occupied in answering for fifty days since its close—
							Excepting only Letters asking for autographs, which puzzle me more than
							all the rest; and no small number of which remain unanswered altogether—
							There was in the National Intelligencer of this Morning an Editorial
							Article written after my Conversation with <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> of last
							Saturday, and to which is added an extract from my suppressed Speech of
							4. April 1834. on the removal of the Deposits— I had mentioned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales that Speech as foreshewing much of
							what is now coming to pass; but the passage of the Speech to which I
							alluded was not that extracted in the Intelligencer of this Morning—
							This induced me to read over the suppressed Speech, and to my surprize
							the passage to which I referred was not in it— I concluded it was in
							another Speech, made on the preceding 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of March, upon presenting the Resolutions of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts— I went to the Office of the National Intelligencer and
							finding neither of the Editors there walked round the Capitol, and on
							returning found <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Seaton</persRef> at the Office— Gales came in
							afterwards— I asked if their Register of Debates for the first Session
							of the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress 1833–34 was printed so
							that I could refer to a debate contained in it— Seaton found upon
							examination that although wholly printed, the volumes were not yet so
							folded and stitched that they could be referred to—but he promised me
							that a set of them should be prepared for me in a day or two— Seaton had
							just returned from Boston and Cambridge, where he had been to replace
								<persRef ref="seaton-joseph">his Son</persRef>, at the University,
							where he is a member of the Senior Class— He left him at board with
								<persRef ref="ware-henry">professor Ware</persRef> the elder— After
							dinner <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-elizabeth">young Ladies</persRef> rode out,
							and <persRef ref="frye-thomas">T. B. J. Frye</persRef> returned with
							them to pass the Night here. I have not received the Quincy Patriot of
							the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and was apprehensive the Paper <hi
								rend="italic">had</hi>
							<pb n="258" type="ms"/>had fallen through, the partnership of the
							<persRef ref="green-john2;obsorne-edmund">two Editors</persRef>
							having been dissolved on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this
							Month—but in the National Inquirer of Philadelphia, of Saturday last,
							and this day received, I find an extract from the Quincy Patriot of the
								15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> being the closing paragraphs of my
							last Address, (of 20. March) to the Inhabitants of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts—
							It has therefore been published— The Hingham Gazette has republished one
							or two of my Addresses without comment. But not one of the Boston
							Newspapers so far as I have seen, has even given notice that such
							Addresses existed; although while they have been in the course of
							publication the Anti-Slavery Resolutions of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts were debated and adopted— This universal Silence upon my
							Addresses, compared with the vehement yet inconsistent proceedings of
							the Legislature, is indicative of an excited and yet tremulous state of
							public opinion upon the subject. Its admonition is, composure and
							caution— The Legislature of Massachusetts, adjourned on the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> The two Houses had passed an act raising
							the pay of their members from 2 dollars to 2 dollars and a half a day—
							It was returned by <persRef ref="everett-edward">Governor Edward
								Everett</persRef> with objections; and they repassed it with
							majorities of more than two thirds in both Houses— This falling out
							between Everett, and the members of the Legislature, on a question about
							their pay, will be likely to have a serious influence upon the future
							politics of the State.</p>

						<p>The cold weather and the necessity for a fire in my chamber continues and
							with it a chill upon my fingers partially disables my fingers from
							writing. So I attempt to read with no better success— I wrote a short
							Letter to <persRef ref="david-virgil">Virgil David</persRef>, and walked
							to the Capitol and visited the Library of Congress— I examined the
							second Volume of <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton’s</persRef> collection of
							American State Papers on their foreign Relations— I found among them
							many valuable public documents which I had not before seen or had very
							slightly perused— Among the rest several Memoirs of <persRef
								ref="livingston-robert">Robert R. Livingston</persRef> addressed to
							Napoleon, dissuading him from the settlement of his Colony in Louisiana,
							and then to cede it to the United States— It seems as if there was
							something providential in the turn of all those transactions— The
							Spanish Monarchy, was an old worn out rotten Government dropping to
							pieces by the weight of its own corruptions— <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> shaking it almost to
							atoms first by War—then stripping it of its European possessions;
							encroaching upon it over the Pyrenees to the Ebro; forcing its
							pusillanimous Bourbons to abdicate; and the <persRef ref="charles-iv"
								>father</persRef> and <persRef ref="marialouisa">mother</persRef>
							with her despicable paramour <persRef ref="godoy-manuel"
							>Godoy</persRef>, to go and die in ignominious obscurity at Rome; and
							the son <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand</persRef>—“Ame lache et
							pusillanime,[”] as <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>
							characterized him to me, to abdicate and pine in prison at Bayonne— In
							the preliminary steps to all this process, because Louisiana had once
							been a French Colony, Napoleon undertakes to recover it, and to settle
							there a <hi rend="italic">Military</hi> Colony of his veteran Soldiers—
							Having a triangular view for futurity upon Mexico, upon Canada and the
							British Northern Colonies, and upon the United States— R. R. Livingston
							was then Minister from the United States, at his Court, and ingratiated
							himself, by falling in without scruple, into the Ultra-royal Etiquette
							of the imperial Upstart—and coming from the stern Republican Government
							of the U.S. <pb n="259" type="ms"/>United States, this species of
							adulation was more flattering than it could be from the representatives
							of Monarchs— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston thus obtained
							access to the ear of Napoleon, who received and read his paper.— They
							had no effect until the War with Great Britain came on—but then they
							found the mind prepared for the reception of argument, and when the War
							was once resolved on Louisiana became a burden which it was the clear
							interest of France to get rid of as soon as possible and upon as good
							terms as she could obtain. The finger of Heaven appears in all this, and
							when we think of <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jay’s</persRef> proposing in 1786 to renounce the Navigation of the
							Mississippi for 25 years, and in 1794 negotiating for the delivery of
							the Posts on the Canadian Lakes, and observe the condition of things
							now, when the City of Mexico can scarcely be kept out of our clutches,
							we can but contemplate with wonder the ways of God to Man— But upon
							looking at our two frontiers North and South it is no pleasing
							consideration to find that while our boundary has been constantly
							advancing on the South, it has been receding on the North— I found at
							the Library in the National Intelligencer of 20. March 1834. the passage
							of my Speech on the removal of the Deposits to which I had alluded in
							the conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales last
							Saturday— It was not in the suppressed Speech, but in the Speech made on
							presenting the Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts—
							Returning home I called at the National Intelligencer Office, where I
							found that my Speech of 20 March 1834. was in the Register of the
							Debates of that Session now printed, but the 4. Volumes of which are not
							yet bound— <persRef ref="featherstonhaugh-george"

						<p>Chilling Cold and winter stock of coal exhausted. I had time to write a

							an attempt to assort and file my papers which have been accumulating
							during the late Session of Congress, but soon found the morning wasted,
							and little advance made in my assortment. I found however a small file
							of Letters from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="lee-arthur">Arthur Lee</persRef> from 1778 to 1786
							with one from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee to him—without date or
							signature but written in 1788 immediately after his return from Europe
							in 1788. which were given to me by the <persRef ref="lee-richard3"
								>younger Richard Henry Lee</persRef>, in 1827. and 1828. I now read
							them all, and they took me back a full half century, and more; even to
							the days of my boyhood— The Letters written at different times mark each
							the feelings and the interests of a different epoch. The first, written
							in September 1778. contains a proposition to employ <persRef
								ref="franklin-william">William Temple Franklin</persRef> as
							Secretary to the joint Commission; and another that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee who resided at Chaillot should come
							and reside at the same house of <persRef ref="chaumont-jacques">Le Ray

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin</persRef> and my father
							lived, for the convenience of holding their conferences with an improved
							economy of time and of expense— The next is of 24. March 1779. at Brest,
							when my father was about to return to the United States— I was then
							reading Don Quichotte de la Manche in the Cabin of the Frigate Alliance,
							or walking the Streets of Brest with <persRef ref="landais-pierre"
								>Captain Landais</persRef>— Then a Letter of 9. June 1779 from <hi
								rend="italic">L’Orient </hi><pb n="260" type="ms"/>L’Orient.— Next
							three Letters from Paris, dated 15 and 31. March 1780. in the
							hand-writing of <persRef ref="thaxter-john2">John Thaxter</persRef>, and
							one of 25. May; all directed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee at
							L’Orient where he was waiting for a passage in the frigate Alliance to
							the United States— Then a Letter from the Hague 29. Augustus 1782. to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee then in Congress at Philadelphia—
							One from Paris 12. April 1783 between the Preliminary Articles and the
							definitive Treaty of Peace—one of 6. April 1784 from the Hague—one of
							31. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1785 from Auteuil; and one of 6.
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1785. from Grosvenor Square,
							Westminster— The Letter from Arthur Lee to him is of 8. August 1788.
							without date of place and unsigned— No doubt a copy— It acknowledges the
							receipt of a Letter from my father announcing his return to his home at
							Braintree— This Series of Letters marks all the changes of my father’s
							residence from the time of his first Mission to France till his last
							return from Europe home. I selected the Letter of 24. March 1779.
							written at Brest, to send as an Autograph to <persRef ref="cist-lewis"
								>Lewis J. Cist</persRef> at Cincinnati, Ohio, taking first a copy of
							it for preservation— There is a character of romantic wildness about the
							memory of my travels in Europe, from 1778 to 1785. which gives to it a
							tinge, as if it was the recollection of something in another world— Life
							was new—every thing was surprizing—every thing carried with it a deep
							interest. It is almost surprizing to me now that I escaped from the
							fascination of Europe’s attractions, and that <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef> affecting line “Plus je
							vis d’Etrangers plus j’aimai ma Patrie,[”] was always true to the Letter
							with me— My return home in 1785, from Auteuil, leaving my father when he
							was going upon his Mission to England, decide the Fate and Fortunes of
							my after Life— It was my own choice, and the most judicious choice that
							I ever made— My short discipline of 15 Months at Harvard University, was
							the introduction to all the prosperity that has ever befallen me, and
							perhaps saved me from early ruin— I called at the National Intelligencer
							Office, but neither <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> nor
								<persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> was there— Second
							walk after dinner, and Cards in the Evening.</p>

								<persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Chauncey</persRef> who gave

							having received his discharge; but told him I presumed it would be found

								>William Tudor jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef>—
							Pleasonton said he would revise the account, and let me know how it
							stood— I walked round the Capitol and took a second shorter walk after

								Smiths</persRef>— I went there after nine, and spent half an hour
							with them at whist— Rode home— I have cleared off the arrears of my
							correspondence, with the exception of several Letters from strangers
							asking for Autographs, a recent fashion like that of keeping Album’s—
							The Album is I believe a German invention, never introduced till of late
							years into this Country, and now perverted by its multiplication, and
							its degeneracy into a mere catalogue of insignificant names— Those in
							which sentiments are added are records of human imbecility—bushels of
							chaff without the two grains of wheat— Ashamed to write my bare name in
							answer to a request for an Autograph, I have usually added a few lines
							of rhyme without reason— Casting about for a thought, two days ago, I
							looked into <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef> and fell upon the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Ode of the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Book ad Romanos— I took the thought of the first
							lines—modernized it—localized it and paraphrased it, till I turned it
							into an Ode as long as the original, but so little like it that no one
							would ever recognize it— This day I finished it, and call it a prophesy,
							addressed to the sons of the Pilgrims.— A poor thing and not fit even
							for an autograph or an Album— This has happened to me five or six times—
							I angle for a thought, and after four or five nibbles catch one, and
							when the line brings it up it turns out to be a sculpin for a mackerel
							or a cod. My prophesy is upon a grave and solemn subject.</p>

							for a Pension, and this reminded me of the Petition of <persRef
								ref="ripley-jerusha">Jerusha Ripley</persRef>. I presented both the
							Petitions at the late Session of Congress; but from the delay in <hi
								rend="italic">printing</hi>
							<pb n="262" type="ms"/>printing the Journal, I have waited to ascertain
							what their condition was at the close of the Session. I found further a
							Letter of <persRef ref="frazar-samuel">Samuel Alden Frazar</persRef> of
							Duxbury, dated 27. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> last, and received
							on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of Jan<hi rend="superscript"
								>y.</hi> respecting a claim of his own upon France, for spoliations
							prior to 1800. and also a claim of a <persRef ref="partridge-mary">widow
								named Partridge</persRef> for a pension—unanswered— I called at the
								<persRef ref="edwards-james">Office of the Commissioner of
								Pensions</persRef>, who took minutes of these three cases, and said
							he would send to the Office of the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk
								of the House of Representatives</persRef> for the papers relating to
							the two Petitions— But I went to the Clerk’s Office myself, which was
							empty; all the Clerks having gone to dinner &amp; leaving only a black
							man to take care of the Office— Two of them soon afterwards came in, and
							gave me the papers with the Petitions of Jerusha Ripley and Huldah
							Penniman, which I took home with me— There were Bills reported by the
							Committee of Revolutionary Pensions in both cases, neither of which
							passed—but they were both embraced by the explanatory Bill of the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March last— I cannot justify to myself
							the lapse of time that I have suffered to pass before giving due
							attention to these cases; especially after being reminded of that of
							Huldah Penniman, by the Letter of Bellamy Storer— This inattention has
							not been voluntary, but proceeded from a want of perfect method, in
							transacting business of individuals before Congress or the Departments.
							The Letters to me, enclosing or recommending the Petitions had been
							presented with the Petitions themselves, to the House, and are with the
							Papers of the file— Not being upon my own files, the recollection had
							escaped me, from whom they came— The abolition Petitions which I
							received in the course of the Session, early 300 in number; a large
							portion of them accompanied with Letters, and the fiery persecution
							which they excited against me so entirely absorbed my faculties, that
							they disconcerted all my system of orderly method, and warned me that if
							it please God to spare me for attendance at the 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congress I must adopt an improved method at last for
							assistance to my failing Memory— These two cases of Jerusha Ripley, and
							Huldah Penniman ought to have been dispatched within ten days after the
							close of the Session of Congress— The Letter enclosing the Petition of
							Huldah Penniman was from <persRef ref="baldwin-reuben">Reuben
								Baldwin</persRef> of Boston— The Letters concerning Jerusha Ripley
							from <persRef ref="parker-jonathan">Jonathan Parker</persRef> of
							Plympton and <persRef ref="loud-jacob">Jacob H. Loud</persRef> of
							Plymouth— <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine Giusta</persRef> was
							here this morning, and told me he had given up for the present his
							purpose of going to settle in the West— That the offer had been made to
							him and to <persRef ref="newell-mary">his wife</persRef> to go in and
							keep the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> house as
							they did when I was there; but they had declined taking the place— His
							inclination was to take a small house, with a garden of ten or twelve
							Acres, and live by cultivating vegetables and fruit trees— <persRef

							and wrote also to <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef> at
							New-York— I took the Papers of the two Pension claims of <persRef

								ref="pennyman-huldah">Hulday Penniman</persRef>, to the <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of Pensions</persRef> who said he
							would have them examined this day— There were two Strangers at the

							in the morning, and the long one after dinner, round to the Potowmack
							bridge, and twice across the Tiber— Evening Cards— There is certainly
							something in the atmosphere of Spring that sets my brain in commotion
							for the composition of verses— Of the multitude of Rhymes that I have
							written, which have now become voluminous, I believe four fifths have
							been written in the Spring; excepting the versions of <persRef
								ref="wieland-christoph">Wieland’s</persRef> Oberon, and of the
							Psalms, each of which occupied me more than a year— Being still in
							search of thoughts for autographs I this day composed a Love-song, which
							if I could give it to a youth just out of his teens, to insert in his
							mistress’s Album would be very suitable, and not destitute either of
							Passion or of Harmony; but perfectly unfit for me to write, either as an
							Autograph, or in an Album. As I was again poaching in <persRef
								ref="horace">Horace</persRef> for a thought, I met with the sentence
							at the head of this page; being part of the last two lines of the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Ode of the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> book—to <persRef ref="phyllis2">Phyllis</persRef>— An
							invitation to a festival, to be kept by him about the middle of April;
							being the birthday of <persRef ref="maecenas-gaius">Maecenas</persRef>,
							which he tells her is to him almost as sacred as his own— He describes
							all the preparations for the sacrifice of a lamb—the altar decked with
							chaste vervein—the boys and girls (a hired choir I suppose ) running to
							and fro—the flame and curling smoke of the altar— He tells Phyllis that
							her passion for <persRef ref="telephus">Telephus</persRef>, a young man
							much above her in rank, is useless, for that a rich and wanton young
							woman has possession of him, and he reminds her of the fate of Phaeton
							and Bellerophon for aspiring too high That she is the last of his loves,
							for that he will never catch fire for any other woman— So that she had
							better come, and learn with him to sing with her beloved voice his
							verses— And then comes that beautiful sentence with which the Ode
							concludes “Minuentur atrae Carmine curae”— Carking cares, assuaged by
							Song— This is an Ode of Horace; and what is an Ode? Sentiment clothed
							with imagery, and delivered in measure— Is not this a just definition of
							all Poetry— Now the mythology of <persRef ref="phaeton"
								>Phaëton</persRef> and <persRef ref="bellerophon"
								>Bellerophon</persRef>—the Roman manners; the sacrifice of the lamb
							on the patron’s birth-day—the invitation by a bachelor to a courtezan,
							for such Phyllis must have been, to come, and join him in a pious and
							religious orgie, to drink wine and sing his verses with him telling her
							that it is idle for her to think of catching Telephus, but that she
							shall be the last of his Horace’s loves—all this has passed off and
							given way to other modes of existence—but the <hi rend="italic"
								>minuentur</hi>
							<pb n="264" type="ms"/>“minuentur atrae Carmine curae” will last as long
							as the human race. It is the intermixture of such Sentiments with
							antient manners, loose morals an extinguished religion and language that
							constitute the charm of Horace’s Poetry— The Sapphick Stanza with the
							Adonic closing line was evidently his favourite measure, and is the only
							one of his measures which falls harmoniously upon my ear.— I took up
							this day an old Newspaper; the Tablet of 4. August 1795. printed at
							Boston, and was about tearing it up, when casting my eye upon a
							Selection—not naming the author, I saw, it was an Ode on the Pleasure
							arising from Vicissitude, and upon reading it found it was part of
								<persRef ref="gray-thomas">Gray’s</persRef> fragment, which on the
								23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of last Month I copied from <persRef
								ref="mathias-thomas">Matthias’s</persRef> Edition of his works in

						<p>“And from the days of <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John the
								Baptist</persRef> until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth
							violence, and the violent take it by force.” Matthew 11.12. This was the
							text from which at the Presbyterian Church <persRef
								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> preached this morning, but he made nothing of his
							subject— He neither explained what Jesus meant by saying from the days
							of John the Baptist until <hi rend="italic">now</hi>; for John was yet
							living, though in prison, and had sent two of his disciples to him to
							enquire, art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? a
							question which he had answered with great caution and some
							obscurity—referring John merely to the miracles which he had wrought,
							among which he classes the preaching of the gospel to the poor— Nor what
							he meant by saying that the kingdom of heaven was taken by violence, and
							that the violent took it by force— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler
							made from this text a commonplace discourse of exhortation to his
							hearers to take the kingdom of Heaven by force; that is, by penitence
							and faith in the atonement; and by hating the world— I suppose that by
							the words from the days of John the Baptist until now, he meant from the
							days when John began to baptize, and to preach repentance in the
							wilderness—but John only proclaimed that the kingdom of Heaven was at
							hand— Jesus says further that the prophets had prophesied until John—but
							that John was a prophet and more than a prophet— That of the sons of men
							none greater than John had appeared, but that the least in the kingdom
							of Heaven was greater than he— He said also expressly that John was the
								<persRef ref="elijah">Elias or Elijah</persRef>, promised by several
							of the prophets and especially by the last words of the last prophet,
								<persRef ref="malachi">Malachi</persRef>.— But how was the kingdom
							of Heaven taken by violence, and how did the violent take it by force—
							It must have been figurative language like that in the preceding
							chapter, when he said that he came not to bring Peace, but the sword—
							Jesus never disclosed explicitly that he came to abolish all the Mosaic
							Institutions— He said that he came not to destroy but to fulfil; that is
							to fulfil the promise of the Messiah.— but the Messiah as the Jews
							understood their prophesies, was to restore the kingdom of <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef>, and Christ’s Mission was to establish
							the Kingdom of Heaven— I think his saying that the kingdom of Heaven,
							was taken by violence, was an obscure intimation that his kingdom could
							not be adopted by the Jews, without the total overthrow of the Mosaic
							Covenant, and of the Levitical Ritual— His Religion was certainly not
							during his life propagated by violence. <persRef ref="frye-carolina"><hi

							<pb n="265" type="ms"/>M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Frye, and her
							Son <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas</persRef> dined with us— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> spent the day at <persRef
								ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef>— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef
								ref="higbee-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Higbee</persRef>
							read prayers for the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after
							Easter and discoursed from Luke 15.10. “Likewise, I say unto you, There
							is joy in the presence of the angels of God, over one Sinner that
							repenteth.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Higbee delivered his Sermon
							with great animation, and is a very eloquent preacher. Repentance
							however is a subject so thoroughly exhausted under the Christian
							economy, that it is scarcely susceptible of any new elucidation— The
							most interesting part of the discourse, was a short discussion in
							support of the belief in the existence of Angels; which he said was
							doubted by many, but which he himself firmly believed— He adduced no
							argument for this belief, but merely authorities, from the Scripture,
							which to be sure are very abundant— The Scriptures both of the old, and
							new Testament swarm with Angels; but of their existence there is no
							other Evidence but the Scriptures— The visible creation, and the
							intellect of man afford confirmative evidence to the testimonies of Holy
							writ, of the existence of God; but not of Angels— The idea of Angels, of
							Cherubim, of Seraphim, loving and beneficent Spirits, ministering to the
							throne of God, is pleasing to the imagination, but that of powerful evil
							Spirits is painful, and afflictive— I wrote a short Letter to <persRef
								ref="blake-alphonsa">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alphonsa
								Blake</persRef>, daughter of the late <persRef
								ref="carmichael-william">William Carmichael</persRef>, one of the
							earliest diplomatic agents of the United States, in the Revolutionary
							War; and in the Evening I went to the Unitarian Church and heard
								<persRef ref="follen-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Follen</persRef> preach, from John 5.28. “Marvel not at this; for
							the hour is coming, in the which all that are in their graves shall hear
							his voice. 29. And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
							resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
							resurrection of damnation.”— He had read from the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							verse of the 33<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> chapter of Ezekiel; and
							explained that the words life and death, in that chapter do not mean
							temporal life and death; nor yet eternal life and death; but that they
							mean happiness and misery—upon which I pause— This chapter of Ezekiel
							has I think excluded him from the Jewish Canon of the Scriptures, at
							least in some of their communities. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Follen expounded from his text and from this passage of the book of
							Ezekiel, the Unitarian creed respecting the retributive Justice of God,
							and to a future state of rewards and punishments— He urged that rewards
							and punishments must necessarily be proportioned to merits and demerits,
							and that neither could be eternal— That both must be susceptible of
							degrees, and that when the motive for punishment, the love of the
							offender has been accomplished and the object, his reformation attained,
							the punishment must cease, and the Sinner restored to the purity of
							innocence. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Follen gave notice, that as
							circumstances would detain him here he should on Tuesday Evening at half
							past seven deliver another Lecture, containing a Summary of the whole
							course of Lectures on Unitarianism, which he has given in this City— It
							was past ten O’Clock when I got home. T. B. J. Frye was here.</p>
