						<dateline>Friday 1 September 1837.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. V. </date>Friday.— Philadelphia.</p>
						<p>Employed the morning before breakfast in writing to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— Breakfasted
							at the Lady’s ordinary, to which <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">Judge Baldwin</persRef> of the Supreme Court of
							the United States had recommended me, and who was the only person
							present whom I knew— After breakfast I was going to <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Biddle’s</persRef> when I met <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Sergeant</persRef>,
							who told me he had concluded to go on by the Steamboat at one O’Clock
							this afternoon, to reach Baltimore this Evening, and Washington
							to-morrow morning. He had heard that <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>, had
							authenticated a protest against the return of his competitor, <persRef ref="naylor-charles">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor</persRef>, and had perhaps done it to prevent
							Naylor’s voting upon the election of the Speaker— He, Sergeant, must
							therefore hasten to Washington, to look to the possibility of unfair
							practices, and counteract them— I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle,
							in bed—much flushed, and with a feverish hand—but relieved from the
							violence of the attack which was an inflammation of the kidneys—free
							from pain, and cheerful and good humoured as is his habitual character—
							He made me promise to dine, and pass the night at his house, and sent
							for a few friends, to come and dine with me.— I had a long conversation
							with him upon the affairs of the Banks, banking and the currency; but
							found him fully convinced that the resumption of specie payments by the
							Banks will for an indefinite period of time be impracticable— He thinks
							the recent proposal of the deposit Banks in New-York for a convention of
							delegates from Banks throughout the Union, to determine upon a time for
							the simultaneous return to cash payments, was a mere stratagem to
							procure the restoration to them of the public deposits— That they well
							knew, when they made the proposal, that cash payments could not be
							resumed till the foreign debt shall be paid; and made the proposal, to
							plume themselves upon it and gain credit for the performance, under the
							delusion of a false promise— He said <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">James Hamilton</persRef> of Charleston,
							South-Carolina, who first proposed in a Letter to him, this Convention
							of Banks, had been here and was now in New-York— That he had warmly
							urged this measure upon him, but that he had told Hamilton, that so sure
							as the attempt to resume should be made, so sure it would prove a
							fallacy and an abortion— It could not be maintained a week.— He told me
							that the Bank of the United States, had now eleven hundred thousand
							dollars of the money to be paid by them to the Treasury of the United
							States, in October for the first instalment of the Stock owned by the
							United States in the late Bank, in Treasury drafts, and that he expected
							when the time of payment should come to have the whole sum, in the same
							paper currency, so that the Bank will pay the whole instalment without
							disbursing a hard dollar.— After this conversation I went to the Bank of
							the United-States, and presented to <persRef ref="jaudon-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jaudon</persRef> the
							Cashier 850 dollars in the Bills both of the old and of the new Bank,
							for which I asked payment by an order on Washington— He gave me an order
							on <persRef ref="smith-richard">Richard Smith</persRef>, Cashier of the late Branch, and now agent of the Bank
							there; payable in current Bills— I took it without remark—for in my
							judgment upon the proceedings of the Bank of the United States, I wish
							to avoid mingling any <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>
							<pb n="300" type="ms"/>possible private interest of my own; but the
							adroitness with which this order changed the nature of my demand upon
							the bank could not escape my observation— I brought to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jaudon Bills payable on demand, in cash— He gave me an order
							payable in current bills, depreciated from 8 to 12 per cent.— I then
							went to the Anti-Slavery Office 223 Arch-Street—thence to <persRef ref="webb-samuel2">Samuel Webb’s</persRef>
							house, and afterwards to <persRef ref="lundy-benjamin">Benjamin Lundy’s</persRef> Office— I saw and had long
							conversations with them both, and with two or three others whom I found
							with them—of whom was <persRef ref="buffum-arnold">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buffum</persRef> who told me he was a
							hatter— Lundy returned with me to my lodgings. He and the abolitionists
							generally are constantly urging me to indiscreet movements which would
							ruin me and weaken and not strengthen their cause— My own family on the
							other hand that is my wife and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> exercise all the influence
							they possess to restrain and divert me from all connection with the
							abolitionists, and with their cause— Between these adverse impulses my
							mind is agitated almost to distraction. The public mind in my own
							district and State is convulsed between the Slavery and abolition
							questions, and I walk on this edge of a precipice in every step that I
							take— After M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lundy left me, I took a Letter for my
							wife to the Post-Office, and returned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle’s
							to dine— He could not leave his bed, but his brother, <persRef ref="biddle-james">Commodore James
								Biddle</persRef>, and his Son <persRef ref="biddle-charles2">Charles</persRef> did the honours of the table. <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
							Ingersoll</persRef>, and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sutherland were of the company—
							<persRef ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef> said he was going for Washington to-morrow— After the company
							were gone, I had another Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Biddle, and then went to the weekly meeting of the American
							Philosophical Society where I met <persRef ref="mease-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mease</persRef>, <persRef ref="vaughan-john">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> John Vaughan</persRef>, <persRef ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Du Ponceau</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="harlan-richard">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harlan</persRef>, <persRef ref="totten-joseph">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Totten</persRef>, and
							some others— I subscribed my name in a book containing a new and
							elegantly written list of the members of the Society— Returned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle’s for the Night, about 10 O’Clock.</p>

						<p>I did not see <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle</persRef> this morning, but <persRef ref="biddle-charles2">his Son
							Charles</persRef> told me that he continued better— I was unwilling to disturb his
							repose so early, and at 7 O’Clock left his House, and went on board the
							Steamboat Telegraph <persRef ref="wheldon-wilmon">Captain Whilden</persRef>— <persRef ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef> was on board; and
							several members of both houses of Congress, among whom <persRef ref="williams-reuel">Williams</persRef> of
							Maine, <persRef ref="swift-benjamin">Swift</persRef>, a Senator from Vermont, and <persRef ref="cranston-robert">Cranston</persRef> of Rhode-Island. At
							Wilmington, we took the cars of the new Railway to Baltimore— <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> John Connell</persRef> went a few miles with us from
							Wilmington, and <persRef ref="newkirk-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newkirk</persRef>, one of the Directors of
							the company, who was exceedingly polite to me. I had seen him yesterday
							at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle’s.— We arrived at Baltimore, at half
							past two O’Clock— The Railway is a stupendous work; accomplished chiefly
							by means of loans from the Bank of the United States— The road is indeed
							uncommonly level the whole way; but the bridges over numerous creeks,
							and the abutments of the passage of the Susquehanna at Havre de Grace,
							were heavy and costly undertakings.— The passage is accomplished in a
							Steamboat in five minutes; and tables are all laid in the boat for the
							breakfast of the Passengers from Baltimore to Philadelphia— Those from
							Philadelphia <pb n="301" type="ms"/>to Baltimore, breakfast in the
							Steamboat before they reach Wilmington— The road is almost the whole way
							through a forest, chiefly of Oak; so that there are no pleasant
							prospects to cheer the passenger— On arriving at Baltimore I went with
							<persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jenifer</persRef>, a member of the House of
							Representatives from Maryland, to <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> tavern, where we dined at the
							Lady’s Ordinary— <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hubbard</persRef> a Senator from
							New-Hampshire was also at the table, and <persRef ref="french-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French</persRef> a
							Sub clerk in the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives—
							After dinner I paid a visit to <persRef ref="brooks-gorham;shepherd-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gorham Brooks</persRef>, and then went to the Depot of the
							Cars of the Railway for Washington— At half past five we departed from
							Baltimore, and landing at the foot of Capitol Hill at half-past eight, I
							took a hack, and reached my house, at Washington just at the stroke of
							nine— <persRef ref="wilson-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wilson</persRef>, who now lives at the <persRef ref="pontois-edouard">French
								Ministers</persRef> came and opened the door for me, and <persRef ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
									Goods</persRef> had all in readiness to receive me— <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> is with the French
							Minister at Philadelphia— I retired immediately to bed.</p>

						<p>At the Presbyterian Church—morning service I heard <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Morning visits from <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> and <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">William C.
							Greenleaf</persRef>.— The Doctor says his health is better than it was last
							Spring; but he looks very much emaciated— He enquired particularly of
							the complaint of <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> in her left eye, and advised her on her passage
							through New-York, to consult <persRef ref="roger-john3">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kearney Rogers</persRef> whom
							he thinks the most eminent oculist in the United States.— William C.
							Greenleaf is living <hi rend="italic">at</hi>
							<pb n="302" type="ms"/>at <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef>, without profitable occupation—
							His application for employment at the Patent Office having been
							unsuccessful. He asked me, if I should hear of any situation in which he
							could be useful to speak a good word for him, which I would most
							willingly do— The first Session of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congress commenced this day— I attended at the Capitol, half an hour
							before the usual time of meeting; which was spent in mutual gratulations
							and greetings with the old members returned anew, and with introductions
							of new members.— At noon precisely <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Walter S. Franklin</persRef>, the Clerk of the
							last House of Representatives, called the Meeting to order, and read
							over a roll of the members, by States, which he had gathered from the
							Newspapers When he reached the State of Mississippi, <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Charles F. Mercer</persRef>
							of Virginia, objected to their admission to vote for Speaker; and
							offered a Resolution, that <persRef ref="gholson-samuel">Samuel<space/>Gholson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="claiborne-john">John F. H. Claiborne</persRef>
							had not produced satisfactory evidence of their election as members of
							the House, upon which an acrimonious debate of two hours arose, which
							terminated in laying Mercer’s Resolution on the table— Gholson and
							Claiborne were elected in the face of the Constitution of the United
							States, for this single Session; that is until superseded by an election
							to be held next November; which was admitted and avowed by Gholson and
							Claiborne—but they bullied the meeting into an admission of them to
							vote, by threatening to call for the certificates of election of every
							person present—not one in five of whom, perhaps not one in ten had his
							certificate with him— An exceedingly irregular practice having within a
							few years crept in, of requiring no certificates of election from the
							members, but swearing them in, upon mere newspaper report— I took no
							part in this debate; though I had my certificate with me, and was
							satisfied that the Mississippi election was null and void— Still the men
							from Mississippi had been elected by a large majority of the People of
							the State, who in the event of their exclusion from the House would be
							unrepresented the whole of the present Session. I was therefore content
							to wave the Constitutional illegality and let them in—224 members
							answered to the call of their names.— The votes for Speaker were for
							<persRef ref="polk-james">James K. Polk</persRef> of Tennessee 116. for <persRef ref="bell-john">John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee 103. and 5
							scattering— So Polk was elected by a majority of 4 votes— At the last
							Congress he had a majority of 48. I voted for Bell— My neighbour <persRef ref="patton-john">John M
								Patton</persRef> voted for <persRef ref="jones-john9">Joseph W. Jones</persRef> of Virginia— Polk on being conducted by
							<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> and <persRef ref="owens-george">Owens</persRef> of Georgia to the Chair, made a clumsy
							address to the House, in which he said it would be impossible for him to
							keep order unless supported by the House, which was true enough as an
							appeal to the party majority; but he promised impartiality which if he
							does practice at all will be only between the two sides of his own
							party— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina, called the father of the house
							swore in the Speaker, and the Speaker swore all the other members
							present, by States— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef> nominated <persRef ref="shock-samuel">Samuel Shock</persRef> of Pennsylvania
							for Clerk— But Walter S. Franklin, was re-elected by a vote of 146. to
							48 for Shock and 15 scattering— <persRef ref="dorsey-roderick">Roderick Dorsey</persRef> was by nomination and
							vote reappointed Sergeant at Arms. <persRef ref="carr-overton">Overton Carr</persRef>, principal Door-keeper
							and <persRef ref="hunter-william6">William S. Hunter</persRef> assistant <hi rend="italic">Doorkeeper</hi>
							<pb n="303" type="ms"/>Doorkeeper.— A motion was made to adopt the Rules
							and Orders of the last Congress, to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer
							moved an exception of the rule for appointing a Committee of Elections
							for the revisal of which he proposed the appointment of a select
							Committee. I moved as an amendment, that the Report of the Committee for
							revising the rules made at the first Session of the last Congress should
							be referred to the same Committee. After some debate on this motion the
							House adjourned— A Message had been received from the Senate, announcing
							that they had formed a Quorum—and appointed a Committee on their part to
							wait on the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> and inform him that a Quorum of both Houses was
							assembled, and ready to receive from him any communication—the joint
							Committee on the part of the House was appointed, but the Message to the
							Senate to inform them of the choice by the House of a Speaker was
							neglected, till after the Senate had adjourned— It was past six O’Clock
							when I got home to dinner— Weary evening.</p>

							It occupied an hour and a half in the reading, and was confined

							Revenue. <persRef ref="hamer-thomas">Hamer</persRef> of Ohio moved that ten thousand copies should be
							printed—<persRef ref="owens-george">Owens</persRef> of Georgia moved for 20,000—<persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio, objected

							Green</persRef>, and 4 for blanks— There were five ballottings, without material

							once 103. Thomas Allen at the fourth ballot had 23. Between 5 and 6
							O’Clock the House adjourned— Patton told me that the 22, were ten from

							on Monday; and invited me to dine with them every day.— I told him it
							was too far to walk after a long Session at the Capitol; but that I
							would come the first leisure day. I rose this morning between two and
							three O’Clock; which I propose to do every day, when I wake at that
							time; for I can neither read nor write by evening lamplight, and I can
							in the morning.— H:R.U.S. The day was consumed in fruitless struggles to
							elect a public Printer— There had been a <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> Caucus last Evening;
							and when the subject was called up this morning <persRef ref="bronson-isaac">Isaac H. Bronson</persRef>, a
							New-York Administration member, moved a Resolution to suspend the

							temporarily and until the election of a printer, the <persRef ref="bronson-isaac">Clerk</persRef> be authorised
							to employ some person or persons to do the printing on the same terms
							upon which it was done at the last Session. This proposition gave rise
							to a long debate, and many proposed amendments— <persRef ref="grennell-george">George Grennell</persRef> of
							Massachusetts moved to lay it on the table, which was rejected by yeas
							and nays 109 to 114. <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> of South-Carolina, moved an amendment that
							the printing should be given by contract to the lowest bidder. <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
							Williams</persRef> that it should not be an editor of a Newspaper; but withdrew
							his amendment.— <persRef ref="coles-walter">Coles</persRef> and <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> of Virginia were for separating the
							public printing from all Newspaper printers.— <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef> of New-York made
							his maiden Speech, severely scoring the globe— <persRef ref="reed-john">John Reed</persRef>, proposed that
							besides the preference of the lowest bidder the quality of the paper
							should also be prescribed— Picken’s’s amendment was carried 112 to 109.
							but <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> then opposed the Resolution— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> proposed that the

							<pb n="305" type="ms"/>much debate upon this; till Robertson of Virginia

						<p>Though rising at this hour, I have not half the time necessary for

							chasing Time in the record of this diary which is running again into
							irretrievable arrears— <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Giusta</persRef> was here again this morning, with my

							of 3000 dollars dated 5. July 1836. 50 dollars a year’s interest on my

							of 8 May last to <persRef ref="walker-john3">John Walker</persRef>, payable in forty days, and endorsed by
							him; including 2:50 for interest since the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of

							four 100 dollar Bills of the defunct Bills of the Bank of the United

							<persRef ref="smith-richard">Richard Smith</persRef> Cashier of the Bank of the United States here payable only

							moved his amendment, to <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon’s</persRef> Resolutions for choosing the Printer viva

							offered a Resolution that <persRef ref="allen-thomas5">Thomas Allen</persRef> should be employed for the
							printing, till a printer should be chosen— He withdrew the motion— A
							ninth ballot was taken 228 votes. <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> and <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef> 104 <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>
							48 Thomas Allen 70. Blank 3. scattering 3.— It was now apparent that
							Allen would be chosen— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> of Maryland moved to suspend the balloting
							till the third Monday in September, and that in the meantime the
							printers to the House at the last Congress should be employed— Another
							Speech, answered by <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef>, who moved to lay Howard’s Resolution on the
							Table— <persRef ref="harrison-albert">Harrison</persRef> of Missouri called for the yeas and nays, and they were
							116 to 107 for laying on the table— Harrison moved that in the future
							ballotings, the name with the fewest votes should be dropped. <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, argued that Blair and Rives having received a plurality
							of votes might be considered as elected; which Patton said was not sound

								12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> ballots were taken; in which the votes for

							and 113.—and the whole number of votes being 225. Thomas Allen, was at
							the last ballot elected— I had voted the first ten ballots, for Gales
							and Seaton— The last two I voted for Allen, seeing that the only
							alternative was between him and the lying rascals of the Globe.— After
							the election was completed <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio moved to take up the
							Resolution for the revisal of the Rules— <pb n="306" type="ms"/><persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef>
							had moved that the Rules of the last House should be adopted excepting
							that for the appointment of a Committee of Elections, and that for the
							revisal of that a select Committee should be appointed— I had moved that
							the Report of the Committee on the Rules made at the first Session of
							the last Congress should be referred to the same Committee— An entire
							revisal of the rules was now proposed, and that the Rules of the last
							House should be adopted for ten days— After much manoeuvering by <persRef ref="hamer-thomas">Hamer</persRef>
							of Ohio, he succeeded in carrying a substitute for Mercer’s Resolution,
							that a Committee should be appointed to revise the rules, and that the
							Rules of the last House should be adopted for ten days, with the
							exception of the 107<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> rule—which is that no change
							of the rules shall be adopted without one days notice, or by less than
							two thirds of the votes. Whittlesey of Ohio then moved for the
							appointment of the standing Committees, which was agreed to— <persRef ref="biddle-richard">Richard
								Biddle</persRef> of Pennsylvania, member from Pittsburgh, brother of <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">Nicholas</persRef>,
							offered a Resolution calling upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to
							report whether a Letter purporting to be addressed by him to the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk

							authentic: if so, to what other claimants on the Treasury, a similar
							offer has been made, and what principle of discrimination, if any has
							been adopted in the medium of payment to the public creditors— It lays
							over one day.— Adjourned near 6 O’Clock— I received a Letter from <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi

							called again, and gave me further particulars of their intended
							Academical school at <persRef ref="u">Ellicott’s</persRef> Mills, near Baltimore— Their main object
							was to obtain my permission to refer enquirers to me, for their
							characters, to which I readily consented; believing them to be
							respectable and intelligent, as certainly in the predicament of Polish
							exiles they are very unfortunate men— While they were here a young man
							by the name and style of the <persRef ref="lester-charles">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Charles Lester</persRef>,
							and a young woman of the Society of Friends named <persRef ref="cox-mary">Mary L. Cox</persRef> came in—

							introduced also the young woman.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kraitsir and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Zerrlaut withdrew. The young woman brought a
							Letter from <persRef ref="lundy-benjamin">Benjamin Lundy</persRef> who had told me that she was desirous to see
							me— She said she had a spiritual impulse, that it was her duty to
							address a discourse to me, if I had no objection to hearing her— I said
							I should on the contrary be greatly obliged to her— She then began a
							regular Quaker Sermon, of about a quarter of an hour, exactly such as I
							had heard before, from <persRef ref="livermore-harriet">Harriet Livermore</persRef>, <persRef ref="lambert-elizabeth">Elizabeth Lambert</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="fry-elizabeth">Elizabeth Fry</persRef>.— Their Sermons consist of passages from the mystical and
							minatory passages in the writings, of the Apostles, especially of <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>,
							strung together by a few words of incessant application, delivered in a
							half way tone between speaking and chanting—or what the French call
							unction— She appeared to be deeply affected, with great modesty in her
							manner, and an intense conviction of the importance of what she said—a
							canto of commonplaces from the Epistles of the New Testament— The <hi
								rend="italic">discourse</hi>
							<pb n="307" type="ms"/>discourse was altogether hortatory to me; and
							prayerful that I may be sustained and fortified by divine assistance and
							support— Conscious of needing it as I am, I could not but receive with
							profound sensibility these exhortations and prayers— I thanked her
							cordially for them, and assured her that I should be encouraged by them
							to persevere in the course that I had hitherto pursued; and I requested
							her to continue to me the benefit of her prayers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lester told me that he was a Presbyterian, and asked me whether I was a
							member of any church— I told him I was, and had for nearly eleven years
							been a member of the Congregational Church at Quincy; the same of which
							<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and his ancestors have been members from the first formation
							of the Church in 1639. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lester took a minute of
							the names of my Ancestors up to the first <persRef ref="adams-henry">Henry Adams</persRef>— He invited me to
							take a seat in the Carriage in which he was going to the Capitol, which
							I did— Mary L. Cox alighted at her lodgings in Pennsylvania Avenue— He
							then told me that she was wholly a stranger to him— They had met at the
							same lodgings, and he had accompanied her to my house as a matter of
							courtesy. She appeared desirous of obtaining the use of the Hall of the
							House of Representatives, to preach in next Sunday and asked me to speak
							for her to <persRef ref="potts-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Potts</persRef>, to make the request, which I
							promised— At the House, <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> offered an amendment to the Resolution
							presented yesterday by <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Richard Biddle</persRef>, and both were ordered to be
							printed. <persRef ref="bell-john">John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee announced to the House the death of
							<persRef ref="standifer-james">James Standefer</persRef> of that State, on his way to this place as a member
							elect of the present Congress. Bell eulogized him in appropriate terms,
							as a worthy respectable man, without lofty pretensions— He moved the
							usual resolution, to wear crape thirty days, and to adjourn, which the
							house did over to Monday— I saw <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas Biddle’s</persRef>
							Son <persRef ref="biddle-charles2">Charles</persRef> at the Capitol.— <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert Buchanan</persRef> was here this Evening. He

									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> were here— I took the two sets of <persRef ref="ammidon-philip">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ammidon’s</persRef> papers to the Department of State; and
							left them there; the Secretary, <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef> being
							absent from indisposition, and the <persRef ref="dayton-aaron">chief Clerk M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dayton</persRef>, likewise absent— The papers are all of a date as early as 1822.
							They are, a Letter to the <persRef ref="mianning">Emperor of China</persRef>, signed by <persRef ref="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef> then
							President of the United States—a Letter to the <persRef ref="yuan-ruan">Viceroy of Canton</persRef> signed
							by me, as Secretary of State, and a Letter signed also by me, to <persRef ref="wilcocks-james">James
							Wilcocks</persRef> then Consul of the United States at Canton— The Letter from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ammidon to me, states that the Letter to the
							Vice-roy of Canton was delivered; but that probably the <pb n="308"
								type="ms"/>the one to the Emperor never was— It was recommendatory
							of an application in behalf of the owners of the Ship President Adams,
							wrecked on the Coast of China, and plundered by the People on the shore,
							and praying for indemnity— The request of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ammidon
							now is for a renovation of these same papers by the present <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>
							and Secretary of State—and that one copy of them may be delivered to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ammidon, and another to the Captain of the
							first ship of War, which may be ordered to the China Seas— These papers
							were first procured by <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>, who had been supercargo of the
							Ship President Adams, and was perhaps interested in the claim.— They are
							now fifteen years old, and there is little prospect of a second edition
							of them being more efficient than they were before— I called at the
							President’s House, and spent half an hour in conversation with him
							respecting the weather, the climate, and <persRef ref="victoria">Queen Victoria</persRef>, the girl of 18
							sovereign of all the British dominions— “Youth at the prow, and pleasure
							at the helm”— I had been told that in these troublous times, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van-Buren was so deeply affected by them, that he
							looked extremely wretched; but I found no such thing— He had every
							appearance of composure and tranquility— He spoke indeed of the cares
							and afflictions of the Station which he now occupies, and said it was
							surprising how universal the delusion was, that any one could be happy
							in it, and he spoke of the calm philosophical Spirit of <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Franklin</persRef> and of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>—who he said
							had expressed to him a very high esteem for me— There are many features
							in the character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren strongly resembling
							that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison— His calmness—his gentleness of
							manners. his discretion—his easy and conciliatory temper— But Madison
							had none of his obsequiousness—his sycophancy—his profound dissimulation
							and duplicity— In the last of these he much more resembles <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>,
							though with very little of his genius— The most disgusting part of his
							character his fawning servility belonged neither to Jefferson nor to
							Madison— I went to the Pension office and left with <persRef ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Edwards</persRef> the Commissioner, the papers of <persRef ref="perry-elizabeth3">Elizabeth Perry</persRef>,
							given to me by <persRef ref="curtis-joshua">Joshua Curtis</persRef> of Abington; those of the <persRef ref="u">children</persRef> of

						<p>Morning service at the Presbyterian Church. heard <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fowler</persRef> from Genesis 3.4. “And the serpent said unto <persRef ref="eve">the woman</persRef>, ye shall
							not surely die.” There is a grammatical inaccuracy in this phrase— The
							translation should have been ye shall surely not die— The negation is of
							death, and not of its certainty— I dined at <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S.
								Smith’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J. Frye</persRef> was there— After dinner I attended at S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church. <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read
							the Evening service for the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity, and preached a short discourse from Psalm 47.5. “God is gone up
							with a shout, the Lord, with the sound of a trumpet. 6. Sing praises to
							God, sing praises; sing praises unto our king, sing praises. 7. For God
							is the king of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.” The
							text was more animated than the Sermon— Evening visit from <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen C Phillips</persRef>. He told me that there had been
							a meeting of a small number of the members of the party now calling
							themselves whigs, in which it was agreed that they should oppose the
							passage of the bill to postpone the payment of the fourth instalment of
							the deposit with the States, payable on the first of October next, and
							amounting to upwards of nine Millions of dollars— The bill has been
							reported in both Houses of Congress, and will probably pass in
							both—undoubtedly in the Senate I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips I
							was sorry they had agreed to oppose it, for it was indispensably

						<p><persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef> called on me this morning, and invited me to dine with
							him, and a few of his friends; it being the anniversary of the battle of
							Plattsburg.— Accepted the invitation. I had received a Letter from
							<persRef ref="bates-william">William Bates</persRef> of Wareham, enclosing a Patent to a person named <persRef ref="bump-lewis">Bump</persRef>,
							with several assignments, and 18 dollars in bank-bills, for a new and
							modified Patent— I took them all to the Patent Office, and left them
							with the Commissioner <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">Henry L Ellsworth</persRef>. He told me however that instead
							of 18 dollars there should have been 27. and instead of Bank-bills,
							coin, for that no bank bills were now received at the Patent-Office— He
							said also that to obtain a modified Patent, the old one must be
							surrendered, and there must be a specification of the principle claimed
							for the new one— He took all the Papers and said he would write to me
							concerning them to-morrow. At the House, <persRef ref="crary-isaac">Crary</persRef> of Michigan, <persRef ref="yell-archibald">Yell</persRef>, of
							Arkansas, <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Lewis</persRef> of Alabama, and <persRef ref="cheatham-richard">Cheatham</persRef> of Tennessee were sworn and
							took their Seats— The standing Committees were announced—<persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>
							Chairman of the Ways and Means, <persRef ref="smith-francis">Smith</persRef> of the Committee of Commerce, <hi
								rend="italic">Howard</hi>
							<pb n="310" type="ms"/><persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> of the foreign Affairs, and <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> of the
							Judiciary, all rank <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Burenites</persRef>— I am still Chairman of the Committee
							of manufactures, which has this Session nothing to do— <persRef ref="buchanan-andrew3">Buchanan</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, a new member is chairman of the Committee of
							Elections—three others of the members are new— A majority Slave holders
							and a majority though not the same persons administration men.— To make
							sure work of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, <persRef ref="hamer-thomas">Hamer</persRef> of Ohio is placed
							next to Howard, and in the event of his removal becomes by the usage
							Chairman of the Committee— There are six Slave holders on the Committee
							upon the District of Columbia, with <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef> of Virginia at their head—
							The party drill, on both points of slavery, and administration is
							complete.— <persRef ref="biddle-richard">Richard Biddle’s</persRef> call upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, to
							explain why he pays members of Congress in gold, and other public
							creditors in rags, with <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson’s</persRef> Amendment, which Biddle accepted,
							was taken up, and supported by Biddle, in a handsome speech— Hamer of
							Ohio, and M’Kay of North-Carolina, laboured hard to counteract its
							force—but in vain— Neither of them ventured to oppose the resolution—
							Hamer’s argument was that it would be but fair to hear the Secretary’s
							explanation before condemning him, and that he would give an explanation
							perfectly satisfactory— He was also shocked at the idea that any member
							of Congress should be influenced by so paltry a consideration as the
							premium upon gold over bank paper. M’Kay drew a fallacious parallel
							between the option offered to members of Congress to receive their pay
							in gold, and that to other creditors to receive their pay in current
							bills, or not be paid at all.— The Resolution was adopted.— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of
							Tennessee offered a Resolution calling upon the Secretary of the
							Treasury to report what appropriations may be dispensed with, which at
							Cambreleng’s recommendation was immediately adopted without opposition—
							The House went into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union,
							upon the President’s Message— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> called me to the chair—
							Cambreleng offered two Resolutions, one referring so much of the Message
							as related to the finances to the Committee of ways and means—the other
							referring so much as related to a bankrupt law, to the Committee on the
							judiciary—both were adopted without opposition, reported to the House,
							and immediately concurred in— Cambreleng moved to distribute in like
							manner, the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, between the same
							two Committees— Ewing of Ohio offered an amendment which was rejected,
							and Cambreleng’s motion adopted— <persRef ref="smith-francis">Smith</persRef> of Maine, offered a Resolution
							that the action of the standing Committees on all matters not embraced
							by the Message of P.U.S. be suspended until the commencement of the
							annual Session in December; and that the consideration of all petitions
							on such suspended matters be suspended to the same time— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of
							Ohio, urged an exception in favour of private claims— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Williams</persRef> of
							North-Carolina moved to postpone the consideration of the question till
							Wednesday— Bell supported this motion, and broke out against the
							sub-treasury project of the message— Cambreleng replied—supported the
							sub-treasury project—and called upon the opposition to propose their
							Bank of the United States— This led to a long skirmishing <hi
								rend="italic">debate</hi>
							<pb n="311" type="ms"/>debate in which motions to except the Committee
							of Claims, and even the Committee of Elections were rejected, without
							allowing the vote to be taken by yeas and nays— This only proves the
							determination, almost unanimous of the house to have a short Session—
							The Senate had already suspended the action, and even the appointment of
							most of their standing Committees— The House adjourned soon after 3. I

						<p><persRef ref="feuchtwanger-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Feuchtwanger</persRef>, brought me a Letter of introduction
							from <persRef ref="abert-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Abert</persRef>.— He has a project for contracting
							to coin cents from a composition of zinc, copper and nickel, called
							German silver— He has coined counters with his name, and one cent
							stamped upon them, of which he shewed me several— They are clean, and
							about the size of a ten cent piece— He makes table furniture and all
							Articles usually plated of the same composition, costing about one
							fourth as much, and looking nearly as well as silver— He had a memorial
							which he wished me to present, but I advised him to make some
							alterations in it— And I suggested to him the expediency, of having a
							coinage of 2 and 3. cent pieces of his composition, instead of throwing
							the copper coinage of cents out of circulation.— I received an answer
							from the <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">Commissioner of Patents</persRef>, returning some of the Papers received
							from <persRef ref="bates-william">William Bates</persRef>, and the 18 dollars in Bank Bills, all which I
							enclosed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates. A man by the name of <persRef ref="heinecke-samuel">Samuel
							Heinecke</persRef>, brought me a subscription paper, for building a methodist
							episcopal Church for the people of colour.— H.R.U.S. <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a Bill to postpone
							the fourth instalment of deposite with the State—twice read, and
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.
							Cambreleng said he should probably report two more Bills to-morrow—
							<persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> moved to proceed to the choice of a chaplain, and nominated the
							<persRef ref="tustin-septimus">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston</persRef>— This
							Gentleman had called upon me some days since, and mentioned that he was
							the person who had baptized a <persRef ref="mason-maria">child</persRef> at Leesburg in August 1825 when I
							was there with <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Monroe</persRef>, and <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>—
							An incident in itself interesting, but rendered deeply pathetic by the
							circumstance, told me afterwards by <persRef ref="wallace-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace</persRef>, that
							the child died that very Night, though at the time of the baptism
							apparently well— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston shewed me also Letters
							very strongly commendatory of him, from <persRef ref="tucker-george">George Tucker</persRef>, professor of
							moral philosophy at the University of Virginia; and from <persRef ref="stgeorgetucker-henry">Henry S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> George Tucker</persRef> his cousin— I had promised M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston to vote for him, and did so. He was elected
							at the second ballot— <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia then moved to adjourn; and
							withdrew the motion, to allow me to offer, separately three Resolutions,
							calling upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President of the United States</persRef> 1. for the
							correspondence with Mexico, relating to the boundary; <hi rend="italic"
								>and</hi>
							<pb n="312" type="ms"/>and especially to any proposal to the Mexican
							Government, for a cession of territory from that republic to the United
							States— 2. Whether any proposition has been made by the Republic of
							Texas, to be annexed to the United States, and if so what answer has
							been returned to it, and all the correspondence relating thereto. 3. For
							copies of the correspondence with the British Government relating to our
							North-eastern Boundary, since the message of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">late President</persRef> to the
							Senate of 15. June 1836— To the first and third of these Resolutions I
							added the usual restriction, so far as the public interest may permit;
							but omitted it in the second— The Resolutions lie over one day for
							consideration— The House adjourned about 2. O’Clock— <persRef ref="denny-harmar">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harmar Denny</persRef>, late member of the House from Pittsburgh, but
							not now a member came this morning to my Seat, and told me there was a
							Convention of Anti-Masons sitting here in a room, at <persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel— That
							they were to meet at one O’Clock; and would be glad if I could find it
							convenient to attend.— I promised him I would, if the house should
							adjourn in time— I went accordingly, and found about fifty persons
							assembled— The principal deputation was from Pennsylvania— <persRef ref="middleswarth-ner">Ner
								Middleswarth</persRef> was in the Chair, and among the Members were <persRef ref="darlington-edward">Darlington</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennon</persRef>, <persRef ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef> and <persRef ref="ogle-charles">Ogle</persRef> of the House of Representatives— Denny and
							<persRef ref="u">Todd</persRef> of the House heretofore; and <persRef ref="stevens-thaddeus">Thaddeus Stevens</persRef>— I found them in
							debate, upon Resolutions honorary to <persRef ref="harrison-william">W. H. Harrison</persRef> as past and future
							Candidate for the Office of President of the United States, and to
							<persRef ref="ritner-joseph">Joseph Ritner</persRef> as Governor of Pennsylvania, and candidate for

							finally withdrawn—and the meeting adjourned to meet again hereafter.
								2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Tuesday Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1838 at
							Philadelphia. It was a convocation invited by the Anti-Masonic Committee
							of Pennsylvania, to consult about a nomination of a Candidate for the
							Presidency, at the next election— But with the exception of one member
							from Rhode-Island named <persRef ref="u">Williams</persRef>, there was no representation from any

							I presented D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Feuchtwanger’s Memorial, which as it

							because he had positive information from high authority that the

							But Wise was not in the true secret— The correspondence to which he
							alluded is extra-official and will not be given— The South-Carolinians,
							and Howard, Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs thought best to
							yield to the call; Wise got a hint that the secret correspondence was in
							no danger of being disclosed, and withdrew his objection to the call—
							<persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia moved to insert the restrictive exception, so far as

						<p><persRef ref="feuchtwanger-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Feuchtwanger</persRef> came again this morning. I told him
							that his memorial had been referred to the Committee of Ways and Means,
							and advised him to see and converse with the Chairman and members of the
							Committee concerning it. I called at the Office of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
							Treasury</persRef>, and left with him the papers delivered to me for that purpose
							by <persRef ref="freeman-russell">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell Freeman</persRef>— They were recommendations <hi
								rend="italic">for </hi><pb n="314" type="ms"/>for his restoration to
							the Office of Collector of the Port of New-Bedford, which he held in my
							time, but which <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> gave to Lemuel Williams— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury told me that <persRef ref="williams-lemuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Williams</persRef> had recently signified his wish to be re-appointed— As I came
							out from the Secretary’s chamber, I saw in the Anti-chamber <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>, now a Sychophant of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
							Buren</persRef>, as he was late a sycophant of Jackson who turned him out of the
							Office of District Attorney at Philadelphia, and a demagogue of the
							school of <persRef ref="clodius-publius">Clodius</persRef> and <persRef ref="vatinius-publius">Vatinius</persRef>— Those three brothers, sons of <persRef ref="vatinius-publius">Jared
								Ingersoll</persRef> are all men of fine talents, and of no moral principle— <persRef ref="ingersoll-edward">Edward</persRef>
							has absconded from the eye of honest Society, for detected forgery—
							<persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph</persRef> came into the last Congress as worthy of being the successor of
							<persRef ref="binny-horace">Horace Binney</persRef>, and went out of it the tool of <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef>, and the
							scorn of every freeman in the House— Charles has spent his life in
							hoarding riches screwed by extortion from the poor, and in boxing his
							political compass to every change of the wind— Federalist, Democrat,
							Tory, Jacobin, Tariffite, Bankite, Anti-tariff, Anti-Bank, black, white,
							gray, any colour any shape that the interest, and the popular breath of
							the moment required, but always under every shape and colour a rapacious
							extortioner, and an unblushing Sycophant. His talents, with his
							sycophancy keep him above water, in spite of an universal distrust of
							his integrity— Parties want him to do their dirty work, and they at once
							sustain and despise him. There are many such characters in this free
							republic. He is knight of the shire and represents them all— He was
							wanted by Van Buren, for his financier in the house, and there was a
							hard struggle to bring him in for the third District of Pennsylvania—
							<persRef ref="naylor-charles">Charles Naylor</persRef> carried the election against him, and Ingersoll has
							trumped up a memorial from the district, to have the election set aside—
							But the Committee of Elections seem to think the chance of an election
							now would be worse than it was before, and they have not yet acted on
							the memorial.— H.R.U.S. I presented the Petition of <persRef ref="gregory-sherlock">Sherlock S. Gregory</persRef>
							of Sandlake, Rensselaer County, New-York for an act of Congress
							declaring him an alien or stranger in the land, so long as Slavery
							exists, and the wrongs of the Indians are unrequited and unrepented of—
							The Petition lies on the table, but together with two or three remarks
							which I made on presenting it, it roused the wrath of <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire, the man of previous questions, moved a resolution “that
							the operation of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule of the House, in
							relation to the call of the States for presentation of Petitions be
							suspended during the present Session of Congress.” I saw his drift and
							immediately assailed his resolution as an attempt to abridge the right
							of petition. <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> and <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> came also to the rescue— Cushman was
							so confounded that he knew not what to say— <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> the Speaker, said he
							probably meant only to suspend the call of the States, and not the
							presentation of Petitions, and advised him to modify his Resolution
							accordingly. I objected to that—observing that it totally changed the
							character of the Resolution— I insisted upon the preservation of the
							form— The call of the States, and demanded the yeas and nays— Cushman
							was at his wits end— He said he was the last man in the world to abridge
							the right of petition—he was interrupted by calls from his own party to
							withdraw his Resolution, and awkwardly did withdraw it— <persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> of
							Virginia, offered three Resolutions of Call upon the Secretary of the
							Treasury which were adopted; and the House <pb n="315" type="ms"/>House
							took up the Report of the Committee of revisal of the rules. All the
							amendments proposed by the select Committee of the last Congress were
							now again reported, excepting one; which was that the previous question
							shall be applicable to pending amendments as well as to the primitive
							proposition to which they are appended— I had not originally proposed
							this amendment; but it was perhaps the most important to the freedom of
							debate of any reported by the former Committee but <persRef ref="hamer-thomas">Hamer</persRef> of Ohio, sly as
							a quaker, and sour as a presbyterian had got upon the Committee of the
							present Session, and prevailed on a majority of them to strike it out. I
							moved to restore it as an amendment; upon which a warm debate of two
							hours terminated in a vote of 106 to 102 by yeas and nays upon my
							amendment.— This was a strict party vote, and may be considered as
							shewing the administration party majority—in the House— Hamer had also
							contrived to introduce two other amendments into the present report of
							the Committee—one that after the call for the previous question, all
							questions of order shall be decided without debate— The Speaker,
							contrary to all precedent had decided at the last Session, that this was
							already the rule and had been sustained by the party drill in the House;
							but Hamer to make assurance doubly sure now got this Committee to
							propose it as an amendment of the Rules; and carried it notwithstanding
							the vehement opposition of Patton—but Hamer lost in the House another of
							his proposed amendments; which was to revoke the 107<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> rule, which requires a day’s notice, and a vote of two
							thirds to revoke or alter any of the standing rules— Hamer and <persRef ref="smith-francis">Smith</persRef> of
							Maine laboured very hard to carry this point, though I warned them that

						<p>Morning visits from <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips</persRef>, and <persRef ref="barstow-gideon">D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Barstow</persRef> of Salem, who has been much out of health; and is
							now returning from the White sulphur springs of Virginia— H.R.U.S. I
							presented the petition of <persRef ref="smith-ebenezer">Ebenezer Smith</persRef>, and 163 citizens of Ryegate,
							Vermont for retrenchment and reform— The words produced a general shout
							of laughter in the house—which was repeated when I said that my reason
							for presenting it was that among the reforms for which it called, one
							was that Congress should reduce the pay of the members of both houses
							from 8 dollars a day to four. It lies on the table, and is in reality an
							abolition petition. <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> said that he had intended, after
							the Resolution of the House to confine its action to the subjects
							referred to in the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> Message, to retain sundry Petitions of
							more than 3000 persons, his Constituents against the admission of Texas
							into the Union— But the extraordinary debate on my Resolutions for calls
							upon the President, had led him to think it his duty to present those
							petitions, which he did; moving that they should all lie on the table,
							giving notice that he should call them up, at any time when a
							proposition for annexing Texas to the Union may be before the House—
							Several other members also presented Petitions against the admission of
							Texas, but I reserved mine for another day— The Speaker laid before the
							House a statement of Appropriations for the last 2 years <hi
								rend="italic">Cambreleng</hi>
							<pb n="316" type="ms"/><persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> from the Committee of Ways and Mans
							reported a Bill imposing additional duties as depositories, in certain
							cases on public Officers. This is the famous Sub-treasury scheme, which
							is to be the panacea for all the diseases of the Country— Twice read and
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— As was
							another Bill reported by Cambreleng, for adjusting the remaining claims
							on the late deposit Banks.— He said the Committee would have only two
							bills more to report. <persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> said that when the Bills should be taken
							up— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> was for acting immediately upon the Bills from the Senate; but
							Cambreleng said they were not in all respects identical with those
							reported <hi rend="strikethrough">by</hi> to the House.— They all came
							from the Treasury, and are very slightly varied in modification
							differently by the financial committees of the two houses respectively.
							The debate upon the rules was concluded.— <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> having made from the
							Committee a further report— The rule that questions of order raised
							after a call for the previous question shall be decided without debate
							was carried by yeas and nays 103 to 96— But the proposed revocation of
							the 107<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule, requiring a day’s notice, and a
							vote of two thirds to alter any of the standing rules, was lost after a
							sharp debate, by yeas and nays 88 to 221.— A proposed addition of two
							standing Committees of 5 members each, upon Patents, and upon the public
							buildings and grounds was adopted without opposition— So was much to my
							surprize a rule that during the sittings of the House, the members shall
							remain uncovered— From the first existence of the Government, the
							members of the House have been in the practice of wearing their hats,
							except when addressing the House— Numberless attempts have been to alter
							the rule, always till now without success.— It passed now without one
							word of objection, and gave me a signal illustration of the humours of
							deliberative assemblies, and how much depends upon the temper which they
							happen to be in, to carry a measure before them.— Mercer moved from the
							Committee that <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> Manual, should be authority in all applicable
							cases, not incompatible with the Rules of the House, or with the joint
							rules of the two Houses.— An order that no spirituous liquors should be
							offered for sale or exhibited within the Capitol, or on the adjacent
							public grounds, was also reported and adopted— Bell moved that no count
							by tellers should be in order but upon motions seconded by at least one
							fifth of a quorum of the members— Carried <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> proposed that the
							Speaker in calling for Reports from the standing Committees he should
							name each of them in succession— Carried L. Lincoln proposed a rule that
							in the elections of the House by ballot, blanks should not be counted—
							<persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> moved that there should be a standing Committee on the mileage of
							the members, which much to the annoyance of <persRef ref="yell-archibald">Yell</persRef> of Arkansas; and the
							<persRef ref="claiborne-john;gholson-samuel;prentiss-seargent;word-thomas">Mississippi Members</persRef> was adopted— Mercer then moved that the rules as
							amended, with Jefferson’s Manual as part of them should be printed for
							the use of the Members which was carried; including also the
							Constitution of the United States—and thus closed the revisal of the
							Rules; whether for better or for worse is yet to be seen— I sometimes
							think there are already too many rules, and that it would be better to
							have none at-all.— The House adjourned at 5. O’Clock, over to Monday.— I
							have been for some time occupied day and night when at home, in
							assorting and recording the Petitions and remonstrances against the
							annexation of Texas, and other anti-Slavery Petitions which flow upon me
							in torrents— I am compelled to suspend the biography for M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><persRef ref="maul-john2">John Maul</persRef> is the son of a <persRef ref="maul-unknown">German</persRef> who was some years a messenger in the
							Department of State—in the latter part of his life, a useless hanger on
							and very troublesome— By the favour of <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, he
							got this Son educated at West-Point, and a Commission of Captain in the
							army— He was dismissed at the reduction of the army in 1821. and has
							been a burden upon Society ever since. He came now to solicit my
							recommendation of him, to <persRef ref="carr-overton">Overton Carr</persRef> the door-keeper of the house, to
							employ him as a Messenger or Runner; and he looked like famine— He had
							written to me to make the same request— <persRef ref="larned-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larned</persRef>
							has been many years Charge d’Affaires of the United States, in Chili and
							Peru; and has very recently returned home— He gave me very unfavourable
							accounts of the condition of those Countries, though he thinks highly of
							the present <persRef ref="santacruz-andres">President of Peru, General<space/></persRef>He holds his station by the
							wager of battle—he invaded Peru as commander in chief of an Army of the
							Republic of Bolivia—vanquished the <persRef ref="salaverry-felipe">Chief then at the head of the
							Peruvian Government</persRef>, had him shot as a traitor, and took his place.—
							This was in Feb<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1836. and I alluded to it in my
							Speech on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May of the same year. Peru
							and Bolivia are now to be united into one republic— They were separated
							only by the foolish ambition of <persRef ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> to have a Republic called by his
							name— I called at the Office of the Secretary of State, and saw <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>— Met there <persRef ref="gratiot-charles">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
									Gratiot</persRef>, and<space/><persRef ref="miller-john2">Miller</persRef>, heretofore Governor of Missouri, and now one of
							the members of the House from that State— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth
							told me that <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor’s</persRef> Brazilian Correspondence was now ready for
							communication to the House, and would be sent in next week. He spoke to
							me, about the reports of the two Commissioners under the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Article of the Treaty of Ghent— They were made in Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1828.— He had written to me to enquire what had
							been done at the time of their reception, as there are on the files of
							the Department no Documents to shew what was, or whether any thing was
							done— I presume that in fact nothing was done— There was an arbitration
							then pending upon the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article, involving the
							Maine boundary, not settled to this day—and while that was undecided, I
							presume, it was thought best to reserve further proceedings upon the
							disagreement between the Commissioners under the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Article— The whole subject had entirely passed away from
							my Memory: but as <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was in Feb<hi rend="superscript"
								>y</hi> 1828 Secretary of State, I referred M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Forsyth to him for the information desired, supposing that he would have
							some recollection of what was done concerning it— As to <persRef ref="ammidon-philip">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Ammidon’s</persRef> Chinese papers M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth
							said there was some difficulty in complying with his request, as there
							was no evidence to shew that the Hong Merchants had not presented the
							former papers to the <persRef ref="yuan-ruan">Vice-roy of Canton</persRef>— I asked him to write me a note,
							stating this difficulty, which I would communicate to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ammidon, which he promised to do— He told me that the
							Correspondence with Mexico, with Texas, and with Great Britain
							concerning the North-eastern boundary would be sent in next week— He
							said that no proposition for the cession of Texas had ever been made to
							the Mexican Government— That when <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Butler</persRef> had been Charge d’Affaires
							there, he came back here once all of a sudden, and made the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">old General</persRef>
							believe that if he would give him <hi rend="italic">sufficient</hi>
							<pb n="318" type="ms"/>sufficient authority, he would not only make the
							proposition but would accomplish the object— He was furnished with the
							authority; sent back and never made the proposition— His reliance had
							been upon what he believed was the disposition of <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa Anna</persRef>— From the
							Department of State I went to the Office of <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
							Force</persRef>, the Mayor of the City— He is preparing a vast collection of
							antient documents relating to the History of this Country, and has a
							very great and curious collection of his own— Thence I called at the
							National Intelligencer Office and saw <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>—
							Evening at home, and wrote to <persRef ref="loud-jacob">Jacob H. Loud</persRef>, of Plymouth enclosing a

						<p>Heard at the Presbyterian Church, <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> from
							Psalm 89.14. “Justice and Judgment are the habitation of thy throne:
							mercy and truth shall go before they face:”— I believe the latter half
							of the verse was not included in the text.— The whole verse is in the
							loftiest style of oriental imagery— Justice and Judgment are a
							habitation; not of God himself, for the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain
							him, but of his throne— The seat of that is fixed, eternally fixed, in
							Justice and Judgment— Yet Justice and Judgment convey only the idea of
							the righteousness and power of God—to complete his attributes, Mercy
							becomes an indispensable element— The Psalmist accordingly says— Mercy
							and Truth shall go before his face—and why go before his face, but to
							enlighten his Justice and to mitigate his judgment.— Taken altogether
							the verse is one of thoe examples of the sublime and accurate
							conceptions of the deity, which abound in the old Testament, and which
							constitute its highest title to be revered as a direct revelation from
							God— It is in the calvinisitic Spirit of fear, to overlook the attribute
							of Mercy, while contemplating the Justice, and the power of God— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler himself is evidently a benevolent, kind
							hearted man; but his <persRef ref="calvin-john">Calvinistic</persRef> education has taken from him the best
							part of his perceptions; and in leaving out the last half of the verse
							he was unconscious that he mutilated one of the most magnificent ideas
							of the Godhead that ever was committed to writing.— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read
							the service for the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and
							preached one of his short Sermons from Romans 13.12. “The night, is far
							spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of
							darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.”— How figurative again
							is this language!— This epistle is a Letter of moral and religious
							instruction to the converts to Christianity at Rome— When he said to
							them that the night was far spent, and the day was at hand, he had
							reference to the condition of those to whom he wrote, and to the
							progress of the gospel dawn— It is difficult to see the application of
							this figure to the present times or to a Washington auditory. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley however remarked the alternation of this
							figure of the transition between day and night, which occurs in the New
							Testament—here it is the passage from Night to day, when the works of
							darkness are to be cast off; and the armour of light to be assumed to
							fight the good fight of faith— Elsewhere it is said that the <hi
								rend="italic">day</hi> is far spent— The faithful are therefore
							exhorted to work while it is day; because the Night cometh when no man
							can work— There is no inconsistency between these metaphors, although
								<hi rend="italic">there</hi>
							<pb n="319" type="ms"/>there may be some, in the language which clothes
							them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley did not trouble himself much to shew
							how the Night was far spent, and the day at hand to us— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Sergeant</persRef> came somewhat belated to Church, and after the
							service, came home and spent an hour with me— Full of the news of the
							Election of Governor and members of the State Legislature in Maine,
							which is said to have turned most unexpectedly in favour of the whigs— I
							called and visited this Evening at <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S. Smith’s</persRef>
							and at <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb’s</persRef>. Neither M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith nor the
							General was at home— I saw <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson;macomb-harriet">the Ladies</persRef>.</p>

						<p>Call at the Bank of the Metropolis; with a check payable to <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary C.
							Adams</persRef>, drawn last May, but which she declined then to take— I now
							received it—50 dollars in bills of the bank, and 50 dollars in a draught
							on the Commonwealth’s Bank at Boston, which I endorsed payable to her
							order, and enclosed to her.— I had received yesterday from <persRef ref="brent-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> William L. Brent</persRef> a Letter of enquiries in behalf
							of the <persRef ref="u">Monk</persRef> family, and the <persRef ref="stokes-john2">John Stokes</persRef> concern— I called this morning
							at his Office to tell him all that I knew upon the subject, but he was
							not there. Met <persRef ref="pope-nathaniel">judge Nathaniel Pope</persRef>. Call at the Bank of Washington,
							which has resumed specie payments of its own bills, and made a special
							deposit of 390 dollars in Bills of the Bank of the United States—
							H.R.U.S.— At my motion 2000 extra copies of the revised rules with
							<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> Manual and the Constitution of the United States be printed
							and by a suggestion of <persRef ref="briggs-george">G. N. Briggs</persRef>, suitably bound— I presented 90
							Petitions and remonstrances against the annexation of Texas to the
							United States— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> presented the Resolves of the
							Legislature of Massachusetts concerning the franking privilege, and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>, the Resolutions respecting the order of
							18. January 1837. and Slavery in the District of Columbia, After
							presenting my Petitions, I offered a Resolution— [“]That the power of
							annexing the People of any independent foreign State to this Union is a
							power not delegated by the Constitution of the United States to their
							Congress, or to any department of their Government, but reserved to the
							People.” The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> refused to receive this motion or to allow it to be
							read; on the pretence that it was not in order— I appealed to the
							uniform practice of the House to receive with Petitions, Resolutions
							relating to the subject of them; but in vain. <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> Chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means, reported sundry Bills, among which one to
							appropriate 1600000 dollars for the suppression of Indian hostilities in
							Florida, and the Bill from the Senate to postpone the payment of the
							fourth instalment of the deposite with the States— He offered also a
							Resolution from the Committee, for the House to meet hereafter at 10.
							AM—which the House adopted, modifying the hour to 11— <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxed Loomis</persRef> a
							New member from the State of New-York offered a Resolution of enquiry of
							the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> about the modes of keeping the public
							monies since the organization of the Government, and the losses
							sustained by the different modes, which after running the gauntlet of
							half a dozen amendments proposed and withdrawn was finally adopted.
							<persRef ref="gholson-samuel">Gholson</persRef> of Mississippi offered a Resolution instructing the Committee of
							Elections to report <hi rend="italic">on</hi>
							<pb n="320" type="ms"/>on the <persRef ref="claiborne-john">contested election of the members from
								Mississippi</persRef>— <persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> of Virginia presented his bill, containing the
							counter project for the sub-treasury system— It is to return in
							substance to the deposit State-Banks— Cambreleng called for the orders
							of the day— The House went in to Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union, <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia in the Chair, and took up the Bill from the
							Senate—to postpone the payment of the fourth instalment of the deposit
							with the States— Cambreleng introduced the Bill, with a short Speech,
							and a statement of the denudated condition of the Treasury—a long debate

							pressure upon the Treasury, without postponing the instalment— No

							There was much discussion about the Bill for postponing the payment of
							the fourth Deposit instalment. The hour elapsed, and we agreed to meet
							again at ten to-morrow.— The call for Petitions began at the Territory
							of Wisconsin— I presented a long memorial from <persRef ref="huband-joseph">Joseph Husband jun<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> of Baltimore, about currency, and banking and the
							like—referred at my motion to the Committee of Ways and Means— I
							presented also 39. petitions and remonstrances against the annexation of

							yesterday denying the power of Congress to annex a foreign people to the
							Union—objection was made— I asked a suspension of the rules, and the
							yeas and nays upon the motion; both of which were denied— But after the
							call for Petitions was gone through, and that for Resolutions came up, I
							offered again the Resolution, which was received and at my own motion
							laid on the table— Other resolutions were offered— One by <persRef ref="martin-joshua2">Martin</persRef> of
							Alabama concerning the public Lands—one by <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> about tobacco—one by
							<persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef>; a Call upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> for documents relating to the trial of

							the last ten years—and one by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, for the appointment by ballot of a

						<p>Somewhat indisposed, and twice up in the Night— But at ten this morning
							we had the second meeting of the Massachusetts delegation, in the
							chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs. We discussed for an hour
							the question upon this deposit postponement bill— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> as
							well as myself has a strong reluctance to vote against it, under an
							apprehension that there is no money in the Treasury to pay the
							instalment, and that it can be paid only by new taxation upon the
							People.— The other members of the delegation incline very strongly to
							vote against the Bill, especially in the form as it comes from the
							Senate— We came only to the conclusion to watch the progress of the Bill
							in the House; to vote for any amendment to it which may be proposed,
							reserving the final vote of yea or nay, as the bill may be made by
							amendment satisfactory or otherwise— H.R.U.S.— I presented 12 Petitions
							and remonstrances against the admission of Texas into the Union— Many
							others were presented by other members. <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> from the Committee of
							Ways and Means reported the Bills from the Senate, authorizing the
							issuing of Treasury Notes, with two amendments; one a penal clause; the
							other an appropriation of half a Million—a bill for the postponement of
							the payment of duty bonds—and a Bill for the adjustment of the claims
							upon the late deposit banks, both without amendment.— All referred to
							the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.— <persRef ref="biddle-richard">R. Biddle</persRef>
							enquired of the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee <persRef ref="thomas-francis">F. Thomas</persRef>, whether
							they intended to report a bankrupt Law; and whether it would be such as
							<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef>, when he was a member of the Senate
							of the United States thought unconstitutional— Thomas said he could not
							give a satisfactory answer. That the Committee had had two Meetings—the
							second called by a member when he was absent; and at which nothing had
							been decided—but that he would give a further answer to-morrow— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef>
							Resolution for a Committee to investigate the Causes and conduct of the
							Florida War was discussed, till Cambreleng called for the orders of the
							day— <persRef ref="holsey-hopkins">Holsey</persRef> of Georgia made a tomahawk and scalping knife speech—
							<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> had objected to the appointment of the Committee by ballot— Wise
							in reply insisted upon it, and referring to his investigating Committee
							of last Winter declared that not one line of the report of the majority
							of that Committee <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
							<pb n="322" type="ms"/>was written by any member of the Committee— That
							it was written by a Scavenger—An Anti-masonic editor brought from
							Boston, by Dutee J. Pearce and made the Clerk of the Committee.— <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce</persRef>
							he said was not now in the house, and ought not to be in the Country.
							Wise’s speech was bitter as wormwood. Cambreleng called for the orders
							of the day.— The deposit postponement bill was taken up— Cambreleng
							replied feebly to <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell’s</persRef> attack upon the bill yesterday. <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> of
							Kentucky followed— <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> of South-Carolina offered an amendment,
							totally changing the character of the Bill— The Bill postpones the
							payment of the fourth instalment; till further provided for by Congress—
							It purports to be postponement. It is really a repeal of the Law
							requiring the payment.— Pickens proposes to strike out the words, till
							further provided for by Congress, and to insert, till the first of
							January 1839. <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of Ohio supported the Bill— <persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> of Virginia,
							promised to vote for it; and <persRef ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef> opposed it— <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Loomis</persRef> of Ohio moved
							that the Committee should rise which was carried and the House
							adjourned, about 4 O’Clock— <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef>—<persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert
								Buchanan</persRef> and <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>, were here separately after
							dinner— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye was complaining of a Bill concerning
							the District Banks; but was called away, by a cry of fire; which proved
							a false alarm— My indisposition continues; and affects my voice— John
							Wilson was here this morning.— He is about to leave the service of the
							<persRef ref="pontois-edouard">French Minister</persRef>, and proposes to set up a Hack.</p>

						<p>I was again twice up in the Night, and have also lost my voice— H.R.U.S.
							I presented the petition of <persRef ref="gardiner-john3">John Gardiner</persRef>, praying compensation for the
							invention of a Life-preserver, to save persons in cases of shipwreck
							from drowning— I believe it is the old Cork jacket— Laid on the table as
							were 12 petitions against the annexation of Texas to the Union which I
							also presented. <persRef ref="ewing-john">Ewing</persRef> presented a petition for a National Bank; and
							asked leave to offer with it a few remarks, but was refused.— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> of
							Maryland presented a petition from claimants of indemnity for French
							spoliations before the year 1800. and was allowed to offer with it a few
							remarks. <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef>, Chairman of the judiciary Committee, announced to the
							House that the Committee had this morning adopted a Resolution that it
							is inexpedient to report a Bankrupt Law, at the present Session of the
							Congress.— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Resolution for an investigation of the Florida War was
							taken up— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> withdrew his objection to the appointment of the
							Committee by ballot. <persRef ref="glascock-thomas">Glascock</persRef> moved an amendment for the appointment of
							a Committee, with authority to send for persons and papers— Howard of
							Maryland moved by way of amendment to Glascock’s amendment, that the
							reference should be to the Military Committee— <persRef ref="muhlenberg-henry">Muhlenberg</persRef> reproach<unclear>ed</unclear>
							Wise, for his attacks yesterday upon <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>, and <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin">Hallett</persRef>; and said
							he presumed Pearce had written the Report of the Majority.— Wise
							replied—respectfully to Muhlenberg— Severely, upon the Military
							Committee.— Wise called upon <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> to prove that Pearce, had
							acknowledged to him that the report of the majority was written by
							Hallett, and Lincoln did confirm the assertion. The House passed to the
							orders of the day and went into Committee of the whole on the Union, and
							took up the bill to postpone the payment of the fourth instalment of the
							deposit with the States— The amendment <hi rend="italic">proposed</hi>
							<pb n="323" type="ms"/>proposed by <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> was under consideration, but
							the Speakers ranged through the whole system of policy of the
							administration; <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Loomis</persRef> of Ohio made an elaborate assault upon the Bill—
							<persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> of Virginia followed in support of the Bill in an
							elaborate and well delivered speech; I believe the first he has made in
							three Sessions of Congress— <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> of New Hampshire came next in a
							very feeble speech sustaining the bill— <persRef ref="foster-henry">Foster</persRef> favoured Pickens’s
							amendment, and <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> opposed the Bill— At <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer’s</persRef> Motion the Committee
							rose and the House adjourned— Howard of Maryland came to my Seat, and
							told me that the Painters employed to fill up the pannels yet failing in
							the Rotunda had chosen their Subjects— One the landing of <persRef ref="columbus-christopher">Columbus</persRef>— One
							<persRef ref="smith-john13">John Smith</persRef> of Virginia— The third subject he did not recollect; but the
							fourth was the departure of the Massachusetts Colony from England— He
							also told me that the Mexican and Texian correspondence called for by my
							Resolutions, would be sent to the House in two or three days— And that a
							proposition to Mexico to cede Texas to the United States, was in the
							instructions to <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef> under my administration.— I invited <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi

							and <persRef ref="sedgwick-theodore2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Theodore Sedgwick</persRef> of Stockbridge,

							were presented by other members.— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> presented the thanks of a

							joint order of the two houses prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors
							within and around the Capitol— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Resolution for investigation of

							contested, and unquestionably null and void, made a Speech in favour of
							the reference to the Military Committee, and bitter and insulting to

							Campbell’s</persRef> conduct in the investigating Committee of last Winter— Wise
							rose to reply to Gholson; but <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> called for the orders of the

							<pb n="324" type="ms"/>Treasury must stop.— The Committee nevertheless

						<p>In the House of Representatives, without the bar, I saw <persRef ref="edwards-weldon">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Edwards</persRef>, heretofore a member of the House from North

							<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> administration in the controversy with France, and is
							exceedingly sore under his disappointment— He says the Country has been
							six years under the most contemptible despotism that ever disgraced a
							Nation— On motion of <persRef ref="haynes-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Haynes</persRef> of Georgia, it was
							ordered that the hour of meeting for the House after next Monday, for
							the remainder of the Session should be ten O’Clock— I
							presented<space/>Petitions for the abolition of Slavery &amp;c in the
							District of Columbia— Upon <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Resolution for an investigation of the
							causes and conduct of the War in Florida being called he made a tart
							speech, answered by squirts of wormwood from <persRef ref="gholson-samuel">Gholson</persRef> of Mississippi—
							<persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxed Loomis</persRef> took up the cudgel in behalf of his predecessor <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Abijah
							Mann jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> whom Wise had roughly handled; but Loomis
							made not much of his case— He is as sly and trickish as Mann; but more
							timid, and of oracular gravity— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> called for the orders of the
							day— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> asked Cambreleng if he intended to close the discussion in
							the Committee of the whole, on the deposit postponement bill, this day.
							Cambreleng said he did.— Cushing asked if the discussion was to be
							choked off; and was called to order.— Cambreleng had said in Committee
							of the whole, that circumstances had occurred since the passage of this
							Bill, and of the Bill for adjusting the balances due from the deposit
							banks in the Senate which rendered the passage of the postponement bill,
							indispensable; or within a week the Treasury would be dry— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
								Garland</persRef>—now enquired what those circumstances were— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> said it
							was not in order to refer in the House to any thing that had been said
							in Committee of the whole—but afterwards Cambreleng answered Garland’s
							question— He said that since the passage in the Senate of those two
							bills; the merchants did not want Treasury drafts to pay their bonds,
							and the banks saw they would not be compelled to pay their balances— The
							bonds and balances had therefore both become unavailable funds, and the
							Treasury was ashore. <persRef ref="fairfield-john">Fairfield</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-francis">Smith</persRef> of Maine, <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="halstead-william">Halstead</persRef> of New-Jersey discussed the postponement bill till near 5
							O’Clock, when at the motion of <persRef ref="williams-christopher">Christopher H. Williams</persRef> a new Member from
							Tennessee the Committee rose. <persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> of Virginia, said he should be
							obliged to go home, upon family concerns next Wednesday, and would
							therefore on Monday submit to the House his counterproject to the
							Sub-treasuries. Adjourned at 5— <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert. C Buchanan</persRef> was here in the
							Evening; and asked me to write some verses, for a young Lady of his

							that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
							life.”— The text is familiar to the <persRef ref="calvin-john">Calvinistic</persRef> doctrines— The preacher
							was more eloquent in purpose than in execution— Very earnest and very
							feeble. Old <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Nourse</persRef>, and <persRef ref="nourse-maria">his wife</persRef> were in

							afterwards <persRef ref="powers-hiram">Hiram Powars</persRef> the Sculptor, who is to sail from New-York for

						<p><persRef ref="adlington-john">John Adlington</persRef>, a man upwards of 80 years of age, a Yankee from the crown

							way, for an increase of pension from 8 dollars a Month, as for a common
							Seaman, to 16 dollars a Month as a Midshipman in 1775, before the
							Declaration of Independence— He came also to claim arrears of pay (which
							he said he had never received for subsequent services in the same
							War[)]. I took his papers to the pension Office, and left them
							together—with others which I had received in a Letter from <persRef ref="loud-jacob">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob H Loud</persRef> of Plymouth, with <persRef ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Edwards</persRef> the Commissioner— I then went to the Office of the
							Secretary of the Navy, and left with him a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-john3">my nephew and
								namesake Midshipman</persRef>, asking for orders—and I made application for <persRef ref="spooner-thomas">Thomas
							Spooner</persRef> now a private in the Marine Corps; soliciting an appointment of
							Lieutenant in the Corps, which <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickerson</persRef> told me
							could not be granted. H.R.U.S. <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> from the Committee of Ways and
							Means reported a Resolution that it is inexpedient to charter a National
							Bank— The object of this is to supersede the discussion of <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef>
							Resolution for an investigation of the Causes and conduct of the Florida
							War.— I had presented the memorial of <persRef ref="strang-david">David Strang</persRef>, and had it referred
							to the Committee of Ways and Means; and I had also
							presented<space/>Petitions against the <hi rend="italic">annexation</hi>
							<pb n="326" type="ms"/>annexation of Texas to the Union; and a budget of
							those of the last Session for the abolition of Slavery in the District
							of Columbia— <persRef ref="chambers-john">Chambers</persRef> of Kentucky offered a Petition for a National
							Bank, and said he had several others which he should in due time move to
							have referred to the Committee of the whole on the Union; but he moved
							that this one should lie on the table—which was done— <persRef ref="ewing-john">Ewing</persRef> asked leave
							to offer a Resolution calling on the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for
							returns of the specie and paper received in payment for public Lands—but
							the leave, and the suspension of the rules which he moved, were both
							refused— <persRef ref="buchanan-andrew3">Buchanan</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of Elections made a report

							and <persRef ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef>, have been duly elected members of the 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congress— <persRef ref="maury-abram">Maury</persRef>, a member of the Committee said the
							minority would not present a counter-report; but would exhibit their
							views in the form of a proposed amendment to the Resolution.— There was
							a discussion whether the subject should be debated in the morning hour,
							or referred to the Committee of the whole on the Union; and the morning
							hour prevailed— Postponed till Wednesday.— <persRef ref="everett-edward">Everett</persRef> moved that the
							Resolution of the inexpediency of a National Bank, should be laid on the
							table— Lost, by yeas and nays 89 to 122. In Committee of the whole on
							the state of the Union, the deposit postponement Bill was debated,
							<persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> in the Chair till one O’Clock in the Morning— <persRef ref="martin-joshua2">Martin</persRef> of Alabama
							moved an amendment to the Bill, which the Chairman received, while
							<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens’s</persRef> amendment was yet undecided— The whole day was consumed in
							debating neither of the amendments, but the Bill and the whole
							financeering system of the administration—at dusk of evening an attempt
							was made to adjourn which failed; a second and third motion for the
							Committee to rise were alike unsuccessful, the third vote by tellers
							being 84 and 84. lost by the casting vote of the chairman— Shortly
							before midnight I enquired if Martin’s amendment was in order—the
							Chairman said, not strictly, but he had entertained it for reasons which
							he was about to assign, when Martin withdrew it— I then moved an
							amendment to Pickens’s amendment—appropriating the balances due from all
							the late deposit Banks to the payment of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							deposit on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January 1839. declaring that
							they shall be applied to no other purpose whatever—providing that if the
							balances recoverable from the banks should not prove sufficient for the
							payment in 1839. the instalment due from the Bank of the United States
							in October 1838. for Stock should be applied to the same purpose—and in
							failure of that, pledging the faith of the United States that provision
							shall be made by Congress for the payment— I made a very few
							observations in offering the amendment, being so hoarse that I could

						<list><item>Adlington John </item></list>
						<p>I came home this morning with a heavy head-ache and otherwise unwell— I
							had no sleep, and rose after the dawn, but before the Sun; relieved from
							my head ache; but with spirits dissipated making it impossible for me to
							write— <persRef ref="adlington-john">John Adlington</persRef> was here again with his hearing interpreter; for
							he is deaf— I had not received the report from the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of
							Pensions</persRef> upon his papers; but he said his cash was short, and he must
							make the best of his way home; and wait for me to send his answer from
							the Pension Office and his papers to <persRef ref="loud-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob H.
							Loud</persRef> of Plymouth.— H.R.U.S. at 10. O’Clock A.M. I presented<space/>Petitions
							and Memorials for the abolition of Slavery; and multitudes were
							presented by other members— <persRef ref="loud-jacob">Dunn</persRef> and <persRef ref="ewing-john">Ewing</persRef> of Indiana offered
							Resolutions of Call upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>— That of Dunn was
							received and adopted— That of Ewing was not ever received.— Ewing
							renewed his motion, and <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina called for the yeas
							and nays— They were 97 to 76. not two thirds—and thus the rule formed
							for the protection of the minority, was abused to their oppression.
							<persRef ref="johnson-henry">Johnson</persRef> of Louisiana offered a Resolution, requiring of the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
							War</persRef>, to prepare for the first week of the Winter Session, a plan for the
							protection of the Western frontier against Indian Aggressions; which has
							over a day.— The Resolution from the Committee of Ways and Means that it
							is inexpedient to Charter a National Bank was opposed by <persRef ref="reed-john">Read</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef>, and amendments were offered by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef>, and <persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef>.— The
							<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> laid before the House, an answer from the Secretary of the
							Treasury to Call for correspondence and statements relating to the
							deposit Banks A Resolution from the Senate for closing the Session on
							the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next Month was taken up, and
							passionately opposed by Bell, who said it was an insult to the House—
							<persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> moved the previous question, but could not carry it— He then
							moved to postpone the consideration of the Resolution till next Monday
							at 11. O’Clock, and make it the special order for that time— I asked
							leave to move an amendment to strike out the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							October, and insert the first Monday in April next—but the Speaker
							refused to receive my motion. <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> had moved a call for a statement
							from the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk of the House</persRef> shewing the cost of this extra session; but
							his motion was rejected— He asked that it might be laid on the table and
							printed, and called for the yeas and nays on this motion but all was
							refused— <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> laid on the table an amendment which he gave notice
							that he should propose when in order, to the deposit postponement bill—
							The House then went into Committee of the whole, <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> in the Chair on
							that bill— Mercer made a Speech of nearly two hours, generally against
							the Bill.— He was followed by <persRef ref="rencher-abraham">Rencher</persRef>, <persRef ref="taylor-william7">Taylor</persRef> of New-York and <persRef ref="bond-william2">Bond</persRef> of
							Ohio.— Wise, Ewing and <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> expressed the wish to speak; and upon a
							promise to Jenifer by Cambreleng that the previous question should not
							be sprung upon him in the house—the question was taken by tellers on my
							amendment to that of <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> which was lost 89 to 104—on that of Pickens
							which was lost 84 to 110, and on other amendments proposed by <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>
							and others; all of which were rejected— The Committee then rose and
							reported the Bill without Amendment— A Message was received from the
							<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>, with the Brazilian correspondence of <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor’s</persRef>
							Negotiations—and the answer <hi rend="italic">to my</hi>
							<pb n="328" type="ms"/>to my call for the correspondence relating to the
							North-eastern boundary but neither the Mexican, Nor the Texan
							correspondence was sent. <persRef ref="archer-william">W. S. Archer</persRef> told me the other day that a great
							majority of the People of Texas were not desirous of annexation to this
							Union, but averse to it— That is a cunning way of stimulating us to
							desire it. The House adjourned at half-past six; and I came exhausted
							home.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> was here this morning, and enquired if I could conveniently pay my

							wants the money to pay— I gave him a check for 200 dollars, which he
							said was all he wanted now, and I promised to pay him the remainder
							immediately after the close of the Session— H.R.U.S. <persRef ref="williams-joseph2">Joseph L. Williams</persRef>,
							a new member from Tennessee took his Seat. I
							presented<space/>Petitions—chiefly for the abolition of Slavery in the

							were offered, among which one by <persRef ref="biddle-richard">R. Biddle</persRef>, to refer the Report of the
							<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> concerning his discriminitive specie payments
							to the Committee of Ways and Means for enquiry into the expediency of
							legislative regulation. But the yeas and nays on the motion to suspend
							the rules were 85 to 102. <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> Chairman of the Committee on the
							judiciary offered a Resolution instructing the Committee to enquire what
							Laws would expire at the close of the present Session of Congress, and
							to report a Bill to continue in force such of them as ought to be

							Resolutions, and <persRef ref="ewing-john">Ewing</persRef> at last succeeded in getting his received, but
							not considered— It lies over, a day—that is to the end of the Session—
							The Resolution from the Committee of Ways and Means that it is
							inexpedient to establish a National Bank was postponed till next
							Saturday <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef>, who had yesterday commenced a Speech against it
							being indisposed and unable to proceed in it to day— <persRef ref="smith-francis">Smith</persRef> of Maine,

							North-eastern boundary, for which I had called— <persRef ref="sawyer-samuel">Sawyer</persRef> of North-Carolina
							objected, but withdrew the objection at my request.— I asked Smith to
							include the Brazilian correspondence in his motion, but he declined— His
							motion was agreed to. I then asked leave to move for the printing of an
							equal number of the Brazilian Correspondence, but objection was made,
							and I desisted— <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> from the Library Committee offered a Resolution
							respecting the purchase and publication of the Papers of the late <persRef ref="madison-james">James
								Madison</persRef>, which was adopted— <persRef ref="maury-abram">Maury</persRef> of Tennessee; offered an amendment to
							the Report of the Committee of Elections, declaring <persRef ref="gholson-samuel">Gholson</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef> duly elected members of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>

							Bill in a speech which I did not hear, and which was not worth hearing.
							He was followed by<space/><persRef ref="menefee-richard">Menefee</persRef>, a new and young member from Kentucky of
							great talent and promise— He is said to be called in Kentucky the young
							<persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>; and his Speech proved him worthy of the appellation— It was
							powerful and eloquent— <persRef ref="fry-jacob">Fry</persRef> of Pennsylvania made a short and <hi
								rend="italic">shallow</hi>
							<pb n="329" type="ms"/>shallow Speech in favour of the Bill, and was
							succeeded by <persRef ref="potter-william">Potter</persRef>, also of Pennsylvania, who canted like a methodist
							Preacher.— He read from a newspaper a part of my Letter to <persRef ref="foster-william">William
								Foster</persRef>, and censured it— A highly spirited debate then followed—by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>,
							in one of his best and most pungent speeches, in which he alluded to
							<persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Flagg</persRef>— Cambreleng denied that he had used the
							expression in that Letter “we have got the banks upon the hip.” said
							that he had no ill will to the Banks; but that Wise should have assailed
							me, who had compared the Presidents and Directors of all the Banks in
							the Union to counterfeitors. He promised Wise to send him to-morrow
							morning a copy of his Letter to Flagg, if he would make it a part of his
							Speech—which Wise promised to do. Cambreleng said his letter was not
							against the Banks, but censured the Legislatures for legalizing the
							violation by the Banks of their engagements— <persRef ref="hambly-thomas">Hamer</persRef> of Ohio answered
							Wise, with all his power which is not small— <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> of Georgia, began by
							enquiring of Cambreleng whether the Bill for the relief of the deposit
							Banks was to pass the House? Cambreleng said he could not answer for
							others— He expected it would— Dawson then asked him whether the deposit
							Banks of New-York were solvent or insolvent— Cambreleng answered with
							hesitation that some were solvent—others not—one at least he believed
							was not Dawson put the same question to Duncan, concerning the Banks of
							Ohio— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> answered that he believed the Banks were good; but their
							paper was depretiated from 10 to 14. per cent. <persRef ref="johnson-henry">Johnson</persRef> of Louisiana and
							<persRef ref="martin-joshua2">Martin</persRef> of Alabama, answered for the banks of their respective States—
							Dawson said he would not put the same question respecting the Bank of
							Missouri, lest it should give offence—but he would receive with pleasure
							any information from the members from that State which they might be
							disposed to give—none was given.— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> took up the cause of the
							Banks of Ohio, insisting that they were all, save one, as sound and
							solvent as any others in the Union— There was some discussion upon this
							between Whittlesey, <persRef ref="bond-william2">Bond</persRef>, Hamer and Duncan— Dawson commenced a Speech
							against the Bill—but nearly at 8 O’Clock yielded to a motion to adjourn,
							which was carried— <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef> said to me that his great objection to the

						<p>H.R.U.S.— I presented<space/>Petitions for the abolition of Slavery in the
							Territories<space/>for refusing the admission of any new Slaveholding State
							into the Union—and<space/>for the prohibition of the interstate Slave trade—
							With the last I asked leave to offer a Resolution, calling upon the
							<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, to report at the next Session of Congress the
							numbers of Slaves exported from, and imported into the several Ports of
							the United States, by the Coasting trade— There was what <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> would
							have called a superb <hi rend="small-caps">no!</hi> returned to my
							request, from the servile side of the House— <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef> asked for
							the printing of 3 Resolutions which he intends to offer for the
							establishment of a national Bank; and it was ordered— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanley</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="toland-george">Toland</persRef>, failed to obtain the consideration of Resolutions, which they
							wished to offer. <persRef ref="snyder-adam">Snyder</persRef> of Illinois offered a Resolution of enquiry of
							the Secretary of the Treasury what amount of Specie was in the Bank of
							Missouri <hi rend="italic">on</hi>
							<pb n="330" type="ms"/>on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July and on

							<persRef ref="bronson-isaac">Bronson</persRef> of New-York, discussed during the remnant of the morning hour
							the Mississippi Section— Then the orders of the day and the deposit
							postponement Bill came up, introduced by <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cambreleng</persRef> who made a recanting and disclaiming apology for his
							discrediting remarks of yesterday upon the New-York banks— He now
							pronounced them all solvent, with indulgence of time; and said he had no
							hostile feelings towards gentlemen concerned in those institutions; but
							what he had censured and resisted was improper and intrusive
							legislation, upon the subject.— <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> and <persRef ref="towns-george">Townes</persRef> of Georgia addressed
							the house in long speeches, one against the other for the deposit
							postponement Bill. <persRef ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> of Kentucky, followed against it— In the midst
							of his Speech, <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> moved a recess of an hour for the members to dine—
							A half an hour’s debate ensued which ended in a resolution to take the
							recess of an hour this day, and from half past 2 till 4. O’Clock every
							day hereafter till the end of the Session— An hour and a half is
							precisely the time that it takes me to walk home from the Capitol, and
							back again. So I cannot go home to dine— I repaired to the Chamber of
							the Committee of Manufactures, but the door was locked, and the key not
							to be found— I wrote during the recess a Letter to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— When the
							<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> resumed the chair, Graves concluded his Speech which was in his
							manner—animated, and with very rapid elocution—but diffuse and full of
							repetitions ad nauseam— <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> of New Hampshire then moved the Previous
							Question, and <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia moved a Call of the House— The previous
							Question, which cut off my amendment and that of <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> was carried by
							yeas and nays. 123 to 102— The passage of the Bill to a third reading by
							119 to 117. Immediately after the vote was declared, Pickens moved a
							reconsideration of it, and said he had voted in the affirmative for that
							express purpose— The real vote then was a tie 118 and 118. and the
							largest vote ever given in the House of Representatives of the United
							States 237. members including the Speaker, present and voting out of
							242— The House adjourned at 8. O’Clock. I walked part of the way home
							with Cambreleng, and noticed the closeness of his vote— He said the
							House would probably reconsider, and adopt Pickens’s amendment— In the
							National Intelligencer of this day, the very few remarks with which I
							introduced the amendment in Committee of the whole on the Union—well
							reported by <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury</persRef>—</p>

						<p>H.R.U.S— I reached the House, at the instant of time to present 51
							petitions and remonstrances against the order of the House of
							Representatives of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1837—which
							was to lay on the table without printing or further action of the House
							upon them all Petitions, Resolutions and Papers in any manner relating
							to Slavery— Most of these were received by me during the last Session,
							but the majority of the House by evading after the 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of February the reception of all Petitions, excluded the
							reception of these, and of 150 others, all of which I have now presented
							and they have all been received and laid on the table.— <persRef ref="toland-george">Toland</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania offered a Resolution of Call upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
							Treasury</persRef> for copies of all correspondence and Documents of the
							Department with individuals Banks and Corporations, relating to the Bill
							for issuing Treasury notes, which lies over one day— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanley</persRef> resolution
							of enquiry, concerning the number and cost <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
							<pb n="331" type="ms"/>of the proposed sub-treasuries, was adopted—but
							<persRef ref="ewing-john">Ewing</persRef> solicited in vain the consideration of the Resolution, which he
							has several days pressed upon the courtesy of the House— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> from
							the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a Bill of additional
							appropriations for the year 1837.— Read twice and referred to the
							Committee of the whole House on the state of the Union— As was a Bill
							reported by <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef>, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to continue
							till the end of the next Session of Congress all laws which would expire
							with the present Session— The Mississippi election was next debated—
							<persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> of Tennessee supported the report of the majority of the
							Committee, and Towns of Georgia, opposed it— <persRef ref="towns-george">Towns</persRef> was a member of the
							Committee, and although devoted to the administration, dissented from
							the report of the majority, in favour of the <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent;word-thomas">sitting Mississippi
								Members</persRef>— <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> of Virginia, spoke also against the report of the
							Committee until the orders of the day were called, when at the instance
							of <persRef ref="gholson-samuel">Gholson</persRef> and <persRef ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef>, the subject was postponed till next Monday,
							and made the special order for that day.— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> laid before the
							House, an answer from the Secretary of the Treasury to a call respecting
							the suspension of payments on the Merchants bonds— The deposit
							postponement bill coming up, the first question to be decided was the
							motion of <persRef ref="pickens-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pickens</persRef> for reconsideration of the vote
							passing the bill to a third reading.— Pickens urged his own amendment as
							an argument for reconsideration, and I urged my amendment to his
							amendment, to the same point. I noticed particularly an assertion of
							<persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> in a speech the other day, that the natural tendency of
							this Government was that all the money of the Nation, flowed <hi
								rend="italic">to</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">North</hi>— I treated the whole subject with
							pleasantry, much to the amusement of the house, and with some
							impression— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> said to me, as we were going out of the house, at
							the recess, that every word I had spoken, drew blood— Waddy Thompson
							admitted that he had said all the money of the Nation flowed to the
							North— <persRef ref="lyon-francis">Lyon</persRef> of Alabama, and Gholson of Mississippi, made some remarks on
							my allusions to the enormous deposits of public monies in the banks of
							their respective States, to which I replied— <persRef ref="gray-hiram">Gray</persRef> of New-York and
							<persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> of Vermont spoke in favour of the reconsideration— <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxed
								Loomis</persRef>, successor of <persRef ref="mann-abijah">Abijah Mann jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> moved the
							previous question, but withdrew it, at the request of <persRef ref="toucey-isaac">Toucey</persRef> of
							Connecticut who began a speech which was interrupted by the recess— I
							passed it in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, writing a
							Letter to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— When the Speaker resumed the Chair Toucey finished
							his Speech, weak as water, for the bill, as a <hi rend="italic"
								>repeal</hi>, of the fourth instalment— Cambreleng moved the
							previous question and a call of the House— 215 members answered to their
							names— The previous question was carried, and the vote for
							reconsideration 149 to 81. Cambreleng voted against it, but allowing it
							to be carried by his rank and file— Pickens then moved his amendment
							limiting the payment of the fourth instalment to the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of January 1839— Haynes moved an amendment to it a
							proviso, that there should be a sufficient surplus in the Treasury:
							which Pickens said he himself would cheerfully have accepted, but to
							which his friends would not assent.— <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> withdrew his amendment and I
							offered mine: appropriating the balances in the deposit banks; the
							instalment of the debt to be due in October 1838 from the bank of the
							United States, and pledging the Faith of the United States, to the
							payment on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January 1839. the last clause
							of which however I consented to withdraw— <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">Phillips</persRef> made <hi
								rend="italic">a</hi>
							<pb n="332" type="ms"/>a very singular Speech; ostensibly in support of
							my amendment; but in reality against the postponement of the instalment,
							and an argument for making the payment at once by an issue of Treasury
							Notes— <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> by an obliquity of the rational faculty not less
							remarkable without objecting to Pickens’s amendment, flatly rejected
							mine, and said if it should be adopted he would vote against the Bill—
							His motive was the dastardly fear of reproach from his constituents for
							supporting any motion offered by me— There are at least 95
							representatives of Slaves in the House, under the same servile fear.—
							Arphaxed Loomis, advised me to change the word pay, in my amendment for
							the word deposit— I said it was a mere mutation of words and not of
							thought; but that to accomodate him I would accept his modification, if
							he would then vote for my amendment; but he declined— My amendment was
							lost by a vote of 94 to 135.— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina moved to lay
							the bill and amendments on the table—lost 101. to 132— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> moved to
							refer the bill and amendments back to the Committee of the whole on the
							Union with Instructions to report another Bill nearly the same with my
							amendment—rejected without counting— Phillips then moved a recommit with
							instructions to report a Bill for paying the deposit, and issuing
							Treasury notes payable in a year with interest—rejected without count,
							and with refusal of the yeas and nays— <persRef ref="mason-james3">Mason</persRef> of Virginia, moved to
							substitute a Bill to repeal the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							instalment—lost—so were sundry other proposed amendments, and at last
							the previous question was carried, and the bill passed to a third
							reading—by a vote of 118 to 105— The third reading was called for
							immediately. <persRef ref="garland-rice">Garland</persRef> of Louisiana, wished it postponed until the Bill
							for settling accounts with the late deposit Banks shall have been taken
							up and amended— The balances due from the Banks of Alabama, Louisiana,
							Mississippi and Michigan are so heavy that they cannot pay them within
							the term of nine months proposed in the settlement Bill— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Garland</persRef> was
							afraid, if this postponement Bill should pass before a longer term than
							nine months should be secured to the Louisiana Banks than the Settlement
							bill proposes, those Banks will be at the mercy of the Secretary of the
							Treasury.— Gholson of Mississippi pleaded also very hard for the
							postponement. Cambreleng to whom the votes of the members from those
							States were indispensable, promised that if they would vote for this
							bill, their banks should be treated with indulgence— <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> of Georgia,
							and <persRef ref="mason-samson">Sampson Mason</persRef> of Ohio indignantly pointed out to the House this
							shameless bargain—thus struck in the face of the House.— But after some
							discussion, <persRef ref="mckim-isaac">M’Kim</persRef> moved the previous question which was carried, and the
							Bill without taking the yeas and nays was read the third time and
							passed— The Speaker laid before the House two Executive reports, and the
							House at 11 O’Clock at Night adjourned— On Pickens’s amendment, and on
							the passage of the Bill to the third reading Patton bolted—he left the
							house and did not vote at all— He had not said a word against Pickens’s
							amendment nor against the Bill; but he had made a Speech against my
							amendment and said if it should be adopted he would vote against the
							Bill— It were a curious enquiry to trace the small motives which turn
							the balance of deliberation upon great National concerns— It was near
							Midnight when I got home— It had been raining all day— Walk with

						<p>My occupations break down all succession of Time. When I reached the
							Capitol this morning, I found the House in Session. The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> was
							calling for Petitions from the Pennsylvania members, having begun with
							the Territory of Wisconsin.— After disburthening myself of all the
							Petitions which had been left upon my hands at the close of the last
							Session of Congress, I had none this morning to present. Other members
							presented petitions, for the abolition of Slavery, and against the
							annexation of Texas— <persRef ref="toland-george">Toland’s</persRef> Resolution offered yesterday, calling upon
							the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for correspondence relating to the
							Treasury Note Bill now before the House, after some discussion was
							adopted— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> from the Committee of Ways and Means reported
							without amendment a Bill from the Senate a Bill to remit the duties on
							goods destroyed by fire in the City of New-York; and with an amendment,
							a Bill for extending the time for the payment of duties on merchants’
							Bonds. <persRef ref="dunn-george">Dunn</persRef> of Indiana, moved a reference to the Committee on the
							Judiciary, of a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, and an
							opinion of the <persRef ref="butler-benjamin">Attorney General</persRef> concerning duty bonds. <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef>
							continued, without concluding his Speech on the Resolution that it is
							inexpedient to establish a National Bank; and <persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> of Virginia
							moved as an amendment, that no such institution ought ever to be
							chartered without a previous amendment of the Constitution <hi
								rend="italic">expressly</hi> delegating the power to Congress.—
							Orders of the day. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							<persRef ref="conner-henry">Connor</persRef> in the Chair— Cambreleng calls for the Bill for issuing ten
							Millions of Treasury Notes— The <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef> takes up the House Bill, and reads
							to the words “without interest,” when Cambreleng stops him and tells him
							he must take up the Senate’s Bill, which he does and reads it through—
							Bell then objects that it is a Bill to raise revenue, and appeals to
							me.— I had started the objection in my speech of yesterday, without
							making any apparent impression upon the house— I now said that if ever
							there was a Bill to raise revenue this was that Bill— I would offer no
							motion, for I knew that if I did it would immediately be voted down; but
							if he would open the discussion, he should have my cordial support—
							<persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> interrupted me by a Question of order and said it was too late to
							raise the objection— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> said it could never be too late for a
							Constitutional objection, and moved that the Committee should rise; that
							the Bill might be sent back to the Senate— I enquired of the Chairman
							whether Wise’s motion superseded Haynes’s question of order— Connor
							answered, in the opinion of the Chairman it does.— Cambreleng sputtered
							about the necessities of the Treasury— Said this was not a Bill to raise
							revenue—that the compromise Bill of 1833 originated in the Senate, and
							complained of the desire of the opposition to trammel the necessary
							operations of the Government— <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> replied—and denied that the
							compromise bill had originated in the Senate— Robertson said that this
							was the most flagrant breach of the privileges of the House that ever
							was perpetrated— The House was kindling into a flame, upon a spark that
							I had dropped yesterday; when Cambreleng gave way, and moved to take up
							the House’s Bill; which after some opposition was done, and then he
							moved the Bill from the Senate, as an amendment to that of the House—
							<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Robert Barnwall Rhett</persRef> (Smith heretofore) moved a long amendment, and
							literally howled, a nullification Speech— I say howled for his
							enunciation was so <hi rend="italic">rapid</hi>
							<pb n="334" type="ms"/>rapid, inarticulate, and vociferous, that his
							head hung back, as he spoke with his face upward, like that of a howling
							dog. A skirmishing debate followed, and at 1/2 past 2 the House
							adjourned over to Monday— I offered a Resolution of Call upon the
							Secretary of the Treasury for returns of the amount of gold and silver
							received by the Receivers of Public monies and deposit Banks under the
							specie circular. Haynes objected to this Call; but upon a hint from
							Cambreleng withdrew his objection, and the Resolution was adopted— As I
							was coming down the steps of the Capitol, a man by the name of <persRef ref="towle-nathaniel">Towle</persRef>
							stopped me and inquired if I would sit to <persRef ref="towle-eunice">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Towle</persRef>
							for my Portrait— I stopped with him at his house; which is the same,
							where <persRef ref="powers-hiram">Powars</persRef> had his moulding room— I saw M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Towle,
							and her collection of Portraits, consisting of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>, <persRef ref="johnson-richard">R. M.
								Johnson</persRef>—<persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> the Speaker, <persRef ref="benton-thomas">T. H. Benton</persRef>, <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos Kendall</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wise-henry">H. A. Wise</persRef>,
							unfinished— I was not over-ambitious to appear in such company, meme en
							peinture, as old <persRef ref="lowenhielm-fredrik">Count Löwenhielm</persRef> said he would not like to reside at
							Delft— Nor was I much charmed with the execution of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Towle’s Portraits— Yet as an act of courtesy, I promised to
							sit; if during the Winter Session I should have leisure— Evening at
							home— <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert C Buchanan</persRef> was here.— His furlough expires next Wednesday,
							and he goes for Baton rouge— He renewed a request that I would send him
							any documents relating to the army. [symbols]</p>
