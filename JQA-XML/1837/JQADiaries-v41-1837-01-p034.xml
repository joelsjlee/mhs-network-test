						<p>I commenced the year, after praise supplication and prayer to whom it was
							due by writing a short Letter to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>. At the Presbyterian Church, morning service, I heard
								<persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef>, from Jeremiah 8:20. “The harvest is past, the
							summer is ended, and we are not saved.” There is great earnestness and
							sincerity in the discourses of this young man; and though very plain and
							unadorned, they command the deep attention of his auditory. His text was
							allusive to the close of one year, and the commencement of another, and
							he explained the order of events, as expressed in the text, by observing
							that in Judea, where the prophet wrote, the harvest, precedes the
							Summer— He very fervently urged upon us his hearers to make the
							application of his text to ourselves—to consider that our harvest was
							past; that our Summer was ended and that we were not saved—and he
							exhorted us most earnestly, while a remnant of time was left us, to
							provide for working out our own salvation— I heard him with a
							disposition and desire to profit by his instruction, and with the
							deepest conviction, that my Summer is ended and my harvest past—whether
							I am or shall be saved is all unknown to me— I know that I have been and
							am a sinner— Perhaps by the depravity of the human heart, an
							unreclaimable sinner—but I cannot if I would, divest myself of the
							belief that my maker is a being whose tender mercies are over all his
							works— That having the power to make me both will and do, however he may
							chastise, he will not cruelly punish thoughts which his pleasure may
							controul or deeds which however wrongful or imperfect, his power can
							turn to good— We are passive instruments in his hands— His will not
							suffer us to do evil, and then sentence us severely for what he has
							suffered us to do— My reason and my sense of Justice will not yield to
							any other creed than this; and therefore when a preacher tells me that I
							am not saved, I believe that he says that of which he knows as little as
							myself—perhaps less—perchance nothing at all— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fowler’s Sermon therefore did not deeply distress me, nor
							depress my hopes of better things— After dinner, at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the Evening service for the festival of the Circumcision; and his
							Sermon was from Philippians 4:12. [“]I know both how to be abased; and I
							know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am instructed, both
							to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and to suffer need.” The
							text seemed to have some allusion to the condition of the preacher
							himself, who does not abound, and whose congregation, are not
							practically zealous to save their Pastor from suffering need— But
							whatever might be the intentional hint of the text, there was no
							corresponding comment in the discourse— There was no complaint, direct
							or indirect—no reference at-all to himself.— Why he read the service of
							the Circumcision day, instead of that for the first Sunday after
							Christmas, I did not understand; nor <hi rend="italic">do</hi>
							<pb n="35" type="ms"/>do I know why the Roman Catholic, and more
							particularly the English Episcopal Church keep as a festival the day of
							Christ’s circumcision—that being a jewish rite which the Christian
							dispensation was to abolish. <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J.
								Frye</persRef> dined, and passed the Night here— I employed the
							Evening upon this diary, without bringing it up to the close of the
							year— There was rain, the former part of the day, and a heavy gale in
							the evening sweeping from the North-west.</p>

						<p>Intense cold, with a strong Gale from the North-west and a clear sky— The
							visitors were fewer than they have ever been upon a New-years day since
							we have resided in this House— The cause of this besides the severity of
							the weather was that for the first time for many years the President’s
							house was not opened to visitors— Many of them before or after going
							there were accustomed to come here— But the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> had some weeks since a
							bleeding of the lungs, from which though much recovered he remains yet
							too feeble to receive multitudes of visitors. In addition to which it is
							but three days since he received the tidings of the death of <persRef
								ref="donelson-emily">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Donelson</persRef>, the wife of his <persRef ref="donelson-andrew"
								>Secretary</persRef>; and who has always lived with him at the
							President’s House— <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Stewart</persRef> and <persRef ref="dewindt-elizabeth2"
								>Elizabeth De Wint</persRef> were the only Ladies, who came this
							day; the men were very few, but enough to keep me all the morning at
							home, and after dinner I had no temptation to go out— <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J. Frye</persRef>, returned this morning to
							the College— I answered a Letter from <persRef ref="clarke-robert2"
								>Robert Clark</persRef> of Monroe, Michigan— He wrote me a Letter
							asking my opinion upon the proceedings in that State relating to its
							admission into the Union. At the last Session of Congress an Act was
							passed for admitting the State of Michigan into the Union—but in that
							same act, and in another they took away without a shadow of right some
							six hundred square miles of the Territory of Michigan, and gave it to
							the State of Ohio— And conscious that they had no right to do this, they
							made it an indispensable condition of the admission of Michigan into the
							Union, that a Convention of the People, called for that express purpose,
							should declare their assent to this change of their boundary— The
							Legislature of Michigan accordingly called a Convention, which met in
							September, and by a majority of 7 votes rejected the condition which
							Congress had imposed upon them— Two months later, another Convention,
							elected by a spontaneous movement of the people, accepted the con— This
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke who writes to me, for my
							opinion, and advice, considers this second Convention as a mere mockery,
							assembled without authority, and enquires whether Congress could not be
							prevailed upon to revise their <pb n="36" type="ms"/>their Act for the
							admission of Michigan into the Union— I answer him that they probably
							will; but that I have no hope that they will repair their injustice to
							the People of Michigan—sanctioned as it has now been by the assent of
							Michigan People themselves— This is one of the most remarkable examples
							of the usurpation of power and perpetration of wrong by Congress that
							has occurred since the Government of the United States has existed. An
							usurpation of judicial power for a shameless and barefaced violation of
							the right of property— So conscious was Congress of the wrong they were
							doing, that by another daring usurpation of power, they made the formal
							assent of the People of Michigan, to this robbery of their property, an
							express condition of their admission as a State into the Union, having
							no more right to prescribe this condition, than to take from the People
							of Michigan their property— Against all this I solemnly protested, in a
							speech of three hours when the wrong was done, but found no support from
							any quarter of the House— There were 29 Members of the House, from the
							States of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, all interested against the right
							of Michigan, and there were 35 electoral votes from those three States,
							to be lost to any candidate for the Presidency or Vice-Presidency at the
							then approaching Presidential Election— There were in the Senate,
							besides <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Van Buren</persRef>, two avowed Candidates, and three or four
							aspirants to the Presidency, and in the House, two proclaimed Candidates
							for the Vice Presidency, hoping for the votes of those three States, and
							certain of losing them by any the slightest opposition to this
							injustice—and not a voice was raised against it but mine— Now that the
							deed is done, there is a hot debate in the Senate, upon the question
							whether Congress had the right to call a Convention of the People of a
							State, and whether a Convention called and assembled by the People
							themselves, could reverse a decision of a Convention called by the
							Legislature of the State— All of this too late—the wrong is done—the
							People of Michigan have not only submitted, but assented to it, and the
							rapacity of the State of Ohio, and the flagrant usurpation of Congress
							have been legitimated into the Law of the Land.</p>

						<p>The severity of the cold continues without abatement, and the sharp

								Pettrich</persRef> was again here this morning; and took with him
							the books of engravings which he had left here—leaving others in their
							place. He told me he had obtained an apartment in the Capitol for the
							exhibition of his groups; and was distressingly urgent to know whether
							he could flatter himself with the expectation, of obtaining employment
							in his profession for the Capitol— I could give him no satisfactory
							answer.— At the House, this was the last of the thirty days upon which
							Petitions and Resolutions may be offered every morning— I called up a
							Resolution which I had offered, at the beginning of the last Session,
							instructing the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions to inquire into the
							expediency of restoring to the list of pensioners, for services in the
							revolutionary war, the names of all persons, who obtained pensions,
							under the act <hi rend="italic">of 18</hi>
							<pb n="37" type="ms"/>of 18 March 1818, afterwards stricken from the
							list, because they did not prove themselves to be in indigent poverty,
							and never since restored— It was again at my motion referred to the
							Committee, though <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel">Wardwell</persRef> the
							Chairman opposed the commitment, and said they could not report in its
							favour— I spoke to <persRef ref="lay-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lay</persRef>, who is a member of the Committee, and
							promised to favour the Resolution— The unfinished business was <persRef

								>Harlan</persRef> and <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"

							made a cutting speech arguing the utter uselessness of a mere call upon
							the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							without a Committee of strict investigation— Garland at last gave up— He
							proposed as a second Resolution a Committee of 9. with power to make a
							thorough search concerning the agency and agent of the deposit banks,
							with power to send for persons and papers if they should think it
							necessary; and at my proposition he agreed to strike out this last
							Contingent clause— At the proposal of <persRef ref="mckay-james">J. I.
								M’Kay</persRef> he accepted a third Resolution requiring a return
							from the Secretary of the Treasury, of the amount of public monies held
							by each of the deposit Banks on the first day of each quarter for the
							last three years— The three Resolutions passed unanimously— That
							respecting the agent and agency by a call of yeas and nays; but there
							was not one nay—199 yeas— <persRef ref="seymour-william"
								>Seymour</persRef> of New-York my next neighbour, before the call
							had reached his name told me he would vote against it so that there
							might be two sides to the question; but when his name was called he
							answered ay— There were many besides him, who voted à contrecoeur.—
							Immediately after the vote the house adjourned— There was a large party
