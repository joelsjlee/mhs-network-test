						<p>Finished the clearing out of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> plat of the
							seminary row, and filled with a mixture of orchard pond mud and
							garden-mould, the vacuities left by the removal of the stones— There is

							and I apologized to them first for not having before this, answered M<hi

							deliver this year the Lyceum Lecture, which owing to my engagements, and
							to the necessity of my attendance at the Meeting of Congress on the 4<hi

							that if my health and circumstances should permit, I would cheerfully

							Pensions have twice reported against his claim, on the score of
							deficient evidence— There was no positive and adequate testimony to his
							disability; the commanding Officer under whom he served, and the Surgeon
							who attended him, being both deceased; another witness insane, and a
							fourth now absent at sea, and not likely to return home within a year— I
							explained the character of the evidence indispensable to the success of
							the claim, intelligibly to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sprout: but Burrows
							could not understand how he should forfeit his right to a Pension,
							merely for want of Evidence— I told him I would call up his petition and
							have it again referred to a Committee; and exhorted him to obtain, and
							forward further evidence in support of it, if possible— The <persRef ref="hellen-mary;adams-abigail4">young Ladies</persRef>

							<p>Hingham— Cohassett— Fishing party. Hingham—

						<p>At six this morning I went with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in his Chaise to Hingham. <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>, with <persRef ref="beale-caroline">his daughter Caroline</persRef>, was just before
							us— But they returned immediately to Quincy. We met at the tavern a
							Committee of 3. from the inhabitants of the town—<persRef ref="lincoln-solomon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Solomon Lincoln</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ford</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><space/>who together with <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef>, accompanied
							me to the harbour—where the inhabitants have petitioned Congress for an
							improvement. I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring in his chaise;
							and <persRef ref="thaxter-norton">Quincy Thaxter jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> went with Charles— We
							alighted to view the harbour, and the channel which the inhabitants of
							the Town petition to have deepened— We then went to the house of an old
							woman, 82 years of age, and blind, named <persRef ref="u">Nicholls</persRef>, widow of a sometime
							<persRef ref="u">commander of the revenue Cutter</persRef>— We went out in boats on a fishing
							party, and caught a few perch, and Pollocks; and flounders, and
							Rock-cod; but without much luck, and were called back about noon to a
							luncheon and after an interval of two hours, we had a dinner of chowder
							and fried fish— The party consisted of about twenty Gentlemen, among
							whom were Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">Richardson</persRef>, <persRef ref="brooks-charles">Brooks</persRef>, and <persRef ref="stearns-oliver">Stearns</persRef>,

							the Academy, and ten or twelve others, strangers, whose names I do not
							recollect.— Just after dinner there came up a very heavy thunder gust;
							after which we returned to Hingham, and attended a tea-party at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s— There were from twenty to thirty Ladies
							there most of whom were unknown to me, among them <persRef ref="thaxter-susan">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Edward Thaxter</persRef> and <persRef ref="thaxter-elizabeth2;thaxter-anna">Misses Eliza and Anna Thaxter</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef>, wife of the preceptor of the Academy—and
							very handsome— At the dusk of Evening, with my Son, I left the company
							and returned home— It was near 9 in the Evening when we reached it;—the
							sky having cleared away cold, with the moon at its third day, and a
							bright northern light as she went down— This phenomenon has become very
							frequent in its appearance— <persRef ref="hellen-mary;adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles Adams</persRef> had been spending the Evening at
							<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef>, and got home after us. I had
							been exceedingly cautious to avoid all inflammatories, but came home
							much exhausted with fatigue. There can be few more sporting days for
							me</p>

							cleared from weeds a plat in the seminary, between the two old plum

							ivory, and two of the kinds of wood twice used— I lost the day for

							Letters—written during the revolutionary War, which absorbed my
							attention and affected my feelings beyond expression. This is no waste

							upon whom the command devolved, at the death of <persRef ref="montgomery-richard">Montgomery</persRef> before
							Quebec, and who died himself in 1776. upon examination of the Act of
							Congress of 4. July 1836. he was satisfied that he could have no claim
							under that: but he supposed he might obtain something by petition. He
							said <persRef ref="thomas-hannah3">his mother</persRef> was dead, and that he, and one brother named <persRef ref="thomas-nathaniel3">Nathaniel</persRef>,
							were joint heirs to his fathers estate— I advised him to make in writing
							a statement of the facts of his father’s service in the revolutionary
							war and of his decease; and with proper authenticating documents to
							transmit them to me; and I promised to ascertain at the general
							Land-Office whether a Land warrant could issue upon them; and if not I
							would inform him; so that he and his brother might if the saw fit
							petition Congress— As the day was cool and the weather fine I walked to
							<persRef ref="field-harvey">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harvey Field’s</persRef>; and settled the account with
							him for the wood which he agreed to purchase standing on the <persRef ref="atherton-unknown">Atherton</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="verchild-francis">Verchild</persRef> pastures last year. I went with him and viewed the five
							Acres which he had agreed to clear out, and remove the stones, to the
							amount of 100 dollars; but as he found more stones than he had expected,
							instead of carting away the Stones, he has built a strong stone wall
							across the lot, and divided off the five acres from the rest; and he has
							not taken up one fourth part of the large stones— He said he had
							expended much more than the hundred dollars, and hoped I would make some
							allowance for the stone wall— This I declined, the wall having been made
							without authority or agreement; and being to me an incumbrance instead
							of a benefit— He has also left several of the split rocks on the ground,
							thinking they would be good for cellar stone— He paid me the balance due
							upon the agreement to clear off the wood 195:39— He having taken upon
							the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of June my note to <persRef ref="verchild-francis">Samuel Copeland</persRef> for
							woodland—164:55. <pb n="280" type="ms"/>I deposited his check at the
							Quincy Stone Bank, and its amount was credited on my bank account book—
							A man calling himself <persRef ref="allen-niles">Niles Allen</persRef>, came this afternoon, and said he was
							one of the passengers in the Steam-boat Ben Sherrod, which some weeks
							since perished by taking fire on the Mississippi— Many of her passengers
							lost their lives in that calamity, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen said
							he had very narrowly escaped; and had lost all the property that he had
							on board— He had agents at New-Orleans who instead of remitting money to
							him had advised him to draw upon them—and shewed me two Letters to him
							signed <persRef ref="burkeandwatt">Burke and Watt</persRef>, shewing sums of several kinds of property in
							their hands and they advise him in case of wanting money to apply to
							me—informing him where I reside— He said he had come on here in pursuit
							of heath, and had fallen short of money—he wished to borrow but I had no
							money to lend, and was obliged to decline— He finally said he would make
							out to get along on his journey, with no more than fifty dollars but I
							could not accommodate him even with so much. I had strong suspicions
							that he was an imposter— <persRef ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef> was here to visit
							the Ladies this afternoon; and <persRef ref="adams-john3">Midshipman John Q. Adams</persRef>, his Sister

						<p>Communion day— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Whitney</persRef> preached the morning

							unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 24.
							But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power
							of God, and the wisdom of God”— The communion was administered partly by
							M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney, and partly by <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef>— Returning home with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> after the service, met <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>, who had come out in a Carriage from
							Boston.— He dined and spent the remainder of the day with me— In the
							afternoon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt preached from James 4.14. “Whereas
							ye know not what shall be on the morrow”— The Doctrine of the Discourse,
							was the wisdom, and goodness of God, in denying to mankind the knowledge
							of the future— Its most impressive passage to my mind was an Allegory of
							two brothers departing from home together upon a long Journey,
							terminated by a distant and unexplored ocean to be traversed before
							reaching the end of their Journey. One of the brothers takes Knowledge
							for the companion of his way, and the other selects for his
							fellow-travellers Faith and Hope— On reaching the borders of the dark
							and dreary Ocean, Knowledge is obliged to take leave of his companion,
							who embarks alone uncertain of his Fate, and sinking into despair— But
							there it is that Faith and Hope, prove to the other brother, friends of
							inestimable value.— They embark with him—cheer and comfort him in the
							perils and distresses of his voyage, and land him in happiness, and joy
							on the distant shore of his destination— I have never before heard M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt practice this style of composition; but the
							power of the parable is of such irresistible force in the discourses of
							Jesus Christ, that I have often wondered why it is not more frequently
							resorted to by the preachers of the gospel— A collection was taken up,
							to form the commencement of a parish library— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt had given notice of it; and that this application would be made of
							it instead of purchasing books with it for the children of the Sunday
							Schools; and he requested contributions of books for the Library.— I
							read the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 10<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> on the greatness of God— The theme is too

						<p><persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went in to Boston, and returned to dine— My attention to my
							seedling trees are now chiefly confined to those in the Seminary, where
							my success in sowing the seeds is hitherto more promising than it has
							been in the garden or the Nursery— The result of my experience however
							is, that the only fruit trees that can be raised to any purpose in this
							climate, without walls or hot houses, are Apples, Pears and Shagbark
							walnuts— Apricots, Nectarines, Cherries, Plums, and even peaches, I give
							up in despair—grapes are equally desperate; and I have little prospect
							of ever tasting the fruits even of my seedling apples and Pears— I
							worked this morning to remove some of the stones from two Seminary plats
							in the line of the old plum trees; and enlarging their borders. I
							received a Letter from <persRef ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> DuPonceau</persRef> of Philadelphia,
							enclosing some abusive strictures upon my late Letter to <persRef ref="foster-william">William Foster</persRef>,
							which he has published together with his Letter to me— In that Letter I
							spoke of the concerted suspension of specie payment by all the banks in
							terms such as I thought they deserved— The administration party have
							chuckled at this, because it gave them the opportunity to apply the
							censure which I made generall, to the Bank of the United States, and
							especially to my friend <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</persRef>.— The party views on both sides
							of this universal bankruptcy have no reference at all to the moral
							depravity involved in it; but to the political turn which may be given
							to it; and especially to its effect on the presidential election— The
							bank party in Philadelphia, are also flattering themselves that the Bank
							of the United States will be rechartered by Congress, and my Letter has
							no tendency to encourage them in this expectation. I began a reply to
							M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> DuPonceau, but could not finish it— <persRef ref="copeland-samuel">Copeland</persRef>

							judge Leland at Dedham in 1831— The account has been kept—and was
							presented by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis— The judge administered the
							oath to us all— Coming out, <persRef ref="richards-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Richards</persRef> of
							Braintree stopped me, and said he wished to submit to me the claim of a
							poor and aged woman to a pension as the widow of a revolutionary
							soldier, and I told him I would readily take charge of it. After
							returning from the judge’s Court, we jointly executed a power, drawn up
							by <persRef ref="lowell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Lowell</persRef> to <persRef ref="bates-joshua">Joshua Bates</persRef>, a copartner of
							the House of <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Baring and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> in London, to receive
							from <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef>, any sums of money, due by him to us as Executors of
							W. N. Boylston’s Will; and to give him a discharge therefor— He has been
							more than seven years responsible to us, for upwards of ten thousand
							Pounds Sterling, which he has received, due to the Estate— He first
							involved it without a shadow of authority in the bankruptcy of his uncle
							William Vaughan; and since that resorts to every sort of prevarication
							to withhold the payment of the remnants which he has received in the
							form of dividends of <persRef ref="vaughan-william">William Vaughan’s</persRef> estate. He has now by his own
							acknowledgment upwards of four thousand Pounds sterling deposited in a
							Banking House in exchequer Bills which it is his duty to remit to us,
							but which upon the shallowed pretences he retains— We have
							unfortunately, by the Law of England no compulsory controul over him—
							The <pb n="282" type="ms"/>knave knows this and will never pay a
							farthing of the money— I proposed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis to
							draw a set of Bills upon him in favour of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates,
							for two thousand pounds, payable at ninety days sight, and enclose it
							with the power to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates—directing him if it

							drafted Letters to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates and to Petty Vaughan
							accordingly; which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis took with him, to write
							off, and send with the Bills to me for my signature; if upon
							consultation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell, and enquiry concerning
							the safety of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates, it should be expedient to
							forward the Bills— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis and M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>I plucked up this morning a willow stake, which I had stuck down about

							taken root so strongly that it was not easily eradicated. After digging

							<persRef ref="adams-aaron">Aaron Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> a merchant of Boston called and
							conversed with me about an hour, chiefly upon the political topics of
							the day. He had some weeks since written me a Letter upon the subject of
							Banks and Banking, which I had not answered; and from which he appears
							to be somewhat illiterate— I had intended to go to Boston this Morning
							to attend a Meeting of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; but
							the weather was threatening, and I gave it up— There came up afterwards
							heavy rain which continued nearly through the day— I finished my Letter
							to <persRef ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> DuPonceau</persRef>, and answered one from <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb
								Cushing</persRef>, and one from <persRef ref="hardwick-john">John Hardwick</persRef> President of the Quincy Lyceum. The
							latter was to request me to deliver a Lecture, before that Society, and
							I was obliged to decline a similar invitation from Salem; and I have in
							both cases promised to perform the service in the course of the next
							year, if they should desire it, and I should be able— These Applications
							to deliver Orations, Addresses, and Lectures are exceedingly oppressive—
							I receive ten or a dozen of them, every year.— To write and deliver one
							a year absorbs all the time that I have in the intervals, between the
							Sessions of Congress; and it is an ungracious task to decline an
							invitation which carries a compliment with it— In the meantime my
							attention and my labours are withdrawn from the subject which ought to
							occupy them above all others.— First Althaea blossom.—</p>

						<p>The Sun rose clear, precisely at 5. O’Clock, and I went over to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>

							three current bushes within a circle of 20 inches diameter—all looking
							puny, but as if with cultivation, they would live, and perhaps one or
							more of them prosper— I enlarged the circle to a diameter of nearly four
							feet, and dug out about two bushel baskets full of stones, the place of
							which I supplied with mould from the orchard pond— There were showers of
							rain— <persRef ref="green-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green</persRef>, publisher of the Quincy Patriot,

							Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> this morning from Romans 5.4. “And
							Patience Experience; and experience hope;” this was a discourse upon
							religious experience or experiences; with a tendency towards enthusiasm
							without falling into it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt inclines strongly
							to religious sensibilities as well as to intellectual piety, and it is
							perhaps in the combination of both that the perfection of religion
							consists— Reason leads us only along the paths of Justice, but the
							kindly feelings responsive to all good feeling, and indulgent to human
							frailty, are the properties most suitable, to man; himself a frail and
							erring creature— The afternoon Sermon, was from John 6.12— “He said unto
							his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be
							lost”—an admirable text to illustrate the [“]virtue of frugality.”— And
							the preacher lost nothing which could be said upon it— He began by an
							allusion to a frequent error in supposing that an attentive regard to
							small things, is incompatible with the capacity to embrace great and
							important objects, and expatiated upon this memorable example of the
							reverse in the character of Jesus—contrasting that supernatural power
							which from five barley loaves and two small fishes could feed to satisfy
							five thousand persons, with that provident regard to the future, which
							instructed his disciples to gather the fragments that nothing might be
							lost— He marked the union of bountiful charity, connected with this
							frugal spirit, as a caution to beware of suffering the frugal principle
							to degenerate, as there is danger that it will, into parsimony,
							selfishness and avarice— The fragments were not to be gathered until
							every one had eaten to his full content— They were to be gathered, that
							nothing might be lost.— He referred to the success with which this
							virtue is generally attended in the world— To the common experience of
							how much it conduces to the worldly prosperity of him who practises it—
							To the kindred virtues with which it is usually accompanied, and to the
							vices, and excesses and ultimate ruin which so often follows the
							disregard and neglect of it— This was the most practical sermon that I
							have heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt— I read the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sermon of the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>;
							upon the renewal of the world, and thought of writing a Lyceum Lecture
							upon the nature and obligation of promises. Whether I shall ever fulfil
							this promise to myself will hereafter appear— I finished the Letter,
							begun yesterday to <persRef ref="channing-william">Doctor W. E. Channing</persRef>.— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was unwell this

						<p>My three grand-daughters sowed in the garden, Jenneton Pear-seeds,

							small chamber of the Farm-house— <persRef ref="houghton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Houghton</persRef>
							of Bolton in the County of Worcester came to make some enquiries,
							concerning his claim for a pension, on account of the services in the

							had promised to call it up at the next Session, and had told him that he
							would rely upon my support to carry it through— I assured him that he
							might depend upon it so far as would be consistent with my sense of
							duty— He spoke of other subjects—upon the currency with bitterness
							against the Banks— Of Abolition, which he said was rapidly spreading in
							his part of the State. He said he had heard the <persRef ref="grimke-sarah;grimke-angelina">Misses Grimké</persRef> lecture
							last Evening at Boxborough— <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Minott Thayer</persRef> came
							afterwards, and had also a claim for a pension for a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Allen</persRef> a widow of a revolutionary soldier long since
							deceased, and who is insane— She has children, and I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer that they must petition for her, and if her
							case is such as Congress may be inclined to provide for, she must have a
							legal guardian, to be accountable for the money— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thayer complained very much of ill-treatment from <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							B. F. Hallett</persRef>—and was quite uneasy upon two subjects— One the
							distribution by the towns of Weymouth and Braintree; of the money which
							by the Acts of Congress was placed in deposit in the several States, and
							which by Acts of the Legislature of this Commonwealth, have been ordered
							to be distributed among the towns throughout the State— The town of
							Weymouth voted to dole it out in loans, at one per Cent interest to all
							the inhabitants of the Town, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer had a
							printed pamphlet containing opposite opinions of <persRef ref="sprague-peleg">Peleg Sprague</persRef> and
							Benjamin F. Hallett as lawyers, on the question whether this disposal of
							the money was <hi rend="italic">lawful</hi>; Sprague holding that it
							was; not: and Hallett that it was— There is also a pugnacious report of
							the Committee of the Town; sent to confer with the Treasurer of the
							State concerning the payment of the money. Thayer said Braintree would
							follow the example of Weymouth— That a town meeting for the same purpose
							at Randolph; and he thought it would also be adopted by the town of
							Quincy— The other subject of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer’s concern,
							was the meeting here, proposed for next Wednesday week, which he said he
							and many others feared was to be an abolition Meeting in disguise. He
							told me something of the manner in which it was gotten up, and was much
							delighted when I informed him that I should probably not attend the

							procuring money, and of the refusal of the banks to pay specie— He said
							Asaph Churchill of Milton had been to the Quincy Stone Bank with, its
							bills to the amount of 75 dollars, for which he demanded specie— The
							Cashier Ibrahim Bartlett, told him his orders were not to pay specie—
							<persRef ref="churchill-asaph">Churchill</persRef> pressed him for some time, and finally proposed to compound,

							in the revolutionary War— I read to her the third Section of the Act of

							Spear had acknowledged this, but she was nevertheless confident of
							obtaining the Pension, though she was rich, and did not want it— I

							on the Tremont Bank and the Bills which I had received from Job Faxon,
							for Bills of the Bank of the United States— I made some enquiries

							was shewn me, of the last and several preceding Saturdays— I asked for a

							M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett the Cashier promised me. <persRef ref="field-harvey2">Harvey
								Field</persRef>, one of the Directors of the Bank was there; and the <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">President

								>th.</hi> of June, containing the Pension Laws of 4. July 1836 and
							3. March 1837, and the regulations of the War Department for carrying

						<p><persRef ref="parkman-francis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman</persRef> of Boston was the preacher— His morning
							text was from Ephesians 4.28. “Let him that stole, steal no more: but
							rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,
							that he may have to give to him that needeth.” I had been very much
							pleased, with a sermon upon this text by <persRef ref="follen-charles">Doctor Follen</persRef>, last Spring at
							Washington, (9. April) and was equally delighted with the Discourse of
							this day, excepting the doubt whether a little stealing had not been
							practiced of the materials to make it up— The treatment of the subject
							was the same—Honesty—Industry—Charity—an enlargement of the literal
							meaning of the injunction to discontinue stealing so as to include all
							injustice and wrong—the connection between the virtues of industry and
							Charity, and the admirable morality of the Apostle, in thus recommending
								<hi rend="italic">them</hi>
							<pb n="290" type="ms"/>them in unison. The doctrine and argument of the
							two Sermons was precisely the same; but the composition was so
							different, that I should not even have been reminded of D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Follen’s discourse by any resemblance of it in the details
							of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman’s; which was precisely such as I could
							myself have written upon that text after hearing D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Follen— D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Parkman’s afternoon text was from Psalm
							37.25. [“]I have been young and now am old; yet have I not seen the
							righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” There was much allusion
							towards the close of this discourse, to the present disordered state of
							our public affairs, and to the distresses of the community— And the
							auditory were reminded of all the blessings that as a Nation we still
							enjoy— Of the contrast between our condition, and that of Nations
							visited with the great calamities of War, Pestilence or famine; and he
							exhorted his hearers to sentiments of peace, of harmony and of mutual
							benevolence. The sermon in this respect was well-timed, and well
							received.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman dined with us. He told me that

							The eight new plats opened two feet deep in the seminary, and from which
							about forty bushels of stones have been removed, were this day also
							filled up with fresh earth— <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dugan</persRef> the collector

							acres and a fraction, from which the wood had then just been cut off— It
							adjoins the Baxter <pb n="291" type="ms"/>lot, and has a growth of Oaks
							sprung up this Season, and of promising appearance— From thence we went
							over the newly opened road to the railway house, and then by the other
							new road to the Captain’s Bridge. We turned off from this to see the
							spot of the old furnace, and the dam which excluded the Water of a small
							pond— There are still remnants of furnace cinders and burnt bricks on

							and viewed the ground through which a third new road is petitioned for
							by certain inhabitants of Braintree, from this side their Meeting house
							to the Railway house— It will run through my land, at two different

							them to return my thanks, and to say that in compliance with their
							invitation I would attend the meeting at 3. O’Clock, which I accordingly
							did— I went alone—the Committee met me at the door of the Hall; and the
							President presented me to the meeting— I addressed them for about an
							hour and a half on their Resolutions— I was frequently interrupted by
							cheering applause, and although my speech was far below mediocrity it
							was very favourably received— <persRef ref="may-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> May</persRef> then moved that
							some poetical lines which he had read, written by <persRef ref="pierpont-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pierpont</persRef> of Boston, should be published with the proceedings of the
							meeting which was agreed to without opposition— The meeting was then
							dissolved and notice was given that at 1/2 past 7 O’Clock this evening,
							the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Samuel J. May would deliver a Lecture on
							the right of petition— A number of copies of the pamphlet edition of my
							Letters to the inhabitants of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congressional district were gratuitously distributed— <persRef ref="field-harvey2">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harvey Field</persRef> introduced to me, <persRef ref="sullivan-john8">Deacon Sullivan</persRef> of
							Germantown, and <persRef ref="stanton-h">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. B. Stanton</persRef>, who said he wished
							to have some conversation with me, and whom I told I would see him if it
							should suit his convenience at my house the day after to-morrow— Deacon
							Sullivan said he had read with great satisfaction my Anti-masonic
							Letters— I walked home with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf and
							<persRef ref="freeman-russell">Russell Freeman</persRef>—who gave me a bundle of papers, being recommendations of
							him, for the appointment of Collector at the port of New-Bedford, which
							he wishes me to present to the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>. He came on
							from Sandwich this morning and after his interview with me proceeded to
							Boston— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> came, and budded for
							me five apple trees from slips brought this morning from Hingham, by
							<persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef>, and given to me— They are of a large,
							pleasant acid apple which he says ripen by the middle of July—from a
							tree imported by <persRef ref="parsons-eben">Eben Parsons</persRef> when he Loring was about 14 years old—he
							then took a slip from it, which has now become a large tree and bears
							plentifully— I budded with it four young stocks in the garden, and one
							in the nursery— <persRef ref="beale-ann">Ann Beale</persRef> and <persRef ref="wales-louisa">Louisa Wales</persRef> were here in the Evening, and
							<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef> came for them— Some mischievous fellow
							kindled a fire, in the shavings from Charles’s house, which he had
							removed to some distance from it—the object was to make an alarm of
							fire, to break up M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> May’s Lecture which it
							effectually did— The Bells rang for some time, and Charles was out
							without his hat nearly two hours, to watch the blazing and dying off of
							the flames— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring had brought from Hingham a
							series of Resolutions, upon the subject of the currency, banking, and
							the suspension of specie payments, which he intended to present to the
							meeting—he shewed them to me; and I assented to all of them but two—
							These he determined to strike out; but he finally concluded not to offer
							them—</p>

							<persRef ref="foster-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Foster</persRef> and <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth2">Elizabeth</persRef>— The family are in

							<pb n="293" type="ms"/>he would have lived to this time; and now they

							<persRef ref="everett-edward">Governor Everett’s</persRef>, and with him I got engaged in conversation, till he
							reminded me that there was an adjourned meeting of the Overseers of the
							University at half past 12— I went with him to the State-house— The
							meeting was in the Senate chamber— It was merely to receive and approve
							the report of a Committee upon the nominations for Doctors of Divinity
							and one honorary Master of Arts— The report was made by <persRef ref="russell-benjamin">Benjamin
							Russell</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee and now a member of the Council; was
							immediately accepted, and the Meeting was adjourned to commencement
							morning at Cambridge— I then went to my Son’s Office where I found
							Russell Freeman, still labouring with solicitude for his papers and for
							the Office of Collector at New-Bedford— After some conversation with him
							he decided to leave all his papers with me. I went to the agency of the
							Bank of the United States 70. State-Street. <persRef ref="frothingham-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham</persRef> gave me an order on the State-Bank, for the order of 170

							said was counterfeit— They paid me the order at the State Bank— I
							stopp’d at Deacon James H. Foster’s shop, and saw him and <persRef ref="foster-charles3">his son
							Charles</persRef>.— He paid me 22 dollars a dividend of two dollars a share on 11.
							shares, in the Braintree and Weymouth turnpike.— I then called at a
							Booksellers and purchased a Bible for a birth-day present to my
							Grand-daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef>— Dined at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the
							head to the feet, I have no need of you.” The Discourse was a sort of

							the House, in a line with the Southern post of the South gate. I planted

							him to his house, where I had with him a conversation of nearly two
							hours— He has just returned from an excursion to New-York and
							Philadelphia— Three of the deposit Banks at New-York have issued a
							circular inviting a convention of all the banks, to consult about a
							simultaneous resumption of Specie payments— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lawrence told me, that neither the Philadelphia, nor the Boston Banks

							that <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas Biddle</persRef> was under the impression,
							which he did not share, that the Executive Government of the United
							States would be compelled, and were already disposed to return to the

						<p>New York— Rockaway, Long-Island. </p>
						<p>We had 370. passengers in the Steamboat Massachusetts; and crowded as
							they all were into the Cabin births and cots, the heat was so excessive
							that I could not sleep a wink— We landed at New-York at 8 O’Clock this
							morning, and I came and took a chamber at the Astor-house— It was full,
							and I could obtain a chamber only by waiting until some of the lodgers
							went away— Immediately after breakfast, <persRef ref="davis-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
							A. Davis</persRef> called on me, and proposed to me, to go with him to Rockaway,
							to which I assented. <persRef ref="hamilton-james2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hamilton</persRef> heretofore
							keeper of an inn at Framingham, then of the exchange tavern at
							Boston—afterwards of the Washington House at New-York, called and
							informed me, that a Committee from the American Institute were desirous
							of waiting upon me, and I agreed to receive them at 11 O’Clock— They
							came at that time— Hamilton was among them; as were <persRef ref="knapp-samuel">Samuel L. Knapp</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="marvin-dudley">Dudley Marvin</persRef>, and four or five others whose names escaped me— Their
							object was to request me to deliver an Address before the members of the
							Institute, sometime in October next— I fear it will be utterly
							impossible, and so informed them; but I promised that I would if I
							could— It has so churlish an appearance positively to reject these
							solicitations, that I have no heart to do it, and yet they are so
							multiplied that it is impossible for me to comply with one of them in
							ten— At Noon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis came— I walked with him to the
							ferry at the corner of the Battery— There we met a <persRef ref="macnab-allan">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> M’Nabb</persRef>, whom M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis introduced to me
							as Speaker of the House of Assembly of the British province of upper
							Canada, who was also going to Rockaway, where his family were— A very
							good looking Gentleman, and a loyal conservative; for within 5 minutes
							he assured me, that <persRef ref="william">His Majesty</persRef>, had no more loyal Subjects than the
							people of Upper Canada— We crossed the ferry to Brookline; there took
							the Railway Cars, through Jamaica, to Bedford; where the railway
							terminates— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis’s chaise was there at a tavern;
							and in it I rode with him to Rockaway, 20 Miles from New-York, and on
							the Eastern shore of Long Island. We found there <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Davis</persRef>—<persRef ref="wayne-james">Judge Wayne</persRef> of the Supreme Court of the United States—M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Nabb’s family, <persRef ref="bayard-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard
									Bayard</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton</persRef> of New-York a son of the <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">late
							Governor De Witt Clinton</persRef>— It was the warmest day I had experienced this
							Summer. Just at Sunset I walked down to the beach with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Davis, and took a bath with the surf breaking over me— I had
							barely time to dress and return to the house when there came up from the
							west, a dark, but not heavy thunder shower— Spent the evening in
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Davis, judge and <persRef ref="wayne-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wayne</persRef>, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>New-York— Philadelphia— Marshall House</p>
						<p>At 5 this morning, <persRef ref="davis-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef> was ready with his
							Chaise; and we departed: stopp’d a quarter of an hour at Bedford and,
							crossing the <hi rend="italic">ferry</hi>
							<pb n="298" type="ms"/>ferry from Brookline to the Fulton slip, he
							landed me at the Astor-House, just in time to breakfast and to reach the
							Steamer for Amboy at 9.— I met at the Astor House <persRef ref="gibbs-william">Governor Gibbs</persRef> of
							Newport, who had been there from New-York for the single purpose of
							voting at the election, and had returned with us in the Massachusetts—
							He now told me that the passengers in the Lexington which arrived this
							morning brought the news that the whigs <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> and <persRef ref="cranston-robert">Cranston</persRef> had
							been elected to Congress by a majority of more than a thousand votes
							over <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Howard</persRef>— He told me too that the Lexington last
							Night in Providence river, before reaching Newport, had been very nearly
							overset by a violent thundergust— That two sloops had been actually
							capsized in her sight, and that she had saved the people of one of them
							excepting two women in her cabin who were drowned— The Steamboat for
							Amboy was crowded with more than two hundred passengers— The first man I
							met upon going on board, was <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">C. C. Cambreleng</persRef>, who accosted me laughing,
							and said that he and I were in the same box about the Banks— <persRef ref="moore-ely">Ely Moore</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> of New-Hampshire, <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legaré</persRef> of South-Carolina, <persRef ref="haley-elisha">Haley</persRef> and <persRef ref="ingham-samuel2">Ingham</persRef> of
							Connecticut, <persRef ref="williams-reuel">Reuel Williams</persRef> Senator, <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef> a Representative from Maine,
							and several other Members of Congress were in the Boat— It was long
							before I could get my ticket for the Cars, and the Captain was so
							grossly uncivil to me, that I came too nigh quarreling with him— He gave
							me in revenge a ticket for the worst car in the train— H.N.S. an open
							waggon, and it was pouring with rain— The conductor however gave me a
							Seat in the best of the Cars, that reserved for the use of the Invalids,
							where my fellow passengers were a man with his arm in a sling, who was
							well nigh killed by the Bowsprit of a Schooner running through the Cabin
							window of the Steam boat Lexington, and thrusting him out of his birth
							with his collar bone broken his shoulder dislocated, and his breath
							crushed out of his body.— His wife was with him— <persRef ref="meredith-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Meredith</persRef> of Baltimore, a fellow passenger in the boat, had been kindly
							solicitous to get me a seat in the Car with him but I was well provided
							for— On landing at Philadelphia I went immediately to <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Nicholas Biddle’s</persRef> house, but was told by the Maid servant
							who came to the door, that he had been taken suddenly ill this afternoon
							after dinner and that the Doctor was with him— My trunk, bag and cloak
							were however taken to my chamber M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle’s Son
							<persRef ref="biddle-charles2">Charles</persRef> soon after came in, and appeared to be in considerable anxiety—
							I asked him to consult the Doctor, whether it might not be better that
							his father should not see me this evening, and this was the
							<persRef ref="laroche-rene">Doctor—Laroches</persRef> advice— I therefore went and engaged a bedchamber at the
							Marshall house, and then went and passed an hour with <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> John Sargeant</persRef>— He is a member of the House of
							Representatives of the United States elect, and engaged to go on with
							me, Saturday Morning, by the new Rail-road from Wilmington to Baltimore—
							<persRef ref="reed-william2">W. B. Read</persRef> came in, while I was there— I returned to the Marshall House
							and by nine O’Clock was in bed.</p>
