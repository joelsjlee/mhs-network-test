								Fowler</persRef> from Isaiah 53.1. “Who hath believed our report;
							and unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?[”] A solemn and
							impressive discourse deeply and affectionately deploring the religious
							coldness and apathy of the times— He said that for the last two years
							there had not been the addition of one member to that Church, and gave
							notice that the Communion would be administered next Sunday— <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">Thomas J. Frye</persRef> dined with us— After
							dinner I took with me my Grandchild <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef>, and went to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<pb n="789" type="ms"/><persRef ref="hawley-william">Hawley</persRef>
							read the Evening service for the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday
							after the Epiphany and preached from Isaiah 52.7. “How beautiful upon
							the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that
							publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth
							salvation; that saith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.”— Oh! what a text for
							a Christian preacher!— This verse is one of the most stirring of the
							Prophet <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef> whose Book it is
							impossible for a believer in the Christian Religion to read without
							feelings of irrepressible enthusiasm—the Discourse was cool— <persRef

							Baltimore spent part of the Evening here</p>

						<p>The House met at eleven O’Clock— I presented 21. Petitions praying for
							the abolition of Slavery and the Slave trade in the District of
							Columbia, after first asking permission to address the House on the
							right of the Petitioners to have their Petitions read—which was refused
							by yeas and nays—<space/>I moved that every successive petition should
							be read— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> in every case
							decided it should not be read—because he said they all came within the
							order of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I appealed from every
							decision, and a motion was immediately made, by <persRef
								ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> of New-Hampshire to lay the
							appeal on the table, not debateable, and always carried— I presented the
							memorial of the Young Men’s Anti-Slavery Society of the City and County
							of Philadelphia, remonstrating against the recognition of Texas— The
							Speaker decided that this Memorial came within the order of the House
							and should go with out reading on the table— From this decision I
							appealed, and asked for the yeas and nays— <persRef
								ref="phillips-stephen">Phillips</persRef> rose and said if the
							Memorial was not read he should ask to be excused from voting on the
							question The Speaker against his own decision allowed the memorial to be
							read, and <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> immediately
							insisted that the Memorial was not within the order of the House— But a
							motion was made to lay the Memorial and the whole subject on the table
							which was carried.— There were two Petitions presented one by <persRef
								ref="harlan-james">Harlan</persRef>, and <pb n="790" type="ms"/>Harlan; and the
							other by <persRef ref="calhoon-john">John Calhoun</persRef>, from
							Citizens of Kentucky praying pecuniary aid to the Colonization Society—
							The first was referred without question taken to the Committee of
							Foreign Affairs. When the question was made by me whether it did not
							come within the order of the House of the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi>
							<persRef ref="pinckney-henry">C. Pinckney</persRef> immediately moved to
							lay the Petition on the table, which was rejected. <persRef
								ref="huntsman-adam">Huntsman</persRef> of Tennessee said he had been
							many years one of the Vice President’s of the Colonization Society, and
							had never heard or understood that it had any reference to Slavery—
								<persRef ref="davis-john8">Davis</persRef> of Indiana moved to lay
							it on the table, which was done— The States were called through for
							Petitions— <persRef ref="white-joseph">White</persRef> of Florida
							offered two Resolutions— The first was to transfer upwards of 90 Land
							claim cases from the Judge of the Eastern District Court of Florida’s
							Court, to that of the Middle District. I opposed this, and the further
							consideration of it was postponed— I moved the reconsideration of the
							vote by which Calhoon’s Kentucky Petition for funds in aid of the
							Colonization Society— And after some resistance the Speaker allowed the
							entry of the motion for reconsideration, and postponed it till next
							Monday— Adjourned between 4 and 5— In the Evening with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">her two children</persRef> I went
							to the New Theatre; and saw <persRef ref="u">Paudeen
								O’Rafferty</persRef> or the Irishman’s fortune— Born to good luck
							and the Irish Tutor—in both of which <persRef ref="power-tyrone"
								>Power</persRef> played parts of an humorous Irishman, for which he
							is famed— Both farces, rather dull but Power has much of the comic Irish
							humour— There was a third Piece, the Illustrious Stranger, which we did
							not stay to see. The House was full— Many Members of Congress there—
								<persRef ref="turnbull-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Turnbull</persRef> came nearly home with me—till we met the carriage
							returning for me, from taking home the Ladies and Children—</p>

						<p><persRef ref="alford-julius">J. C. Alford</persRef> from Georgia, a

							of one of the Petitions from Kentuckey in behalf of the Colonization

							on his motion for live to bring in a Bill to secure the freedom of

							against him and me; and said that so far as it related to him, it was an
							infamous calumny. When Bell concluded, <persRef ref="graves-william2"
								>Graves</persRef> of Kentuckey obtained the floor but <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> called for the
							orders of the day— The House went into Committee of the whole on the
							Union, and took up the Indian Appropriation Bill— <persRef
								ref="craig-robert">Craig</persRef> of Virginia in the Chair The Bill
							differs from the corresponding Bills of late years by comprizing
							multitudes of spefic items in a few general charges— It passed through
							the Committee however with several amendments proposed by Cambreleng,
							without opposition or debate— The Bill was reported to the House and
							adjourned on motion of <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>, who said he had
							something on the Indian Appropriation Bill, with relation to our Indian
							relations— Evening occupied till very late in writing to the Petitioners
