						<p>Observed the rising of the Sun, as I have been enabled to do almost every
							day of the month of November.— The Southing of the Sun is perceptible
							from day to day. The disk is here just 3 minutes in rising— I have
							marked in Charcoal over the bedchamber door the line formed by the
							Sunbeams on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of November— The 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
								8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November, are the days upon
							which the Sun’s Southing seen from the Northeastern chamber window of
							the Presidents House rises directly behind the three domes of the
							Capitol— He rises returning Northward in order inverted, behind the same
							three domes on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							February.— From our eastern chamber entry window, the Sun first appears
							on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of November through two opposite
							Lutheran windows of an house about 200 yards east of ours— <persRef
								ref="mayo-robert">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayo</persRef> came
							this morning with his subscription Book for his sketches of 8 years at
							Washington, which <persRef ref="lucas-john2">Lucas</persRef> at
							Baltimore is to publish for him; and I subscribed for one copy.— He said
							he should offer the Subscription book to the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="sumner-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Sumner</persRef> of Boston, Son of the <persRef ref="sumner-charles"
								>Sheriff</persRef> of the County of Suffolk had called here twice
							yesterday when I was not at home, and came again this morning. He is a
							lawyer, and has published Reports of the decisions of the United States
							Circuit Court in Massachusetts; and has also acted as an assistant to
								<persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge Story</persRef> as Dane Professor
							of Law at Cambridge.— He is now going to France, England, Germany and
							Italy—to make himself acquainted with the Systems of administering the
							Law in those Countries, and with the ultimate object of comparison
							between those Systems— I promised him Letters and to leave them at
								<persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsbys</persRef> Hotel, his lodgings, if
							I could write them in time—he was going at 5 this afternoon in the Cars
							to Baltimore— But I had not the time, for an old Scotchman named
								<persRef ref="u">Lindsey</persRef> came and consumed the remainder
							of the morning with a dissertation upon Silk-worms and Silk— He bred in
							this City about one Million of Silk worms this Summer, from which he
							raised about 14. pounds avoirdupois of Silk—besides presents that he has
							made here, and others sent to his friends in Scotland— He was clad from
							head to foot in garments of coarse silk manufactured from the cocoons of
							his own worms— He brought with him some samples of his sewing Silk, and
							a pair of Socks, of the same material.— He gave me many details of the
							manner of breeding the worms, which if I had memory left I should commit
							to it, but which I shall forget to morrow— He projects a memorial to
							Congress for patronage to the breeding of Silk worms, and the
							manufacture of silk— To which end I promised all my aid, worth exactly
							nothing— I called again at the Treasury Department, and again <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodbury</persRef> was with the President. At <persRef
								ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse’s</persRef> Office, but he had no
							bills for Specie— After dinner <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> called and spent an
							hour with us— Then <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Stewart</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="parnell-john;stewart-delia2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Parnell</persRef> came in— They
							are upon a visit here with an <persRef ref="u">infant daughter</persRef>
							about 6 months old, from Ireland— Parnell married Delia Stewart in July
							1835 when he was here with <persRef ref="wingfield-richard">Lord
								Powerscourt</persRef>— Finally I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> son <persRef ref="todd-john">Todd</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">who</hi>
							<pb n="405" type="ms"/>who left with me three manuscript volumes of his
							writings— The same which he had once before lent to me last Spring— One
							of the volumes contains Letters from <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, written during the
							revolutionary war, and one of the Letters, contains reflections upon the
							character and capacity of the late <persRef ref="dana-francis">judge
								Dana</persRef> injurious to his memory, which I had advised M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd, to leave out or modify to avoid
							giving unnecessary pain to his surviving family and friends— He now
							requested me to mark with a pencil the passages that I thought it would
							be advisable to strike out, and said he would call again for the
							manuscript to-morrow— There was a cry of fire this Evening—a false
							alarm— I began making out a list of the Petitions against the annexation
							of Texas to the Union, received since the close of the last Session—
							Northern light. No fire in my chamber.</p>

						<p>The Birth-day of my eldest Grand-daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa Adams</persRef>, daughter of my dear departed Son,
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>; born in the President’s
							House, and this day nine years of age.— She and <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">her younger Sister</persRef>, born at Quincy
							10. September 1830 have been brought up in my family, as children, and
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">their mother</persRef> has always been to
							me as a daughter— I finished this morning the list of Petitions against
							the annexation of Texas to this Union, received since I ceased
							presenting similar Petitions at the late Session of Congress— They are
							33 in number; and I have a few others upon the subject of Slavery— I
							called at the Treasury Department and left with <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodbury</persRef> the Letter which I last received from <persRef
								ref="freeman-russell">Russell Freeman</persRef> relating to his
							application for re-appointment to the Office of Collector of the Customs
							at New-Bedford— I told him that I performed this Office as a friend of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, and at his desire, without
							wishing to interfere with the appointment— I had not much acquaintance
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman, but had been intimate with
								<persRef ref="freeman-edmund;freeman-nathaniel">two of his elder
								brothers</persRef> especially with one of them, Nathaniel Freeman,
							my Classmate at the University; afterwards a member of Congress but who
							died in the first year of this century— But of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell Freeman’s present pretensions I did not wish to
							judge— He had politically been a friend to me, and of the party formerly
							called republican— And had eight years since been removed from the
							office to which he wished now to be restored— In his Letter to me he
							expressed some apprehension that a charge of intemperate habits had been
							or might be urged against him; but he affirmed not only that he had been
							for years a member of a Temperance Society; but had been a delegate from
							it to a general Temperance Convention in Massachusetts last year.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury said he had never heard any
							charge of intemperance against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman.
							Nor any other excepting that of his being deaf— I said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman did not deny that, but alleged
							that it had not disqualified from performing to the entire satisfaction
							of the people at New-Bedford, the Office of Collector; but had in some
							degree disqualified him for professional practice as a lawyer, and
							therefore made the emoluments of Office more necessary to him for the
							support of his family— He said he would <hi rend="italic">lay</hi>
							<pb n="406" type="ms"/>lay M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman’s
							Letter before the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>, As
							he had already submitted to him M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman’s
							other papers that I had left with him.— That <persRef
								ref="williams-lemuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Williams</persRef> the present collector, had been a speculator in
							copper, and some months since was supposed to be immensely rich; and it
							was then expected that he would decline a re-appointment— But it was now
							said the copper speculation had failed and that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Williams wished to be re-appointed— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Woodbury made some enquiries of me, about the Dighton-rock;
							and particularly if I had ever seen it— He said there was a new
							Antiquarian Society in Denmark, which had already published some
							dissertation about supposed Norwegian discoveries in this hemisphere in
							the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> century— I suppose a new
							resurrection of <persRef ref="madog">Prince Madoc</persRef>— I said I
							had no faith in any of these ante Columbian discoveries of America, from
								<persRef ref="plato">Plato’s</persRef> Atlantis, and the captive ten
							tribes of Israel down to Prince Madoc.— At <persRef ref="nourse-charles"
								>Major Nourse’s</persRef> Office and then at the Bank of Washington.
							The premium on specie 5 1/2 per cent— At <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah"
								>Niles’s</persRef> Register Office— He gave me Newspapers containing
							Letters from <persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C.
								Calhoun</persRef>—<persRef ref="king-john4">John P. King</persRef>;
							and <persRef ref="legare-hugh">H. Legare</persRef>, all upon the

						<p>At the Presbyterian Church heard a Stranger preach from Galatians 6.14.
							[“]But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
							Jesus Christ”—the first part of the verse— The preacher soon gave notice
							that by the cross of Jesus Christ, was understood what was usually
							called the Atonement, and then came the whole presbyterian creed— The
							fallen condition of man—his utter inability to do any thing for his own
							Salvation— The necessity of a vicarious sacrifice to atone for the
							irremissible crimes, and the ignominious death of almighty God, as a
							malefactor— I can hardly preserve my gravity, when I observe the fervour
							and seeming sincerity with which these young men dwell upon this
							argument as if they really believed what they say— I believe that Christ
							died for man as <persRef ref="warren-joseph2">Warren</persRef> died for
							his Country— Why, in the Counsels of divine Providence his death was
							necessary, transcends my capacity of comprehension— If as the <persRef
								ref="calvin-john">Calvinists</persRef> believe, Christ was incarnate
							God, his death was the death only of the mortal part—of man not of
							God—that the Soul of man suffers in its separation from the body, I
							perceive and understand. But that omnipotence should suffer is
							incomprehensible and incredible to me— That he should suffer by his own
							decree to save man his own creature from the penalty of his own Law, is
							as inconceivable to me, as that he should be his own Son— That such a
							bundle of absurdities as the abuse of humane reason has drawn from the
							gospel of <persRef ref="john">John</persRef>, and the Epistles of
								<persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>, should after nineteen centuries
							of Christianity overspread the intellect of so large a portion of
							mankind is a mortifying and a melancholy contemplation— That it should
							have subdued and still hold in subjection minds of capacity so far
							surpassing my own is a humiliating consideration. <hi rend="italic"
								>Indeed</hi>
							<pb n="407" type="ms"/>Indeed almost the only instruction that I ever
							gather from the pulpit is humility, and the perverseness of my nature
							revolts continually against that.— The Calvinistic doctrine of human
							depravity, so far as concerns the inspirations of the heart, is I fear
							too near the truth— I have much to answer for before God— I hope not
							much before man— God forbid that I should glory in any thing— S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul might glory in the cross of Jesus
							Christ; for he had laboured faithfully and effectively to achieve its
							victory over the world—but if the cross of Christ was necessary to my
							Salvation, it affords me cause rather for mourning than for glory—
								<persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Asbury
								Dickins</persRef>, now Secretary to the Senate paid me a visit this
							afternoon— He has recently returned from an excursion to Philadelphia
							after the close of the late Session of Congress— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> with the <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">two children</persRef> attended
							Church at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s this morning— I went
							with Mary-Louisa only after dinner— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening
							service for Advent Sunday, omitting the Psalms of the day, and the first
							Lesson which is the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Chapter of Isaiah—
							His Sermon was from Isaiah 55.8. “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
							neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord— 9. For as the heavens are
							higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my
							thoughts than your thoughts” We spent the Evening at <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas</persRef> is
							confined to his chamber— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye had
							received within a few days the final volumes of the writings of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>—that is the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							and the first volume which contains the Life— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frye had also two Letters from <persRef ref="lee-arthur"
								>Arthur Lee</persRef>, and some other papers relating to the
							controversy about <persRef ref="williams-jonathan">Jonathan
								Williams’s</persRef> accounts in 1778 and 1779.— After returning

							Representatives— I walked to the Capitol and at 12. Noon <persRef
								ref="polk-james">James K. Polk</persRef>, Speaker of the House of
							Representatives took the Chair, and called the House to order— The roll
							was called alphabetically by States, beginning with Maine—163 members
							answered to their names, and several others came in after their names
							were called and before the House adjourned— Their names were entered for
							the Journal— <persRef ref="yell-archibald">Archibald Yell</persRef> of
							Arkansas, appeared, claimed his seat, and was sworn— His case is
							precisely the same with that of the <persRef
								ref="gholson-samuel;claiborne-john">two members</persRef> from
							Mississippi who at the late extra Session, were declared by Resolution
							of the House, members for the whole 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							Congress— He was elected for the special Session, and attended it,
							without question upon the legality of his election— The regular election
							has since been held, and he was chosen again— The usual message was sent
							to the Senate that a quorum of the House was assembled and ready to
							proceed to business and a similar message was received from the Senate—
							A joint Committee was ordered in each House to wait upon the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President of the United States</persRef>, and
							inform him that Congress was assembled, and ready to receive any
							Communication from him— The usual order was taken, that the members
							should be supplied with three daily Newspapers— <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elijah Whittlesey</persRef> moved that the
							standing Committees should now be appointed, and then that his motion
							should be considered to-morrow— <persRef ref="cushman-samuel"
								>Cushman</persRef> of New Hampshire moved to postpone the
							Consideration till Thursday— Whittlesey then made a hortatory and
							objurgative Speech, and called for the yeas and nays; upon which Cushman
							softened down to Wednesday, and finally agreed upon to-morrow— <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> of Kentucky was for
							discussing the rules of the House again; and upon being told that the
							Rules adopted at the first Session of a Congress were Rules for the
							whole Congress, he offered a long Resolution for a new Rule to publish
							the lists of Yeas and Nays upon all questions, and send them after every
							Session to their Constituents— This was ordered to be printed. He moved
							also a call upon the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
								War</persRef>, about the employment of Indians in the Florida War—
							This lies over one day.— The House adjourned about one— I wrote a few
							lines to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="fletcher-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Returning home from the Capitol, I met in the yard <persRef
								ref="legare-hugh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Legare</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, who had just come in; and was going to the House— After

							<pb n="409" type="ms"/>South Scituate, in my District, brought some
							samples of sewing silk and of silk handkerchiefs, made by himself and
								<persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>, from silk worms of their own
							raising— He has invented a machine, for spinning the silk from the
							Cocoon, for which he has a patent, and which he proposes to exhibit
							working to-morrow in the Rotunda at the Capitol. His machine and his and
							his wife’s silks were exhibited at the late Mechanics Fair in Boston,
							and again at that of the American Institute at New-York. I told him I
							had received the pamphlet containing the proceedings at the Exhibition
							of the Mechanical Fair at Boston, with <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Governor Everett’s</persRef> address, which he said was excellent—
							He asked to see the pamphlet, and pointed out to me three several places
							where his machine and his silks were noticed with commendation.—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Capitol Yard we met <persRef ref="ogden-david3">David B.
							Odgen</persRef>, a New-York whig of considerable note— As he passed us
							Cambreleng said to me— Why, he has got a new suit of Clothes on the
							strength of his success— This was Cambreleng’s characteristic manner,
							intending to rally me in the person of Ogden, as I happened to have on a
							new Coat— He has been touched to the quick, during the recess, by the
							figure he makes in my Speech on Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs and Adverbs, and
							vented his spleen anonymously, in the New-York Evening Post— The House
							at Noon was called to order, and <persRef ref="muhlenberg-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Muhlenberg</persRef> of Pennsylvania
							reported from the joint Committee to wait on the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>, that he had informed them
							he would make a Communication to both Houses of Congress this day at 12
							O’Clock— The message was immediately afterwards delivered by his Son,
							and private Secretary<space/><persRef ref="vanburen-abraham2">Van
								Buren</persRef>— The reading of it by the <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef> took an hour and a quarter;
							after which <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia
							moved that it be referred to a Committee of the whole house on the state
							of the Union,—which was agreed to—as was his motion that 15000 copies of
							the Message with the Documents, and 5000 copies without the Documents,
							be printed for the use of the members— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha"
								>Elisha Whittlesey</persRef> moved to reduce the whole to 10000
							copies with the Documents, for economy’s sake, and to return to <pb
								n="410" type="ms"/>to old habits— But Haynes said he had proposed
							only the same numbers printed of the Message at the opening of the
							special Session; and he thought there was at least as much reason for
							printing an equal number of this— Of the immense importance of the
							Message, he would advert only to that part of it which related to
							Mexico— Haynes had Texas and Slavery in his head, though in the Message
							there was not a word about either.— Haynes’s motion was carried, and the
							5000 copies are to be delivered within two days— The House immediately
							adjourned— In the Rotunda, I found <persRef ref="brooks-adam">Adam
								Brooks</persRef> working with his spinning and twisting machine; and
							I introduced him to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							The Message gave me a fit of melancholy for the future fortunes of the
							Country— Cunning and duplicity pervade every line of it. The sacrifice
							of the rights of Northern freedom to Slavery and the South, and the
							purchase of the West by the plunder of public Lands, is the combined
							system which it discloses;— It is the system of <persRef

							was reading his book— His account of the origin of the political parties
							in New-York, during the revolutionary War, and of their subsequent
							bearing on the fortunes of Burr, throws some light upon the history of
							the time— The failure of <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>

							Between my father and <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef>, the final decision of that same Justice was
							reserved, for a higher state of being— The double-dealer succeeded in

						<p>A young man from the Office of the National Intelligencer brought me a
							Note from <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seaton</persRef>, asking for the manuscript of my two speeches at
							the special Session, on the Mississippi election, to be published in the
							paper to-morrow; which I gave him— I had returned yesterday to <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>
							the manuscript of <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxed
								Loomis’s</persRef> speech which immediately preceded mine, and which
							Gales had lent me— When I reached the Capitol this morning I found the
							House in Session, the Clock having been set, a quarter of an hour in
							advance of the City Clocks, generally.— The order for the appointment of
							the standing Committees was now passed, and <persRef
								ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia moved that the
							House should now resolve itself into a Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, to take into consideration the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> Message— It was objected
							that this had never been done until the appointment of the standing
							Committees had been made and announced to the House. Haynes did not
							press his motion, but moved that the Resolutions which he gave notice
							that he should offer be printed which was agreed to— A message was
							received from the President with sundry documents, which were laid on
							the Table— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>
							modified his call upon the President for information why the exploring
							expedition has not sailed, and it was adopted— At 25 minutes past 12 by
							the Clock the House adjourned— I invited the members of the
							Massachusetts delegation to meet in the chamber of the Committee of
							Manufactures and they all attended excepting <persRef
								ref="borden-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="phillips-stephen">Phillips</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="reed-john">Reed</persRef> were there— I told them I had called
							them together to consult them upon the disposal which should be proposed
							to be made in the House of the Petitions and Memorials against the
							annexation of Texas to the Union, of which I had now about forty to
							present; and also of the various petitions relating to Slavery, of which
							I had ten or twelve.— The Petitions would be called for next Monday to
							which day the House had adjourned, and I thought that would be the time
							for calling up all the Petitions and Memorials on the same Subject; and
							then by the general order, laid on the table— My own idea and purpose
							was, in presenting the first Petition to move that it be referred,
							together with all those on the same subject presented at the special
							Session, should be referred to a select Committee to consider and report
							thereon. I did not expect that the House would agree to this motion, but
							I thought it would be advisable to make it— The Petitions relating to
							Slavery I thought of moving to refer to the several Committees on the
							District of Columbia—on the Territories, and of Commerce— I supposed
							however that the House would pass a Resolution, of the same import with
							that adopted at both Sessions of the last Congress, that all such
							petitions, Memorials and papers be laid on the table, without further
							action upon them by the House— With regard to those against the
							annexation of Texas to the Union I knew not what course the House would
								<hi rend="italic">take</hi>
							<pb n="413" type="ms"/>take but I thought they should be referred to a
							select Committee. There was then a discussion of about two hours, in
							which very little difference of opinion was expressed, excepting by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parmenter, who is a strong friend and
							supporter of the present Administration— He disagreed to almost all the
							opinions expressed by the other members and by me, but made no objection
							to the motions proposed by me to dispose of the Petitions, and declared
							his willingness to agree to them— Most of the members took part in the
							discussion, and it was at last unanimously voted that I should make the
							motions for reference of the several petitions as I had proposed.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hastings was inclined to have another
							meeting to consider of the Petitions relating to Slavery, but the other
							members thought it not necessary— As I was returning home, I passed in
							the Avenue, by <persRef ref="macomb-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Macomb</persRef> without seeing her, till she called me
							back, and asked me to vote for <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> as Chaplain to the
							House, which I promised I would, and told her laughing that she made all
							our Chaplains— At home I gave some to assorting Petitions to be
							presented next Monday— Answered a Letter of 9. August last from <persRef
								ref="thomas-john8">John Thomas</persRef> of Kingston, and read 30
							pages of <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burr’s</persRef> Life.— The narrative
							and documents relating to the contested election between <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> and Burr for the
							Presidency of the United States, in February 1801.— The only thing new
							to me that I find in it is a Letter from <persRef ref="smith-samuel2"
									>Sam<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Smith</persRef> to <persRef

							of <persRef ref="kent-joseph">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kent</persRef>, which he had with great sensibility announced last
							Tuesday to the Senate. He said he had been much shocked on receiving the
							intelligence, from a newspaper which was handed to him by a friend as he
							landed from a Steamboat, at Wheeling— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Kent was one of those fortunate men of good understanding courteous
							manners, placid temper, and pure morals, who glide through the world in
							the most tempestuous times, with the steady favour of their Countrymen,
							scarcely affected by the mutability of popular opinions— For the last
							forty years Doctor Kent has been almost without intermission in public
							life—as a member of the Maryland Legislature, and of both Houses of
							Congress, Presidential Elector, and Governor of the State— He was
							universally respected, and his death is lamented by all who knew him.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay spoke to me also of the
							Mississippi election, which he said was unquestionably illegal— And he
							said <persRef ref="gholson-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gholson</persRef> himself had told him he thought it so.— The most
								<hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi>
							<pb n="414" type="ms"/>extraordinary fact of the case is, that both
							Gholson and <persRef ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef>
							asseverated in the most positive manner in the debate upon their
							election before the house, that the People of Mississippi at the
							election in August had universally believed that it was for the whole
							Congress— I knew that was impossible but there was nobody to contradict
							them— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that I was sick of
							contested elections.— This is the third case since I have been a member
							of the House unjustly decided— In that of <persRef ref="letcher-robert"
								>Letcher</persRef> and <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Moore</persRef>
							the House stultified itself by shrinking from the decision which they
							had been forced to admit, forced upon them— In that of <persRef
								ref="graham-james4">Graham</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="newland-david">Newland</persRef>, they came within one vote of
							admitting the intruder, and they excluded the rightful member.— But
							there has been no prostration of principle equal to that of this
							decision at the special Session— On the subject of the Banks and their
							present condition we had some conversation but I could not ascertain how
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay felt upon it, and how far he may
							be under bank influences— The Convention of Bank delegates at New-York,
							concluded by calling another convention to meet next April— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that <persRef
								ref="brockenborough-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brockenbrough</persRef> who was a delegate to that Convention from
							one of the Virginia Banks and was now returning home had told him there
							was a considerable manifestation of jealousy manifested between the
							Banks of New-York and those of Philadelphia, by <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef ref="eyre-manuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Eyre</persRef>— I walked before dinner
							to College Hill and the Race-ground— I had not been there before for
							many months— Meridian Hill forms part of those Heights— The house in
							which I resided from the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March to the
								10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1829. has left on my mind,
							associations, deep and distressing beyond any thing else that has ever
							happened to me throughout my life— This afternoon and Evening I was
							occupied in making a minute of the Petitions presented by me, at the
							special Session of Congress, in number 400, which are to be called up
							next Monday, and in writing an answer long delayed to a Letter from
								<persRef ref="savil-josiah2">Josiah Savil jun<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The first fall of snow, in quantity just sufficient to whiten the surface

							that I was obliged to betake myself to the dining room, and to reading

							a shivering fit— <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript"

							<pb n="415" type="ms"/>Petition for an allowance of a claim, of about a

							as diplomatic agent in Peru— The two claims if existing together might
							prove injurious to each other, and have a tendency to defeat both— I
							gave her two copies of the document just published of his Brazilian
							Correspondence— I received this morning a Letter from <persRef
								ref="freeman-russell">Russel Freeman</persRef> enclosing two papers
							with numerous signatures recommending the appointment of him as
							Collector at New-Bedford; and a sealed Letter from <persRef
								ref="foster-william10">William Foster</persRef>, addressed to
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>, President
							of the United States— I took that Letter and the two certificates to the
							President, and delivered them to him. He spoke favourably of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman, and said he had endeavoured to
							prevail upon <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> to
							retain him in office— He added that <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury</persRef> had already
							communicated to him several other recommendations of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman, and that when the time for making
							the nomination should come, he would give full consideration to his
							claims— But he said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury had told him
							he did not know, but believed that <persRef ref="williams-lemuel2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams</persRef> the present
							Collector, having been unfortunate in some Speculations, would wish for
							reappointment to the Office. I said I had no acquaintance with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams, and not much with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman personally— He had been a member
							of the Legislature and of the Executive Council of Massachusetts— I had
							been fifty years ago acquainted with <persRef ref="freeman-nathaniel2"
								>his father</persRef>, and the intimate friend of <persRef
								ref="freeman-nathaniel">his brother</persRef>, a Classmate of mine
							at the University, generally considered the first scholar in the Class,
							and afterwards, a member of Congress though he died young, not much over
							the age of thirty— I had also been acquainted with a yet <persRef
								ref="freeman-edmund">older brother</persRef> as Editor of a
							newspaper, and of a monthly Magazine in Boston— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russel Freeman, had been first appointed Collector at
							New-Bedford by <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef>— In December 1828 I nominated him for
							re-appointment; his Commission being to expire on the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1829. It was one of a multitude
							of nominations upon which the Senate did not act through the whole
							Session, and when Jackson came in he nominated <persRef
								ref="baylies-francis">Francis Baylies</persRef>, who was appointed
							but declined accepting; but recommended Williams— All these proceedings
							were stimulated by Jackson’s personal malignity to me— Baylies and
							Williams were federalists rank as the compost of a dunghill—and
							therefore bitter as wormwood against me— Baylies in 1825 had as a member
							of Congress voted for Jackson as President, libelled me in the
							Newspapers and lost his election in consequence— He thought Jackson
							undervalued him by the offer of the Collectorship of New-Bedford, and
							Jackson to appease him gave him as a second sop the Office of Chargé
							d’Affaires at Buenos-Ayres. He went there—stayed there not three months;
							just long enough to embroil his Country in a senseless and wicked
							quarrel with that government; and without waiting for orders from his
							Government demanded his Passports and came home— Nothing but the
							imbecility of that South-American abortion of a State saved him from
							indelible disgrace and this Country from humiliation in that concern.—
							Jackson did not employ him again; and so he turned Bank whig, and now is
							in deadly opposition to Van Buren— He is one of the most talented and
							worthless men <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
							<pb n="416" type="ms"/>in New England— Russel Freeman had originally
							been of the democratic party, but had also been and continued to be
							friendly to me— That was his crime with Jackson who turned him out first
							to put in Francis Baylies and then Lemuel Williams—Blue-light
							federalists, but thorough going haters and revilers of me. I said
							nothing of all this to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren—not a
							single word even to insinuate the political opinions of either of
							word—nor a word against Williams or Baylies— We had some conversation
							about patronage and appointments, upon which his theories and mine do
							not so well agree as our experience— He says he considers it as a
							misfortune when any office to be filled by him becomes vacant, and
							thinks patronage rather a burden than a benefit. I went to the Pension
							Office and left with the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner
								Edwards</persRef> a Letter from <persRef ref="bovee-matthias"
								>Matthias J. Bovee</persRef> a member of the last Congress from the
							interior of New-York, concerning the claim of a Widow <persRef

						<p>Flannels. Heard this morning at the Presbyterian Church <persRef
								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from Romans 2:28 [“]For he is not a Jew, which is
							one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the
							flesh— 29— But he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumcision, is
							that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is
							not of man, but of God.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler’s
							Discourse was very short, and he descanted upon the peculiar character
							of the Christian religion as adapting its precepts not only to the
							actions, but to the thoughts and purposes of man— Whether this property
							belongs so exclusively to the Christian Religion may be doubted, for it
							seems included in the doctrine of responsibility to a superior Power,
							and a future state of retribution— But that it is the great
							characteristic of Christianity cannot be denied— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the Evening service for the second Sunday in advent, omitting the
							Psalms and the first lesson, and reading by mistake the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> instead of the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> chapter of Romans for the second Lesson— The Sermon was by
							a person named <persRef ref="wolff-joseph">Wolff</persRef> a German
							convert from the Jewish faith, and his text was from Romans 11.25.
							[“]For I would not, brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery,
							lest ye should be wise in your own conceits: that blindness in part is
							happened to Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in 26— And
							so, all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, there shall come out of
							Zion, the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from <persRef
								ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef>”—and so on to the end of the chapter—
							The final restoration of the Jews was the thence; and the principal
							merit of the discourse consisted in a continual text, collated with
							passages of the prophets <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="jeremiah">Jeremiah</persRef>, <persRef ref="daniel"
								>Daniel</persRef>
							<persRef ref="zechariah">Zecariah</persRef>, and <persRef ref="micah"
								>Micah</persRef>, which appear indeed wonderfully adapted to one
							another— This M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolff is an itinerant
							missionary and has travelled over all the world preaching his judaic
							Christianism— He has a coarse, vulgar, not very clearly German-Jewish
							look—short-sighted, with a frowzy black periwig, and an exceedingly <hi
								rend="italic">broad</hi>
							<pb n="417" type="ms"/>broad German-pronunciation of English, making
							altogether as ungainly a personage as you would wish to see— The effect
							of the whole is so ludicrous that it is scarcely possible to refrain
							from laughing— And he was obliged in the midst of his Sermon to chide
							the boys in the gallery, who could not garder le serieux. At another
							time he interrupted himself bent down over the pulpit and said he should
							like a light; and a lamp was accordingly carried to him— Yet there was
							with all this a sincerity—a zeal, a vehemence and a penetration of
							research, and closeness of argument in the discourse deeply impressive,
							and the like of which I never heard before— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley gave notice that he would preach this Evening at
							Trinity Church and lecture twice a day every day during the ensuing
							week, at Georgetown, Alexandria, and in this City.— Evening visits from

						<p><date>11. VI:30. </date>Monday. </p>
						<p>Our visitors last evening kept us up till past eleven O’Clock, and the
							consequence was a corresponding postponement of my rising hour this
							morning— Our philosophy was tried this morning by unlucky accident— The
							Barouche was standing at the door, and having on a pinching pair of new
							shoes, I was about riding in it to the Capitol— The Coachman <persRef
								ref="nelson-thomas3">Thomas Nelson</persRef>, left his horses, with
							the reins in the hands of the black man <persRef ref="william2"
								>William</persRef> to go into the stable to fetch a bear-skin to lay
							on the floor of the Carriage— While William held the reins a man with a
							Cart passed by—cracked his whip two or three times—the horses started;
							the reins broke in William’s hands—away went horses and barouche, raced
							down two or three Streets—overset, and broke the carriage all to pieces—
							A new purchase last year, by <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>, and very little used—
							The third carriage of mine, smashed and ruined within three years by
							oversetting— I had not seen the Carriage move from the door and after
							waiting for it a quarter of an hour or more I enquired where it was—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Adams</persRef> thought it was in the yard— I went
							there and called for Thomas— No answer, no barouche and horses— I went
							into the Streets— <persRef ref="rachel4">Rachel</persRef> the Cook, was
							standing at the corner of the house— I asked her if she knew what had
							become of the barouche— She said Thomas had gone down the Street, with
							it and William was gone after him— All this happened in the course of a
							quarter of an hour and I had not a suspicion that any accident had
							occurred— I thought Thomas had taken the Carriage to the Coachmaker’s
							for some necessary repair, and walked on to the Capitol— As I turned the
							corner at <persRef ref="blake-john2">Blake’s</persRef> shop, at the foot
							of Pennsylvania-Avenue, where there is a stand of Hucks, one of the
							drivers was telling another as they stood in the street by their
							vehicles of horses that had <hi rend="italic">run</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">away</hi>
							<pb n="418" type="ms"/>run away, overset the Carriage, and broken it all
							to pieces— The other man asked him to whom the Carriage belonged. He
							answered in a low tone of voice, and I thought he named me— Still I
							thought it so impossible that this should have happened, and got to be a
							matter of talk so near my house, that I thought the man was telling of
							some disaster that had happened last night and that I had not heard
							correctly the name he had given as the owner of the Carriage— I did not
							even stop to ask the man if he had named me, but thinking more of my
							pinched corns than of the barouche, was sure I had mistaken the name,
							dismissed the subject from my cogitations, and limped along to the
							Capitol, expecting all the time that Thomas and the barouche would
							overtake me—looking occasionally behind to see if they were coming as I
							had told Rachel to tell Thomas to do when he should return to the House,
							and still notwithstanding all these warnings, not even surmising the
							wreck of the carriage, which had taken place— From that time, the
							conversation between the Hackman at the Corner of the Pennsylvania
							avenue never presented itself to my thoughts till after I had come home
							and dined when my wife told me what come to pass; when I could but
							reflect upon the sluggish torpidity of my own senses, and bless
							Providence that in this casualty no person, nor even the horses had been
							hurt; and particularly for my own escape from a heavier calamity, if I
							had been as I was so near being in the Carriage when the horses started—
							By a singular coincidence, the <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">children</persRef> who had missed
							their morning lesson of reading with me in the Bible, because they had
							not come down in time before they were obliged to go to school, read
							after dinner, from the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm— When we came to the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							verses of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— 7. “Some trust in
							chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord
							our God. 8. They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen and stand
							upright.”— I reminded the children how appropriate this passage was to
							the event of this day, and how much they should lay it to heart always
							to rely upon the Providence of God—and Louisa remarked, that it taught
							us also to be careful in whatever we do— At the House, in reading the
							Journal, the standing Committees were announced—with very little
							difference the same as at the special Session— The <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> gave notice that he should call
							by the States for Petitions to-morrow— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha"
								>Whittlesey</persRef> presented a list of claims upon which Bills
							have heretofore been presented to the House, and moved the reference of
							them all to the Committee of Claims— <persRef ref="patton-john"
								>Patton</persRef> moved the extension of the same principle to all
							the other Committees which was adopted— The house balloted five times
							for a Chaplain when the <persRef ref="reese-levi">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef><space/>was elected— <persRef ref="fowler-philemon"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> had 47. votes
							at the first ballot nominated by <persRef ref="garland-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Garland</persRef> of Virginia—
								<persRef ref="macomb-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Macomb</persRef> had stop’d me the
							other day in the Street, and asked me to vote for him; which I had
							promised and did.</p>
						<pb n="419" type="ms"/>
						<p>Sundry Resolutions were offered by the Western Members, for plundering
							under the name of pre-emption and graduating the prices of the public
							Lands— <persRef ref="lawler-joab">Lawler</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="martin-joshua2">Martin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lyon-francis">Lyon</persRef> of Alabama, ran a race upon this
							subject— <persRef ref="carter-william2">Carter</persRef> of Tennessee,
							cut in for a slice of the public domain— <persRef ref="johnson-william2"
								>W. Cost Johnson</persRef>, put them in check by having the
							reference made to the Committee of roads and canals instead of the
							Committee of Public Lands— I offered a Resolution to instruct the
							Committee on the District of Columbia to report a Bill prohibiting the
							Banks in the District of Columbia from making or declaring any dividends
							of profits to their Stockholders, whenever they suspend specie payments—
							Patton moved an amendment turning it into an instruction to the
							Committee to inquire into the expediency of reporting such a Bill— I
							accepted the amendment, and the Resolution passed— Adjourned a quarter
							past 3. I went into the Library and consulted the volume of the
							Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence containing the Letters from the
							Commissioners to France in 1778. to ascertain the appointment of
								<persRef ref="johnson-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua
								Johnson</persRef> as Consul of the United States at Nantes, but
							could not find it— In the evening I read 30 pages of the Life of
								<persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burr</persRef>. After the contested
							election in Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1801— The correspondence is
							almost entirely with <persRef ref="alston-theodosia">his

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> year married <persRef
								ref="alston-joseph">Joseph Alston</persRef> of South-Carolina; a
							rich Planter, but a very ordinary man— They had after a year’s marriage
								<persRef ref="alston-aaron">one Son</persRef>; and they visited and
							revisited one another between New-York and North-Carolina.— <persRef

							Before the Meeting of the House <persRef ref="reed-john">John
								Reed</persRef> introduced <persRef ref="buckingham-joseph">J. T.
								Buckingham</persRef> to me: he is the Editor of the Boston Courier,
							and a member of the Massachusetts Legislature from Cambridge.— <persRef
								ref="davis-matthew">Matthew L. Davis</persRef> was also on the
							floor, and I told him I was reading in regular course his life of
								<persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burr</persRef>; and that I had read last
							Evening to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">daughter</persRef>, to their great
							amusement, the correspondence about his proposal of marriage to a Lady
							in Philadelphia in 1802 when he was Vice-President, and that we all
							thought it the best part of the Book— I asked him who the Lady was— He
							said he could not tell that; for she was still living and had a family
							of children— He said some of the Southern Gentlemen blamed him for
							publishing that part of the Correspondence, as being of too light and
							frivolous a nature—but there is nothing in the book more characteristic
							of the man— As soon as the Journal was read, the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> called the States for Petitions
							beginning with Maine— When the turn of Massachusetts came, I waited till
							all the other members from the State had presented their Petitions, and
							then offered first all the Petitions and Memorials which I had presented
							at former Sessions, and which had not been finally <hi rend="italic"
								>acted</hi>
							<pb n="420" type="ms"/>acted upon, and had them referred to the
							appropriate Committees I then called up the Memorial of <persRef
								ref="feuchtwanger-lewis">Feuchtwanger</persRef>, and a Memorial from
							Vermont praying for retrenchment and reform, and had them referred to
							the Committee of Ways and Means— They were referred to the Committee at
							the special Session, but not reported upon— I moved the reference of the
							Petition of <persRef ref="gregory-sherlock">Sherlock S.
								Gregory</persRef>, praying for an act of Congress declaring him an
							alien, to the Committee on the Judiciary; observing that since the close
							of the special Session, I had received another Letter from him asking me
							to present again his petition, and to demand the action of the House
							upon it—a request which I had not felt myself at Liberty to deny— The
							memorial was referred.— I then presented the Petition of <persRef
								ref="ripley-nancy">Nancy Ripley</persRef> and 238 women of Plymouth,
							the principal town of the District that I have the honour to represent
							remonstrating against the annexation of Texas to this Union; and I moved
							that together with 190 Petitions, signed by more than twenty-thousand
							signers, and a still greater number of Petitions and Memorials presented
							at the same special Session by my Colleagues of the Massachusetts
							delegation, on the same subject, it be referred to a select Committee.
								<persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>, of Maryland,
							Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations, moved that the reference
							should be to that Committee— I said that I had moved the reference to a
							select Committee by concert with my Colleagues, and with their unanimous
							assent— That if the Chairman of the Committee of foreign affairs
							persisted in his motion, I should feel myself bound to assign my
							reasons, for wishing to have the subject considered by a select
							Committee. The Speaker said if debate arose it must be postponed until
							to-morrow— Howard said it was a subject proper for the consideration of
							the Committee of foreign Relations, and he thought that the charge of
							persisting rather laid at my door.— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> moved to lay both the motions, and all the Petitions
							and Memorials on the table, but the Speaker said that would not now be
							in order, but would be when the subject should be taken up to-morrow.— I
							next presented a petition for the abolition of Slavery and the
							Slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and moved its reference with
							all the Petitions on the same subject presented at the special Session
							to the Committee on the District of Columbia— Wise moved to lay all
							these upon the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 135 to 73— I
							offered several others with the same result, till <persRef
								ref="lawler-joab">Lawler</persRef> objected to receiving one, but
							upon the yeas and nays the vote was 144 to 60 to receive, but it was
							immediately laid on the table— Then I presented a petition for the
							abolition of Slavery in the Territories; which again was laid on the
							table; by a vote of 127 to 73.— I then left the remaining anti-slavery
							petitions to be presented hereafter and presented a petition
								of<space/><persRef ref="u">Morey</persRef> on banking and currency,
							which at my motion was referred to the Committee of Ways and Means— The
							call for Petitions then proceeded as far as Pennsylvania, when about 3
							O’Clock the House adjourned— This Evening <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillebrown</persRef> one of the
							Trustees of the second Presbyterian Church called on me, and said that

						<p>Publication this morning in the Globe and National Intelligencer, by six
							members of the Committee of Ways and Means against <persRef
								ref="fletcher-richard">Richard Fletcher</persRef>, member from
							Boston; and a member of the Committee— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef> called here this
							morning and told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher
							proposed giving an explanation, at the meeting of the House, and wished
							me to be in attendance— I rode to and from the Capitol— The meeting was
							opened with prayer by <persRef ref="reese-levi">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Reese</persRef>, the Chaplain of the House— After the
							reading of the Journal M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher,
							referring to the Article in the Globe asked leave of the House to make
							an explanation which was granted.— The publication of the six members,
							was a passionate and elaborate attempt to prove the falsehood, of a
							Report in the Boston Atlas of a speech made by Fletcher at a Caucus in
							Faneuil Hall, in which he exposed the subserviency of the Committee of
							Ways and Means to the Executive. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher
							said that the report was incorrect as to details—that it was not made
							nor authorised by him— That he had not seen it till after it was
							published, and that he held himself not responsible for it— That the
							meeting at which he had spoken was not as the joint publication alledged
							to celebrate whig victories, but a regular annual meeting preparatory to
							the election— That he was there called upon to address his Constituents,
							and considered it his duty to inform them of the state of things here at
							the special Session of Congress from which he had just returned, and at
							which he a new and inexperienced member had been appointed by the
							Speaker a member of the Committee of Ways and Means— He had seen what he
							thought an improper influence exercised by the Executive Departments in
							the proceedings of the Committee, and of the House— He had said so to
							his constituents, and he still retained that opinion— But the report of
							his Speech was altogether inaccurate in the details, upon which the six
							signers of the publication in the Globe this morning, dwell so
							earnestly, and which he disavowed— He complained of the manner in which
							they had chosen to make this publication without first calling upon him
							to know whether he had spoken that which they had chosen to consider as
							personally offensive, and under these circumstances, he asked of the
							House to be discharged from further service on the Committee of Ways and
							Means— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee, <persRef ref="atherton-charles"
								>Atherton</persRef> of New-Hampshire, and <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Jones</persRef> of Virginia, with leave of the House, answered M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher, and insulted him with coarse and
							abusive language.— Jones began with great formality by asking if
							Fletcher avowed the report of his Speech at Faneuil-Hall, as published
							in the Boston Atlas, and said that what he should say would depend upon
							the answer to that question— Fletcher had already explicitly disavowed
							the details of that report; and did so again and then Jones went on and
							made his speech as he had gotten it by heart, as if Fletcher had avowed
							every word of the Report, and concluded by saying that it was a base
							falsehood— Fletcher asked me, if I thought he should reply to them, and
							I said No— They were six to one against him— The whole <hi rend="italic"
								>proceeding</hi>
							<pb n="422" type="ms"/>proceeding was a party movement to bully down
							Fletcher and to brazen out their own delinquency—and there was in the
							House a majority to back them.— He could have given no suitable answer
							to Jones, without including in it the lie direct, and that would have
							produced violent disorder in the House, and probably violence out of it—
							He was discharged from further service on the Committee of Ways and
							Means— I spoke perhaps an hour, in support of the motion to refer the
							Memorials and Remonstrances against the annexation of Texas to this
							Union, to a select Committee, and not to the Committee of foreign
							affairs— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> made no reply—
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> of South-Carolina, and
							some others of the Slave-holders were ferocious for battle, and claimed
							the right to answer me— But <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>
							said I had made an intemperate speech, and renewed his motion of
							yesterday that all the Memorials concerning Texas, and both the motions,
							Howard’s and mine, for reference of them to Committees should be laid on
							the table— Which was carried 137 to 68— The call for Petitions was
							continued only from Pennsylvania to Virginia inclusive; and the House
							adjourned about 3. O Clock.— I rode to and from the Capitol. <persRef
								ref="buckingham-joseph">J. T. Buckingham</persRef> the Editor of the
							Boston Courier came to my seat and invited me to write whatever I might
							please, to be published in his paper— <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope</persRef> of Kentucky paid us a
							morning visit; I was already on my way to the Capitol when he came, but
							the <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">Ladies</persRef>
							saw him— I was this evening under deep agitation of mind this evening,
							reflecting upon what had occurred this morning in the House, both to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher, and to myself— Meditating
							upon the course proper for me to pursue hereafter— Upon the moderation,
							which reason, and Christian charity and sound policy all concur to
							prescribe, and from which the unruliness of my tempers so often urges me
							to depart; and upon the firm and daring Spirit, which a sacred sense of
							duty enjoins upon me as equally indispensable to the cause almost
							exclusively committed to my trust—</p>

						<p>I have a whitlow on the forefinger of my right hand, without which it is
							impossible for me to write. It was so painful that I scarcely slept at
							all, last Night, and this day I could not put pen to paper; which is
							little less than the extinction of my life. H.R.U.S. <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> was announced as the member of
							the Committee of Ways and Means appointed in the place of <persRef
								ref="fletcher-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fletcher</persRef>— He asked my advice whether he ought to accept,
							and at first, without much reflection, I said, yes. I saw no sufficient
							reason for him to decline, but I thought he was bound to take a firm and
							resolute stand in the Committee, and compel them to do their business in
							a very different manner— Soon after, <persRef ref="phillips-stephen"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips</persRef> told me that
							Briggs had asked his advice, which was that he should not accept; and he
							thought no member of the delegation should consent to serve on that
							Committee; and I understood from him that other members of the
							delegation held the same opinion— I therefore told Briggs that in
							deference to the opinions of the other members he must consider my
							advice first given, as withdrawn— The calling of Petitions was resumed
							beginning with Virginia, and going through the remainder of the States
							and <hi rend="italic">Territories</hi></p>
