						<p>May day— I filed once more alphabetically the Letters received since the
							commencement of the year; to find among them any which might require an
							answer and yet remain unanswered— I did find several, and among them one
							upwards of a year old— Several of later date, but still obsolete—and I
							received Letters from <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott
								Thayer</persRef> and <persRef ref="newcomb-bryant">Bryant
								Newcomb</persRef> of Braintree. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thayer’s Letter informs me that just at the close of the late Session of
							the Legislature of Massachusetts, he called the members from the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District together, and
							they passed Resolutions appointing a Committee to congratulate me upon
							my return home, and to express their sense of my services at the late
							Session of Congress. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer, as Chairman
							of the Committee enquires when I may be expected home— I answered him, I
							hoped not later than the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this
							month; and probably not sooner than the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi>— The Letter from Bryant Newcomb, was in behalf of a
								<persRef ref="spear-elizabeth">widow Spear</persRef>, having a claim
							for a Pension— I took it to the Pension-Office, and <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards</persRef>
							promised to examine the Massachusetts records, and see if they furnished
							proof of the service. He said also that he would report to me to-morrow
							upon the cases of Huldah Penniman, and of Jerusha Ripley— He should send
							me the certificate in the case of <persRef ref="pennyman-huldah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Penniman</persRef>; but in that of
								<persRef ref="ripley-jerusha">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Ripley</persRef> there was only a Petition stating her claim instead
							of a Declaration upon Oath, which the Law requires.— We had morning
							visits from <persRef ref="wadsworth-alexander">Captain
								Wadsworth</persRef> of the U.S. Navy and <persRef
								ref="wadsworth-louisa">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Wadsworth</persRef>— He has just returned in the frigate Brandywine
							from the Station in the Pacific— Sailed from Callao in January and
							arrived after a passage of 94 days at Norfolk— I made some enquiries of
							him concerning the present condition of Peru— Our public journals take
							little more notice of the affairs of South-America than of the interior
							of China— Captain Wadsworth says that <persRef ref="santacruz-andres"
								>Santa-Cruz</persRef>, formerly President of Upper Peru or Bolivia,
							was when he left Lima, President of Peru with dictatorial powers. That
							Bolivia, is now united with Peru; which consists of three
							divisions—North and South Peru, and Bolivia—that the Government de facto
							is a military despotism; but that they have a Congress; and continue to
							be occupied in making Constitutions of which they have had three or
							four, since he went upon that Station— At his departure they were on the
							point of War, which has since been declared against Chili—a country much
							more tranquil, and more prosperous— But in truth there seems to be no
							cement in these new Independent States, formed out of Spanish Colonies—
							After the North American Revolution, we had only five or six years of
							languor, and imbecility, and approximations to civil War— None such
							occurred between the States, but there was a serious insurrection in
							Massachusetts— Within seven years from the Preliminary Articles of Peace
							with Great-Britain, the Constitution of the United States had been
							constructed and adopted, and was in full operation— The 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress under that Constitution has
							commenced; and the close of that Congress will be the Jubile of the
							Constitution.— One half century has passed over the heads of this
							People; with scarcely enough internal dissension to create a convulsion—
							Without Secession of one State from the Union—with only two light
							insurrections, within the first ten years, rather reasoned down than
							subdued by force— With short War with <hi rend="italic"
								>Great-Britain</hi>
							<pb n="267" type="ms"/>Great-Britain and a Quasi-war with France— In
							that time, the number of the States has doubled; the population more
							than quadrupled— The extent of Territory more than doubled— The wealth
							more than ten-fold, and Justice the great object for which Governments
							are instituted among men has been administered however imperfectly, with
							more approach to perfection than in any other Country upon Earth— This
							is an excellent subject for that discourse which I have conditionally
							promised to deliver before the American Historical Society of Military
							and Naval Events, at New-York next November; and about which I ought
							very soon to set to work— <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef>
							was here this morning—he has made his engagement with the <persRef
								ref="pontois-edouard">French Minister</persRef>— I walked this
							afternoon round the Capitol— Evening hour at Cards.</p>

						<p>I went at ten this morning with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth
								C. Adams</persRef>, and the two children <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Louisa</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Fanny</persRef> to the Columbian College, and attended an
							exhibition of the Senior and junior Classes— The College was some years
							since broken up, and since it was resumed has continually languished—
							There are only four Students in the Senior Class, of whom <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">T. B. J. Frye</persRef> is one— In the Junior
							class there are 11. and there were 15 parts to be performed—four of them
							were excused— The rest occupied about ten minutes each, with a beginning
							close and three intervals of instrumental music.— The performers were
							all in English prose, and generally below the average of such
							exhibitions at other colleges—almost every one of the performers was
							grossly deficient in Memory; but the elocution was generally good— The
							best piece was a dissertation upon the Poetry of the Hebrews by a
							Virginian named <persRef ref="herndon-traverse">Herndon</persRef>, and
							pilfered from <persRef ref="hazlitt-william">Hazlett</persRef> or
								<persRef ref="campbell-thomas">Campbell</persRef>— The President
								<persRef ref="chapin-stephen">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chapin</persRef> was absent and <persRef ref="ruggles-william"
								>Professor Ruggles</persRef> presided—the Mayor of the City <persRef
								ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Force</persRef> was
							there; and <persRef ref="brown-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Catherine</persRef> Brown; one of the performers
								<persRef ref="kurtz-john2">J. D. Kurtz</persRef> being I believe her
							Grandson— I was requested by the faculty to enter the Chapel and take a
							seat on the stage with them— The exhibition was over about 1. O’Clock
							and I took my companions with me into the race grounds, where we saw two
							three Mile heats run, and taken by the same horse— I had not been at a
							race before these ten years or more— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was there on the stand
							among the judges; though the weather was excessively chilling. There was
							to be another race, but we did not wait for it. Thomas Frye rode home
							with us.— I found on my table Letters from <persRef ref="edwards-james"
								>J. L. Edwards</persRef> Commissioner of Pensions, with Pension
							certificates—for <persRef ref="partridge-mary">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Mary Partridge</persRef> sometime widow of <persRef
								ref="alden-ichabod">Ichabod Alden</persRef>, and for <persRef
								ref="pennyman-huldah">Huldah Penniman</persRef>, sometime widow of
								<persRef ref="hollis-barnabas">Barnabas Hollis</persRef>, and now of
								<persRef ref="penniman-bethuel">Bethuel Penniman</persRef>: and
							rejecting for insufficient evidence the claims of <persRef
								ref="ripley-jerusha">Jerusha Ripley</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="spear-elizabeth ">Elizab<hi rend="superscript">h.</hi>
								Spear</persRef>. I wrote immediately to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Partridge, and to <persRef ref="frazar-samuel">Samuel Alden
								Frazar</persRef> who had requested me to enquire into her claim— The
							certificate entitles her to the receipt of 3600 dollars immediately and
							to a pension of 600 dollars a year for the rest of her life— I then went
							and dined with <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> W. W. Seaton</persRef>; where besides <persRef
								ref="seaton-sarah2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Seaton</persRef>, her daughter and niece, I met her father <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Gales
								Senior</persRef>, <persRef ref="follen-charles">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Follen</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-pishey">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pishey
								Thompson</persRef>— Had a very pleasant dinner, with the only
							dissatisfaction that I engrossed far too great a part of the
							conversation— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Follen told me that he had
							examined the Bible with reference to the remarks that I made to him the
							other day, upon the Covenants between God and Man—<hi rend="italic"
								>and</hi>
							<pb n="268" type="ms"/>and had found them surprizingly numerous— I urged
							him to take up the subject and carry it out into all its consequences,
							and see if it would not lead him to the conclusion that the power to
							make a covenant or promise is a part and a proof of the immortality of
							man’s nature— At half past seven D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Follen
							delivered at the Unitarian Church the last of his course of Lectures,
							which I attended, and it contained a recapitulation of the whole course—
							His text was from John 16.12. [“]I have yet many things to say unto you,
							but ye cannot hear them now— 13. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth,
							is come, he will guide you into all truth”—omitting the remainder of the
							verse.— And he read the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of
							Acts from verse 16 to the end of the chapter,—<persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul’s</persRef> valedictory at Ephesus— And this also was a very
							affectionate taking of leave— D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Follen
							pronounces the English, almost like a native, and speaks it
							grammatically without elegance. His style is clear and perspicuous, and
							the turn of his mind argumentative and logical. When I returned home, I
							found <persRef ref="thornton-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Thornton</persRef>, <persRef ref="talbot-adelaide">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Talbot</persRef> her <persRef

						<p>As old age steals upon me, I feel more and more the want of tranquility,
							and the annoyance of agitation— Yesterday was a whole day of bustle and
							commotion— It continued till near Midnight, and after all I had not a
							quiet Night— Awoke this morning before the dawn, and rose by five
							O’Clock when there was scarcely daylight to dress by— <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitcomb</persRef> was here and informed me that he had accepted an
							Office as a Clerk with a Salary of 800 dollars a year under the <persRef
								ref="parris-albion">second Comptroller of the Treasury, Albion K.
								Parris,</persRef> sometime Governor of the State of Maine— He came
							to make enquiries whether it would be advisable for him to make
							application for the admission of <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef> now
							13 years of age as a Cadet at the West Point Academy. I told him I could
							not advise him against making the application; because I saw not that it
							could do any harm; but a new or revised system of Regulations had been
							adopted at the War Department, a printed copy of which he could easily
							procure— By this system one Cadet was allotted to each congressional
							District throughout the United States and the member of the House of
							Representatives from the same District was called upon to make the
							nomination— I had accordingly within a few weeks been notified, by the
							Chief Engineer, <persRef ref="gratiot-charles">General
							Gratiot</persRef>, that there was at the Academy a vacancy for the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts
							to fill which I was authorised to make a nomination; and had accordingly
							made one for a youth named <persRef ref="tower-zealous">Tower</persRef>,
							who had accordingly received the warrant— But the regulations expressly
							gave notice, that priority of application would give no priority of
							claim when the appointments should be made; and upon my being requested
							to file in the Department a recommendation of a youth from Boston, in
							the District adjoining upon mine, General Gratiot had told me, that it
								<hi rend="italic">could</hi>
							<pb n="269" type="ms"/>could be of no use, as when the vacancy should
							occur the nomination must be made by the member from the District— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitcomb was sometime a subordinate
							Officer in the custom-house at Boston; but residing at Dorchester— He
							lately resigned that station, and removed to the State of Vermont, and
							has now taken the place here, in the expectation of a better office
							hereafter—for which he feels himself to be fully competent— I wrote
							Letters to <persRef ref="parker-jonathan">Jonathan Parker</persRef> at
							Plympton, respecting the claim to a widows Pension, of <persRef
								ref="ripley-jerusha">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jerusha
								Ripley</persRef>—to <persRef ref="newcomb-bryant">Bryant
								Newcomb</persRef> at Braintree, in answer to his enquiries in behalf
							of <persRef ref="spear-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Elizabeth Spear</persRef>; and to <persRef ref="baldwin-reuben"
								>Reuben Baldwin</persRef> of Boston to enclose the Pension
							certificate for <persRef ref="pennyman-huldah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Huldah Pennyman</persRef>. Called at the Office of the
							Commissioner of Pensions, and took back the Letter from Reuben Baldwin
							to me, which had enclosed the Petition of Huldah Pennyman; and also the
							affidavit of <persRef ref="cushman-zebedee">Zebedee Cushman</persRef>;
							one of the vouchers to the Petition of Jerusha Ripley, which <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards</persRef>
							had omitted accidentally to include with those he sent me yesterday— I
							found upon enquiry from him that the vouchers for the claim of <persRef
								ref="partridge-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary
								Partridge</persRef>, had been received by him on the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March last from <persRef
								ref="loud-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob H
								Loud</persRef> of Plymouth— I was walking for a tour round the

							to turn back and fetch home—immediately after which there was a heavy
							thunder shower. After dinner I took a second walk— Evening Cards—and
							nothing from <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef>.</p>

						<p>I wrote this morning to <persRef ref="loud-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jacob H. Loud</persRef> of Plymouth, and thus squared
							off my correspondence, respecting the claims for Pensions, in behalf of
							which I had received Letters during the late Session of Congress— I have
							now nothing to detain me here longer than the time necessary to make
							preparations for departure— But not having heard from the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, concerning
							the Letter from <persRef ref="ellis-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Ellis</persRef> that I had left with him some
							weeks since, I called at his Office to enquire about it— He had referred
							it to the <persRef ref="miller-jesse">first Auditor</persRef>, the
							acting Officer in which had addressed to me on the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month a Letter, which I had not
							received, in answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis’s enquiries—
							The Letter it seems had been addressed to me at Baltimore; the
							Newspapers having announced my visit there, and not my return— The
							Letter was read to me from the Book, and a copy of it was sent to me in
							the course of the day: with the printed Report, made by <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef>, from the Committee of
							Foreign Relations, on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of March last
							on the petition of <persRef ref="parke-william">William C.
								Parke</persRef>, which was not acted upon by the House. Parke is the
							Son of the <persRef ref="parke-matthew">Captain of Marines
								Parke</persRef> of the Frigate Alliance— On my walk round the
							Capitol I called twice at the Office of the Franklin Insurance Company,
							but there was no one there— <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> spent the
							Evening here with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>— I went to the
							May-Ball given by the French dancing master <persRef ref="labbe-fc"
								>Monsieur L’Abbé</persRef>, to exhibit his pupils. <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> went also, with <persRef ref="buchanan-robert"
								>Robert M. Buchanan</persRef>, who returned this afternoon from his
							visit to Annapolis— It was at <persRef ref="carusi-samuel"
								>Carusi’s</persRef> Salloon— The number of pupils, boys and girls is
							near one hundred children from five or six to twenty years old— The
							exhibition was lively and pleasant, and Mary’s <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">two children</persRef>, were
							among the most distinguished of the little dancers— The Queen <hi
								rend="italic">of</hi>
							<pb n="270" type="ms"/>of May, was a <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>
							of <persRef ref="wainwright-robert">Major Wainwright</persRef>, about 15
							years of age. The Hall was crowded with company, not many of whom were
							known to me The Secretary of the Treasury Woodbury and his family were
							there, and I had some conversation with him— Also with <persRef
								ref="king-charles2">C. B. King</persRef> the Painter and with
								<persRef ref="agg-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Agg</persRef>, who urged me with no small importunity to write a History
							of the United States, or of my own Times.— I fear I have lost and am
							losing the time to accomplish this— While I remain in Congress more than
							half the year is totally absorbed in performing the duties of my
							Station—and while at Quincy, my mode of life occasions of an enormous
							waste of time— If I cannot change it, the possibility of completing even
							a tolerable Memoir of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>
							life will be lost— We came home about 11. O’Clock, and Robert Buchanan
							and <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas Frye</persRef> came with us to
							pass the night here— I met this morning <persRef ref="lincoln-heman"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heman Lincoln</persRef> of
							Massachusetts also is transiently in the City— He told me that <persRef
								ref="tappan-arthur">Arthur Tappan</persRef> of New-York had failed—
							For the last two Months there have been a succession of enormous
							failures in New-Orleans and New-York, extending to Philadelphia, Boston,
							and partially to other cities— The blowing up has been the most
							extensive in New-York—where after various other abortive expedients a
							great whig meeting was held and a Committee of fifty persons appointed
							to come to Washington to remonstrate with him against the
							Administration— And to demand 1. that he should rescind the Treasury
							circular forbidding the Western Land-Offices to receive any thing but
							gold and silver in payment for the Public Lands 2. That he would order a
							suspension of the collection of the custom-house bonds, till next
							January 3. that he would convoke Congress at an early day. A
							sub-committee of fifteen members are said to have been here yesterday
							and this day. At their first interview with <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef>, he required
							that whatever proposition they had to offer should be made in writing—
							This was accordingly done, and the general rumour is that the answer was
							negative upon all the demands.</p>

							been delivered to me by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Herkimer, when I
							was Secretary of State— <persRef ref="dayton-aaron">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dayton</persRef> Chief Clerk of the
							Department of State informs me that after strict examination no trace of
							the Papers or of any thing relating to them can be found either upon the
							files or the Records of the Department. This I communicated to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Herkimer; but the Letter from Gros to him
							refers to a letter which he says he wrote to me when I was President
							making enquiries, about <pb n="271" type="ms"/>the Papers, and which
							remained unanswered— I now examined my files of Letters received when I
							was President; and after emptying and overhauling nearly one whole chest
							full, I found the Letter from H. Gros, endorsed by <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">my Son John</persRef> “with out date; received 2.
								Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1826.” and pencil-marked by me D.
							B. meaning <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Daniel Brent</persRef>, to whom
							it was doubtless referred at the time to make the examination at the
							Department. This Letter names the Winter of 1824 as the time when M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Herkimer put the papers into my hands— I
							suspended the conclusion of my answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Herkimer, and took Gros’s new discovered Letter, together with the other
							two, to the Department of State, where I saw <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef> the Secretary,
							and left the three Letters with him requesting a further examination of
							the files and records; and particularly of the Instructions to <persRef
								ref="brown-james">James Brown</persRef> who was the Minister in
							France, in 1824. and to <persRef ref="sheldon-daniel">Daniel
								Sheldon</persRef>, who was about that time the Chargé
							d’Affaires—both since dead— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth told
							me that since the expiration of our Treaty of 1822. limited to ten years
							duration, and adjusting the respective pretensions of the two Countries
							on the Northwest Coast of America, one of our merchant vessels has again
							been warned off from a Russian Settlement, and the Russian pretensions
							in that sea have all been revived— He said he had been intending to
							visit me at my house to have a conversation with me on the subject— He
							shewed me the Article of the Treaty which settled the controversy for
							the time, and the despatch from <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton</persRef> with the Protocol
							of his Conferences with the Russian Plenipotentiaries <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-karl">Nesselrode</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Forsyth seems to apprehend that there was some concession on
							the part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton, of which the
							Russian Government might now take some advantage; but I saw no occasion
							for such apprehension. The Article of the Treaty having expired,
							remitted each of the parties to their respective rights, and
							pretensions; and the Emperor Alexander having fully indemnified after
							the conclusion, of the Treaty, the owners of the vessel which had been
							turned away by virtue of his hundred league ukase, had made the
							effective concession, if there was one to be imputed to either party— I
							walked to the Office of the Franklin Insurance Company—and received the
							half-yearly dividend which was now ten per Cent—reserving still 6 2/3
							per Cent for the next dividend— But <persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley</persRef> told me that the new
							Company at Georgetown would take from the Franklin company one third
							part of their profits.— Walking home I was almost suffocated with heat
							as oppressive as that of the dog-days— <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel;poinsett-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Poinsett</persRef> paid us an
							Evening visit and I abandoned the Evening to idleness.</p>

						<p>I had a Letter this morning from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>, and concluded to take the chance of going home alone
							next week, leaving my family to follow me, if it may be after the first
							of next Month— To assist in effecting which I wrote short Letters to
								<persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Laurie</persRef>, and to <persRef ref="wood-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Wood</persRef> the Treasurer of
							the Columbian College which I left at their respective Offices.— Before
							leaving the City I thought it a decent mark of courtesy to visit
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef> at the President’s house— I went accordingly, and
							was received by him in his Cabinet, alone. <hi rend="italic">I had</hi>
							<pb n="272" type="ms"/>I had not before set my foot, in the house since
							I left it on the evening of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March
							1829— The conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren was
							upon subjects of a general nature, and not at-all upon the public
							affairs of the Country— Upon the inconvenience of a Summer residence in
							this City, and on my custom heretofore when under that necessity of
							bathing and swimming every morning in the Potowmack— Then upon the
							general state of European Politics— He spoke of unfriendly relations
							existing between Great-Britain and Russia, and between Russia and
							Prussia— Of the character of the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-prussia">Crown Prince of Prussia</persRef>,
							as violent, and of his reputation as unpopular— Of dissensions between
							the present king of England, <persRef ref="william">William the 4<hi
									rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="victoria2">Duchess of Kent</persRef>, mother of the <persRef
								ref="victoria">Princess Victoria</persRef>, presumptive heiress to
							the Crown, and coming of age on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							this Month— I mentioned my intention to leave the City next Tuesday, and
							he asked me to remember him respectfully to my Son; and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>— After a call at the Bank of
							the Metropolis I went to the Patent Office, to make enquiries concerning
							a Patent, for <persRef ref="beckwith-ira">Ira L. Beckwith</persRef> of
							Quincy, mentioned in my Son’s Letter, received this morning— <persRef
								ref="ellsworth-henry">The Commissioner of Patents Henry L.
								Ellsworth</persRef> was not at the Office, but <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hand</persRef>, a clerk in the Office
							informed me that the Patent had been despatched to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Beckwith on the 29<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of April. I went to the Capitol, and returned to the
							Library of Congress all the books that I had taken out— The <persRef
								ref="meehan-john">Librarian John S. Meehan</persRef> was absent,
							having been for some weeks confined by indisposition I enquired of the
								<persRef ref="stelle-edward">Assistant Librarian Edward B.

							Librarian from <persRef ref="persico-luigi">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Persico</persRef> immediately before his departure,
							respecting the disposal of my bust executed by him which is yet there—
							He had no knowledge of such Letter, but said he would enquire of the
							Librarian, and if there was such, he would send me a copy of it— At the
							door of the Office of the House of Representatives I met <persRef
								ref="jarvis-leonard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leonard
								Jarvis</persRef>, who told me that he was going this afternoon for
							home, and of whom I took a parting and perhaps final leave— I had met
							him yesterday in the entry of the Department of State, with <persRef
								ref="hall-joseph6">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Hall</persRef>, also a member of the late Congress from Maine, and
							who he says is now here upon some Post-Office contract— In the Clerk’s
							Office I obtained the printed sheets of the Journals of the late House
							of Representatives from the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							February to the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March, and 4 copies
							of the document containing the correspondence of <persRef
								ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> while he was Consul at Lima, and political agent
							in Peru— <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burch</persRef> is still confined to his house, but expected to be
							out again next Monday. They promised to send me the remaining sheets of
							the Journal of the House when printed. My next call was on <persRef
								ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef>, to whom I returned the two Volumes of the
							Federalist belonging to the Washington City Library, which he had
							borrowed for me, and which have the initials of the names of the
							respective authors of each number in <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s</persRef> hand-writing;
							being the copy from which <persRef ref="gideon-jacob">Gideon’s</persRef>
							Edition of 1819. was printed— On my return home I stopped at <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts’s</persRef>
							house, and took up the <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna;adams-mary4">two
								children</persRef>, who had spent the morning there, and brought
							them home. A Northwestern gale this afternoon, again swept the sky and
							chilled the atmosphere, raising clouds of dust, which deterred me from
							the Postmeridian walk— Evening cards.</p>

						<p>I attended Church morning and afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church and heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the services for
							the Sunday after Ascension day— His morning Sermon was from Matthew
							8.26—latter part of the verse— [“]Then he arose, and rebuked the winds
							and the sea; and there was a great calm.” That of the afternoon was from
							Isaiah 11.9. “They shall not hurt nor destroy, in all my holy mountain:
							for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
							cover the sea.” There is so little point in the connection between M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s texts and his Sermons, that
							either of these texts might with equal propriety have been placed at the
							head of either of the discourses— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley
							is a man of excellent Character, and adapted to preach the Gospel more
							effectively by his life than by his eloquence. He gave notice that the
							communion would be administered next Sunday being Whitsunday or the day
							of Pentecost— <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert M.
								Buchanan</persRef> dined with us— <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">her Son Thomas</persRef> were here in the
							afternoon; and <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef>; and <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							spent the Evening with me— He communicated to me the state of Affairs in
							my hands—a subject of as little amusement as of profit— He spoke of
							leasing and repairing houses; of the Columbia flour Mills, and explained
							how these Mills the building of which cost 50000 dollars, were now of no
							value as flour Mills whatever. The main cause is the Baltimore
							Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, which has diverted the course of trade in
							wheat to Baltimore— There is now no market for wheat at Georgetown— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye advised to turn the Mills themselves
							to some other account, for example for paper making—but there is no such
							good fortune for me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye proposed also
							repairs to the amount of 200 dollars upon the house near <persRef
								ref="vanness-john">J. P. Van Ness’s</persRef>, and said enquiry had
							been made of him what I would take for the house which I bought of
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">Daniel Baker</persRef>— I authorised him
							to offer it for 1500 dollars cash. and if that did not suit to ask for
							an offer— I gave him the account I had drawn up in Nov<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1834, against <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Doyne</persRef> which he thought he
							could recover— He said he had a balance of upwards of 100 dollars of
							mine in his hand, which I requested him to pay over to <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> as she might want it—
								<persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Tudor</persRef> had repeatedly sent to request me to call on her
							before my departure for home, which I did this morning after the
							service— I took with me a copy of the document of <persRef
								ref="tudor-william2">her Son William’s</persRef> correspondence
							while he was consul General at Lima, and political agent of this
							Government in Peru. It forms a pamphlet of upwards of 200 pages, and one
							of the most interesting diplomatic correspondences which has ever taken
							place under the Government of the United States— I returned to her also
							the small account Book, which <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart</persRef> had requested me to
							take, and containing charges for travelling expences, which she thought
							should be claimed; but which <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasonton</persRef> the 5<hi
