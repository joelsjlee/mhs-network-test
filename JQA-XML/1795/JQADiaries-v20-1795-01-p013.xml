						<p><date>22. </date>Paid a visit with <persRef ref="bourne-sylvanus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bourne</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> to the Representants du
							peuple françois, and was received with civility. Principally
							complimentary in their fashionable cant, which I adopted in all its
							forms. They told me they received the visit of the <hi rend="italic"
								>citoyen ministre</hi> of a free people, the friend of the <hi
								rend="italic">peuple françois</hi> with much pleasure. That they
							considered it <hi rend="italic">tout à fait</hi> as a <hi rend="italic"
								>visite fraternelle</hi>; I told them that hearing of their arrival,
							I felt myself obliged to present my respects to the citoyens
							Representans of the peuple françois, for whom my fellow-citizens had the
							greatest attachment, and to whom they felt grateful for the obligations
							under which they felt themselves to the french nation, &amp;c. The
							substance of the business was that I demanded safety and protection to
							all american persons and property in this Country: and that they told me
							it would be under the safeguard in common with <hi rend="italic">the</hi> <pb n="20" type="ms"
							/>those of the Country and of other strangers here. That all property
							would invariably be respected, as well as persons and opinions. That if
							hereafter there should be any occasion for exceptions they would make
							the strongest representations to their constituents in behalf of
							americans.</p>
						<p>They spoke of the <persRef ref="washington-george">President</persRef>,
							whom like all Europeans, they called General Washington; enquired his
							age, and on being told, said he might still long enjoy his glory. That
							he was a great man and they had great veneration for his character
							&amp;c. They observed that a Treaty of Commerce had lately been
							concluded, between Great Britain and the United States, by <persRef
								ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jay</persRef>.— They were
							emulous to surpass one another in expressions of inveteracy against
							England. one said She was their most obstinate enemy. Another that she
							was their <hi rend="italic">only</hi> remaining enemy; a third that she
							had always been their enemy, a fourth that she was the Enemy of all the
							maritime powers. They said however that America, not having a navy
							sufficient to protect <pb n="21" type="ms"/>her commerce against
							Britain, and <hi rend="italic">having no possessions of that power near
								them which she could attack by land</hi>, was right in maintaining
							peace. They acquiesced in the observation of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Bourne that this peace was even for the interest of France, because it
							enabled us to supply her with provisions and other necessary articles
							which in case we were at war could not be done.</p>
						<p>They spoke of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Monroe’s</persRef> reception by the national Convention, “<hi
								rend="italic">parbleu</hi> said one it was a <hi rend="italic">scene
								attendrissante</hi>. It was<hi rend="italic">une des plus fameuse
								séances</hi> of the convention. There were more than 10,000 persons
							present. He shed tears, he was so much affected. I saw him cry.” “Ah:
							said another c’etait aussi bien de quoi faire pleurer.” Then they said
							one of the flags had been sent to America.— In short the national
							character appeared in nothing more conspicuous than in the manner in
							which they spoke of this recurrence.</p>
						<p>They enquired if <persRef ref="morris-gouverneur">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Morris</persRef> was in Swizerland. I answered them I did not know.
							That I had no personal acquaintance with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Morris.
							Ah said the Citoyen who appeared to be at the head of the deputation “La
							France, sait parfaitement qu’il est en Suisse.” He spoke with a peculiar
							emphasis, but I did not think <pb n="22" type="ms"/>proper to make any
							further enquiry of him on the subject.</p>
						<p>They asked me if I had ever been in France; I answered that I had. That I
							received part of my education there, and had resided there several
							years: that I had therefore from my infancy every possible reason to
							form sentiments of admiration and of affection for the french Nation.
							Whereupon they replied that the Representants du peuple françois were
							delighted to hear me say so.</p>
						<p>Thus ended the conversation upon which we withdrew.— <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Faesch</persRef> paid me a visit; &amp;
							mentioned some particulars of the <persRef ref="wiliam-v"
								>Stadtholder’s</persRef> quitting the Hague. The circumstance
							appears to affect him.</p>
						<p>We dined together at old <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Scholten’s</persRef>, with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bourne, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Girard</persRef>. <persRef ref="u;u"

							Went in the afternoon with <persRef ref="willink-wilhem">M<hi rend="superscript"

							&amp; went to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							supped. Home late.</p>
						<p>I forgot to observe that as we were going to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Hubbard’s, we saw a Jew, laying in the Street apparently at the point of
							Death. Three or four persons were round him, Christians &amp; Jews, who
							seemed to throw upon each other the burden of giving him any assistance
							whatever. They said he had the falling sickness; but upon a piece of
							bread being held to his mouth, the convulsive manner in which he snapped
							at it, though he had apparently lost his senses, discovered that his
							only falling sickness was hunger. After some altercation whose <hi
								rend="italic">business</hi> it was to relieve him he was carried
							into a neighbouring tavern, and recommended to the care of the woman who
							kept it.</p>

							brigade du génie, who was with us, as was <persRef
								ref="vaneeghen-christiaan">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Van
								Eeghen</persRef>. Both very sensible men. The officer’s name is
								<persRef ref="u">Verrine</persRef>; a man of great simplicity of
							manners. He was a Lieutenant at the beginning of the revolution, and has
							now become a general officer. Has been in the War of the Vendee, in the
							campaigns of <persRef ref="custine-adam">Custine</persRef>, and in the
							last campaign of eighteen months. Neither Custine nor <persRef
								ref="dumouriez-charles">Dumouriez</persRef> he says were great
							Generals, but Custine, was personally brave at least at times.— His
							observations upon many subjects were cool and rational. But his
							discretion was as remarkable as his modesty.— He read us however in
							answer to some questions relating to the actions of the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> &amp; 9<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">ts:</hi>
							some passages in his Journal; and in one instance where he mentioned a
							mistake of the General in Chief he had added “ainsi les rapports du
							General ne sont pas ce qu’il y a de plus sur au monde.” His principal
							attention appears to be towards military subjects. There appeared to be
							no sort of enthusiasm about him.</p>
						<p>Van Eeghen is a member of the new Committee <pb n="28" type="ms"/>of
							finance, and appears tolerably well reconciled to the Revolution, and
							present course of things. Even the established rule of allowing no
							refusal to offices, he thinks was necessary on the present occasion,
							although he was compelled by it reluctantly to engage in public affairs.
							He seems with others to be deeply sensible of the deranged state of
							finances here. The deficiencies must be greater than they expected.</p>
						<p>Hubbard is dissatisfied with every thing but the Committee of finance. He
							has hardly discretion enough in concealing or disguising his sentiments.
								<persRef ref="u">His wife</persRef> is still less so, and said if
							they put her in requisition she would kill herself. Madam said the
							french officer, “your children put you in requisition every day.”— The
							subject of requisitions is terrible. That of Assignats as bad; and the
							Stadhouderien party’s policy, now is to make the greatest outcry
							possible, at the smallest inconvenience <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>possible</hi>. they will before long discover the operation of this
							system; which will assuredly not help them. The quartering of troops was
							the first complaint. But this evil being really light people have
							accustomed themselves to it. At every new measure, the Orangists will
							certainly yell. <pb n="29" type="ms"/>The patriots will in time grow
							angry. They have the power in their hands—and then—</p>
						<p>Upon my observing to the Officer, that their army was under a very good
							discipline—he answered that they were partly so. That offences which
							immediately affected operations against the Enemy were punished with
							sufficient severity. Every act of <hi rend="italic">Pillage</hi>—of <hi
								rend="italic">Drunkenness</hi>,—and of <hi rend="italic"
								>Cowardice</hi> is capital; all upon the same principle; because
							they render the offender <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi> incapable to
							do his duty, and be at all times prepared for action. But the deficiency
							is with respect to minor faults, and the small police of regularity.
							They want cleanliness, exact subordination, attention &amp; economy of
							clothing. The consequence is unfavourable to their health, and occasions
							a prodigious waste— Their shoes—their coats their linen does not last a
							fourth part of the time they ought. The army under proper regulation
							would not cost a tenth part what it has—and of all this the Convention
							takes no notice whatever.</p>
