						<p><date>2 </date>Well this day. Wrote to my friends <persRef

								ref="gardner-james">Gardner</persRef>. Letter from <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> enclosing one from my
							brother <persRef ref="adams-charles">Charles</persRef> at New-York. He
							was married to <persRef ref="adams-sarah">Miss Sally Smith</persRef> on
							the 29<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August. Answered Thomas’s letter in the
							Evening. Long walk again up the bay, this morning. The <persRef ref="u"
								>Captain</persRef> returned from Rotterdam. Says <persRef ref="u"
								>Skinner</persRef> is to come down to-morrow. I told Graham
							yesterday before he went for Rotterdam, that he must consider me as at
							liberty to take passage in any other manner I pleased and as discharged
							from my agreement to go with him; to which he fully assented, and said
							he should be glad if I took another conveyance his accomodations being
							very indifferent. This day on his return, his difficulties with <persRef
								ref="u">Allis</persRef> appear to be suspended if not removed, but
							he has got into others relating to his girl. He has obtained it seems
							the mothers consent for her to go with him. But as she has been in the
							service of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> d’Escury</persRef>
							it seems she cannot part from her without her consent, except upon three
							months notice. d’Escury therefore will give the consent only on
							condition that his baggage shall be returned to him from on board the
							ship, which he had been told before was impossible, because the baggage
							was in the fore-hold, and underneath part of the Cargo. The Captain
							therefore in order to secure the Doll and Helen of his noble thoughts,
							was compelled to promise that he would have the baggage taken out from
							under the cargo and sent on shore: but after making this engagement,
							with his usual regard for his word he endeavoured to get <hi rend="italic">the</hi> <pb n="64"
								type="ms"/>the girl on board the ship privately, before he had
							performed his promise. But d’Escury had foreseen this case and provided
							for it so that the woman was prevented from going. This gave occasion to
							two or three scenes, until the night came on; and none of them went on
							board at all. The wind came round this Evening to the North-east: fair
							as it can blow; but these weighty concerns will yet prevent the ship
							from sailing, and even if she should go, I think I should not sail in
							her. They are suspicious it appears that the vessel is destined for
							England, though she clears out for Hamburg, and Allis has finally let
							out, that the Captain of a brig in the Service of this Republic now
							here, has declared his intention to follow our ship out, and see what
							course she steers. I observed the other day that she was under weigh,
							when the ship was, and came to anchor again as soon as she did.— This
							might be one reason of our present detention here. But why should I who
							have not been accessory to the shadow of a deception be punished in
							common with those who have.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ireland</persRef>, and saw several of
							his manuscripts which he assures have been lately discovered, and are
							original from the hand of Shakespear. They are Deeds, billets, a
							love-letter to <persRef ref="hathaway-anne">Anna Hatherrewaye</persRef>
							with a lock of hair, designs done with a pen; a fair copy of Lear, three
							or four sheets of an Hamlet, and a Tragedy hitherto unknown of Vortigern
							and Rowena. The last we did not see, as unfortunately some company came
							to which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ireland was obliged to attend, and we
							accordingly took our leave. The marks of authenticity born by the

							<persRef ref="chatterton-thomas">Rowley</persRef>, and those of Ossian
							have done. They will be published in the course of a few Weeks, and the
							play Vortigern is to appear upon the Drury Lane Stage. <persRef

						<p>At Drury Lane Theatre again to see Lear, which was followed by the
							Village Lawyer, taken from the french Avocat Patelin. <persRef
								ref="kemble-john">Kemble</persRef> did tolerable justice to the part

									>rs:</hi> Siddons</persRef> could not do otherwise to that of
								<persRef ref="cordelia">Cordelia</persRef>. But in this instance as
							in <hi rend="strikethrough">that of</hi> several others I have found
							that the stage does not support the merit of <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> in the closet. The
							acted play is very different from the printed one. An amour between
								<persRef ref="edgar">Edgar</persRef> the legitimate Son of Gloster,
							and Cordelia is introduced. And the Catastrophe closes with their
							marriage, with the gift of the kingdom to them by <persRef
								ref="kinglear">Lear</persRef>, to whom it is restored for that
							purpose. If this termination be less pathetic than that of the original
							it is more pleasing to those who are fond of poetical retribution. But
							the sentiment of filial affection, the great characteristic of Cordelia,
							is weakened by this mixture, and would be almost effaced by it if the
							Love intrigue were not extremely frigid. M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Siddons makes it completely so, and although this may be considered as a
							proof of her <pb n="69" type="ms"/>judgment, the character designed by
							the Poet evidently suffers from the alteration. The village Lawyer is a

						<p>I sat next to a Gentleman who entertained me with some observations upon

							Tragedy, he told me was acted by <persRef ref="packer-john"
								>Packer</persRef>, one of those who are always called <hi

							political and literary. We had some bread made of 1/3 rice, &amp; 2/3
							wheat, which I could not have distinguished from fine wheat bread; some
							water impregnated with fixed air &amp;c. The Count who wears a blue
							ribband, and who has doubtless made philosophy a means for his
							advancement, told me that he had met with nothing that flattered him
							more, than his having been elected as a member of the American Academy
							of Arts and Sciences. That he had taken it, as a very honourable
							testimony of the liberality of Americans, and that he retained a great
							regard and attachment to that Country. He mentioned his design of
							applying a sum of money, the interest of which is to be made an annual
							premium to <pb n="70" type="ms"/>be given by the American Academy for
							the best paper on the subject of light and heat. He has applied a
							similar sum for the same purpose to the Royal Society of which he is
							also a member.— Sir John M’Pherson and D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Piercy
							made a number of very sensible observations. They both declared their

									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ireland</persRef>, were unquestionably
							genuine, but they both expressed an opinion as to the composition of the
							small papers, and particularly of that called the profession of faith,
							higher than I think they deserve. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Young appeared
							neither more nor less than a thick &amp; thin political partizan, and
							such as might be expected from his last pamphlet. Somewhat dogmatical,
							and impatient of contradiction.— Sir John Sinclair himself was more
							politically reserved. He told me that his labours for the improvement of
							the fleece were in a great measure merged in the more extensive pursuits
							of the board of agriculture, instituted under the authority and
							direction of parliament, by his persevering exertions, his plan was
							indeed he said so extensive that he had not ventured to let it be
							entirely known, but had added the words “and internal improvement” to
							those of board of Agriculture in soliciting the Institution, so that the

							improvement.</p>

						<p><date>24. </date>Called on <persRef ref="edwards-enoch">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Edwards</persRef> by agreement betwen 12 &amp; 1. to go
							with him &amp; visit <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								West</persRef>. He proposed to me, to take the same opportunity to
							visit <persRef ref="morris-gouverneur">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morris</persRef>, at the York Hotel, Covent Garden which we did
							accordingly. This is the first time I ever saw that Gentleman, who
							conversed with as much freedom as from his character I expected. We had
							not been there a quarter of an hour when he asked me whether I was
							accredited to this Court, or was only a Commissioner with full Powers.
							The simple truth is sometimes as well prepared to meet such questions as
							the most artificial refinement. I answered “neither.” He then observed
							that he had not asked the question from an impertinent curiosity, but
							because he meant in case my mission was as had been reported to
							negotiate upon the subject of the Treaty, to offer me any assistance in
							point of information that might be in his power, for which I thanked
							him. You will find I think said he <pb n="71" type="ms"/>the Cabinet
							here well disposed to America.— Do you think so Sir?— Yes; they are so
							now. They hesitate a little upon the dependence they can place on the
							American Government. They see such a display of opposition to it, from
							the antifederal faction there, that they are afraid of losing the
							neutrality of America.— But said I, are they really so much attached to
							our neutrality? would they not prefer to see that opposition which you
							speak of, kept up in all its strength? Do they not wish to have the
							American Government shackled, and harassed, or driven into measures
							which shall exhibit to the world, the wavering, unsteady policy of
							weakness?”— “Not at present. There was a time, just after their capture
							of Toulon when they thought themselves about to carry every thing before
							them; when they were backed by all Europe: then, I suppose they did
							intend to bring on a quarrel with America. They imagined they could
							compass any point they please. But they have found they cannot go
							through with that dragooning system: they have made their arrangements
							upon a plan that comprehends the neutrality of the United States, and
							are anxious that it should be preserved. As to their personal
							dispositions, <persRef ref="george-iii">the king</persRef> himself is
							not, and never will be cordially well inclined towards the Americans;
							because the greater their prosperity may be, the more poignant all his
							feelings of regret will be at his having lost so fine an Estate. The
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince of Wales</persRef>, partakes of the
							same Sentiments. In the Council there is a great division. Among its
							members there are several who were <hi rend="strikethrough">amon</hi>
							the most active and inveterate advisers of the American War. They hate
							us completely. But the others are very differently disposed. <persRef
								ref="pitt-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitt</persRef> indeed is
							not to be depended on. He varies according to circumstances, but
								<persRef ref="grenville-william">Lord Grenville</persRef> is another
							sort of man. Those among the ministers of other Nations who know him
							best, tell me, that [“]he does not indeed always say all that he does
							mean, but that reliance may be placed upon all that he does say.” The
							conversation here took another turn. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Morris by
							his own account must be a very able negotiator, for he gave us to
							understand that while he was our Minister in France, he knew every thing
							that was going forward. It was his business to know it he said, and he
							told us a number of curious anecdotes connected with the History of the
							Revolution in France.— Of the papers he had seen before the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August 1792. handed to him by <persRef
								ref="louis-xvi">the king</persRef>, and which contained the whole
							plan of the insurrection that took place on that day. It was he says
							planned by the Brissotine party at the Jacobins, but they were cowards,
							and would have shrunk back from the Execution, but for <persRef
								ref="westerman-francois">Westermann</persRef>, whom they had
							employed to command their Marseillese. He was the greatest mauvais sujet
							in France, and when he had once got fairly engaged in that business, not
							only refused to retreat, but threatened the others to denounce them if
							they flinched.— And yet says M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Morris those people
							were not ashamed of declaring the king guilty of an insurrection against
							the People on that same 10<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August.— If however
							he had at the Time of his trial, put himself into the hands of the other
							party they would have spared his life. <persRef ref="chabot-francois"
								>Chabot</persRef> himself said so to a person who told it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Morris. They would not have suffered the trial,
							by asserting <pb n="72" type="ms"/>asserting the principle that the
							Convention had no right to try him. But as he committed himself to the
							Brissotines, Chabot said he must die, that being the only way to get at
							them.</p>
						<p>From this account of a first conversation it appears that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Morris is sufficiently communicative, for a man of such
							extraordinary diplomatic penetration. The time of secrecy, as to these
							affairs is indeed past. But this parade of sagacity, these lessons in
							the theory and practice of negotiation so freely given, and so liberally
							tendered, what do they mean?</p>
						<p>We found M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> West, almost laid up with the gout, made
							our visit to him quite short. Doctor Edwards tells me that <persRef
								ref="hichborn-benjamin">Hichborne</persRef> has got himself so
							entirely into the confidence of <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Monroe</persRef>, that he as a friend before
							he came last from France, felt himself bound to give him a caution on
							the subject.— Home, remainder of the day.</p>

							of suspicion, he places no confidence in me, and I have been in error to
							place any in him. If of design, I see no good one that it can answer,
							and there is one very obvious, but so bad, that I will not believe he
							could harbour it and will only keep upon my guard.— The other remarkable
							fact is, that he has made considerable purchases in the french national
							debt, and his interest is enlisted on the side of the present State of
							that Country. Received this Evening a card from <persRef

							requesting me to call at his Office to-morrow, <persRef

								Williams</persRef> of Boston here this morning. Some conversation

								ref="pickering-timothy">Secretary of State</persRef>. Some
							conversation afterwards with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hammond.— He told
							me he wished <persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pinckney</persRef> would go home, and that I might be placed here in
							his stead. Enquired whether I should not like it as well as being at the
							Hague. Answered him that this was a pleasant Country, and that
							personally I thought the residence here would be very agreeable. He
							asked if I had any news from America. Answered none. He said he heard
							the <hi rend="italic">democrats</hi> were quite <hi rend="italic"
								>cock-a-whoop</hi>. Talked very high of impeaching the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President</persRef> &amp;c. <pb n="74"
								type="ms"/>There always will be in all Countries said I, people that
							will talk very high, <hi rend="strikethrough">said I</hi>. You find that
							in this Country, as well as elsewhere. Ay said he the best way is to let
							them talk.— “Your Government seem to think otherwise” I might have said,
							but I preferr’d saying nothing, not chusing to imitate his conduct. He
							suggested that the place of ordinary minister here would be very
							agreeable to me, because it would be succeeding to the station <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> had held. That may do very well
							for you, said I. You may be an aristocrat with propriety. But in my
							Country you know, there is nothing hereditary in public offices.</p>
						<p>This foolish talk of his, is very intelligible. “I do see to the bottom
							of this Justice Shallow,” but he knows not me. If I stay here any time,
							he will learn to be not quite so fond, nor yet quite so impertinent.</p>
						<p>Took tea and pass’d the Evening with <persRef ref="edwards-enoch">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Edwards</persRef>; found there a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Field</persRef> of Philadelphia: a
