							Willink intimated to me that they considered all the responsibility of
							the business to rest upon them. From this determination I endeavoured to
							avert them by urging an attempt to the renewal of the instalment. M<hi

							would not undertake that, without an express order from me in writing,
							to make a sacrifice of ten per cent as a premium for renewal. I answered
							that I should certainly give no such order, and indeed that I could give
							them no orders on the subject. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Willink was going

								Hubbard</persRef> called on me this morning very early intending to
							set out on his voyage to England. Delivered to him all the papers I had
							prepared for him, and he set out. Walk in the wood at noon. When I came
							home, I found a billet from <persRef ref="vanstaphorst-nicolaas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> N. Van Staphorst</persRef> enclosing one from
							Hubbard to him, informing him that he was arrested, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Van Staphorst’s requesting me to go with him to the
							commander of the place, and <hi rend="italic">obtain</hi> his release. I
							could not go to obtain his release from a french military officer, but
							being desirous to take every proper measure in the case, and at least to
							know the cause of his detention, I went immediately to the lodgment of
							Amsterdam, found M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Van Staphorst at dinner, and
							soon after went with him to <persRef ref="delmasdelacoste-antoine"
								>General Delmas</persRef> the present commander, recently
							substituted for <persRef ref="dumonceau-jean">Dumonceau</persRef>. Upon
							enquiring what was the cause of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hubbard’s
							arrest, the General said it was because he was going to England, a thing
							prohibited and therefore suspicious. Because he had a Passport from the
							States General dated but two days ago, and inspected by the
							representative <persRef ref="ramel-dominique">Ramel</persRef>, who had
							been a fortnight in Paris, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Van Staphorst told
							him that it was because their High Mightinesses had received several
							signatures of Ramel, upon blank Passports, for mutual accomodation.
							Delmas said that he knew nothing about that; but the circumstance had
							been so suspicious, and heightened by an attempt to go without having
							presented the Passport for his <hi rend="italic">visa</hi> as was
							necessary, that he had thought his duty obliged him to order the arrest,
							and to send the Papers that had been found on M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Hubbard to the General in Chief of the Northern Army. That he could not
							now undo what was done, and the arrest must continue until he should
							receive his Answer. From thence M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Van Staphorst
							went to the commandant of the police <persRef ref="u">Soder</persRef>,
							in whose custody Hubbard was. I told him that in a case where there was
							a misunderstanding of arrangements agreed on between the french
							Representatives and this Government my interference would obviously be
							improper, and that I must therefore retire. Came home accordingly.— In
							the Evening feeling however very anxious that Hubbard should suffer this
							treatment when employed upon business of the United States, I wrote a
							line to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Van Staphorst again requesting to know
							when I could see him; he desired me in answer to come immediately to the
							Hall where the States General were assembled, and which he could <pb
								n="32" type="ms"/>not quit; he there told me that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Hubbard was at the Heeren Logement, and that a second
							express had been sent to Utrecht upon the business. Called at the Heeren
