						<p><date>14. </date>Walk to Scheveling with <persRef ref="u"
								>Bielfeld</persRef>. I find him still agreeable and entertaining.
							Our conversation was political, literary and critical, without sliding
							as it often does into the bottomless pitt of metaphysics. He told me
							some anecdotes about the second <persRef ref="frederick-william-i">King
								of Prussia</persRef>, the father of the late <persRef
								ref="frederick-ii">Frederic</persRef>. He says that his
							correspondence with the Minister he then had, at the Hague, was never
							upon subjects of State, but consisted simply of commissions for
							purchases. At one time he writes for six pair of worsted stockings; at
							another for a cookmaid, and requires particularly that she should know
							how to stew prunes. He once ordered a Minister who was taking his
							Audience of departure going upon an Embassy to Sweeden, to purchase him
							a pair of leather breeches.— Speaking of the late King Bielfeld has not
							so high an opinion of his character as his reputation in the world would
							inspire.— Of the present <persRef ref="frederick-william-ii"
								>Sovereign</persRef> he says of course but little. His opinion is
							discoverable in his silence. He told me however that the characters and
							representations in the Secret History of <persRef ref="riqueti-honore"
								>Mirabeau</persRef>, are all founded in truth, and accurate to
							admiration. At least as the Court was at that time. What it may be now I
							shall not pretend to say; said he. He says that the people of Prussia
							are extremely quiet. That a riot or insurrection is a thing which never
							enters the imagination of any of them; and he foresees that the
							Government has before it the prospect of a long and uninterrupted
							tranquility. For there are but three sources from which Insurrections
							and Revolutions, generally proceed. They are. Disorder of the public
							Finances. Religious persecution or judicial oppression. Whereas the
							finances in Prussia are in an excellent situation, or at least they have
							been. The present War may have produced some alteration in this
							respect.— All religions are tolerated, and the administration of Justice
							is Excellent. So that we have no reason to fear turbulence and
							rebellion. This theory appears very plausible, but it is always in vain
							to look forward into the History of Nations. The Course of Events is
							always so different from every thing foreseen, that one would think it
							is one of the professional employments of the Fates, to baffle all human
							penetration.</p>

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Brito.— The General informed me of the Peace

							Schubart’s, passed the Evening, and supped. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Levsen</persRef>, beat me at Chess. After
							supper, the conversation became romantic and mystical, owing principally
							to the presence of the ladies, <persRef ref="u">Madam Scholten</persRef>
							&amp; <persRef ref="u">Madam Nederburgh</persRef>, a beautiful young
							woman whose <persRef ref="nederburgh-sebastian">husband</persRef> is in
							the East Indies. It ended in a discussion upon the common place of Love.
							Scholten and <persRef ref="despaen-gerhard">Spaen</persRef> are both
							sensible men, and <hi rend="strikethrough">both have</hi> each of them
							has the opinion so common among men that his genius is universal, and
							extraordinary. Spaen is at the same time amiable in his manners, modest
							and pleasing in his address. Scholten values himself much upon his
							frankness and sincerity; upon his disregard of ceremony, and contempt of
							the little complaisance usual in Society. He sees a merit in indulging
							his own habits and his own feelings, while he prides himself in having
							no respect for those of others. He is jealous, suspicious, timid, vain
							and above all selfish. This last quality though not peculiar to him,
							characterizes him best. A dramatic writer might copy from him a model of
							egoism united with a good understanding. Spaen and he are both authors
							and even Poets; so they both of course dogmatized a little; not without
							warmth as they differed in their opinions. Scholten’s sentiments were
							such as might be expected in the creed of an old woman of the last
							century. The mystical union of souls, the impossibility of a second
							love; a state of pre-existence, a tutelary angel &amp;c &amp;c. Baron
							Schubart also confessed his belief in most of these articles. This
							Gentleman without pretending to so much genius, is very amiable and
							agreeable in Society. Benevolence of heart, is he says the first of all
							qualities in his opinion and I believe his practice agrees with his
							theory.— It was very late, when the company broke up.</p>

								>r:</hi> Scholten.— The next subject of amusement was a number of

							agreed that four bouts rimés should be taken to be filled by each of the
							Gentlemen present, and produced on Monday at Madame Nederburgh’s, when
							the Ladies should pronounce upon the merit of the best.— These
							diversions entertained us till 2 in the morning. This is not one of the
							occasions when “the Heart distrusting asks if this be joy.” There could
							be no room for such a question.</p>
