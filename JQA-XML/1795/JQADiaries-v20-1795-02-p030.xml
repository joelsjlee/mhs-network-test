						<p><date>2. </date>Visit to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Scholten</persRef>. He has a pay-master quartered in his house,
							appears to be quite easy. To <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mersen</persRef>, who is laid up with the Gout. Told me some
							particulars of the <persRef ref="wiliam-v">Stadholder’s</persRef>
							departure. He talk’d with many of the people as he went along; wish’d
							them well; said he always had their happiness at heart &amp;c. The
							<persRef ref="wilhelmina2">princess</persRef> was
							furious. The <persRef ref="frederica-louise">hereditary
								Princess</persRef> resigned to any thing but going to England.
								<persRef ref="frederic">Prince Frederic</persRef> very averse to
							going at-all. Said he had done nothing but his duty. Had served his
							Country, and had committed no faults unless of inexperience which could
							not be criminal. He could not bear to fly like a malefactor, and finally
							submitted only upon the express and positive command of his father:
							These anecdotes whether true or false are characteristic of the several
							reputations. The Stadtholder himself, is well disposed, with a good
							heart &amp; a feeble mind, he is the man of his councils, and not of his
							own energy. The princess detested almost universally. Haughty,
							Domineering, incapable of submitting to misfortune with dignity, when
							she found her power at an end, and no resource for personal safety, but
							inglorious flight, in an open paltry fishing boat, in the extreme
							severity <pb n="32" type="ms"/>of a season almost unexampled, she could
							no longer contain her passions. But broke out in transports of rage,
							until she was totally exhausted, and sunk into a state of sullen apathy.
							The hereditary Princess was beloved. Her youth, beauty, innocence and
							affability of disposition all recommended her to compassion, and the
							interest in her favour is encreased by attributing to her so popular a
							sentiment as an antipathy against England. <persRef
								ref="karlgeorgaugust">Her husband</persRef> seems to have no
							character at all. He is cold reserved and unamiable, without being
							positively hated. Nothing is said of him. Frederic is the favourite, and
							therefore he is supposed to have gone with great reluctance.</p>
						<p>The Representatives of the people sent me word they would see me when I
							pleased. I visited them in the evening to demand a passport for <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> M’Evers</persRef>, and the
							permission to an American Vessel at the Texel entered since the arrival
							of the french here to depart. they promised it should be immediately
							done, demanding however for their justification a claim from me in
							writing, to which I agreed.</p>
						<p>In Conversation, they spoke of <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> in a <pb n="33" type="ms"/>complimentary stile.
							Enquired if I knew <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> &amp;c. I observed I had been more acquainted with
							his Predecessor <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>, who I believed was still remembered in France
							with pleasure.— Yes said the deputy with more pleasure to speak the
							truth than <persRef ref="morris-gouverneur">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Morris</persRef>. They appeared doubtful whether Morris was yet
							employed by the Government of the United States or not. The drift was
							evident, and I told them he was not, to my knowledge or belief.— They
							said M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Morris was in Switzerland, at Basle,
							intriguing; and the soul of councils against France; but his manoeuvres
							were perfectly known, &amp; it was to be hoped they would do no harm. I
							said that if M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Morris, was doing or attempting
							anything ag<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> the interests of France, it was most
							assuredly not by any authority from the United States. That I knew
							perfectly well the disposition of the American councils was very far
							from being unfriendly to the french republic.— He said they were fully
							perswaded of it, and what had happened, sufficiently proved it.</p>
						<p>They were very glad he said to have the ministers of their friends here
							to witness their conduct; and see what was the manner in which the
							french people answer calumny.— It is to be hoped (he added) that it will
							do away some of the impressions produced <pb n="34" type="ms"/>by the
							representations which Messieurs les Emigrés, have been pleased to make
							of us. Calumny is one of the weapons, which have been used against us.
							We hope it will not be more successful than the others. I said the
							weapon would soon lose all its efficacy, by such examples as they had
							shewn here.</p>
						<p>I left them; and soon after my return home M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							M’Evers called on me just arrived from Amsterdam.</p>

							desisted. The simple hint put him in a passion. In short the man is
							impracticable.</p>

							<persRef ref="vonschubart-hermann">Schubart</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="araujo-antonio">Araujo</persRef> the Danish, and Portugueze
							Ministers, neither of whom was at home; then the <persRef
								ref="pichegru-charles">General en chef Pichegru</persRef>; with whom
							I held a conversation of about a quarter of an hour. He turn’d it very
							soon from the subject of his campaign to enquiries upon American
							affairs.— This man is systematic, in retiring from public display, and
							he is the more successful for it. The questions he asked, were
							concerning the late Western Insurrection— Our differences with England—
							The tribes of Savages— The state of our public force— But particularly
							as to our paper currency in the late Revolution; what had been done with
							it, and how it had been funded.— Upon all these subjects I answered him
							as well as was in my power.— He asked whether I thought Great Britain
							sincere in the intention to perform the treaty lately concluded: I said
								<pb n="36" type="ms"/>we hoped she was sincere, as we wish to live
							at Peace with all the world.</p>
						<p>A Man who in three years time rises from the rank of a Serjeant of
							Artillery to that of Commander in chief over an army of an hundred
							thousand men; and in the last capacity performs a campaign, like that of
							Pichegru since last March, deserves particular consideration— His person
							has nothing remarkable. His stature is of the middling size. His person
							well formed; his countenance manly; but not handsome, nor impressive.
							His manners easy and graceful, and his address polite though not the

							too hastily concluded himself to be the pivot upon which the affairs of
							the world were to turn, and neither had the talent to disguise or
							conceal the opinion. Pichegru has learnt wisdom from the example of
							their fate, and covers himself with a mantle of humility</p>

						<p><date>4. </date>Had a visit this morning from a woman, who introduced
							herself by enquiring after <persRef ref="ternant-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> de Ternant</persRef>, who she said had been for many
							years her <hi rend="italic">intimate friend</hi>. Upon being informed
							that I had no personal <pb n="37" type="ms"/>acquaintance with that
							Gentleman, she appeared to be surprised, but took her seat and enquired
							if I could inform her how it would be possible to send him a letter,
							which I thereupon offered to do. She then said she was a Hollander born,
							but from the age of 17. had lived in Paris. Her maiden name was <persRef
								ref="palm-etta">Daelders</persRef>. <persRef ref="palm-ferdinand"
								>Her husband</persRef> a man who had been given her, but a worthless
							character died in the East-Indies; his name was Palm, but she had always
							perferred her other name, and usually was called by both. That she had
							lived twenty-three years in Paris, where she had always been upon the
							most friendly terms with the best of company. By good company she did
							not mean Princes or Dukes or Courtiers who as such were no company at
							all; but such men as <persRef ref="dalembert-jean">D’Alembert</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="diderot-denis">Diderot</persRef> &amp;c. men of genius
							and learning.— That after M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> de Ternant returned in
							1783 from the war in America she contracted an acquaintance with him.
							That a young woman abandoned by a husband for whom she had never any
							regard, might naturally be supposed to have a heart, that in short she
							felt extremely interested in the fate of her poor little Ternant.— That
							when he last went to America, as the King’s Minister, he would have
							carried her with him. But she knew the manners of that Country were
							different from those of France; <pb n="38" type="ms"/>She knew it would
							be thought extraordinary there, to see a woman living with a man who was
							not her husband; and at that time she had no certain news of her
							husbands Death: which she did not receive until she return’d to this
							Country. That at the time when <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles"
								>Dumouriéz</persRef> was for the first time Minister of foreign
							affairs Ternant had been displaced, by <persRef
								ref="bonnecarrere-guillaume">Bonnecarrere</persRef> a clerk in the
							Department, who had substituted himself to take the place. Upon hearing
							the intelligence she had represented the matter to the Minister, &amp;
							Ternant was restored for that time, and continued in his office till
							after the Death of the <persRef ref="louis-xvi">King</persRef>. That she
							had been happy to hear he was still in America and well. She was afraid
							he would imagine that she had been guillotined, and therefore wished to
							write him, and let him know of her being here, and well.— That she was
							no emigrant. She came to this Country in October 1792, with a secret
							commission from the Diplomatic Committee of which <persRef
								ref="brissot-jacques">Brissot</persRef> was a member, to enquire
							here whether this Country would remain neutral, and whether they would
							receive a Minister from France. She shew me her Passport from Paris
							dated October 18. 1792. &amp; signed <persRef ref="lebrun-charles">Le
								Brun</persRef>; A billet from <persRef ref="vanderspiegel-laurens"
								>Van de Spiegel</persRef>, polite enough, but excusing himself that
							his numerous occupations did not <pb n="39" type="ms"/>permit him to see
							her so frequently as he wished. Another billet purporting to be a copy
							without date name or signature, but which referred to the object of her
							commission, and as she said was from the same Van de Spiegel. this was
							probably true. The contents of this billet were:—“that assuredly it was
							the full intention and desire of this Country to remain neutral, and it
							was hoped, that no measures would on the part of France be taken to
							compel an abandonment of this system. That as to the reception of a
							public Minister, from France, upon a point so, important it was thought
							advisable to take no determination without previously consulting the
							only <hi rend="strikethrough">ally</hi> neutral ally of the republic
							which was Great Britain. That in the mean time if it was thought best to
							send here a person without public character, he should be enabled to
							transmit such advices as he should think proper[”]— As soon as I had
							read this billet she said, “Do you think that old woman enough.”
							[“]Here’s a man extremely desirous of preserving neutrality; And yet as
							to the only measure to ensure it, He cannot speak, but he must go and
							take his lesson from England, where it was already decided the other
							way.— So in goes this Country, to a War; and now Van de Spiegel, has
							full leisure for repentance.— But Oh! my Country my Country! I wish I
							could see things like to go on <pb n="40" type="ms"/>any better than
							they have done. I have no great hopes of it. What sort of Revolution is
							this?— They talk of the People— The sovereignty of the people. Here is
							an assembly, that have driven out the States of Holland, and put
							themselves in their place. And all by the Sovereignty of the people,
							while the people dont so much as know their names. The people have acted
							but one part in this affair; that is to submit.— You’ll see strange
							things yet Sir: these people have been so eager to grasp at Office, that
							they have not had time to think of cruelty; but it will come. There will
							be blood shed yet.” We must hope better things Madame.— “Oh! yes hope
							better things, but for my part, I will have nothing to do with it. The
							Men think that Women are incapable of doing any thing.— <persRef
								ref="condorcet-marie">Condorcet</persRef> made a report to the
							Assembly appropriating 42 millions to public education for boys. I was
							sent with a deputation from my section to demand that the same
							advantages should be extended to our sex.— Condorcet had not noticed
							them had not applied a denier to them.— I delivered my address. I have a
							copy of it—you shall see it. But I am sorry I have it not about me now.
							We obtained however what we demanded from the Assembly. It was I that
							obtained an application of public expences for the education of girls as
							well as boys.— I had the rights of <hi rend="italic">Citoyenne
								granted</hi> me in three different <pb n="41" type="ms"/>places
							where I had never been. At <hi rend="italic">Creil</hi> they sent me a
							very solemn deputation, with a medal, which I have here[”]—(and shew me
							the medal.)— [“]For eighteen months I never miss’d a session of the
							Assembly. A great many of the members did not like it. One of them asked
							me once before several <hi rend="strikethrough">member</hi> others what
							good there would be in giving an education to women. <hi
								rend="strikethrough">In order</hi> Why said I, in such cases if a
							woman should have a fool of a husband in such an office for instance as
							you hold, she could direct him how to conduct himself.— judge how they
							laughed at him.— Then says, <persRef ref="barnave-antoine"
								>Barnave</persRef>, Madam you would doubtless have women to compose
							our armies &amp; fight.— No Sir said I, but if your hospitals were full
							of sick and wounded, I would render all the women capable and I would
							make it their duty to tend them. That would not do said the <persRef
								ref="noailles-louis">Vicomte de Noailles</persRef>, for all our
							soldiers would get wounded on purpose to go to the hospital.— So in 1792
							they sent me here upon this commission. I was to have 300 livres a
							month, but I was paid only one month— And after the Brissot party was
							ruined I received nothing. But I have seen the Representans du Peuple
							here. They said they supposed I wanted my money. No said I the first
							thing to consider is la gloire. I demand that the Convention declare in
							the first place, that I have not ceased to <pb n="42" type="ms"/>deserve
							well of the Country.— For I received a commission, and have faithfully
							executed it. The other day when <persRef ref="audibert-achilles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Audibert</persRef> was liberated it was by my
							means. I went to Starrenburg, and told him that he should answer with
							his head, if the french commissary was kept any longer. And he was
							frightened out of his wits.— He said stop, stop Madam he shall be set
							immediately free— The fellow knew not what he was saying.— So he sent
							the orders to open the Prison, and immediately ran off himself.[”]</p>
						<p>She concluded with assuring me that <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Iddeking</persRef>, now President of the States General,
							is her first cousin. That she was acquainted here with all the
							considerable people. That the <persRef ref="eden-william2">English
								Ambassador</persRef> used to say that she monopolized all the
							bourgeois. That the <persRef ref="wiliam-v">Prince</persRef> used to
							called her his Jacobine. But however he always had an high opinion of
							her.—that if I pleased she should be glad to see me at her house; that I
							might depend upon it, I should not commit my reputation by it. That she
							had always preserved the most immaculate reputation, and the invitation
							was not a thing that was common to every body. For instance She did not
							choose to have the Sweedish Minister come to see her. She did not like
							him. But the Prussian Minister, the <persRef ref="u">Comte de
								Keller</persRef>, she used to see with pleasure. [“]They used to
							call him <pb n="43" type="ms"/>a fool[”] said she; [“]because when he
							heard them prating in the way they always do without knowing what they
							say, he would be silent.— It was only because he despised them and their
							foolish prattle, and I have told them so.[”]— After a great deal more
							miscellaneous talk of the same kind this problem of a woman went
							away.</p>
						<p>Pass’d the Evening at <persRef ref="veermansenserf-anna">Madam
								Veerman’s</persRef>. They quarter a lieutenant who was there part of
							the Evening. A proper sans-culotte, ignorant illiterate &amp; very
							ill-bred; or at least as foul-mouth’d as the perroquet Ver-Verd. He
							belongs to Bordeaux, and plainly discovers in his conversation his

						<p><date>6. </date>Visit this forenoon from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Bentinck van Rhoon</persRef>, former Grand Baillif of the Hague,
								<persRef ref="vanderspiegel-laurens">Van de Spiegel</persRef> the
							Pensionary, &amp; three members of the dismiss’d Regency of the Hague,

							Greffier now in England, who went over with the <persRef ref="wiliam-v"
								>Prince</persRef> and have just returned. The two first are
							committed to a public prison. The cause of this arrest is not known.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Scholten answered the enquiry, by whose
							order the pensionary was arrested, that he knew not. He supposed by
							order of the States General. He hoped not however. There was indeed one
							example of a Grand Pensionary arrested by the States, but it was not a
							good one to be quoted as a Precedent. he meant the instance of <persRef
								ref="vanoldenbarnevelt-johan">Barneveld</persRef>, which is not said
							he the period of our History which tells the most to our honour</p>
						<p>There are five boards of Admiralty.— Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Zealand, North
							Holland &amp; Friesland. In reality there are but three of any effect;
							the fourth is almost and the 5<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> merely titular. If
							the ships belonging to Zealand did not escape, with some exertion, and a
							good deal of money, sixteen or seventeen men of war, and several
							frigates might be fitted out before mid-summer. This is what remains of
							a navy, and a maritime power, which in the last century, so obstinately
							disputed the dominion of the Sea, with England.</p>
						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Scholten said he hoped the change would not be
							extended to the name of <hi rend="italic">Their High Mightinesses</hi>,
							because <pb n="45" type="ms"/>as long as the name was retained, any
							changes however essential would create no embarassment with foreign
							powers. In Sweden, in Denmark, the most material alterations had been
							made in their Government &amp; Constitutions, but no difficulty had
							occurred because the names were preserved— But in changing the names the
							facility of making Peace, would be impeded, because a previous question
							of acknowledgment must be decided.— Peace he believed was a thing very
							necessary to this Country. For if we are to go through yet, a war with
							England; the Gentlemen may busy themselves in regulating the <hi
								rend="italic">forms</hi>, but the substance of the Country will be
							gone.</p>
						<p>The motive for this solicitude as to the changing the name of the
							Legislative head of the Union is natural enough, and probably connected
							with other motives than those mentioned. And for the same reasons which
							operate to produce in his mind the wish that the change may not take
							place, those who now have the power in their hands will probably be
							equally anxious to make it. Part of their security consists in making
							the revolution as complete as possible—</p>
						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Scholten &amp; his family are great sufferers by

									>r:</hi> Bielefeld</persRef>. Some company that I did not

						<p>The Haut conseil of which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Scholten is a member is
							he says a monster in the Republic. Their authority is contained in an
							instruction from <persRef ref="william-i">William the first</persRef>.
							They have none from the States-General. The course of judicial causes
							begins in every city before the Schepens, from their decision an appeal
							lies to the Court of Holland and from that Court to the Haut Conseil, in
							causes of more than 600 florins value. There is another step yet in
							their judicial ladder, for after these three removals there may be a <hi
								rend="italic">revision</hi> before the judges of the two Courts and
							6 other persons appointed by <persRef ref="wiliam-v">the Stadholder</persRef> for the particular
							cause.</p>
						<p>The Grand Baillif in their Cities is a superintendant of the police, and
							at the same time performs the functions of a public accuser, but he has
							no authority as a judge. They allow no council to the accused—they have
							not abolished the practice of torture, and indeed their criminal
							jurisprudence is much in need of reforms</p>
						<p>At Amsterdam the principal legislative authority resides in a council or
							assembly composed of the burgomasters, and Old Schepens, not in the
							Vroetschap.</p>
						<p>The best work upon the commerce of the Country is a book in french,
							entitled <hi rend="italic">richesse de la Hollande</hi> by <persRef
								ref="luzac-elie">Elie Luzac</persRef>.</p>
						<p>The Baron de Schubart has nothing characteristic in his manners, but
							complaisance, and apparent goodness of disposition.— Is a great admirer
							of <persRef ref="rousseau-jean">Rousseau</persRef>. Says <persRef
								ref="schubart-jacobe">his Lady</persRef> who is absent, admires him
							still more.— Says he is a believer in the equality of men. And thinks
							that the french revolution will have no ill effect upon the authority of
							kings, who conduct themselves well.</p>
						<p>Baron Bielefeld has to appearance more literature than any other man I
							have met among the diplomatics, except <persRef ref="araujo-antonio">M.
								D’Araujo</persRef>. He has read most of the publications of the
							controversies, which have become so important at the present day. He
							appears also to be no enemy to the principles of equality— But these
							principles have supported themselves so well upon the ground of force,
							that those the most interested against them, no longer venture to oppose
							their progress. <persRef ref="riqueti-honore">Mirabeau</persRef>, says
							Bielefeld wrote but a small part of the works attributed to him; and
							particularly very little of the History of the Prussian. He says he is
							ashamed to acknowledge that the Academy of Berlin, crown’d <persRef

								<persRef ref="constantrebecque-jean">Generals Constant</persRef>,<space/>&amp; <persRef ref="doultrement-ferdinand">Colonel Comte

								<persRef ref="bielefeld-jakob">author</persRef> of “<hi
								rend="italic">political institutions</hi>.”</p>
						<p>Something was said at dinner of the use the french had made of balloons
							during the last Campaign, in discovering the positions of their adverse
							armies. The experiment it seems was made by the army of Sambre et Meuse.
							Pichegru and the other Generals assured us in the strongest terms, that
							it was of no service at all. That no distinct view of positions could be
							discovered, by them, because there could be no stability sufficient <pb
								n="51" type="ms"/>in the station, to look steadily at objects
							through a glass. That if the Country is open, the elevation is not
							necessary; if it is covered, the rays of sight proceeding obliquely
							could not discover a party placed in ambush behind trees. That he had
							therefore never found any service or made any discovery of consequence,
							by going on the top of steeples.— It was observed that the relation of
							the circumstance had at least produced a great effect in public. “Oh!
							yes said Sauviac the effect was infallible in the Gazettes.”— I told him
							I did not hear lately of their using the Telegraph.— “pardonnéz moi”
							said he; &amp; seemed not perfectly pleased with the observation.— The
							reason for this difference of opinion as to the two inventions is plain
							enough. The latter was used only in the armée du Nord, &amp; the other
							was confined to that of Sambre et Meuse.— The esprit de Corps, and the
							contempt for newspaper fame were discernible in the conversation of
							these Officers as much as they were in that of the chef de brigade
								<persRef ref="u">Verrine</persRef>. Sauviac and Elbel conversed
							together principally in Italian, <hi rend="italic">sans se gener</hi>.
							Pichegru was modest, polite, attentive, and apologized for the other’s
							unpoliteness, observing that he was naturally of a petulant character.
							Sauviac upon the whole is the most unfavourable specimen of a french
							republican officer that I have seen. He limps from a wound which he
							received in the service, and which he is far from endeavouring to
							conceal. His first appearance contrasts <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>ver</hi> completely with that of Pichegru. As much as the one is
							modest &amp; unassuming <pb n="52" type="ms"/>so much is the other
							arrogant &amp; censorious. Being seated next him at dinner, as an
							introduction to Conversation, I observed to him that he found colder
							weather here I presumed, than in France. “Yes said he, but we shall not
							complain of the cold. It has been our friend.”— “You have no reason to
							complain of it indeed.”— “Why as we came along with constant success,
							our troops marched on, without perceiving the cold.”— [“]They acted to
							be sure as if they did not perceive it, but it must however have been
							sensibly felt”— “yes &amp; especially by me, a wounded man.” He soon
							enquired whether I belonged to this Country.— Upon being informed I was
							an American, He asked what Sensation the retreat of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef> had produced in the United
							States. I told him a different one upon different persons. That he had
							conducted himself well in America and was therefore beloved. That he was
							generally compassionated there, although we did not think ourselves
							competent judges of the merits of his cause.— I observed that many
							Officers of the present Revolution had been in America.— “There have
							been, said he. But they have all turned out unfortunate. They went to
							America, &amp; there drew the first sentiments of their Liberty; but I
							don’t know how, none of them has succeeded in France.”</p>
						<p>He was asked how many Representatives of the People there were with the
							two armies.— “Sometimes more, sometimes less said he. It is constantly
							varying. It is to be hoped, the principles of the Government do not
							change so often, as they change their Representatives with us. It
							produces inconveniences. The power being unlimited, and possessed <pb
								n="53" type="ms"/>by so many persons, a difference of opinion takes
							place, and affairs suffer. . .[”] He said that <persRef
								ref="barere-bertrand">Barrere</persRef> was one of the most immoral
							men that had appeared upon the theatre of their Revolution; but that he
							possessed such a Protean versatility, as had hitherto carried him
							through amid the shock of all parties. He spoke in similar terms of
								<persRef ref="collotdherbois-jean">Collot d’Herbois</persRef>. . .
							After enquiring of me who the several persons at table were, whom he did
							not know; “this seems to be a diplomatic dinner said he; I am surprized
							that none of the Representatives of the french people are here.”— He
							appeared not to be pleased with Count Löwenhielm’s star, and spoke of it
							to his brother General in Italian; which the Count understood; &amp;
							thereupon the other made him an apology good or bad— From these
							specimens of his breeding may be judg’d his convivial qualities, &amp;
							probably without injustice. Lowenhielm was not satisfied with the title
							of Citoyen, said that every one should be a good citizen at home, but he
							saw no occasion to prefix the title perpetually, to every body’s name.—
							As for his title of Count, he should certainly keep it, and he was very
							sure nobody would ever take it from him.— We withdrew; Bielefeld took a
							seat with us to go home, and was scarcely in the carriage, before he
							exclaimed: “my God! what an Aristocrat Count Lowenhielm is.” “more so
							than any other man I know.” [“]As to the titles of Monsieur or Citoyen,
							it is a thing indifferent in itself, &amp; if any meaning is annexed to
							either when used, the latter appellation is the most rational. But for
							the titles of Duke, Marquis, Count &amp;c if any special privileges are
							annexed <pb n="54" type="ms"/>to them it is an injustice; if none it is
							a vain &amp; empty sound which deserves nothing but contempt.”</p>
						<p>Bielefeld is no less sociable than democratic. Says <persRef ref="u"
								>Kalitcheff</persRef> the Russian Minister who lately went away was
							prodigiously frightened, when the french arrived. They treated him very
							well, however.— “He is now gone; but not esteemed to be a loss to the
							place, for he was universally detested.”— He did not say on what
							account.</p>

						<p><date>17. </date>I had just began upon my usual daily walk, when I met
							the democratic <persRef ref="u">Baron</persRef>, who was upon the same
							plan and we agreed to walk together. The Conversation was principally
							political, but upon the affairs of the day. He told me there was to be a

							agreed accordingly; but in the evening he came and told me, he had been
							misinformed, and the play would not be till next Monday.— He sat with me
							about an hour.—</p>
						<p>The observations which made in the course of the day, worth notice, must
							appear as they were made without order, and in the miscellaneous tone of
							common chat.</p>
						<p>He has been here nearly four years.— <persRef ref="eden-william2">Lord
								Aukland</persRef> was the british Ambassador here when he came.
							Auckland was not much admired notwithstanding his reputation. About two
							year’s ago when the french took Breda, in the time of <persRef
								ref="dumouriez-charles">Dumourier</persRef>, Auckland hearing the
							news of it, and in order to make light of it said—“Well; fortresses are
							made to be taken.”— The late Ambassador <persRef
								ref="fitzherbert-alleyne">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Helen’s</persRef>,
							was better liked, and clever enough.— Both however, governed the
							Country— They were real Proconsuls.— And now, we <pb n="55" type="ms"
							/>we shall have french Proconsuls.— It is in vain for this Country to
							pretend in future to political Independance. They have got used to
							submitting, and would scarcely know how to act for themselves.— The
							french Representatives have demanded that one of them may be present
							when the papers of the late Pensionary <persRef
								ref="vanderspiegel-laurens">Van de Spiegel</persRef>, are examined;
							they view him as one of their most inveterate enemies.— They are very
							much mistaken. Van de Spiegel was extremely desirous of preserving a
							Peace with them. He was very adverse to the war. But he was a weak Man,
							and dared not oppose himself openly to the torrent. About two years ago,
							the political intolerance here was excessive. <persRef
								ref="short-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Short</persRef> then the
							American Minister, when he first arrived was well received, and liked
							pretty well; he pass’d for a pretty good Aristocrat. But He visited
								<persRef ref="demaulde-emmanuel">M. de Maulde</persRef> who was here
							then with a secret Commission from the Executive Council, and ever after
							that Short was shunned &amp; disliked, and branded as a Jacobin. This
							Maulde was avoided like a pestilence. If he ever appeared in public
							companies, scarce any body would speak to him. The Spanish Minister of
							that time, gave a great supper to almost the whole city, and by some
							accident was obliged to invite M. de Maulde. He seemed perfectly alone
							in the midst of the Company; and he was so universally shunned, that
							when supper was served, the seat next to that which he had taken, was
							left empty.— But, said I, this is surprizing, since at that very time,
							the Pensionary and british Ambassador were negotiating with this same
								<pb n="56" type="ms"/>“de Maulde.”— That is true, but it was
							secretly and not avowed. They never confessed it untill Maulde upon
							returning to Paris, published the account of it, &amp; then they could
							no longer deny it.</p>
						<p>This war has not been very favourable to the glory of Sovereigns.— The
								<persRef ref="frederick-william-ii">king of Prussia</persRef>
							reached neither Paris nor Warsaw. The <persRef ref="francis-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> came with great eclat to his army; &amp; returned
							with less to Vienna. The <persRef ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of
								York</persRef>, is returned without many laurels to London. The
								<persRef ref="charleswilliamferdinand">Duke of Brunswick</persRef>,
							publishes fine Manifestos, and afterwards retires. The <persRef
								ref="coburg-francis">Prince Cobourg</persRef> takes the command,
							goes on swimmingly for some time; but finally he resigns too. The young
								<persRef ref="frederic;william-i">Princes of Orange</persRef>,
							resign. The <persRef ref="wiliam-v">father</persRef>; sets out all of a
							sudden to make his coup d’essai; and Nimeguen is taken. To crown the

						<p><date>23. </date>Another visit this morning from <persRef ref="palm-etta"
								>Madam Palm D’aelders</persRef>, who left with me her letter for
								<persRef ref="ternant-jean">M. de Ternant</persRef>, and lent me her
							political works. They consist in two or three addresses to popular
							societies, upon the subject of the rights of women; delivered in the
							year 1791. and full of the kind of trash, fashionable at that day. The
							performances are upon a level with the subject, and contain the usual
							common-place of argument, upon the rights of women and the injustice
							they suffer.— This has been at one period among the whimsies of the
							french Revolution. But it is in vain to labour and toil against the
							prescriptions of Nature. Political subserviency and domestic influence
							must be the lot of women, and those who have departed the most from
							their natural sphere, are not those who have shewn the sex, in their
							most amiable light. But Madam Daelders Palm may yet be serving an
							interest; she is too furiously democratic, not to become suspicious. She
							complains of every thing now going forward; the <persRef
								ref="wilhelmina2">Princess of Orange</persRef> could not be more
							bitter; but her pretext is that the present men and measures are
							aristocratical. She said she had rather <pb n="58" type="ms"/>live at
							Constantinople than at Venice; though she did not like the Turkish
							Government, which allowed one Man, to have five or six wives.— The
							observation that perhaps she would prefer that Government reversed,
							appeared to give her great delight.— N.B. To remark this woman.</p>
						<p>Called on <persRef ref="u">Plaat</persRef> for my book. He protested to
							me, that I should have it to-morrow; and frankly avowed to me he was
							going to be a State printer.— The man has no punctuality, and for
							personal convenience is not worth employing.</p>
