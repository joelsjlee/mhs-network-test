						<p><date>19. </date>Preparing to go for England. Went to present <persRef

							General <persRef ref="kempenaar-ludovicus">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Quarles</persRef>, and to the President
							of the Provincial Assembly <persRef ref="paulus-pieter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Paulus</persRef>. told them I had received orders from
							the Government of the United States to go to <pb n="55" type="ms"
							/>England to transact some particular business. That I expected my
							absence would be short; and that the relative situation of that Country
							and this rendered it proper for me to assure them, that my business
							there is of a nature which cannot in the remotest degree affect the
							friendship and harmony so happily subsisting between this Republic, and
							that of the United States. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Kempenaer appeared
							perfectly satisfied. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Paulus said that they could
							have no possible suspicion of the friendly disposition of the United
							States; who might have business to transact in England, inducing the
							Government to order me there. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Quarles requested
							me to send him a note in writing to him, which he would present to their
							High Mightinesses, as the chargé des Affaires must be recognized by the
							registers of the States General, to authorize him to act if there should
							be occasion. That the request for a Passport which I made, might also be
							mentioned in the Note, whereupon it would be immediately expedited and
							their High Mightinesses would then direct their Agent <persRef
								ref="u">Slicher</persRef> to come and wish me a good
							voyage. That he should advise me likewise, to mention the assurance I
							had given him that the object of my journey is such as cannot affect the
							interests of this Republic unfavourably. He added that it was
							particularly necessary at the present time to adhere to forms, and that
							the States General never deliberated but upon what is in writing. I
							replied that I did not wish their High Mightinesses to deliberate upon
							this Circumstance. I was desirous merely to give them information of the
							orders I had received from the American Government, and of my consequent
							intention to obey them. That upon any ordinary occasion it would have
							been unnecessary for me to add the information of the place of my
							destination, but under the present circumstances I thought it would be
							proper to give it, in order to prevent any erroneous suspicions, which I
							hoped however, would not have arisen. That I had understood the
							presentation of a chargé des Affaires was usually merely verbal, and had
							not therefore given notice of it by a note. But that I was sincerely
							disposed to comply with all the customary forms, and to accommodate
							myself entirely to his wishes on this occasion; I would therefore
							immediately write the note, and send it to him, as I accordingly did. He
							mentioned the instance of the <persRef ref="lowenhielm-fredrik">Count de
								Löwenhielm</persRef>, the Swedish Minister, who recently went away
							on a temporary leave of absence, and had presented <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Reuterswerd</persRef> by a written note.</p>
						<p>Met <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Midleton</persRef>, walking
							in the wood. Conversing with him on the subject of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quarles’s observations, he told me that a simple verbal
							presentation of a Chargé des Affairs had always been customary here, but
							that Count Löwenhielm had written a note to present M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Reutenswerd in consequence of the same formal scruple of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Quarles <hi rend="strikethrough">as</hi>
							that he had made to me.— Called on <persRef ref="u">Bielfeld</persRef>.—
							In the evening saw <persRef ref="dumas-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Dumas</persRef>, and informed him of my proposed voyage. At <persRef
								ref="veermansenserf-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							Passport from the States General was sent for me this Evening.</p>

							Description.</p>
						<p>Visited the french Minister <persRef ref="noel-francois">Plenipotentiary
								Noel</persRef>, at the Palace of the old Court. found him very
							polite and rational. Told him where I was going. He said I should be in
							England at an interesting period, as the Parliament are soon to
							assemble, and from the present aspect of affairs, probably some
							negotiations would be least commenced during the approaching Winter.
							Told him I hoped they would terminate in an early Peace. That I
							understood the french Nation wished for Peace: that the British Nation
							must desire it, and that my Country, although its neutrality had
							procured for it several advantages from the War was also interested in
							the return of Peace, and sincerely wished for it. That our situation
							from various circumstances had been repeatedly very embarassing, and
							constantly dangerous during the contest, and that for our own sakes as
							well as for that of our friends we ardently wished for the restoration
							of tranquility. He said he readily conceived that between the opposite
							interests and claims of France and Britain we must have been frequently
							perplexed, and in danger of being drawn into the War; which might
							perhaps have been the intention of the British Government; but which he
							was happy that we had avoided; for he was persuaded that our neutrality
							had been much more advantageous to France than would have been our
							participation with her in the War. As it is said he, the English have
							intercepted part of the provisions sent from America for us; but far the
							greater part has arrived, and has been of the greatest service to us, as
							that is the principle article we have needed; but had you been at War
							with Britain, that resource must have failed us altogether. I replied
							that the neutral state had the more readily been embraced by us, and the

							freight, and it seems bribed the pilot to carry the vessel down to
							Helvoetsluys, instead of the Briel where the Captain meant to go. But
							Allis not keeping his counsel, the Captain was informed this afternoon
							of the fact, and a Prince upon discovering a conspiracy to hurl him from

							revenge himself the Captain determined therefore to carry us all down in
							a boat five or six miles in the midst of an unpleasant night. As I had
							no concern in the plot, I did not chuse to be included in the

							executed; the interest in the fate of the actors is well kept alive with

								>ele</hi> energetic, and elegant, though sometimes obscure; by
							excess of refinement; the great fault of the latest french as well as

							discovered by the ingenuity of the readers, is carried to such an
							excess, that a man in the present day, must have gone through the whole
							circle of the Sciences, to understand the language of a novel. The moral
							and the action of this book are double; but this defect if it be such is
							abundantly compensated, by the variety and the mutual relief which the
							two stories receive each from the other. The Catastrophe of the
							principal male character is well enough, though a duel is an expedient
							too trite and too easy. But that of the woman, who is represented on the
							whole as the most prominent and most detestable character on the scene,
							is very defective in point of moral effect. Her calamities have no sort
							of connection with her crimes; they are such as must be supposed to have
							happened equally in case she had been entirely innocent. The exception
							to this observation, is too slight to form a defence of the point to
							which the objection is made. Poetical Justice, consists not merely in
							representing the wicked as miserable; but as miserable, because they are
							wicked. To load them therefore with Calamities, to which all men are
							equally liable, cannot produce a good moral effect, because if this is
							supposed to produce any, it will be only an erroneous <hi
								rend="strikethrough">effect</hi> impression. In truth the rain falls
							and the sun shines equally upon the just and the unjust. But it is also
							true that guilt is followed generally by punishment, and that the misery
							inflicted upon Vice, can be just only as it proceeds from it.</p>

						<p><date>27. </date>My complaint against the elements was idle and unjust.
							They might have been ever so indulgent, and I should be no further
							advanced. The vessel got down this day, and at about 3 in the afternoon
							the wind became entirely fair. About the same time received a letter
							from <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> informing me, that
							my fellow travellers will not be ready till this Evening, and have not
							expected to be. Soon after <persRef ref="u">Captain Graham</persRef>
							came in, being in a great hurry to get away, but assuring us that the
							wind was contrary and that we could not sail this afternoon. Several of
							his passengers were unprovided with the proper Passports, and the
							Captain of the Ship of War in the harbour; by whom they were to be
							inspected, declared that he could not <pb n="60" type="ms"/>permit them
							to depart without papers more regular. There were a number of passes
							from the municipality at Amsterdam, which being in Latin the Captain
							could not understand; besides which he did not admit the right of the
							municipality to give such papers. After a deal of chaffering and
							disputing, the only remedy was for the persons whose papers were
							deficient, to go immediately to the Hague and procure them Passports
							there. It was supposed they might go, do their business and return by 3
							o’clock to morrow afternoon. But the fear then was that the vessel would
							go in the morning and leave them. Our Captain declared he could not wait
							an hour in case the wind should be fair in the morning, but after a
							great deal of persuasion, as a special favour consented to <hi
								rend="italic">promise</hi> to wait till 3 o’clock in the afternoon,
							but upon the condition which he actually extorted from them, that they
							should give him a note in writing promising to pay him one hundred
							florins for his complaisance. The gentlemen asked my consent to this
							delay, which I gave the more willingly because I was persuaded that
							there was no intention whatever to go in the morning. <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Allis</persRef> and the Captain appear
							to disagree very much together. But either they really agree, or the
							Captain has a strong check upon Allis, for the consent of the latter to
							stay was not even asked at least publicly, and he did not oppose it. The
							cargo is Allis’s, and he has been here five or six days apparently very
							anxious to get off; what can induce him to submit so tamely to a delay
							which if he be really ready to go, must be so adverse to his interests.
							My brother’s letter gave me the first suspicion that they have been
							jointly practising an imposition upon me, and all the other passengers,
							which every observation I have since made confirms. But I have further
							reason to believe that Allis is under the harrow, and obliged to comply
							with the Captain’s will much against his own, and without daring to take
							even the consolation of complaining. But hitherto I have as to him, only
							suspicions.</p>
						<p>The passengers had not been gone an hour on their journey to the Hague,
							when the Captain declared he should sail early in the morning provided
							the wind should be fair. Not believing it to be his real intention, I
							only concluded that he meant to continue the deception upon me, and
							cared not what my opinion of his regard for his word was, when other
							persons were the objects of his promises.</p>
						<p>If indignation were of any avail in this case, I should indulge it. If by
							quitting this man, I could procure another conveyance without a very
							considerable delay, or if by that delay I should dispose only of my own
							time, I would send immediately for my trunks and leave him. I believe
							the Captain capable of <hi rend="italic">any thing</hi> that he dares,
							and regret having any concern whatever with him. Yet on the whole I
							think the chance of arrival with him, as rather earlier, than it would
							be for me to take another course, and in that consideration, still
							intend to proceed. I have made a point of preserving an appearance of
							tranquility and even of indifference, as to the delays I now meet with,
							but I have taken some pleasure in raising a suspicion, in their minds
							that their tricks to deceive me are detected, and at the same time of
							leaving that suspicion <pb n="61" type="ms"/>in suspense. Allis I
							believe feels it. But the Captain being of rather blunter sensibility
							still thinks me as susceptible to his manoeuvres as ever.— Wrote to my

						<p><date>28. </date>Wind perfectly fair the whole day. In the morning,
								<persRef ref="u">Allis</persRef> and the <persRef ref="u"

							promise to wait had been made in his presence. I observed that I was
							glad of it, as it would appear to me a scandalous transaction to sail
							before three after promising upon valuable consideration to wait till
								<hi rend="strikethrough">after</hi> then.— The Gentlemen arrived
							with their Passports before two, and the wind continued fair. Our
							contrivers were then reduced to a hard shift for a pretext, and it was
							accordingly a very clumsy one. The ship was got under sail, and a boat
							was procured in which Allis and I went on board. He was told before we
							went into the boat that the Pilot was not on board the ship, but
							insisted that he certainly must be, and was at the same time in a great
							hurry to get off, without making any further enquiry for the Pilot. Just
							before we reached the ship, the anchor was dropped, and Allis began to
							lament and exclaim, as much as if it had been unexpected to him. The
							pilot was indeed not on board: it was too late in the afternoon to go
							out; the weather looked dirty, and various other reasons equally
							substantial were given for waiting till to-morrow morning. I had nothing
							to do but to return on shore. The Captain asked Allis to send him a boat
							on board to-morrow morning at seven or eight o’clock. He asked him also
							whether he had got, <hi rend="italic">he knew what?</hi>— Allis said he
							did not know what he meant, but finally said “oh! you mean the Dutch
							money; yes I have it in my desk.” The probability seems that Allis is
							waiting for something, and pays the Captain as well his demurrage, as
							whatever passengers he may lose by it. This is the only thing that I can
							conjecture, which gives a consistency to all the various appearances.
							This is a trial of temper, very different from that of an opposite wind
							mentioned the other day. “I tax not you ye Elements with unkindness.” We
							submit to the opposition of the Seasons, if with reluctance, at least
							without mortification; but to be made the sport of our fellow creatures
							and to see no remedy, to perceive the artifices of fraud, without the
							means to discover its track, or to detect its purpose is humiliating as
							well as vexatious. I am very strongly inclined to extricate myself
							entirely from their hands and to look out for another opportunity to
							perform my voyage. Another of the sweets of sea travelling, is that I
							have got into a public house where English temper and Jewish exaction
							are combined with very bad fare for my entertainment; and in this place
							there is no better house. So that I have at once to deal, with fraud
							insolence, surliness, extortion, and ill nature— Can it be surprizing if
							the effect of all this should be to ruffle somewhat of ones serenity?—
							Yet I still submit without much idle complaint.</p>
						<p>Received letters from <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>
							and answered them. The want of any thing to do, or rather the inability
							of application to any thing important, in this situation lengthens the
							details of my journal, and gives them their character. I have always
							found that in travelling the only object to which I can devote much
							attention, is the end of my journey, and every thing that tends to
							advance or retard that magnifies to an interesting point. Human Nature
							too, and human <pb n="62" type="ms"/>qualities are proper subjects of
							observation in every situation. The knowledge of mankind is principally
							to be collected from the ordinary occurrences of life, and among those
							we meet in our ordinary intercourse.— One of the faculties that appears
							to me the most essential to the formation of an extraordinary character,
							is that of commanding the application of his own mind. It is a talent
							without which there may be genius, judgment, virtue and every thing
							necessary to make valuable or even good and great men, but which is
							sometimes of itself a substitute for all those, and in its effects has
							perhaps a more extensive operation than them all. A man who does not
							possess it may be persuaded that ambition does not become him, and that
							whatever his lot in life may be, <hi rend="italic">fortune</hi> will
