									>r:</hi> Dumas</persRef>. Walk round the town. Have finished the
							reading of <persRef ref="cerisier-antoine">Cerisier’s</persRef> Tableau
							de l’Histoire des Provinces Unies. It gives a general idea, of their
							History, but it is an unfinished work; written in haste and requires
							much labour of the file to give it the perfection of which it is
							susceptible.— The partizan, is also too clearly discernible throughout
							the work.— The factions which necessarily divide a free people have
							always a considerable influence upon their historical relations. Since
							the Revolution which delivered these Provinces from the Spanish Dominion
							in the 16<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Century, the People have always been
							divided into two powerful parties. The one adhering to the House of
							Orange, and the other consisting of its opposers. To promote and
							strengthen and increase the power of that family has invariably been the
							real object of the former; to thwart, and weaken, and even destroy it
							has been as constantly that of the other. The pretexts with which they
							have at different times endeavoured to colour their encroachments upon
							each other, have been various; sometimes religious and sometimes
							political. Each of the factions has endeavoured to support itself by the
							assistance of foreign connections. And ever since the marriage of
								<persRef ref="william-orange">William the second</persRef>, with a
								<persRef ref="mary-orange">Daughter</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="charles-i">Charles the first</persRef> of England, the House of
							Orange has derived its external support, principally from the Alliance
							of Great Britain. The attention of the other party has therefore
							necessarily been turned to the rival power of France, And from the days
							of <persRef ref="dewitt-john">John De Witt</persRef> to the present the
								<hi rend="italic">Republicans</hi> have always attached themselves
							to that Country.— Cerisier was a frenchman born, and an ardent
							republican in principle. The heroes of his History therefore are
								<persRef ref="vanoldenbarnevelt-johan">Barneveld</persRef>, The
								<persRef ref="dewitt-cornelius">De Witts</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="deruyter-michiel">De Ruyter</persRef>, and all the chiefs who
							have been the most distinguished antagonists of the Stadholders; while
							at the same time, though he values himself much upon his impartiality,
							he appears to pay a reluctant tribute to the merits of the Princes, and
							to display with a peculiar satisfaction their manifold faults, their
							vices and their crimes.</p>
						<p>Barneveld and the De Witts, were undoubtedly the martyrs of Liberty, and
							the victims of despotism. Yet even at this day, the Orange faction do
							not render justice to their <pb n="4" type="ms"/>memory, and it is not
							two months since I heard a Dutchman of understanding, versed in the
							History of his Country, affirm that the Judgment of Barneveld, to be
							sure was not perfectly reconcileable to the forms of Justice, but that
							he really deserved his fate. Such is the creed of courtiers.</p>

							prohibiting the exportation of Specie. Upon the detention of American
							Vessels in the Ports. Upon the permission to import grain &amp; flour
							free from duty. He gave me, not he said as President to the American
							Minister, but in his private capacity to me in mine, a copy of the new
							publication representing the State in which the finances of the Country
							were found. Desirous as they are that a line of strong discrimination
							should appear between the system now pursued and that of the Government
							they have abolished, they are determined to make both as public as
							possible, and then shall be perfectly willing to abide by an impartial
							decision.— With respect to the Vessels detained, he recommended to me,
							to converse with the french Representative <persRef
								ref="alquier-charles">Alquier</persRef>, the only one now remaining
							here.</p>
						<p>I wrote a card accordingly to him requesting to know when I could see
							him. he appointed half past two, at which hour I went, and found him
							with a company apparently of french officers. He told them on my
							entering that he had some business with the American Minister, and
							requested them to withdraw which they did. He said there would be no
							difficulty whatever with respect to the two Vessels, and if I would put
							in writing my demand and Proposition he would concert the measures to
							give me satisfaction with the Government here. But just at this present
							moment they could not permit the departure of vessels for any foreign
							Ports. “This Country said he is yet a conquest to us; or at least we
							occupy it.” But in a few days the intercourse with other countries will
							be as free as ever.</p>
						<p>I made my demand and proposal in writing, and sent it to him in the

							called and requested me to forward to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi

								<persRef ref="u">Geuthryer</persRef> came to see me this morning,
							having already been here several times. He calls himself a Baron; says
							he was a member of the equestrian order in the States of Flanders, and
							from his <pb n="5" type="ms"/>conversation must be very wealthy. He
							proposes returning to Brussels, his home the latter end of this week. He
							brought with him a certificate signed by <persRef

							similar certificate, or at least a Recommendation that he supposed might
							be serviceable to him on his return home.</p>
						<p>I told him, that I had no doubt but that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> de
							Schubart had certified nothing but what is perfectly conformable to
							Truth. That I was fully perswaded however that a similar certificate
							from me or a recommendation, would be of no possible service or utility
							to him, and that I hoped and believed he would have no occasion for any
							such paper. But that a declaration which M. de Schubart could make with
							perfect propriety, as containing only facts within his knowledge, could
							not with equal propriety be made by me to whom those facts were not
							known. And as to a recommendation, it would only expose me to
							animadversion as assuming a right to which in his case I am certainly
							not entitled.— After urging me more than was necessary, finding that I
							persisted in declining, and in repeating the assurance of my regret,
							that I could not give him the assistance which he required, he took his
							leave, evidently piqued at my refusal—</p>
						<p>The request was unreasonable: to give a certificate that I knew him, his
							wife and Sister, their conduct and how long they have resided here;
							while in reality, I know not a person or circumstance of the whole,
							except the man himself; and know him only from his having been to see me
							several times without any introduction other than his own.</p>

							never been molested <pb n="7" type="ms"/>and between these

							civility and good humour was observed on this occasion. d’Araujo
							evidently was desirous of getting acquainted, with the frenchmen, of

							negotiation for Peace between his Country &amp; Spain with France:
							perhaps he only means to observe as accurately as possible, and for that

							was solicitous upon the point was evident; for though he was seated at
							some distance from the Representative Alquier at the table, he carried
							on a conversation during the whole dinner time with him which drew the
							attention of the whole company. It was entirely upon subjects of Science
							and the arts. There was a kind of armed neutrality in the complexion of

							they acquiesced fully in the observation; but it appeared to me one of
							the things to be avoided, where the object is to please. He attacked the
							relations of the french traveller <persRef ref="levaillant-francois"
								>Vaillant</persRef> and ridiculed them, as extravagantly false and
							absurd. Alquier defended them, but with perfect good humour.— He
							observed in the course of the conversation that they have still two
							eminent chemists in the Convention, <persRef ref="fourcroy-antoine"
								>Fourcroy</persRef>, and <persRef ref="guyton-louis">Guiton de
								Morveaux</persRef>.— He mentioned also that they had packed up a
							great number of the objects of curiosity in the ci-devant cabinet of the
								<persRef ref="wiliam-v">Stadholder</persRef>, to send to France.</p>
						<p>During the relaxation of attention that I could afford from this
							conversation, I carried on a particular one, with young Dedem, who has
							been nine or ten years with his father at Constantinople. During that
							period he travelled in Greece and in Egypt. But he was very young, and I
							know from experience to how little advantage a man travels at such an
							age. He gave me a number of details relative to the learning the manners
							the Genius and character of the Turks, and relative to his travels into
							Greece; but I think I collected little or no new information from him.
							His sphere of observation is not very extensive.</p>
						<p>I had before dinner a little conversation with his father the Minister.
							He was formerly much acquainted with <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, and one of the Deputies in the States General who
							signed the Treaty with him. He enquired particularly with regard to him.
							He <pb n="8" type="ms"/>told me that soon after the period of my
							father’s being here, he was sent to Constantinople. That about a year
							ago he obtained leave of absence upon a visit home, and just at this
							time it happens the Revolution has taken place, at which he was much
							rejoyced. Upon the observation that his case was singular, to have
							remained in Office during all the mutations that have taken place; he
							said that after the Revolution of 1787. the Court party had determined
							to involve him in the common dismission of all the patriots in Office.
							But that the expence of the Turkish Embassy is in a great measure
							supported by the council of commerce, which consisted principally of
							Amsterdam members: that they had a meeting at the time in question, and
							were unanimous for having him continued in office. That it was owing
							solely and entirely to their influence that he was not recalled. The
							Court however he adds, never forgave him his ancient and inveterate
							patriotism, and since his return, he always found himself observed,
							shunned, suspected there, as well as in the States General. That
							whenever he appeared in the Assembly nothing was transacted, while he
							was <hi rend="strikethrough">abs</hi> present, and he has often seen his
							colleagues from his own Province whispering very busily together; but
							upon his enquiring whether they were talking upon business, they
							invariably told him no; and he often put an end to their conversations
							merely by going towards them.</p>
						<p>He is now the only member of the States General under the old Government,
							who continues to be so still, notwithstanding his being a nobleman,
							which at this day is a heavy objection against him. He has escaped
							untouched during both the Revolutions.</p>
						<p>Were it not that a judgment upon the character of a man, after seeing him
							only once, would be rash and presumptuous, I should be led to suspect
							that there is a reason distinct, from those of superior merit or good
							fortune, which might contribute to make him thus a singular exception to
							the total alteration of two opposite Revolutions.</p>
						<p>That reason would be derived from his personal reputation, perhaps
							amiable, and irreproachable; and not such as to make him an object of
							fear, to either party. But I presume the Dutch Embassy at
							Constantinople, is as insignificant in the System of their policy, as
							the American legation at the Hague is in that of the United States.</p>
						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lestevenon who was formerly Minister from hence
							in Sweeden, and did not enjoy the same exemption with the other
							Gentleman, appears to be a more <hi rend="italic">expressive</hi>
							character. He was one of <persRef ref="eustace-john">Eustace’s</persRef>
							friends here, and I enquired whether he had returned to this country, or
							probably would. He said no. The General had written him a fortnight or
							three weeks since that he was coming back: but he did not think he
							would.</p>
						<p><pb n="9" type="ms"/>“The General (added he) is an ingenious sensible,
							clever man: and you rendered him a great service at Amsterdam.” [“]By no
							means, said I; I had no opportunity to render him any service.”</p>
						<p>Queries for future solution— Did Eustace get employed by these People, by
							his talent at meddling, intriguing, and promising, more than he can
							perform?</p>
						<p>Is he contriving to fasten himself upon them for a subsistance, and are
							they determined to get rid of him, finding he has disappointed them?</p>
						<p>Have they discovered that with their new Allies he can do them nothing
							but harm, or do they mean simply to throw him off because they can now
							transact their business by any agent they may like better?</p>
						<p>Did he pretend to Lestevenon that I rendered him any service at
							Amsterdam, and if so what was his motive?</p>
						<p>I had a very few words conversation also with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Quarles the new Greffier, whom I now saw for the first time. There is no
							occasion for a hasty Judgment respecting him, as I shall probably have
							occasion to see him more than once again.</p>
						<p>The Representative Alquier excused himself to me, for not having answered
							my two applications to him, in behalf of our commerce. He promised me
							however that I should have an answer to-morrow. He said they had
							declared by an arreté, that all neutral commerce and navigation with
							this country should remain open and without obstruction.</p>
						<p>The Representative Cochon conversed upon the State of Affairs in France.
							He talked very freely, and ventured even to censure some of the
							prevalent habits and opinions. He spoke as they all do at present, with
							contempt of <persRef ref="robespierre-maximilien">Robespierre</persRef>,
							and with horror of his reign, as he called it. Regretted very much the
							Death of <persRef ref="bailly-jean">Bailly</persRef>, who was a good
							man, and a great loss to the Sciences. “I had him said he five weeks,
							concealed in my house, but I should not have said it, six months ago.”
								<persRef ref="condorcet-marie">Condorcet</persRef>, he said was a
							loss to the Sciences, but <hi rend="strikethrough">h</hi>as to his
							morality, he is not much to be regretted on that account. <hi

							was a mauvais sujet, his fate is not to be lamented; but the conspiracy
							for which he perished was a mere trumpery of Robespierre. Cochon was
							then in mission at Valenciennes; in prison; that is at the siege. He
							knew but little about those Events.— They are not fond of talking of
							them to strangers, and it is not surprizing, that they are unwilling to
							uncover their own nakedness.</p>
						<p>Baron Schubart sends a Courier to Copenhagen this week, and offered, to
							convey a packet for me to Hamburg.</p>
						<p><pb n="10" type="ms"/>The Baron de Rehausen told me, he should go to

						<p><date>17. </date>Dined at the <persRef ref="vonschubart-hermann">Baron de

							the <persRef ref="lowenhielm-fredrik">Sweedish Minister’s</persRef> the
							day before yesterday. <persRef ref="richard-joseph">Richard</persRef> a
							new commissioner from the convention has arrived, and was of the
							company; as was also <persRef ref="u">Baron Bielfeld</persRef>.</p>
						<p>Richard maintained the principal part of the conversation; it was
							altogether upon the military operations of their armies; one would have
							thought from his account that they were more than human beings, and he
							himself infinitely superior to all the heroes of antient or modern times
							in the art of War. There was indeed one particular in which he was
							certainly comparable with <persRef ref="hannibal">Hannibal</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="sertorius-quintus">Sertorius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="civilis-julius">Claudius Civilis</persRef>.— Gasconade is a
							part of his policy too. These people seem to think the rest of the world
							created for no other purpose than to admire them. All their heads are
							giddy with their own greatness &amp; power. <persRef
								ref="pichegru-charles">Pichegru</persRef> among the Generals, and
								<persRef ref="cochondelapparent-charles">Cochon</persRef> of the
							Representatives from whatever I have seen of them may be admitted as
							exceptions to this rule. They appear to have the gift of modesty, which
							is not among the shining qualities of the others.</p>
						<p>Richard was prodigiously rapid in his talk; he appeared to be afraid that
							time would fail him to sing the praises of the Army, and in the course
							of his eloquence often gave us to understand with those intimations
							under which Vanity imagines itself sheltered from detection, that he had
							often been the most important character in the Army: the life the
							animating principle which inspired such extraordinary efforts.</p>
						<p>“People think (“said he”) that we would not make Peace; but they are much
							mistaken: we are so far from wishing to continue the War, that there is
							a power of whom we would ask for Peace though we are conquerors: we
							would say, We have taken from you an immense territory, we have reduced
							you to the utmost extremity; we will return it all to you, if you will
							make a peace which shall restore us what was ours; and they would not
							accept our terms.— They think we are exhausted; that we cannot carry on
							the war any longer; that we have no further supply of men. Well we shall
							meet them upon that ground as long as they please. They have said the
							same thing these three years: our first requisition raised 100,000 men;
							the second three; the third eight or nine: and now we can raise as many
							more when we please. Austria, will not be reasonable till she has been
							beaten a little more severely. <persRef ref="decroix-francois"
								>Clairfayt</persRef> must go on in his career, and he has <pb n="11"
								type="ms"/>excellent troops. This War has been fatal, to many
							military Reputations, though that of Clairfayt has not suffered. He has
							been unfortunate, and has not been supported; the generals of both wings
							in the Austrian Army, have been sacrificed to the Jealousy of the
							commander in chief: but we have a great esteem for Clairfayt. However,
							we hope to give a good account of him. They talk about experienced
							Generals; but in our mode of warfare experience is learned in a
							campaign; a General does the duty of a soldier, and is in the midst of
							the action. According to the old fashioned style of war, the General, is
							at three or four leagues from his army; but how can he manoeuvre to any
							advantage at that distance. At the beginning of the last campaign, the
							army of the allies manoeuvred three times to our once; and at the close
							of it, I am sure we manoeuvred five times to their once.” “Our troops
							(he continued) scarcely seem subject to the wants of humanity; they live
							days and even sometimes a week together without food, without clothing,
							and without sleep. We have no tents, no camp bagage. Often after 16 or
							17 hours of battle; worn out, exhausted unable to move our soldiers
							stretch themselves upon the bare ground, without covering, cold or hot,
							moist or dry, and enjoy, the sweetest sleep imaginable. I have found it
							infinitely more delicious than at any other time in bed and under
							cover.” Here he was interrupted by his colleague <persRef
								ref="alquier-charles">Alquier</persRef>, who said he was not of that
							opinion, and a little discussion arose upon the subject between them. It
							did not however detain Richard long; he soon returned to his favourite
							topic, which he scarcely suspended for a moment from the time we sat
							down to dinner, until the company broke up.</p>
						<p>In the mean time <persRef ref="araujo-antonio">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								D’Araujo</persRef>, had fastened again upon Alquier, and had a very
							long particular conversation with him, in which the company in General
							did not participate. After the Representatives were gone, he enquired of
							me whether there is now any American Vessell going to Spain or
							Portugal.— I asked him whether he had learned if Peace is made or making
							between them and France. He said there had been something, done, but it
							was not finished. He certainly wants to bring forward a negotiation, or
							to have the appearance of it.</p>
						<p>The french Representatives affected to give encouragements to <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Midleton</persRef>, the former
							Resident from Poland, as to a new Revolution to restore his Country’s
							Independence: he said the business was too thoroughly done. But they
							told him to keep up his Spirits, and Alquier toasted “success to his
							Hopes.” The toast immediately went all round the table, and was pledged
							by Bielfeld himself. D’Araujo was the only one, who avoided it, and in a
							good humoured manner recommended to Midleton, to communicate the toast
							to <persRef ref="u">M: de Kalitcheff</persRef>, The Russian Minister
							here, who went away, since the french arrived.</p>
						<p><pb n="12" type="ms"/>The Representatives Alquier and Cochon, repeated
							the strongest assurances, that they meant to give every facility to
							neutral Commerce and Navigation. That as it respected the United States,
							this disposition was the result of Sentiment as well as of interest.</p>
						<p>Alquier, apologized for not having sent me the answer he had promised me
							on Sunday and said I should receive it this day; that upon my return
							home, I should undoubtedly find it there. He invited me to dine with
							them, sans ceremonie to morrow.</p>
						<p>At table I enquired of <persRef ref="vandedem-frederik">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Dedem</persRef> the elder, why they thought proper to
							interrupt the communication with England, and whether it was like to be
							restored. He told me, they had the best disposition for it possible,
							here, but I must be sensible the inclinations of the french
							representatives must be consulted, and any alteration must be solicited
							of them.</p>
						<p>“Disguise thyself as thou wilt, Slavery! still thou art a bitter
							draught.” These people french and Dutch, cannot on either side carry
							through their farce of equality of independence or of republicanism. In
							the midst of all the forms which they cast around the real substance of
							things, the respective situations, and the prevalent ideas arising from
							each, break through upon all occasions. On one side politeness has the
							garb of condescension on the other it degenerates into flattery; their
							equality and fraternity are good as a subject of declamation, but there
							is nothing of it in their manners and practice.</p>
						<p>We have left every body quiet here said Alquier “we have disturbed no
							body. Mons<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> the chargé d’Affairs of Prussia can
							bear us witness to that.” and saying this turned to Bielfeld by way of
							appeal to him for the truth of what he said. Bielfeld said that
							certainly <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had every possible reason to be
							content with their treatment of him.”— He remarked this circumstance
							afterwards to me; and said the fact was certainly true. But Alquier’s
							politeness would have suffered no diminution, if he had forborn to
							remind him of it.</p>
						<p>Upon my return home I did not find the answer which Alquier had promised
							me; nor did I receive it this day.</p>

						<p><date>18. </date>Dined with the <persRef
								ref="richard-joseph;cochondelapparent-charles;alquier-charles"
								>french Representatives</persRef>, with a numerous company,
							diplomatic, civil and military. The <persRef ref="richard-elisabeth"
								>wife</persRef> of the Representative Richard, a young and beautiful
							Woman, was the only Lady present. I was seated at table between Richard,
							and the <persRef ref="quarles-william">Greffier Quarles</persRef>.
							Richard told me that he was well acquainted with <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Monroe</persRef>, who was
							much esteemed and respected in Paris. He spoke of the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President</persRef> in the most respectful
							terms, and said he was a great man, and deserving of veneration from All
							Mankind. I told him such was our opinion in America. “And it is the
							general opinion in France too said he. There may be some exceptions
							because great pains have been taken to prejudice minds against him, but
							in general we know from what a perfidious quarter those pains came, and
							therefore they have been in general unsuccessful. We had a minister in
							the United States, Genet, who conducted himself imprudently there, and
							we disavowed all his misconduct— Genet’s intentions I believe were not
							bad; but he fell into <pb n="13" type="ms"/>bad hands upon his arrival
							in America, and was impelled to his offensive conduct, by people of the
							Country, who wanted to produce a discord between your Government and our
							Minister to serve their personal views. The British fomented it, and
							were very glad to see the designs of disturbing the friendship between
							France and the United States. They were at the same time intriguing with
							us, to make us believe the American Government was hostile to France; it
							was the detection of some manoeuvres of this kind, which opened the eyes
							of many people among us, and convinced them, that they had been mistaken
							in supposing your President unfriendly to our cause. I am sorry for
							Genet, because he is a man of talents, and meant well I believe though
							he got led into trouble by bad advisers. We have now sent out <persRef
								ref="adet-pierre">Adet</persRef>, a very able and very excellent
							man; <persRef ref="fauchet-jean">Fauchet</persRef> is a man of
							abilities; but he is a young man, and not equal to an embassy so
							important as that of the United States: we consider it as an Embassy of
							the first importance, and have now sent a man, who by his talents and by
							his manners, will be fully equal to it.</p>
						<p>“Upon mention of the late decree of the Convention, restoring the members
							heretofore outlawed; “yes said he, and I am very glad to hear of it. I
							want to see every thing disappear of that system which for fourteen
							months desolated France. I was so fortunate myself to be absent in
							mission with the armies during almost the whole of that time, and was
							always glad to be absent in those cruel times.”</p>
						<p>He again returned to his favourite topic of the miracles performed by
							their armies; mentioned that under their former Government they had
							troops who fought very well in the War of our Independence; [“]but the
							officers who were then and are now in the service say that the troops do
							infinitely greater wonders now than they did then. <persRef
								ref="pichegru-charles">Pichegru</persRef> himself was to have gone
							to America, during that War; he was embarked at Cadiz; being then an
							Officer of Cavalry; but the expedition was countermanded. Our Armies
							were then fighting for your Liberty, and that gave them an extraordinary
							ardour; but now they fight for their own, and nothing is impossible to
							them. We dont allow ourselves in the campaign more than two or three
							hours sleep in a night; and I remember I once was so totally exhausted,
							that I fell asleep on my horse in the midst of an action.” Such an
							instance of indifference to danger, could not possibly be heard without
							notice and admiration, and to qualify the exalted opinion of his
							courage, with an idea of modesty equally supernatural, he added “it is
							true, I was then exposed to the danger only of the cannon. But upon
							simple marches, I have very often slept three and four hours at a time
							upon my horse, as we went along. At the beginning of the War, it was
							absolutely necessary for the Representatives <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>to</hi> in mission to be the first to <pb n="14" type="ms"/>expose
							themselves to every personal danger and every hardship; because the good
							will of the soldiers to hazard and endure depended very much upon having
							the example set them, by us. But now it is so universal a thing and they
							have been so long used to it, that they go on without minding, and often
							without knowing, whether the Representative is with them or not. Our
							maxim is that whatever an Army is commanded to do, it must do. So if we
							have an Enemy before us, we attack; we fight all day but if we have not
							beat him; we sleep upon the field; as soon as day light appears, we
							attack again, and continue</p>
						<p>fighting in this way until we succeed in our object.”</p>
						<p>This is certainly the true system of War which the french armies have
							pursued: it has been crowned with compleat success, and must necessarily
							be so when it is practiced by brave men, and a powerful superiority of
							numbers, but both these circumstances are requisite to give any utility
							whatever to this art of War. In any other case it must be pernicious and
							destructive.</p>
						<p>We had a band of music playing during the dinner. Richard asked me
							whether there was much taste for music in America. I told him no; that
							American Genius was very much addicted to Painting, and we had produced
							in that Art some of the greatest masters of the Age; but that we had
							neither cultivated nor were attached much to music. That it had always
							appeared to me a singular phenomenon in the national character, and I
							could not account for it otherwise than by supposing it owing to some
							particular construction of our fibres, that we were created without a
							strong devotion to music. “Oh! do not say so, (said he) you will be
							chargeable with high treason, against the character of your Country, for
							such a sentiment, especially if you were to deliver it to an Italian or
							french connoisseur, &amp; virtuoso.” [“]I suppose so said I, but then I
							must rely for my pardon, upon the other tribute which I have paid to my
							country’s Genius in the article of painting.” [“]As for the rest (I
							added) I pretend not to trace the cause of the fact, but Music is not an
							object of enthusiasm in America; and that Marseillaise hymn, that your
							band are now playing, reminds me of a forcible proof of the fact I have
							stated. The Americans fought seven years and more for their Liberty: if
							ever a people had occasion to combine the sensations of Harmony with the
							Spirit of Patriotism, they had it during that time. Yet there never was
							during the whole period, a single song written, nor a single tune
							composed, which electrised every soul, and was resounded by every voice
							like your patriotic songs.” “That is indeed said he a very strong fact.”
							I told him that if I could be permitted to cite myself as an instance, I
							am extremely fond of music, and by dint of great pains have learnt to
							blow very badly the flute. But could never learn to perform upon the
							violin, because I never could acquire the art of putting the instrument
							in tune. That I consoled myself with the idea of being an American and
							therefore not susceptible of great musical powers; though I must do my
							countrymen the justice to say that few of them are so very dull as this.
							That I knew many who had a musical ear, and could tune an instrument
							with little or no instruction at all.</p>
						<p>I know not whether the Representative Richard finally concluded that I
							was guilty <pb n="15" type="ms"/>of debasing the Genius of my Country,
							but the American Character needs no speaking-trumpet of Vanity to
							proclaim its praise. For us the voice of truth and of Justice is enough,
							and on that ground we shall never dread the test of comparison, with any
							Nation upon Earth.— In the midst of this discussion an incident occurred
							which gave a full proof that some of the musical enthusiasm which
							Richard thought so essential an attribute of the dignified human
							character, is among the french the result of fashion, and not of an
							accurate and discerning taste.</p>
						<p>Alquier complained that the music performing was bad, and after sometime
							declared that one of the clarinets was discordant. The director of the
							band was called, and ordered</p>
						<p>to make the harmony more complete. The discord however continued. At
							length Richard assured Alquier that there was none. That the effect only
							proceeded from the loudness of the instrument and its proximity. Alquier
							insisted, and appealed to Madame Richard, who confirmed his judgment.
							The clarinett was pronounced discordant, and the decision as far as I
							could judge was just. On one side or the other, a discerning ear was
							certainly deficient, and both were too much in the ton, not to be
							enthusiastic musicians; for Alquier made a number of grimaces and
							shrugged his shoulders, at every grating sound while Richard in the full
							confidence of delicious enjoyment was positive that there was not a
							discordant sound.</p>
						<p>He returned to the subject of painting; asked me the names of our great
							painters, and whether they were historical painters. I mentioned among
							the others <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Trumbull</persRef>, and his</p>
						<p>design of painting a series to give the History of our War. With his two
							first pictures and the engravings nearly finished of the Deaths of
								<persRef ref="warren-joseph2">Warren</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="montgomery-richard">Montgomery</persRef>.</p>
						<p>He enquired, whether we had any originals of the Greatest masters of the
							Schools. I answered very few. “Ah! parbleu (said he) vous me faites
							venir une idée.” “Yes,” putting his finger to his forehead, as a promise
							of remembrance “yes” said he “I will remember it. I will not forget this
							idea.” He paused a moment and then added. “We will send you some; you
							must form a national Gallery. We will send you a number of very fine
							pictures. We can do it as well as not, for our Government has got an
							immense number of them. How do you think such a present would be
							received?” “No doubt it would be received said I with all the gratitude,
							that would be due to it.” “Well said he it is a good idea; and I will
							not forget it.” I believe my promise of gratitude, is as good as his
							promise of pictures.</p>
						<p>I had also some conversation with the Greffier Quarles. He said he should
							have gone to America had not the late Revolution taken place. Mentioned
							his having been obliged to resign his former office of deputy Greffier
							after the Revolution of 1787. That after that he had retired into the
							Country, and lived as a farmer about five years, untill he was called
							from his obscurity again by the late change of Affairs</p>
						<p>He enquired after <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> whom he
							knew when here. [“]I remember (said he) that <pb n="16" type="ms"/>soon
							after his admission here as American Minister, I saw him one day, and
							asked him how he liked the Country &amp;c. He said he had that day
							remarked a circumstance for which he could not well account. That having
							occasion to present a memorial to the States General he went in the
							morning according to Custom and delivered it to the President. That
							afterwards he had been to visit the <persRef ref="wiliam-v">Prince
								Stadholder</persRef>, and was very much surprized to see the same
							man who in the morning had received him formally, as President then open
							the door to him as the Prince’s valet, otherwise called his
							chamberlain.”</p>
						<p>I told him that it was unquestionably an absurdity under their former
							Government, to see the same day a man acting the double part of head of
							the Legislative body, and of a personal retainer to the executive chief;
							but that probably nothing of this kind would be seen under the new order
							of things, to which he assented.</p>
						<p>He enquired respecting <persRef ref="dumas-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Dumas</persRef>.— I told him I understood he had
							demanded, that a Resolution of the States General, past in the 1788.
							respecting him, and as he thought injurious to his honour, should be
							rescinded. Enquired whether it had been done. He said no. That some sort
							of resolution had been taken; but the former record could not be erased,
							unless I would take some measure in his behalf. That if the Government
							of the United States would interest themselves in his favour, there was
							no doubt every attention would be paid to their representations, and
							appeared desirous that I should embark in the cause. I told him that I
							was not thoroughly informed of the transaction, and if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Dumas desired the interference of the American Government,
							I was persuaded he would solicit it.</p>
						<p>Richard enquired if there were many french emigrants in America. I told
							him very few. “Those emigrants are very dangerous people said he. I hope
							your Government, will keep a watch over them. They have deep designs,
							and may be intriguing when there is no suspicion of them. Though I am
							persuaded said he, that a great many people, have been forced to
							emigrate; who would never have done it from choice, but were driven to
							it by terror. Have you many of the emigrants of the old monarchy. I
							answered that I knew of none. “No said he, that is not the Country in
							which they sought refuge.” There are a few Constitutional emigrants said
							I. “Yes there is <persRef ref="noailles-louis">Noailles</persRef> said
							he. Noailles went to the public Audience of the President with the old
							french uniform, and a white cockade, and announced himself as the
							Vicomte de Noailles, a french Officer. The President told him he knew no
							Vicomte de Noailles, and no french officer in that uniform. Then he
							attempted to get introduced to the private audience of the President,
							but met with an equal repulse there, and the President would not see
							him.” I know not where he got this Story. I make some question of the
							facts; but made no observation to him upon the subject.</p>
						<p>I enquired of him what is at this time the state of cultivation in
							France. [“]Greater than ever it was said he. I have just travelled the
							Country from Paris here. It is every where in an high state of
							cultivation. The grain is already grown two or three <pb n="17"
								type="ms"/>Inches high. All France is in an higher State of
							cultivation than it was before the Revolution; because many hunting
							grounds have been converted into Grain fields. The English traveller
								<persRef ref="young-arthur">Arthur Young</persRef> says, that
							wherever he found a <hi rend="italic">chateau</hi> there he found
							barrenness all round it for some distance; but he would not find it so
							now. Notwithstanding the great armies we have on foot, men are not
							wanting for cultivation, because our population was so great heretofore,
							that five or six men, were taken to do the labour that may be done by
							one. A peasant for instance would have a certain field to labour with
							three or four sons; all laboured partially, because none could labour
							elsewhere. But now the Sons come to the Armies, and the father remains
							behind, and is able to do all the work himself. Our vineyards are
							carried to a greater perfection than they have ever been.” He then
							enquired whether we had vineyards in America. I answered that all
							attempts to introduce them hitherto had failed. He recommended very
							strongly perseverance in the attempt, and said we could easily get
							assistance for the purpose from France. I replied that as long as our
							people could get foreign wines better and cheaper than they could be
							raised among ourselves, we should probably not succeed, in raising them
							at home.— It will be</p>
						<p>well to obtain information on this head, but the tale of <persRef
								ref="williamos-charles">Williamos</persRef> is soon told.</p>
						<p>After we rose from table I had some conversation with one of the
							Officers, and one of the Secretaries, their names were unknown to me.
							Very civil polite people. The Secretary said he believed the English
							were very glad that the slaves had been freed in the french islands.
							that he supposed after this War all the West Indies, would be free and
							independent of any European controul. That by their proximity to a free
							country, they would naturally imbibe the Spirit of freedom. I told him I
							somewhat questioned that. That our intercourse with the West-Indies was
							simply commercial, and we had no political communications with them at
							all. [“]Then the propagating madness has not reached you said he![”]—
							[“]Madness said I? do you venture to call it madness? your Government
							seemed to countenance the System at one period, and even since your
							arrival here, some of your countrymen, have told me you were very soon
							going to London—[”] “Oh! yes said he I hope we shall have the pleasure
							of seeing you there to breakfast; and if you please, we will dine
							together on the same day at Vienna, and take lodgings that night at
							Constantinople. But to be serious I hope you will not attribute to the
							french nation such a wild system as that;” I told him I had always done
							them more Justice; but I was afraid such an <hi rend="italic"
								>opinion</hi> though without foundation would have a tendency to
							protract the War. They were a <hi rend="italic">conquering Nation</hi>;
							and whatever moderation conquerors might have, it was extremely
							difficult to establish an opinion of it. “Ah! said he, if we could but
							conquer our happiness; if we could but become an happy Nation!”</p>
						<p><persRef ref="u">Young Dedem</persRef> exhibited a great number of views
							and figures, drawn by him from the life, in Turkey, Greece and Egypt.
							They were very well drawn, very well coloured, designed with taste, and
							executed with a delicate pencil. <persRef ref="vandedem-frederik">His
								father</persRef> was very proud of them, and through him the
							Representative Alquier paid the young man, many well deserved

							agreeable talent. He was highly gratified with the praise, and it was a
							well earned reward.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="vonschubart-hermann">Baron Schubart</persRef> told me his
							courier to Hamburg would not go till Friday. I took the opportunity to
							mention to the Representative Alquier, my desire for an answer which he
							had promised me. He made all possible apologies for not having sent it
							before; and excused with all the disarming complaisance which is so much
							at their command, his want of punctuality, that I could not possibly
							think of it with any dissatisfaction; it was all repaired, and I was
							promised that my answer should infallibly be sent me by tomorrow 2.
							o’clock, P.M. The only reason why I had not yet received it because the
							Secretaries had been so much engaged, that they had not yet made out the
							copies in all the Registers.</p>
						<p>In my turn I apologized to him for repeating so frequently my

								Petry</persRef> dined with us. This Gentleman I saw in Paris in the
							years 1778 and 1783. He is an Englishman, but has been more or less
							connected with many Americans. He told us among other things several
							anecdotes relative to the famous contest between our former
							Commissioners <persRef ref="deane-silas">Deane</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lee-arthur">Lee</persRef>. In Feb<hi rend="superscript">y:</hi> 1778
							(he says.) very soon after the Treaty between France and the United
							States was concluded, and on the day when the American Commissioners
							were first presented <pb n="19" type="ms"/>at the Court, he went with
							them to Versailles, that on his return he received Letters from England,
							and in one of them his friend says to him “you have been very secret in
							not communicating the treaty lately signed in Paris, while I have seen a
							Letter with intelligence direct from one of the Commissioners which says
							‘last night the new articles of partnership were signed, and whatever
							the old partner may think of them it is still in his power if he pleases
							to come in for a good share.’” This extract Petry then read to Deane,
							who was already recalled home, and was to set out the next day from
							Paris, to sail for America. Deane asked his leave to take a copy of the
							above quotation, which Petry consented to. Deane afterwards, brought
							several charges against the Lee’s, and among others that of having given
							advice in England of that Treaty’s being signed, contrary to the express
							and solemn obligation of all the Commissioners, who had agreed that it
							should not be divulged to any one within forty days afterwards.— The
							fact of divulging, was very positively denied by the Lee’s, and Deane
							not having the authentic document, afterwards wrote to <persRef
								ref="bancroft-edward">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bancroft</persRef> a
							Letter in cypher, but the post-script to which was uncyphered; and was
							thus, “Ask our friend Petry for that Letter which contains the proof of
							Lee’s having written to England that the Treaty was signed, on the day
							when it happened.” [“]This Letter was intercepted, published in the
							American Newspapers, and from them extracted into the English.” When
							they appeared in the latter Petry was in Paris, as was also Arthur Lee;
								<persRef ref="lee-william2">William Lee</persRef> the former
							Alderman of London, was then at Francfort. Arthur Lee, wrote Petry a
							civil and Gentlemanly billet, requesting him to declare positively,
							whether he had ever known of</p>
						<p>any Letter written by him Arthur Lee, which could authorise the assertion
							contained in Deane’s Postscript. Petry answered that from the terms upon
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Arthur Lee, and he had been he should have
							expected M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lee would have made an amicable and
							verbal enquiry, and received his answer in that way. That however he
							would answer him with the utmost candour and frankness, that he had
							every reason to believe the Letter, to which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Deane’s Postscript referred, was not written by him M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Arthur Lee, but by his brother the Alderman. Lee reply’d;
							thank’d Petry for his very civil and polite explanation, but said the
							circumstance as to his brother must have arisen from some mistake, as to
							his certain knowledge, the signature of the Treaty was not known to his
							brother untill six weeks after it took place. The forms in this instance
							says M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Petry were well enough; but the lie was
							unnecessary, and could answer no purpose. But William Lee took the
							matter up in a very different manner. He wrote from Francfort to Petry,
							demanding in the most peremptory manner of him a <pb n="20" type="ms"
							/>positive declaration that what he had said was without foundation, and
							an explicit answer from whom he had the story, or else that he would
							meet Lee, at Valenciennes on a given day, but a short time distant.
							Petry had scarcely time after receiving the Letter to take Post Horses
							and reach Valenciennes on the day assigned. He then wrote to Lee, that
							had his conduct or Letter to him been comformable to the common rules of
							civility among Gentlemen, he would have answered him fully and
							explicitly; but that the tone he had assumed was such as precluded any
							other answer than that he Petry, was at Valenciennes, according to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lee’s invitation and ready to receive his
							commands. He sent this billet to Lee’s lodgings, but not hearing from
							him in return sent again the next morning, and was told that Lee had
							taken Post-Horses and set out on his return to Francfort. And from that
							time (said he) I heard no more from him.</p>
						<p>The truth of the fact was (continues M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Petry) that
							William Lee, wrote the original paragraph which gave occasion to all
							this altercation to <persRef ref="jennings-edmund">Edmund
								Jennings</persRef>, then in London. Jennings shew it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi>     who was the person that wrote the account to
							me.</p>
						<p>This Conversation of Petry is here minuted, as accurately as an attentive
							recollection could take from his own words, because it is a testimony
							from the first hand of a</p>
						<p>circumstance which will be doubtless noticed in the General History of
							America. not a word is added: not a word is diminished. The two
							principals of that contest which became almost national, have lost the
							enmities, and all the personal passions which could actuate either of
							them, in the silence of the grave. As a matter of fact it is now an
							incident to be ascertained, and the declaration of an agent in the
							business deserves particular notice.</p>
						<p>Petry says that every probability indicates that Deane’s Death was
							voluntary and self administered. That he was at Gravesend, on board a
							vessell destined for America, to which he was returning, after having
							been for some time in extreme misery in London, and supported
							principally by <persRef ref="bakerholroyd-john">Lord Sheffield</persRef>
							and his friends. <persRef ref="u">His brother</persRef> in America had
							invited him to return, and had promised him support there; in
							consequence of which he had embarked. He was there found one morning
							dead in his bed.</p>
						<p>The fate of this man, adds one more lessen to human ambition and human
							Vanity. Deane was a Man of talents and ingenuity. At the commencement of
							the American Revolution,</p>
						<p>they raised him to a station of eminence, to an agency of conspicuous
							importance. He was not temperate in his elevation; his conduct was vain,
							imprudent &amp; prodigal. <pb n="21" type="ms"/>The consequence, was a
							recall without further employment. He endeavoured to persuade the
							public, perhaps he persuaded himself, that he had been the victim of a
							party or a faction, without any fault of his own. The public was not
							convinced. He was soured by his misfortune, and naturally saw the
							circumstances of his Country with partial eyes. His passions became
							interested in the ill success of the United States, and his feelings
							betrayed themselves in his Conversations and in his writings. Hence
							those verbal accounts given by him, in France towards the close of our
							War; hence those Letters which he wrote, and which were intercepted and
							published, not without some suspicion of his connivence; hence, in short
							as I believe all that conduct at that particular and critical period,
							which had so many effects similar to what treachery would have produced,
							as convinced many Americans that he was a traitor, and induced so many
							to put him upon a footing with <persRef ref="arnold-benedict"
								>Arnold</persRef>.</p>
						<p>It completed the ruin of his reputation in America, and made him so
							obnoxious, that it is to be presumed he was afraid to return home again.
							He took up his Residence in England therefore, and being poor, and
							irritated more and more against his Country, he furnished materials to
							Lord Sheffield, for the pamphlet which he published, and the great
							object of which was, to prove in Great-Britain, that although they had
							been defeated in the Armed contest, the means of triumph were yet in
							their hands, and to succeed, required only that the war should be made
							entirely commercial, and as such continued, though in a military view
							the Peace was concluded. That Deane furnished the principal materials
							for this pamphlet is not questioned at this day, though he meant it
							should be secret. For after the fact was discovered, he published an
							address to the People of America, in order to defend himself and remove
							some of the detestation of him and his conduct, which at this time had
							become universal in that Country. In this address he denies that he
							wrote the pamphlet published under the name of Lord Sheffield, and
							appears desirous to persuade that nothing in it can be attributed to
							him.— Lord Sheffield was believed, and the British Ministry adopted with
							regard to America, a commercial system, which has led them to the verge
							of another War, but which they still think has been highly prosperous to
							them. Deane was certainly its author, and one would have thought the
							Ministry, would have rewarded him in some form or other. Instead of
							which he was barely supported for years in extreme misery, by Lord
							Sheffield, and most probably despair resulting from the alternative of
							starving in Europe, or of living upon the charity of his friends in
							America, an object of the public hatred and contempt, without having
							even the miserable satisfaction of having his wretchedness veiled by
							obscurity, armed his hands against his own life, and he fell a victim to
							his own weakness, discovering by his life and by his Death, that the
							temperance and fortitude, which respectively adorn the States of human
							Prosperity and adversity, were neither of them allotted to him.</p>

						<p><date>29. </date><persRef ref="u">Bielfeld</persRef> sent me this morning
							a billet inviting me to go with him and take a parting view of the late
								<persRef ref="wiliam-v">Stadholder’s</persRef> library.— He called
							accordingly at 11. We first went to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Euler’s</persRef> the librarian. He is a sort of
							virtuoso, and has number of minute curiosities in his house.</p>
						<p><pb n="23" type="ms"/>Several other gentlemen, and two Ladies were of the
							party. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Euler, as may be supposed is grievously
							afflicted, and indignant, at the fate impending upon his</p>
						<p>charge. The french conquerors who respect all private property, consider
							that of the Governments with which they are at War, as the lawful fruits
							of their victory; and this library is to be removed in a few days to
							Paris. The new Government here, might silently acquiesce in this
							measure, as they cannot prevent it. They might forbear to bestow their
							applause, upon circumstances really humiliating to the Nation.</p>
						<p>The Library consists of about four thousand volumes. It contains most of
							the voluminous compilations with which modern literature and Science
							have been at once burdened and adorned. There are few very magnificent
							editions, and a proportion remarkably small of english books. We saw no
							valuable and only one curious manuscript. It appeared to be a monkish
							collection of legends with a great number of mystical coloured figures.—
							A representation of the late king of Prussia in wax-work, was the only
							curiosity that drew our attention, but it is indifferently executed.</p>
						<p>The weather being fine, I took a walk, with Bielfeld, after seeing the
							library. We rambled in the wood, and conversed upon subjects of
							literature and the arts.</p>
						<p>On my return home I found <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Sonsbeek</persRef>, a deputy to the States General, from the
							province of Zealand: Who enquired whether I could appoint an agent or
							consul for the United States at Middelburg: and if so said there was a
							respectable and wealthy merchant there who would be glad of the
							appointment. I told him, I did not conceive my powers sufficient for the
							purpose. That if any officer of the United States in this Country, has
							such authority it is the Vice-Consul at Amsterdam. That I would write to
							him on the subject and return an answer as soon as I should receive one
							from him. Wrote accordingly this Evening to <persRef
								ref="bourne-sylvanus">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bourne</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>30. </date>Received a letter this morning from <persRef
								ref="wilson-alexander">Alexander Wilson</persRef>. He informs me
							that <persRef ref="moreau-jean">General Moreau</persRef>, after reading
							my letter immediately gave him and his companion a passport authorising
							them to go through any part of the Northern Army without hindrance or
							molestation. They obtained not long since a similar passport as to the
							british Army, from <persRef ref="abercrombie-ralph">General
								Abercrombie</persRef>. These facilities granted at the same period
							by the chiefs of armies contending with the fiercest hostility against
							each other to men whose principles and practice recommend universal
							peace, and reciprocal good-will to all mankind, shew the liberal spirit
							of the age. Why can they not be considered by both parties as incentives
							to the adoption of those pacific dispositions which would establish a
							real fraternity among men? Solitary walk this forenoon, on the road
							towards Delft.</p>
