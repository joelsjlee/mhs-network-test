						<p><date>1. </date>Called on <persRef ref="hammond-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Hammond</persRef> at noon, as by appointment, and had
							considerable conversation with <hi rend="strikethrough">us</hi> him. But
							his tone with me begins already to be different from what it was at
							first. His conversation was still such as if he thought my personal
							feelings or sentiments upon political subjects would have a tendency to
							make me complaisant. Asked if I had heard any thing of the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President’s</persRef> intending to resign?
							Told him no. He said he had heard such was his determination at the
							expiration of his present term, in case there should be no <hi
								rend="italic">troubles</hi> in the Country.— What sort of a soul
							does this man suppose I have?— He talk’d about the Virginians, the
							Southern People, the democrats, but I let him know, that I consider them
							all, in no other light than as Americans. They never shall be considered
							by me in any other light, in treating with foreigners. He spoke again of
								<persRef ref="randolph-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Randolph’s</persRef> resignation. I told him I had seen an account
							from which, if true it appeared clearly that there was nothing like
							bribery in the case. He said that the President, <persRef
								ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wolcott</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="pickering-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pickering</persRef>, and <persRef ref="bradford-william3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradford</persRef> were all fully convinced
							that Randolph was guilty. I replied that not having seen the papers, I
							could not be a competent judge of the facts. That the public officers he
							mentioned, might think there had been improper conduct without believing
							there was any corruption.— He said he had not the smallest doubt but
							Randolph was bribed by the french: and added he had better be quiet on
							that score for if he presumed to deny it, other proof amounting to
							demonstration would be produced. He said he would shew me the next time
							I should see him the intercepted Dispatches of <persRef
								ref="fauchet-jean">Fauchet</persRef>. But he promised me the same
							thing once before, and I question whether he means I shall see them. He
							says they abuse all the federalists very much: particularly <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>. (another address to my
							feelings, fruitless like all the rest.) That they speak highly of
								<persRef ref="mifflin-thomas">Mifflin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="dallas-alexander">Dallas</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="giles-william">Giles</persRef>: of Randolph and <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">Monroe</persRef>. Perhaps said I, this was
							because he thought those persons, not much your friends. “Ah," said he,
							"but they are your enemies, more than they are ours.” No indeed said I,
							they are not in my opinion our enemies. Yes they, hate us said he,
							because they owe us money, and they hate you because you will not let
							them owe you money.”— “Why they do not owe you much money now; that
							matter is in a great measure settled already. the old debts are
							principally discharged, and as to all recent ones, we pay your people to
							admiration. Indeed we are the best customers you have. What an immense
							quantity of your manufactures we take. You swallow up almost all the
							balance of trade in our favour, that we get from every other quarter,
							and your trade with us, supplies you principally with the means of
							supporting your war.”— “But we are the best customers you have too. We
							take more articles of yours than any body else does.”— “Ay! but in no
							porportion to what you sell us, and the balance in your favour is
							prodigious.”— “True, there is a balance to be sure; but as to the old
							debts, you are much mistaken in supposing them small. When that
							Commission comes to sit, you will find they amount to three or four
							millions sterling.”— “Well the Commission will <pb n="76" type="ms"
							/>see, but I have no idea that the amount will be comparable to the sum
							you suggest. This conversation was far from pleasant to him. At least it
							was very different from what he was doubtless disposed that I should
							hold.</p>
						<p>He came at last to a language not less intelligible, but rather more of
							unqualified acid. Well, said he, Congress is to meet next Monday, and if
							they do not pass such laws as will be necessary to give effect to the
							Treaty, <hi rend="italic">we shall be all at sea again</hi>. And I hear
							said he that the <hi rend="italic">antifederalists</hi>, threaten very
							high.— This perpetual allusion to an American party, and affectation of
							an idea, that our sense of injuries from this Country, is <hi
								rend="strikethrough">felt only by</hi> confined to that party alone,
							at length gave me an opportunity to touch another string.— “Why, said I,
							all Governments have their opposition, who find fault with every thing.
							Who has better reason to know that, than you have in this Country? But
							in America you know opposition speaks in a louder voice than any where
							else. Every thing comes out. We have no lurking disaffection, that works
							in secret, and is not seen; nothing that rankles at the heart, while the
							face wears a smile. So that a very trifling opposition naturally makes a
							great shew.— He felt evidently the force of this, and must have meant I
							should know it . . . for he immediately after enquired <hi rend="italic"
								>how I liked</hi> the two bills now pending in Parliament. They are
							matters said I, of internal arrangement, concerning which I have a right
							scarcely to form an opinion, in my present situation. But they <hi
								rend="strikethrough">were</hi> are as objects of speculation,
							measures highly interesting, &amp; therefore have attracted much of my
							attention.— “Well said he as soon as you have been presented at Court, I
							will go and introduce you, and you can then take a place under the
							Galleries, in the house of Commons with the foreign Ministers, and I
							will introduce you too at the house of Lords, where you can stand behind
							the Throne.” “A propos of being presented at Court said I, My <persRef
								ref="grenville-william">Lord Grenville</persRef> has appointed me
							to-morrow at eleven o’clock to call on him here, and I understood from
							him that to-morrow would be the day for my presentation. I have to
							enquire of you the forms of that ceremony, concerning which I am
							ignorant.” “No forms said he in particular. After the Levee you will go
							into the king’s closet. <persRef ref="cottrell-clement">Sir Clement
								Cottrell</persRef> will go before you &amp; Lord Grenville behind
							you, or something like; and then you will deliver your credentials. That
							is all.”— “They are under a flying seal. Should they be delivered
							sealed, or open?”— “Sealed.”— “The style of address to the king?”—
							[“]Sir and your Majesty.”— [“]But did Lord Grenville appoint you
							to-morrow at 11. o’clock. are you sure it was not at one.”— “Yes. it was
							certainly eleven he said.[”]— Well then you had better come in undress,
							at 11. or a quarter after 11 and you can return to dress before the
							levee-time.— N.B. He spoke again of the bills pending in Parliament.
							[“]I like them very well said he. They are necessary to preserve the
							Government, and that is very important to this Country, and to yours <pb
								n="77" type="ms"/>too, for <hi rend="italic">depend upon it, if this
								Government falls, your Government will fall too</hi>.” [“]Oh! said
							I, you joke when you talk of a Government so <hi rend="italic">very
								strong</hi> as your’s falling.[”] [“]No said he, it is not very
							strong; it is weak, too weak; and we must strengthen it. But these
							measures will have that effect.” “Indeed said I, I agree with you that
							the present period is momentous: that it looks gloomy to the whole
							civilized world: but you know there is the point where the two opinions
							part, and while some think that Governments ought to be strengthened,
							others believe they require weakening. Now this is a serious
							question.[”]— “Ah! yes, that indeed said he.[”]— <hi
								rend="strikethrough">I aske</hi> He asked if I had any credential
							for the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>. Told him No.— That
							the object of my appointment is special—merely to transact a particular
							business. That my character here was entirely informal, and the American
							Government had not therefore supposed the credentials to the Queen
							necessary or perhaps proper. And indeed (I added) it will only be during
								<persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pinckney’s</persRef> absence that I have to transact this business
							and he is now expected back in a very few days, as he has already left
							Madrid.— At this moment I fixed my eye specially upon his countenance,
							and saw clearly what I expected. What said he, “<hi rend="italic">has he
								signed the Treaty?</hi>” [“]I know not said I how he has finished
							his business, but he had done, there.” It had its effect. His
							mortification at the news, was clearly perceptible.— It is indeed true,
							that in saying M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pinckney had finished in Spain,
							my tone was such as I believe satisfied Hammond, that the circumstance
							was pleasing to me. But the news was equally displeasing to him. We both
							view it as very important, in two points of light. The prospect of one
							enemy the less for America, and one more for Britain did not escape
							either of us. I then added, that I was glad M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Pinckney was returning; and observed I thought him well disposed towards
							them here, and towards the Peace of the two Nations.— He made no answer
							but mentioned <persRef ref="deas-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Deas</persRef>. I said I believed him well disposed too. That
							nothing I had ever heard him say indicated otherwise. He said that a few
							days before my arrival he (Hammond) had written to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Deas, requesting to see him on business; but that he
							neither came, nor return’d an answer.— But I imagine said he, that he
							did not receive my letter.— I said that must certainly be the case, for
							I was sure M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Deas would not do any thing
							disrespectful to him. Such was the substance of our conversation.— But
							there were two other things he said, that I could not but remark. He
							enquired how I liked my lodgings in the Adelphi, and whether I did not
							find them too noisy.— I said no. He said I had better take lodgings in
							some of the private houses of the neighbourhood.— Does he wish to have
							facilities for keeping spies over me, greater than my present lodgings
							give him, or does he fear I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> change, and by
							advising me to it, think it will deter me from changing?— He likewise
							enquired whether I had been at <pb n="78" type="ms"/><hi rend="italic"
								>Drury Lane</hi> Theatre. told him yes, I was there last Evening. He
							asked whether I did not think it the handsomest play-house I had ever
							seen, and particularly superior to any in Paris. Told him it was
							certainly a very fine house. Well said he, when you write to your father
							you will please to give my compliments to him, and you can tell him that
							our Theatres now are equal to those of France. Oh yes said I, I can tell
							him that <hi rend="italic">in your opinion</hi> they are much
							superior.—</p>
						<p>Hammond is a man of intrigue. His question whether M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Pinckney had signed the Treaty, in Spain, implies at least
							that he knew there was a treaty to sign.— His question on the subject of
							my having been at Drury-Lane, was probably suggested by some previous
							information he had received.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pinckney’s letter
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Deas, received yesterday came by Post. My
							letter to <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef> mentioned my
							having been at Drury Lane. I sent it last Sunday to the New-York
							coffee-house.— Had not Hammond seen them both?</p>
						<p>Past the remainder of the day at home. I forgot to mention that <persRef
								ref="edwards-enoch">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Edwards</persRef>
							breakfasted with me. Had a good deal of conversation with him. He hinted
							to me that <persRef ref="morris-gouverneur">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gouverneur Morris</persRef>, professes an intention to be very
							serviceable, on the business in which I am employed. I said what might
							make him easy on that score. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Morris is certainly
							a person with whom I shall have no communication relative to my mission,
							at least none on my part.</p>

						<p><date>2. </date>While I was with <persRef ref="hammond-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hammond</persRef> yesterday, a card was
							delivered to him from <persRef ref="deas-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Deas</persRef> which he shew me with an expressive
							smile. It proposed that Deas should (this day, I think) introduce
								<persRef ref="bayard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bayard</persRef> to Hammond, and requested to know whether <persRef
								ref="grenville-william">Lord Grenville</persRef> would present him
							(Deas) at the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen’s</persRef> drawing room,
							next week. I had told both Deas and Bayard that Lord Grenville had
							appointed me this day at 11. o’clock to see him at his Office. Bayard
							then (at his house on Sunday) asked me to introduce him to Lord
							Grenville, from which (considering the request as somewhat singular) I
							excused myself, on the true ground that from what Lord Grenville had
							said to me, I expected that he meant the visit of this day, in order to
							present me at the Levee. This morning just after breakfast, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard came in, and told me he was going to call
							on M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hammond, and repeated his request that I
							would introduce him to Lord Grenville. I then told him explicitly that I
							could not do that without first asking that Minister’s consent.— He then
							said that <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jay</persRef>
							would have introduced him, but upon looking into his authority from the
							American Government, he thought it would first be necessary that he
							should write over for a regular commission, and proper papers. Now all
							these said he I have received.— “Have you received a commission said
							I.”?— “No. not indeed a commission (he answered) but the letters from
							the <pb n="79" type="ms"/>Officers of the Government.” I thought a reply
							to this unnecessary. He then repeated what he has already said to me
							several times. That several causes involving very important points would
							come immediately before the Lords Commissioners of appeals, and that he
							wished the Ministry here might know the sense of the American Government
							upon those points, and particularly that they had received the
							intelligence of the decision last Summer in the case of the Betsey,
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Furlong</persRef>, with <hi rend="italic"
								>disappointment</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chagrin</hi>, the very
							words used he said in the <persRef ref="pickering-timothy">Secretary of
								State’s</persRef> Letter to him on the subject. I told him that at
							his desire, I would introduce the subject in conversation with Lord
							Grenville, if I could with any propriety; but if I did, it must be in an
							indirect manner, for I had no instructions whatever to warrant me in
							doing it, and any ministerial insinuation hinting at the interference of
							Government in judicial causes, was an extremely delicate point. [“]Why
							said he, they say here that the Government does influence the Courts of
							Admiralty, and they pretend that it is just and politic, that in cases
							where <hi rend="italic">national</hi> questions are to be determined,
							the Government <hi rend="italic">should</hi> influence the decisions
							according to circumstances.” “I know not said I who says that, but in
							the printed report, upon the subject of their difference with the late
								<persRef ref="frederick-ii">king of Prussia</persRef>, on the
							occasion when he seized the Silesia loan, such an influence is expressly
							disclaimed from the highest authority, and that dispute was of exactly
							the same nature with ours at present, and refers to the same sort of
							Courts.[”]</p>
						<p>It appears to me that Bayard means to throw upon my shoulders the odium
							in America, that will arise from decisions in the Court of appeals here,
							contrary to our wishes. He will perhaps succeed. But I must confine
							myself to the performance of my duty, and be prepared for any thing that
							may result from it.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="romayne-nicholas">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Romayne</persRef>
							came and invited me to dine with him this day. <persRef
								ref="copley-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Copley</persRef> called,
							and I had some interesting conversation with him. But interesting matter
							crowds upon me with such accumulation, that I must limit my details to
							business relating to my mission. He too enquired my opinion of the bills
							pending in Parliament. I told him that situated as I was I could only
							say that if <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a remedy be necessary, the wound
							must be very deep indeed.</p>
						<p>Went to Lord Grenville’s office, between 11. and 12. He was not there,
							nor had been there this morning. At the same instant when I arrived
							there, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Deas and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard,
							alighted on their visit to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hammond. Their
							Carriage immediately preceded mine at the door. We all went into his
							apartment together. I enquired for Lord Grenville. Was told he had not
							yet come in. Hammond asked, if <persRef ref="scott-william">Sir William
								Scott</persRef> was not to meet me at the Office. Told him I
							understood from Lord Grenville that he was. Soon after Bayard said, he
							rather thought Sir William Scott would not be there this day, for he
							knew him to be engaged on business before the Lords Commissioners. Deas
							and Bayard after a short visit, and no material conversation went away.
							I stayed myself waiting for Lord Grenville untill one o’clock; but had
							no conversation with Hammond, who was busy writing, and gave me a
							newspaper to read. At length somebody came in, and I withdrew requesting
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hammond, as soon as Lord Grenville should
							come in, to let me know whether <pb n="80" type="ms"/>he meant to see me
							this day, and if not, at what other time. I then came home, and between
							two and three, received a card from Hammond informing me that Lord
							Grenville was much concerned, that his appointment with me had <hi
								rend="italic">entirely escaped his recollection</hi>. That he would
							see me however on Friday, at 12 o’clock, with Sir W. Scott. That he had
							not yet <hi rend="italic">had an opportunity</hi> of taking the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king’s</persRef> pleasure with respect to my
							presenting my credentials this day, and that therefore that ceremony
							will be deferred until this day week.</p>
						<p>This escape of Lord Grenville’s recollection is a little odd, under all
							the circumstances. The excuse thus chosen deserves some attention.— But
							patience! patience!</p>
						<p><persRef ref="rogers-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rogers</persRef>
							called on me; and also a clerk of <persRef ref="dickasonandcompany">Mess<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs:</hi> Dickason and C<hi rend="superscript">o:</hi></persRef> with
							some papers. Dined with D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Romayne at a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Van Dam’s</persRef>. Two Ladies
							there and several Gentlemen whom I did not know. Among the company
							however was <persRef ref="cooke-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Cook</persRef>, in days of old (1781.) a fellow student at Leyden,
							and whom I have not seen before, since that period. He tells me that two
							others of our acquaintance there, by the names of <persRef ref="u"
								>Lynch</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Burroughs</persRef> are
							dead.</p>
						<p>Agreed with D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Romayne to go with him on Sunday at
							1/2 past six. P.M. to Church at the foundling hospital, and afterwards
							to see <persRef ref="church-angelica">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>

							very gratuitous, but his management to guard against it shews
							considerable skill and knowledge of the human heart— I told him this

							given me some, and not an inconsiderable confidence in return: such
							indeed that I could not prudently even commit it to paper. It must
							therefore remain upon my mind only.— I told him that he would oblige me
							by retaining on his memory as much as would be convenient, all the
							conversation that passed between Morris and myself the day when he was
							present; which was the only time I had ever seen him.— He said he
							would.— His great fears of Morris’s influence must have a french
							origin.— Paid several visits and called at an Auction of books, but they
							are not upon so good terms here as in Holland. Purchased nothing.— Dined
							at home, and past the remainder of the day very busily in writing.

							immediately wrote a card to <persRef ref="grenville-william">Lord

							Minister Plenipotentiary, that my Letter to the <persRef

							him to the levee. He again expressed his regret that he had not before
							heard of my arrival.— I told him I should have notified it to him, but
							for the informal character in which I was placed here. He had all the
							forms of courtly civility about him as of course. At the levee he
							introduced me to the <persRef ref="cavendish-william">Duke of
								Portland</persRef>, to <persRef ref="dundas-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>Marquis of Salisbury</persRef>, the <persRef ref="murray-david"
								>Earl of Mansfield</persRef>, whom he called Lord Stormont, to the
							Minister of the Elector Palatine &amp;c.— After the levee was over I was
							introduced into the private closet of the king, by Lord Grenville and
							presenting my credential letter said, “Sir. To testify to your Majesty
							the Sincerity of the United States of America in their Negotiations,
							their <persRef ref="washington-george">President</persRef> has directed
							me to take the necessary measures connected with the exchange of the
							Ratifications of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation concluded
							between your Majesty and the United States. He has authorised me to
							deliver to your Majesty this letter, and I ask your Majesty’s permission
							to add on their part the assurance of the sincerity of their
							intentions.”— He then said. “To give you my answer Sir, I am very happy
							to have the assurances of their sincerity, for without that you know,
							there would be no such thing as dealings among men.[”]— He afterwards
							asked to which of the States I belonged, and on my answering
							Massachusetts, He turned to Lord Grenville, and said, “All the Adams’s
							belong to Massachusetts?[”] to which Lord Grenville answered, they did.
							He enquired whether <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> was
							now Governor of Massachusetts? I answered No Sir, he is Vice-President
							of the United States. [“]Ay said he, and he cannot hold both offices at
							the same time”? “No Sir.”— He asked where my father is now? At
							Philadelphia, Sir, I presume, the Congress being now in Session.— “When
							do they meet”? [“]The first week in December Sir.”— “And where did you
							come from last”? “From Holland Sir.” [“]You have been employed there.”
							“Yes Sir about a year.” “Have you been employed before, and any where
							else”? No Sir.— I then withdrew.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cottrell
							invited me to go and witness the ceremony of an address presented by the
								<hi rend="strikethrough">Clergy with</hi>
							<persRef ref="porteus-beily">Bishop and clergy of London</persRef>,
							which was received upon the throne.— The Bishop read his address, to
							which a <hi rend="italic">very gracious</hi> answer was returned, and
							they all kissed his hand, kneeling to obtain <hi rend="italic">that
								honour.</hi>— As I was coming from the Palace, with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Cottrell he called for the American Minister’s servants,
							and said that he had spoken to Lord Grenville who said that in the
							Gazette which would mention my audience I might be styled Minister
							Resident <pb n="83" type="ms"/>but without saying whether it was to be
							added to this Government or not. Determined to see <persRef
								ref="hammond-george">Hammond</persRef> on this matter. Resolved on

							the debates. Hammond has intimated to me, that I should have a place

							to make a point of it, I am determined to assume no privilege, that

								Deas</persRef> breakfasted with me. He said that what I had told him
							yesterday, made him think it necessary for him to notice a circumstance
							that had occurred to him the day before, when he had been to hear the
							debates in the house of Commons. On his first attempting to go in under
							the gallery as usual the Serjeant at Arms told him he did not know
							whether he should let him in, as he had received a note from the
							Secretary of State’s office, informing him that another Minister from
							America, had arrived. That however after some further explanations he
							admitted him. That on going into the house he found <persRef
								ref="hammond-george">Hammond</persRef> there and suspected him of
							having given the hint to the Serjeant at arms. He had now determined to
							take notice of the thing, and meant to write to <persRef
								ref="grenville-william">Lord Grenville</persRef> on the subject.</p>
						<p>It looks so much like a plan to force upon me the character of a Minister
							at this Court, that it gives me a real alarm.— Went as I had determined
							to see M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hammond; told him it was necessary there
							should be no misunderstanding between us on this article. That I have
							not the character of a Minister to this Court, and could not have. I had
							only the orders and instructions of the American Government to execute
							upon certain points. To enable me to obviate a scruple of form, a
							credential letter to <persRef ref="george-iii">the king</persRef> had
							been sent me special in its nature, and designating me under my real
							character. If this be not sufficient said I, let us stop here. no harm
							is done. But the thing with us is <hi rend="italic">constitutional</hi>,
							and were I to assume the character of a Minister at this Court, and act
							under it, I should not only be impeachable for it, but it would be
							deceiving you not to tell you, that the United States would be bound by
							none of my acts.— Hammond had just received Deas’s <pb n="84" type="ms"
							/>letter to Lord Grenville on the affair that had happened to him in the
							house of Commons. It had put him quite in a rage. I know what made you
							come here said he. One William Allen Deas. No indeed said I you are
							mistaken. That is by no means the occasion of my coming. Well said he,
							this matter shall be arranged so that you may be sure no blame shall
							fall on you, or the American Government. That is not the thing said I.
							my only wish is that neither the American Government nor I should be
							misunderstood. If there be a difference of opinion which must prevent me
							from acting in this case, let us wait. <persRef ref="pinckney-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pinckney</persRef> will be here in a
							few days, and it will be better to stay for his arrival, than make a
							question between the two Governments.— Hammond first asked me to state
							my ideas in writing; then abandoned that proposal, and asked me to call
							again at four o’clock, which I did. He had got his paragraph for the
							Gazette, and had altered it from what he had first made it, in which it
							was said I had presented to his Majesty a credential letter as Minister
							Resident from the United States. He tried it now in various shapes and
							asked for my approbation of it, saying that the Gazette was a sort of
							record of these things. Well said I, in that case, I cannot make myself
							responsible for any thing you may chuse to put in it. As it is under
							your controul, you will say what you think proper. I am responsible for
							my conduct as it relates to my own Country.— He appeared anxious and
							embarassed, and at length said the Letter was to be sure completely
							informal. They should have discovered that before. He at length made out
							his paragraph in a manner to which I saw no objection, and asked if he
							should mention to Lord Grenville that he had shewn it to me. I told him
							if he pleased, but he must not understand that I meant to make myself
							answerable for any consequence that might be drawn from it.</p>

								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> gallery of Paintings.
							I was very highly gratified during three or four hours that we spent in
							looking them over. There is indeed a mixture of good and of indifferent
							things, but there was only one really disgusting to me, It was a scene
							in the Midsummer’s Nights dream; instead of the fine frenzy of the Poet,
							it gave nothing but a combination of madness and idiotism; instead of
							the sportive excursions of a sublime imagination nothing but the
							darkling errors of a sick man’s dreams.— Among the paintings that struck
							me as the works of most special excellence, were a Death of <persRef
								ref="beaufort-henry">Cardinal Beaufort</persRef>, by <persRef
								ref="reynolds-joshua">Reynolds</persRef>, an <persRef ref="ophelia"
								>Ophelia</persRef> mad, by <persRef ref="west-benjamin"

								ref="hubert">Hubert</persRef> and <persRef ref="arthur"
								>Arthur</persRef> by <persRef ref="northcote-james"
								>Northcote</persRef>, and some others. But one of the most pleasing
							reflections on this occasion, arises from the idea of such a combination
							of talents and wealth, concurring to pay their tribute to the greatest
							Genius of their Country. Extreme refinement in the arts and Sciences is
							said to be connected with extreme civilization, and therefore with
							corruption. I would fain believe they are not necessarily connected, for
							indeed I cannot remove from my heart an enthusiastic fondness for the
							former, and I have a rooted and deliberate detestation of the latter. In
							knowing, in understanding, in admiring the works of transcendent genius,
							as far as is practicable to every individual respectively, consists one
							part of human duty, and in indulging the feelings of gratitude towards
							those who have contributed to relieve us from the burdens of life there
							is the double pleasure that arises from the consciousness of rewarding
							merit with fame, and discharging our own obligations at the same time.—

							on indecency are indeed left out, and as the play is very short
							additions have been introduced to the Dialogue. The characters are all
							preserved, even the mountebank <persRef ref="pinch">Pinch</persRef> the
							effect of his figure however is lost as the description of him by
							Antipholis, is omitted.— The farce was Merry Sherwood or Harlequin
							Forester, a new operatic pantomime, as splendid in pageantry, and as
							stupid in substance, as any thing I have seen. Townsend one of the
							performers, while he was singing a song as a begging impostor, he had a
							pebble or a nut thrown at him that hit him in the face.— He addressed
							the audience upon it in a very decent manner; said the practice had been
							repeated several times, and might if it did not cease, finally reduce
							him to <hi rend="italic">real</hi> beggary.— He was very much applauded;
							for these people are by no means destitute of Play-house
							sensibility.</p>
						<p>Here closes the year.— A period, when I am in the habit of indulging
							reflection, as it naturally brings to mind upon its frequent returns the
							variations of human life; &amp; as it always makes me desirous to repair
							by the future the deficiencies of the past.</p>
