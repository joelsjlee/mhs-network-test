						<p>On looking out of my window this morning, I found the ground as far as I
							could see again covered with snow. A light snow continued to fall till
							nearly noon, about 8 inches deep and without drifting, the atmosphere
							being calm— I called at the Department of State, and saw the chief
								<persRef ref="vail-aaron2">Clerk Vail</persRef>. The <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Secretary Forsyth</persRef> was not there— I
							found a voluminous correspondence respecting the Pirates and murderers
							of the Plattsburg; with <persRef ref="saabye-hans">Saabye</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> successively Consuls of
							the United States in Denmark; and between Forbes and <persRef ref="u"
								>Count Dohna</persRef> then Prussian Minister in Denmark— I examined
							also my correspondence with <persRef ref="bagot-charles"
							>Bagot</persRef>, <persRef ref="antrobus-gibbs">Antrobus</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="canning-stratford">Canning</persRef>, in several cases
							of the demand for the delivery up of persons charged with crimes— Among
							the rest the case of the man tried at Charleston S.C. taken in the
							Almeida— I was there nearly an hour and a half; and yet had not time to
							examine thoroughly the papers in any one of the cases; but I saw that
							many of them are very important for the discussion of the question of
							the delivery up of persons charged with crimes—Slaves—and deserters— The
							opinion of the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General
								Wirt</persRef>, against the delivery up in one case was referred to
							by me; but the opinion itself was not in the Letter Book, and I had not
							time to wait for a search for it among the files— The subject swells
							upon me as I look into it— I told Vail that I should move a call for the
							correspondence in the late cases of demands for surrender, but he was
							shy of giving me any information what they are— I went next to the
							Office of the Commissioner of Pensions <persRef ref="edwards-james">J.
								L. Edwards</persRef>, and found him at his desk— I left with him a
							Letter from <persRef ref="sprague-seth2">Seth Sprague jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and an affidavit respecting
							the pension claim of <persRef ref="stoddard-lucy">Lucy</persRef>, widow
							of <persRef ref="stoddard-melzar">Melzar Stoddard</persRef>— A Letter
							from <persRef ref="lewis-charles">Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Pierce</persRef> of Brooklyn L.I. to the Commissioner Edwards, with
							a Certificate of the deputy Comptroller of New-York in support of the
							pension claim of widow <persRef ref="benson-dinah">Dinah
								Benson</persRef>—and a Letter from the same Lewis and Pierce, with a
							Certificate from the Comptroller in support of the pension claim of
								<persRef ref="kelly-sibbel">Sibbel</persRef>, widow of <persRef
								ref="kelly-craig">Craig Kelly</persRef>.— Thence I went to the War
							Office and reminded the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary
								Poinsett</persRef> of my recommendation of <persRef
								ref="turner-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel A.
								Turner</persRef> of Scituate for an Appointment of one of the annual
							Visitors at the West-Point Academy—of his answer that it was too late
							for that year, the appointment having been already made—but that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner would be remembered for the
							appointment of this year— He took down M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Turner’s name, and said he should be remembered. I spoke to him also of
							the Memorial from the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia
							praying an Appropriation for magnetic observations; and said I supposed
							its proper reference would be to the Military Committee— He said he
							thought a select Committee would be preferable. I met at the Department
							of State <persRef ref="grundy-felix">Felix Grundy</persRef>—late
							Attorney General—now again Senator from Tennesee— Afternoon visit from
								<persRef ref="dawson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dawson</persRef> of Georgia and <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jenifer</persRef> of Maryland.</p>

						<p>The Snow fell so level, and laid so light upon the ground, that I found a
							foot path, already beaten, on going this morning to the Presbyterian
							Church— <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef> preached from 2. Peter. 2.4. “For if God spared not
							the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them
							into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment 5. And spared not
							the old world, but saved <persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>, the eighth
							person, a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world
							of the ungodly; 6. And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into
							ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto
							those that after should live ungodly— 9. The Lord knoweth how to deliver
							the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of
							judgment to be punished”— A thorough going damnation Sermon—such as I
							have not heard for several years, and such as I would never willingly
							hear again— There is no religious doctrine which appears to me so
							revoltingly absurd as that which teaches that God Almighty created Man,
							with the foreknowledge and predestination of delivering him over to the
							dominion of the devil to all eternity—which exhorts man to repentance by
							laying it down, as an irrefragable truth that man can do nothing for
							himself, and that God sacrificed his own Son by an ignominious death,
							for the salvation of all mankind, ninety-nine of every hundred of whom
							are after all doomed to eternal misery— How is it possible to denominate
							the being who can be made to believe all this a rational animal? For
							these are not errors of ignorance; but errors of the most enlightened
							and most cultivated minds. It is in the exercise of the highest and
							acutest faculties of the human understanding, that Christian theologians
							arrive at these results, and they draw them from the holy Scriptures—
							After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the Evening service of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday
							after the Epiphany, and preached from Zechariah 6.12 “And speak unto him
							saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of Hosts, saying behold the man, whose
							name is the BRANCH: and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall
							build the temple of the Lord: 13— Even he shall build the temple of the
							Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his
							throne: and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of
							peace shall be between them both.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley has a peculiar propensity to select for his afternoon Sermons
							mysterious and obscure passages from the prophets without explaining
							them—of which this text is a signal example— The collect of the day was
							most impressive— “O God, who knowest us to be set in the midst of so
							many and great dangers, that by reason of the frailty of our nature we
							cannot always stand upright; Grant to us such strength and protection as
							may support us in all dangers, and carry us through all temptations,
							through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.” Of this strength and protection
							how great is my need! How hard the task to direct my course as the
							divine Spirit would enjoin! how faint the hope of accomplishing any
							useful purpose to close my career with the approbation of my maker.</p>

						<p>Household occupations at home, delayed me this morning, so that it was 20
							minutes past 11 when I reached the Committee room of the Committee of
							Manufactures— Four Members of the Committee had been there and without
							waiting for a Quorum had adjourned— I trust I shall take this as a
							lesson of punctuality. Whoever else may be tardy, the Chairman of a
							Committee should be to the minute at his post— In the House the result
							of the vote of last Friday for the five members of the cheap printing
							committee, was announced— Three of the five <persRef ref="black-edward"
								>Black</persRef>, the mover of the Resolution, <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">John W. Davis</persRef> of Indiana, and <persRef
								ref="prentiss-john">John H Prentiss</persRef> of New-York elected— A
							second vote then absorbed nearly three hours of the time of the House—
								<persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> of Louisiana and
								<persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> of Maine were
							elected— Two days of the House have been consumed, in this viva voce
							election of a very useless Committee as I expect it will prove to be—
							The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> would have appointed
							the same men in five minutes.— This business being over, the house
							proceeded to vote for a chaplain, viva voce as before. There
							were<space/>Candidates for this Office.<space/>votes were given in; and
								<persRef ref="danforth-joshua">Joshua Danforth</persRef> had the
							highest number 31—<persRef ref="balch-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Balch</persRef> 29. <persRef ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi

								<persRef ref="boyd-fw">F. W. Boyd</persRef>, nominated by <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef>, and for whom I voted
							20.— The house then without taking a second vote adjourned— <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> introduced to me two Officers of the Custom house
							at New-York, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wasson</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cairnes</persRef>, who expressed a wish to confer with the Committee
							of Manufactures; and as they are obliged to leave the City on their
							return to New-York, the day after to-morrow, I notified the members of
							the Committee to meet to morrow morning at 11. O’Clock— <persRef
								ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef> was not in the house;
							and I could not find <persRef ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbet</persRef>— So
							I requested <persRef ref="follansbee-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Follansbee</persRef> the door-keeper to give them notice
							at their lodgings.— At the suggestion of <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef> I notified
							also the members from the Massachusetts Delegation in the House to
							attend a meeting in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, next
							Wednesday morning at 11 O’Clock, to consult together upon what we are to
							do with the abolition Petitions with which we are or hereafter may be
							charged— I notified them all, excepting <persRef ref="hastings-william"
								>W. S. Hastings</persRef> whom I did not see in the House— Cushing
							said something of a Protest— There are objections to this, perhaps not
							insuperable, but some joint action of the whole delegation is surely
							advisable— I propose 1. To take a vote upon two sets of Resolutions of
							the Legislature of Massachusetts— 2. To offer a Resolution that every
							member of the Delegation will by such means as he shall deem just and
							proper use his influence to obtain the rescinding of the new rule of the
							house 3. To suggest the expediency of publishing lists of all petitions
							refused to be received under the new rule of the house— 4. To propose a
							plan of co-operation with the members of other States friendly to the
							right of Petition— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas B. J.

							<persRef ref="u">Wasson</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Cairnes</persRef>
							attended before the Committee, and testified to the enormous frauds
							practiced in the collection of the revenue— They appeared to be very
							respectable persons, and they spoke very earnestly in favour of the
							present <persRef ref="hoyt-jesse">Collector Jesse Hoyt</persRef>, who no
							doubt appointed or patronizes them.— They said that in <persRef
								ref="swartwout-samuel">Swartwout’s</persRef> time two of the
							Inspectors were bribed— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hoyt
							immediately after coming into office detected them, and they were
							removed— That the woolen trade is carried on almost exclusively by
							Agents of the Yorkshire Clothiers, utterly unprincipled men, who take
							out Commissions for testimony in England, which is any thing they
							require it to be— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cairnes said it was his
							constant practice to appraise their goods from 15 to 50 per cent higher
							than their invoices— As to a remedy they thought of no other than an
							increase of the number of Appraisers, but they recommended to us to
							consult the collector Hoyt— We had not time to read the communications
							from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nisbet
							without hearing them read, thought the whole matter should be referred
							to the Committee on the judiciary. It was agreed however that we should
							meet Thursday Morning at ten O’Clock; and then consider whether the
							meetings of the Committee shall be reduced to once a week— At the House,
								<persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> the Chairman of the new
							cheap printing Committee a fiery tempered piece of inanity swelling with
							his dignity of Chairman of a select committee appointed by the house,
							palmed upon us by direction of the Committee two Resolutions—one that
							the Committee might be authorised to employ a clerk, with a flourish of
							their reasons for needing him, and of the facilities he would afford to
							their investigations—the other formally authorising them to summon
							witnesses before them, and to administer oaths to them— I was struck
							with the pomposity of the first resolution, but let it pass without
							notice— I observed that the second was worse than superfluous, by
							calling upon the house for authority to swear witnesses which every
							standing and select committee, possessed by express Law— I moved to
							strike out the second Resolution, and add to the first, power to the
							Committee to send for persons and papers— After some petulant resistance
							of Black and some impertinent sputtering of <persRef
								ref="ramsey-william">Ramsay</persRef>, the bobtail of the Harrisburg
							mob, Black peremptorily called for the reading of the Law to which I had
							referred.— The acts of 1798 and 1817 were read— I said I hope the
							Chairman of the Committee now understands the Law, and my amendment was
							carried without a count— The Resolution was adopted, and the house
							proceeded to elect a chaplain— After the third ineffective vote <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef> withdrew the name of
								<persRef ref="boyd-fw">F. W. Boyd</persRef>.— I then voted for
								<persRef ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Bates</persRef>, who at the fifth vote was elected by 92 votes over
								<persRef ref="braxton-thomas">Thomas Braxton</persRef> who had 83.
							The time for daily receiving of petitions was continued to the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> and after other business the house
							adjourned a quarter before four—</p>

								ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef> and Henry <persRef
								ref="williams-henry4">Williams</persRef>, purposely, to avoid
							concert with the rest. It was my wish to present the abolition petitions
							committed to my charge together with the rest— But the unanimous opinion
							of all the other members present was not to offer this day, any <hi
								rend="strikethrough">but</hi> that they called abolition
							petitions—that is to say that touched at all upon Slavery—but only
							business petitions— It was said that by avoiding the obstruction to the
							presentation of other petitions, we should not excite resentment, and
							that as the daily receipt of Petitions is continued until the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month we shall have ample time
							and occasion to present the Anti-slavery petitions between this time. I
							gave it as my opinion, that if we once let slip the opportunity of
							presenting the anti-slavery petitions, they would never allow us
							another.— I said that I had attended the meeting intending to propose
							measures of increasing concert and energy; to recover the prostrate
							right of petition; and I mentioned those that I minuted in this diary of
							the day before yesterday—but I said I would not set my face against the
							whole delegation and would accordingly abstain from presenting any
							anti-slavery Resolutions this day— Not even either of the two sets of
							Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts bearing upon Slavery— At
							the house I found <persRef ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bates</persRef> closing his first prayer—Petitions were
							immediately called resuming the State of Massachusetts— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence presented one petition praying
							for the recognition of the Independence of Hayti—he moved its reference
							to the Committee of foreign Affairs— <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn
								Banks</persRef> immediately moved to lay it on the table; which was
							carried by yeas and nays<space/>to 65. I presented<space/>Memorials and
							Petitions among which were the Memorial of the American Philosophical
							Society; with the Letter of the Secretary of War <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef>— the memorial of <persRef
								ref="wattemare-alexander">Alexander de Wattemare</persRef> with the
							Letter from <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">C. C.
								Cambreleng</persRef>—referred to the joint Committee on the Library—
							The petition of <persRef ref="mcnally-w">W. M’Nally</persRef>, and 1209.
							Seamen referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs— Two or three to the
							Smithsonian Committee, and others to the appropriate Committees— The
							other States were then called quietly till the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> called New-Jersey— <persRef
								ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> then presented the
							Resolutions of the Legislature of New Jersey, remonstrating against the
							exclusion of the five members— Randolph enquired if the Speaker had not
							received the same resolutions from the <persRef ref="pennington-william"
								>Governor of the State</persRef>, and was answered that he had; and
							declined presenting them.— This led to a blow up, in which the house got
							into a Chaos of confusion in the midst of which about 4. a motion to
							adjourn was carried— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> took

								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef>.— The Documents
							received from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> numbered from 1. to 4 were read; and demonstrated
							beyond all doubt enormous frauds in the collection of the revenue.— Ten
							or twelve additional memorials of manufacturers had been yesterday
							referred by the House to the Committee; but a Message from the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> relating to the same
							frauds was yesterday referred to the Committee of Ways and Means.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Nisbet was still desirous of requesting to
							be discharged from the further consideration of all the petitions, and
							to have them all referred to the Committee of Ways and Means I finally
							found myself roused in behalf of the manufacturing interest; and urged
							it upon the Committee, but I had no measure prepared to be proposed, and
							with the Committee yielded to the wish of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Nisbet to postpone the further consideration of the Petitions, till next
							Thursday— The same disposal was made of a Resolution offered by
							Tillinghast for reporting a bill to strike out the article of Pins, from
							the list of those exempted from duties—and also of the bill, introduced
							by Petrikin, to repeal the act of 14. July 1832, exempting rail-road
							iron from duty, and graduating the duty upon it. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Nisbet is exceedingly apprehensive of disturbing the
							compromise— Passing from the Committee room I found the house in
							Session, and the Clerk reading the answer of <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">R. M. T. Hunter</persRef> the Speaker, to the
								<persRef ref="pennington-william">Governor of New Jersey</persRef>
							declining to present the Resolutions of the Legislature of New-Jersey,
							because they had been transmitted to him, as a member of the house from
							Virginia, and not as speaker of the House. The resolutions were entered
							upon the journal of yesterday— <persRef ref="leadbetter-daniel"
								>Leadbetter</persRef> moved to strike them out, and insert a
							narrative of dialogue and desultory debate— The motion was lost by yeas
							and nays, on a motion of <persRef ref="reed-john">John Reed</persRef> to
							lay the amendment on the table 87 to 86— Then <persRef
								ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> moved that the Resolutions
							should be printed—carried again by yeas and nays 92 to 90. though
								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> skulked— The call
							for Petitions was then continued through the remainder of the States and

							would be so, to give effect to any plan which the Department might

						<p>The debate of yesterday upon the proposed instructions to the Committee
							of Ways and Means to report of an appropriation of 150000 for the
							continuation of the Cumberland road through each of the States of Ohio,
							Indiana and Illinois, presented some developments of the ostensible
							condition of parties; altogether delusive— <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> moved to lay the motion of
							instructions upon the table— The western men were all as of course to
							make a clamorous resistance against this, but each one coloured by his
							party politics— <persRef ref="rariden-james">Rariden</persRef> of
							Indiana made a <persRef ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> speech
							in favour of the appropriation, and <persRef ref="wick-william"
								>Wick</persRef> of the same State intreated and conjured Pickens, to
							withdraw his motion to lay on the table, that he might make a <hi
								rend="italic">personal</hi> explanation; and he offered a pledge if
							Pickens would let him speak to renew the motion to lay on the table—
							Pickens after a decent portion of wavering, consented.— <persRef
								ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef> objected to this bargain for
							the exclusive occupation of the floor between two members— The <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> said Pickens had a right to
							withdraw his motion to lay on the table; and he the Speaker could know
							nothing of any bargain between the two Gentlemen— From this decision
							Biddle appealed, but withdrew his appeal on the positive assurance from
							Wick that he only wanted to make a personal explanation— But this
							personal explanation, was a Kinderhoek speech in favour of the
							appropriation—to shew that however he agreed with Rariden in support of
							the road, it is as not for the same reasons— He was stop’d successively
							by <persRef ref="white-john6">White</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> of Kentucky both of whom
							renewed Biddle’s appeal, and again withdrew it—while Pickens was all the
							time wavering, yielding and refusing to yield the floor several times—
							Wick finally made his speech and closed by renewing the motion to lay on
							the table— But after a call of the House the motion was rejected by yeas
							and nays 86 to 112. Biddle then took the floor, and gave such a
							scorching castigation as I have never before heard— <persRef
								ref="mason-samson">Sampson Mason</persRef> immediately followed but
							the house soon after adjourned—</p>
						<p>This was a dull dark and gloomy day: sultry almost warm, with thick fog,
							and copious showers of rain in alternate succession At the morning
							service of the Presbyterian Church M<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi><space/>Colton, a chaplain in the Navy preached from Luke 9.23.
							“And he said to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny
							himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.” There might be
							thirty persons, men, women and children present— <persRef
								ref="colton-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton</persRef>
							gave notice that owing to the inclemency of the weather, there would be
							no afternoon service there— And there was none at S<hi

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lewis Johnson</persRef> who informed me of the present

									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Otis</persRef> of Barnstable as
							Administrator of his brother <persRef ref="otis-william3">William
								Otis</persRef> He said they had made one partial settlement in which
							he had received from the comptroller between 4 and 5000 dollars, which
							he had distributed pro tanto among William Otis’s creditors. They were
							now pressing for indemnity for the real estate— There was an
							unfavourable report but <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Key</persRef> hopes to prevail upon the Comptroller to reverse it—
							At the House the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> called
							upon the States for <hi rend="italic">Resolutions</hi> according to the
							rule of the alternate Monday— There were three different rules of the
							house between which the Speaker this morning might take his choice— The
							order for daily receiving petitions till the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> which he ought to have taken— The rule of Saturday’s
							unfinished business of Saturday going into Committee of the whole on the
							Union, upon the pension appropriation Bill—and the alternate Monday call
							for Resolutions which I had suspected he would take and for which I was
							yet not quite prepared— The Resolutions offered from the Northern States
							were very few and unimportant—excepting two calls for correspondence
							relating to the North-eastern boundary question, from Maine— All the
							Resolutions offered were adopted without opposition till it came to me—
							I offered two— One a call upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for all the investments in
							State Stocks of public monies—and the other upon the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> for the demand of the
								<persRef ref="deargaiz-pedro">Spanish Minister</persRef> for the
							delivery up to him of the Africans captured in the Ship L’Amistad, and
							the correspondence with the Spanish Minister and with the <persRef
								ref="holabird-william">District Attorney</persRef> in Connecticut on
							the subject.— As calls upon the Executive these Resolutions lie over by
							the rule one day; but by the practice and the will of the Majority for
							an indefinite term of time, probably to the end of the Session, never to
							come up— I asked the house to take them up now—but <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> objected to both the
							Resolutions, and I acquiesced— Petrikin declared he would object to
							taking up now, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Resolutions required to lie
							over a day.— but he made exceptions for his friends.— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> offered two Resolutions one of which
							was a call upon the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
								War</persRef> for an account of the importation of bloodhounds— He
							said he was in possession of the fact officially from the Secretary of
							War himself. There was a great struggle to arrest Wise in making this
							Statement upon points of order; but he got it out in spite of them:
								<persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> brought forth an
							enormous budget of his proposed amendments to the Constitution; which
							Petrikin would not even allow to be printed— <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Bell</persRef> brought forward his old bill to secure the freedom
							of elections, and the Bill to repeal the law limiting to 4 years the
							tenure of certain subordinate executive Offices. <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> made a desperate effort to
							refuse leave to introduce the first of these bills, but failed— The call
							for resolutions went through— Adjourned at 5. <persRef ref="cutts-mary"

							reclaim the papers relating to her and <persRef ref="telfair-mary">her

							Miss Pierce also exhibited to me receipts of several Articles of

							their expenses.— I did speak to Underwood and he promised to procure the
							papers from the Committee— When the journal of yesterday, <persRef
								ref="u">Davis</persRef> moved to dispense with the reading of the

								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="anderson-simeon">Anderson</persRef> of Kentucky were within the

							not— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> had dealt
							disingenuously with me in not telling me that it would not be— I moved
							to amend the journal by stating the fact of my enquiry and of the
							decision— The question was first put by rising and there were fifty six
							to forty four—no Quorum— I called for the yeas and nays which were
							ordered. Then <persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> moved to
							lay the amendment on the Table— I called for the yeas and nays on this

							laying them on the table was 116 to 52—my object was secured of having
							my question and the decision entered upon the journal; but my remarks
							were overheated and increased the majority for laying the amendment on
							the table— The Speaker then gave the floor to <persRef
								ref="mason-samson">Samson Mason</persRef>, upon <persRef
								ref="casey-zadok">Casey’s</persRef> motion to instruct the Committee
							of Ways, and Means to report a Bill appropriating 450000 dollars for the
							continuation of the Cumberland road— I asked him if the receipt of
							petitions was not the order of the day—he said this was a case upon the
							reference of a Petition— Mason made a speech of about two hours to prove
							that the Government was bound, to make these appropriations by compact—
							He addressed himself chiefly to the South-Carolina nullifiers, and their
							Virginian auxiliaries with many shrewd remarks and cutting sarcasms— He
							was followed by <persRef ref="parris-virgil">Virgil D. Parris</persRef>
							against the appropriation—a plain commonplace speech of less than half
							an hour, rather above the standard of the Orators capacity but the chief
							merit of which was its brevity— <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Ogden
								Hoffman</persRef> then took the floor and moved an adjournment at
							short of four O’Clock which was carried— I paid a visit to <persRef

							company with a subscription paper for a contribution to pay for an alarm

							Tennessee, who remarking upon the beautiful weather, a clear sky, and

							trees— He said there were great quantities of those trees in his part of
							the State, and that in a favourable season he had known 1000 pounds of
							sugar made from 150 trees— At the House the day was consumed by the
							delivery of three speeches upon the Cumberland road appropriation—first
							that of Hoffman which was in his usual style of classical eloquence— He
							was in favour of the appropriation for the Cumberland road; but not for
							instructing the Committee of Ways and Means, until, the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> or the Secretary whether
							the omission of the appropriation for the Cumberland road from the
							estimates of the present year was intentional or undesigned— He read
							passages from the Message warning Congress not to make any appropriation
							beyond those exhibited in the Estimates; and giving a significant hint,
							that if they do, he will veto the Bills for their extravagance and
							boasting that if the estimates of the Departments are not exceeded the
							public expenses of this year will be five Millions less than they were
							the last year— He then referred to the appropriations already <hi
								rend="strikethrough">much</hi> exceeding five Millions, proposed by
							friends of the administration, not even hinted at in the estimates; and
							he exposed the fraud in the Message, of suppressing and of the estimates
							in omitting millions upon millions of the expenses, which it was known
							congress must and would authorize, so as to throw upon Congress the
							Odium of extravagant expenditure measured by the <hi rend="italic"
								>amount</hi> of the appropriations, and boast of his own rigorous
							economy measured by the amount of the purposely curtailed estimates and
							the urgent and threatening admonition to Congress to keep closely within
							them. Hoffman was followed by <persRef ref="hubbard-david">David

						<p>At <persRef ref="nourse-charles">C. J. Nourse’s</persRef> Office I
							exchanged 50 half-eagles, and deposited 260 dollars bills of the Bank of
							the United States at the Bank of Washington—and there took up the 22

								Rives</persRef> moved to suspend the rules, that he might offer a

							laid before them printed for the use of the house. One hour of this
							morning had ben yesterday fixed at the motion of <persRef
								ref="russell-david">David Russell</persRef>, Chairman of the
							Committee of Claims, to receive Reports from Committees— But this motion
							of Rives was made not from the Committee of Elections, but from their
							minority— I had been informed yesterday by <persRef ref="brockway-john"
								>Brockway</persRef> that it would be made; and that its object was
							to get the subject again prematurely before the house to ground a motion
							to admit the spurious members from New-Jersey— There was a call of the
							House— Only<space/>members answered to their names and further
							proceedings in the call were suspended— Rives’s motion to suspend the
							rules failed, though sustained by a majority 83 to 72— Reports from the
							Committee of Elections was called.— <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John

							from the Committee a Resolution authorizing the Committee to have their
							journal printed— Rives moved his Resolution to have <hi rend="italic"
								>all</hi> the papers before the Committee printed for the use of the
							house as an amendment, and called for the previous question—but before
							it could be ascertained that there was a second to the previous
							question, the hour expired; the orders of the day were called and
							Barnard took the floor on the Cumberland road. He made an excellent
							speech of about two hours, receiving little attention from the house,
							now thoroughly weary of this subject; and highly excited by the return
							upon them of the New Jersey election through the schism in the Committee
							of Elections. Barnard was followed by <persRef ref="crary-isaac">Isaac

						<p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilcocks</persRef> was
							here this morning, and made enquiries about lots of land, which he

							I referred him to <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Frye</persRef>— He says he has obtained a Clerkship in
							the adjutant General’s Office. I received by last evening’s mail a
							Letter enclosing a remonstrance, and a string of resolutions adopted by
							a numerous popular meeting at<space/>New-Jersey against the exclusion by
							the house of Representatives of five of the six commissioned members
							from that State, from their Seats.— The remonstrance and Resolutions
							were likewise enclosed in a packet addressed to that delegation, which I
							was requested to deliver to them, and did this morning deliver to
								<persRef ref="randolph-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Randolph</persRef>— It was desired that if they thought it expedient
							that a member other than one of themselves should present the
							remonstrance to the house the duty should devolve upon me— And the
							measure was suggested to them, but left to their discretion of
							withdrawing altogether and returning home There was also a vote of
							thanks to <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef>, <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Stanly</persRef>, myself and others for our exertions in sustaining
							the rights of New-Jersey in the house— But the committee of elections
							have postponed the consideration of this case for two Months to give the
							parties time for collecting their evidence, and Randolph told me that
							the five members were all gone— This state of things was altogether
							different from that under which the remonstrance and resolutions of the
							meeting were adopted— I advised Randolph not to withdraw, and thought
							his colleagues could not at this time without appearing to abandon their
							cause— I advised him also to write to <persRef ref="condict-lewis">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict</persRef>, and to present the
							remonstrance himself; but said I would present it if he so preferred— He
							said he scarcely knew what to do, and appeared dejected— It is plain
							that the same rotten majority which committed the first outrage will
							carry it through and not only expel the five members duly elected, but
							admit the five spurious pretenders.— In the house, after some
							preliminary squabbling, <persRef ref="goode-patrick">Goode</persRef> of
							Ohio made a sensible Speech of three hours upon the defence of <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> against <persRef

								Meehan</persRef> the Librarian of Congress yesterday told me that in
							the violent storm of the Night before last, one arm of the emblematical
							statue of America, in the Pediment over the entrance door of the Hall of
							the House of Representatives, my design so beautifully executed by
								<persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef>, had been blown away,
							and came down with a tremendous crash— He said the group was of free
							stone— I said it was ominous— He said he hoped not— But he was mistaken
							as to the Statue mutilated.— It is not the figure, but that of Justice
							which has lost her right arm, nearly to the elbow— Still more ominous;
							and painfully significant of the condition of the Hall within, where
							Justice has emphatically lost her right arm— This morning I attended
							public worship at the Presbyterian Church, where <persRef
								ref="colton-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton</persRef>
							the chaplain in the Navy preached from Proverbs 22.6. [“]Train up a
							child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart
							from it.”— The whole system of good-education, and of parental
							instruction seems to be embraced in these few words. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton’s discourse was addressed chiefly
							to Parents— Plain—practical—urgent—eloquent by the very omission of all
							the arts of eloquence— He dwelt very earnestly upon the duty and
							efficacy of maternal instruction exemplified in the conversion and
							beatification of John Newton, of whom he related that he was converted
							from that most infamous of all occupations (so he called it) a slave
							trader on the coast of Africa— Then it was by the agency and
							instructions of <persRef ref="newton-john3">John Newton</persRef>, that
							Thomas Scott, the author he said of the best commentary on the bible
							that had ever been published, had been formed—and <persRef
								ref="scott-thomas">Thomas Scott</persRef> had been the instructor of
								<persRef ref="morrison-robert">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morrison</persRef> the translator of the Bible into the Chinese
							language— All this good he said had been accomplished, by the prickings
							of conscience of John Newton while pursuing the piracy of the Slave
							trade, but remembering the tender admonitions of his mother— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton gave notice, that there would be a
							meeting of the members of the Society at half past four O’Clock next
							Tuesday afternoon, to consult together upon what is to be done
							concerning the present condition of the Church and congregation—
								<persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef> was here after the morning service at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s, but would not stay to dine— After
							dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s where M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyd read the evening service for
							Septuagesima Sunday, and preached from Mark 1.15. [“]and saying, the
							time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and
							believe the gospel.” I read the Sermon of <persRef ref="furness-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Furness</persRef> of
							Philadelphia upon that awful calamity the burning of the Steamboat
							Lexington one of those events at which the heart sickens, and
							imagination is incapable of conceiving why it was permitted by
							omnipotent goodness— <persRef ref="follen-charles">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Follen</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Russel Jarvis</persRef> with
							her <persRef ref="u;u">two daughters</persRef> were among the victims—
							What can I say; and what must I think! that God is good, and that myself
							am blind— The day slipped away almost unheeded; but the evening until
							midnight was engrossed by the report on the Smithsonian bequest.</p>

								ref="hoyt-jesse">Jesse Hoyt</persRef> collector of the Port of
							New-York, for the punishment and suppression of the frauds on the

								>r</hi> Lawrence read to me, and promised me a copy of his proposed

							Missouri, and referred to the Committee of Commerce of which <persRef
								ref="king-william2">W. R. King</persRef> of Alabama is chairman—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King is not very favourably disposed

							and reprinted them in a pamphlet of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Radcliff gave me a copy— He said he was about to return in two or three

							suspend the rules for a resolution to take up the pension-bill at one

								ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> squeezed in a report from the

							taking the Census— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> insisted that this was the alternate Monday for
							receiving petitions; but in vain— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> decided that Corwin had the floor; but <persRef
								ref="corwin-thomas">Corwin</persRef> took a vote of the house which
							gave the same result; though Governor Lincoln was unquestionably right—
							Corwin then delivered in the space of three hours one of the most
							eloquent Speeches ever pronounced in that house, and was followed by
								<persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef> of Tennessee against the appropriation—about one
							hour— A motion was then made that the daily receipt of petitions, should
							be continued till the first of March—the vote was twice taken; the
							second time by tellers but there was in both cases no Quorum to vote— So
							the house adjourned; about half past four— Corwin’s speech was
							admirable, but not quite equal to that part of it, which he delivered on

							The first thing taken up was the Resolution offered by <persRef

							amendment of <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> for the

							Campbell this morning said he was instructed by the Committee to accept—
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Millard Fillmore</persRef> had the

							transactions in the Committee and read a Resolution adjourning the
							farther consideration of the subject till the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of April, giving the parties the interval to collect
							further testimony— Fillmore was exposing the motive to this movement—the
							design to force of report from the Committee and a decision upon the
							New-Jersey Election, without waiting for the testimony.— I have foreseen
							from the beginning that this would be the last resort of the
							Administration party, and that they would end as they began by arbitrary
							decision instead of adjudication— When Fillmore began to read the
							Resolution of the Committee, <persRef ref="petrikin-david"
								>Petrikin</persRef> made a point of order insisting that he should
							make no allusion to any thing that took place in the Committee; and this
							point of order as usual threw the house into confusion— The <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> decided that it was not in
							order to refer to any thing that took place in Committee, and therefore
							that Fillmore must not read the resolution— Fillmore appealed and
							withdrew his appeal— A motion was made that he should have leave to
							proceed, and it was coming to a call of yeas and nays— I then appealed
							from the Speaker’s decision—debate followed; and at 1. O’Clock the
							Orders of the day were called— There was a struggle to continue the
							debate on the New-Jersey election, but the Orders of the day
							prevailed—</p>
						<p>A Bill from the Senate making an appropriation to remove a raft from the
							red river of Arkansas was first in order, upon which <persRef

								ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="beatty-william">Beatty</persRef> of Pennsylvania about 4.
							O’Clock took the floor and moved to adjourn which was carried— Biddle’s
							Artillery is heavy but he wastes his powder in petty warfare— The
							Speaker came, and spoke to me of my appeal from his decision; in which
							he said he wished me to persist. <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary

						<p>Fire in my chamber intermitted— Soap-Stone. Last evening we had a visit
							from <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef>. I finished this morning the draught of a Report on
							the Smithsonian bequest Bill, to be submitted to the Committee; and left
							it with <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
								D. Barnard</persRef> at his lodgings.— I have requested him to read
							it, and to suggest any alterations, additions or omissions which may
							occur to him, as advisable before I present it to the Committee— Meeting
							of the Committee of Manufactures, at which <persRef
								ref="lawrence-samuel3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel
								Lawrence</persRef> attended— Present Adams, <persRef

								>Eastman</persRef>, <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef>, <persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>—
							I had received from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, the draught of a Bill, in 13. Sections, prepared
							by the <persRef ref="hoyt-jesse">Collector</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="butler-benjamin">District Attorney</persRef> U.S. at New-York,
							with explanatory remarks upon each Section, and 3. Additional Sections
							offered by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Lawrence; and drawn up
							by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</persRef> of
							Boston— The Bill was read by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mitchell,
							and the explanatory observations upon each section, by me, Section by
							Section— A motion was then made that the Chairman do report the Bill—but
							to this Eastman and I myself objected, without further examination of
							its contents. It was therefore agreed to meet again, Monday Morning at
							10.— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> sent for me to
							his chamber, to adjust the phraseology of his decision and my appeal
							made yesterday, which was done— This appeal was the first business of
							the day— I had the floor, and after the usual struggle to get other
							business before the house, I briefly stated my reasons for making the
							appeal— <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> made a Speech to
							sustain the decision— Concurring with me in the abusive practice of
							majorities in the application of the rules; perfectly willing that
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> should read the
							resolution of the Committee upon which the point of order had been
							taken, he still thought it all important that the majority should hold
							their grasp upon this engine of power— He asked me to withdraw my
							appeal, and at the same time moved to lay it on the table— But withdrew
							his motion upon being reminded that if the appeal was laid on the table
							the Resolution would of course follow it— <persRef ref="pope-john"
								>Pope</persRef> and <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>
							replied to Banks; the hour expired and the orders of the day were
							called— <persRef ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> moved a
							suspension of the rules to introduce a Resolution of investigation into
							a dirty transaction of the <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Postmaster General</persRef>, but failed by a vote of
							118 to 83. not two thirds.— An amendment to the Pension Appropriation
							Bill, made by the Senate was concurred in— The red river raft Bill was
							passed over, and the Bill amendatory of that for taking the sixth census
							was debated in Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Linn
							Banks in the Chair— <persRef ref="carter-william2">W. B.
								Carter</persRef> introduced mal-a-propos the character of the
							Marshal of East-Tennessee, which was sharply defended, with retort very
							uncourteous by <persRef ref="watterson-harvey">Watterson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="mcclellan-abraham">M’Lellan</persRef> of that State—
								<persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> offered a
							ridiculous preamble censuring the last Congress for incompetency, in
							passing an imperfect Bill— <persRef ref="dawson-william"
								>Dawson</persRef> and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>,
							warmly opposed this preamble and Dromgoole with much intercession
							prevailed upon Petrikin to withdraw it— The bills were reported and the
							house shortly before 6. adjourned.</p>

						<p><date>21. IV:30. </date>Friday</p>
						<p>Last Evening and this morning were consumed in assorting endorsing and
							filing Letters received since the entrance of this month, which had
							become numerous— At the House after much effort particularly of <persRef
								ref="russell-david">David Russell</persRef> Chairman of the
							Committee of Claims to obtain leave for the Committees to report; my
							appeal from the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker’s</persRef>
							decision was taken up, and the decision confirmed by an unflinching
							party vote. </p>
						<p>After this decision <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>
							commenced resuming his Speech; but <persRef ref="petrikin-david"
								>Petrikin</persRef> insisted that having been declared out of order
							he could not without special permission from the house, proceed— Here
							was another point of order; and another brawling debate till past one
							O’Clock— It was apparent that the administration party intend to force a
							decision upon the New-Jersey election without waiting for the testimony—
							They had come prepared to force it this day—so that when after the
							expiration of the hour, the call was made for the orders of the day, the
							house refused by yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>to do so— Then they
							contended that the question upon <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson’s</persRef> amendment to the Resolution offered by <persRef
								ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> was still under debate— And
							so the Speaker at first decided—but the reverse had been repeatedly
							decided before— And Fridays and Saturdays being expressly assigned for
							private business, the Speaker finally decided that this order of
							business is a different thing from the orders of the day, and can be set
							aside only by a majority of two thirds— After much manoeuvering to bring
							him round again, <persRef ref="holleman-joel">Holleman</persRef>, most
							respectfully took an appeal from his decision which was confirmed by
							yeas and nays 116 to 64— Private Bills from the Senate were taken up;
							and while one of them was under discussion, I went into the Senate
							chamber, and gave to <persRef ref="mouton-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mouton</persRef> a Senator from
							Louisiana, to whom <persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston</persRef> of South-Carolina
							introduced me, the copy of the Petition of 611 Masters and Officers of
							Vessels at New-Orleans, for the repeal of the Naturalization Laws; which
							they have requested me to present to the House— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mouton that although I should present the
							petition, I should not support it— He said it might be advisable to
							modify the Naturalization Laws but not to repeal them— On returning to
							the House I found them upon the Bill for continuing the office of
							Commissioner of Pensions; and <persRef ref="proffit-george"
								>Proffit</persRef> on the floor making a regular retrenchment
							Speech, upon a motion to reduce the Salary of the Commissioner from 3000
							to 2500 dollars a year— Then a wrangling match between Proffit and
								<persRef ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="smith-albert">Albert Smith</persRef>, about the relative
							extravagance of the whig and democratic parties, in which <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> manifested a convulsive
							passion to take a part—he finally about half past four O’Clock moved the
							adjournment which was carried— <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> came to my Seat and asked me how I should vote on
							the question to reduce the Commissioner’s Salary— I said against it— He
							said he believed he should do the same.— I said the whole Scheme would
							prove a humbug—</p>

						<p><persRef ref="codman-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Codman</persRef>, a young man from Boston, brought me a Letter of
							introduction from <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef>— He
							says <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> resided at New-York, and was
							a brother of the Codman’s of Boston.— He said he was pursuing some
							revolutionary pension claim for a soldier who enlisted about the time of
							the dark day—and asked me if I could tell him when that was.— I told him
							it was in May 1780— I thought the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— But
							afterwards I found in the Massachusetts Register for 1836. it was on the
								19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— In looking over my files of
							Letters I found in one of them a Petition for a Revolutionary Pension
							which I had over looked— And six or seven cases of applications for
							information at the Departments— I took four of them to the Pension
							Office and left them with the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner
								Edwards</persRef> for answers to the Enquiries— I met there <persRef
								ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef> of New-York, <persRef
								ref="fletcher-isaac">Isaac Fletcher</persRef> of Vermont with
								<persRef ref="fletcher-charles">his Son</persRef>; and <persRef

								ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef> sent for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards to go to him; so that I could not
							make the enquiries personally of him— I called upon the Secretary
							himself, who was engaged—but one of the waiters shewed me into his
							private chamber where he soon came to me— I left with him the Letter of
							the <persRef ref="cornell-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								William M. Cornell</persRef> of Quincy recommending <persRef
								ref="wood-william6">W. H. Wood</persRef>, son of <persRef
								ref="wood-henry2">Henry Wood</persRef> for admission as a Cadet at
							West-Point this or the next year— He asked if there was not one from my
							Congressional District— I said there was—<persRef ref="tower-zealous"
								>Zealous B Tower</persRef>—appointed at my nomination and twice
							successively reported as the head of his Class. But he is to be
							graduated in 1841 and then there will be a vacancy of a cadet from that
							District.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett said he would have
							the name of W. H. Wood, entered as a Candidate upon my recommendation
							for 1841. and he kept the recommendatory Letter of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell to me, to be put on the files— I
							spoke to him of the Memorial from the American Philosophical Society,
							which I have presented to the House, and of its reference to a select
							Committee.— I asked him if he could furnish me with a copy of the
							circular from the English Royal Society concerning combined magnetical
							observations— He said he had it not; but thought he could procure it, by
							writing to <persRef ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Du Ponceau</persRef>— From the War Department I went to the
							Department of State, and conversed with <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>— I found that the
							distribution of the Alliance Prize Money, belonged to neither of those
							Departments, but to the Treasury— I had also much conversation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth respecting the case of the
							Africans captured in the ship L’Amistad; and of the demands for
							delivering up persons upon the demand of foreign Governments— He said
							the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of
								<persRef ref="holmes-george">Holmes</persRef> was to be delivered
							this day.— I had intended to devote a part of this day to returning
							visits of which I owe a multitude— But when I came back from the
							Departments it was past 2 O’Clock—too late for visiting— I only left a
							Card for <persRef ref="grinnell-moses">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Fire yesterday and this day—part of each day— </p>
						<p>I attended public worship this morning at the Presbyterian Church where
								<persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef> preached from Psalm 12.6 [“]The words of the Lord,
							are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven
							times.” It was a discourse upon the excellency of the Bible; and
							incomparably the most pleasing to me of any that I have ever heard from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood— He spoke of its prophetical,
							its historical and its doctrinal character. well—of <persRef
								ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>, the father of the faithful—of
								<persRef ref="isaac">Isaac</persRef>—of <persRef ref="jacob"
								>Jacob</persRef>. of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, and All
							the prophets—of Jesus and the Apostles.— He laid down in terms as clear
							and explicit as the gospel of Christ, that the salvation of Sinners
							depended upon their belief in Jesus, manifested by works— And surely
							that is the doctrine of the new Testament— Faith is belief, and the
							difficulty is to understand how far our faith depends upon our own
							will.— Belief is an operation of the immortal soul— It is a property
							belonging only to man of all the animal creation— Faith is confidence in
							the word of another—and Faith is fidelity to your own word— These two
							properties are entirely distinct from each other; and yet seem to be
							indissolubly connected together— A man must be devoted to Truth himself,
							to believe in the truth of another—and by the reverse of the position—
							He who believes in the truth of another will always be himself faithful—
							But whom and what are we to believe? Experience of the world, teaches
							distrust and confidence is a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom, as
							was said by <persRef ref="pitt-william">Lord Chatham</persRef>. Belief
							therefore, to be rational presupposes a diligent search after truth, and
							a sound judgment.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood gave notice that
							divine service would hereafter be regularly performed here after in that
							Church at the usual hours every Sunday. He was chosen last Tuesday
							Pastor of the Church— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church. <persRef ref="boyd-fw">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F.
								W. Boyd</persRef> read the Evening service for Sexagesima Sunday,
							and preached from John 5.40. “And ye will not come to me, that ye might
							have life.” How stands the grammar of that sentence?— <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef> was there and walked
							home with me, but would not come in— I am so absorbed in temporalities
							that I prepared an estimate of the cost of an Observatory; to be
							appended to the Report on the Smithsonian bequest Bill— This was
							suggested by <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> D. D. Barnard</persRef> on returning the manuscript
							Report, which I communicated to him, and which he approves— <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here this Evening. I
							received 11 Petitions, and sundry Letters, among which two from <persRef
								ref="lewis-charles">Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Pierce</persRef> at Brooklyn, Long Island, one from <persRef
								ref="williams-nathaniel">N. F. Williams</persRef> of Baltimore, one

						<p>Going to the Capitol this morning I met a man named <persRef

							vouch his claim as an invalid pensioner for service during the last War,

							Bill were read, discussed and amended, and one of the Sections struck
							out— The discussion upon the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> was begun
							and left unfinished when the time for the meeting of the house came—
							This was the alternate Monday for receiving Resolutions—but upwards of
							two hours were consumed upon a motion of <persRef ref="jones-john9">John

							the special order of the day— He moved to suspend the Rules but failed

								>Campbell</persRef> moved that the Committee of Elections should

								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>

							Memorial against the election of <persRef ref="baker-osmyn">Osmyn
								Baker</persRef> for the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> District of
							Massachusetts— There was a wrangling debate upon this Resolution
							terminated only by the previous question, and two votes of yeas and
							nays— The leave was given in both cases.— At last about half past 2. The
							call for Resolutions commenced with the Territory of Iowa— Several of
							the members attempted to squeeze in Petitions memorials and Resolutions
							of State Legislatures, and <persRef ref="rariden-james"
								>Rariden</persRef> of Indiana moved a suspension of the rules to let
							in a reference to a Committee of some favourite of his own, but failed
							like all the rest— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>
							was calling the State of Kentucky, when after 4 O’Clock a motion to
							adjourn was carried— <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> had
							moved a suspension of the Rules for a Resolution to continue four days
							longer the daily reception of Petitions, but he failed; and his real
							object was not to receive petitions but to bring up again the Cumberland

							he had received several memorials praying for the rescinding the rule of
							28 Jan<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> and enquired if I had any— I had—
							And said as his State would be called before mine, I wished him to move
							the Resolution to rescind; which if no other member should do before the
							Call of my State I should do myself— He said he would— I had one
							memorial from Boston, signed by more than 100 names—none of whom were
							personally known to me— I took it to <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi

							persuade me to draw and present for him a petition for an <hi

							and certificated sound— In April 1830: he was discharged for disability;
							but his discharge did not attest that his disability occurred while on

							rupture— He had quarreled with <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore

							treated him, both now dead, and had not a shadow of evidence to shew his

							amendment proposed by <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
							Johnson</persRef>— The house by a close party vote 95 to 91. sustained

								>Smith</persRef> of Maine and <persRef ref="campbell-john7"
								>Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina, who is sick—confined to his
							chamber, and was not notified.— I presented my Report, of which I
							briefly stated the contents. The Committee authorised me to present to
							the house and move to be printed— The additional Sections, and the
							Estimates were read and authority was given me to report them with the
							Bill— Also the Messages of 6 and 7. December 1838. and any other
							Document at my discretion. Dixon H. Lewis proposed to report a
							Counterproject for the establishment of an agricultural School, on
								<persRef ref="fleischmann-charles">Fleischman’s</persRef> plan— It
							was agreed that he should present to the House his counter projet at his
							leisure, and that it should also be printed.— Lewis declared his
							aversion to the acceptance of the bequest, which he said only gave
							trouble to Congress by diverting their attention and consuming their
							time upon subjects not suitable for their Legislation— He asked again
							that a motion might be made to have Fleischman’s Memorial at the last
							Session of Congress reprinted; which was agreed to— In the House, the
							New-Jersey election case was brought up at once. <persRef
								ref="johnston-charles2">Johnson</persRef> of New-York, moved a
							Resolution for an investigation into a dirty bargain by the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> of the house given to <persRef
								ref="langtree-samuel">Langree</persRef>— But <persRef
								ref="smith-truman">Truman Smith</persRef> of Connecticut had the
							floor and declined yielding it— He made a Speech of three hours in
							answer to <persRef ref="fisher-charles">Fisher’s</persRef> most
							disingenuous Speech of yesterday— Smith was followed by <persRef
								ref="rives-francis">Rives</persRef> of Virginia about half an
							hour—very angry and very dull— Then by <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> of Ohio, one of the blustering bullies of the
							house— Noisy and surly— He began by saying that there had been enough
							said on the subject, and that he would move the previous question—and
							then he launched into standing common-place declamation and vulgar
							abuse, till he acknowledged that he could not fairly move the previous
							question— <persRef ref="crabb-george2">Crabbe</persRef> a whig member of
							the Committee then got the floor to take it back from him by pretending
							that he had not finished—but in vain— Crabbe kept the floor and after
							twice taking the yeas and nays, the House adjourned— I went into the
							Senate, to give <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Bill for reinforcing the collection of the revenue, and went through the
							remainder of it from the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section; and
							after raising and amending it the Chairman was unanimously directed to

							One enclosing a Letter from <persRef ref="cook-edward">Edward
								Cook</persRef> urgently pressing the passage of a bill to repeal the

							question was finally taken, and the Bill failed by a tie— Adams, Slade,
							Tillinghast and Mitchell ayes—and Dromgoole, Worthington, Davis and
							Eastman, nays— Nisbet if he had been present would have voted with them—
							The other communication from the Secretary was with enclosures proposing
							a repeal of the drawback upon exported sugars— The consideration of

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Connell</persRef>, with a young man named <persRef
								ref="blight-charles">Charles Blight</persRef>, not the petitioner on
							behalf of the heirs of <persRef ref="fulton-robert">Robert
								Fulton</persRef> but a relative of that family.— Also from <persRef
								ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pettrich</persRef> the Sculptor, who invited me to his Studio where
							he has his fisherman’s daughter, and a young hunter executed in
							marble.—and which he said <persRef ref="keim-george">General
								Keim</persRef> had bespoken— Keim a patron of the arts! Pettrich
							told me that he had executed a Colossal Statue of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, and several Busts,
							from the Quarry of marble near Frederick, in Maryland of which he had
							spoken to me two years ago as just discovered by him— He says it has
							since been explored— It is found to be one solid rock, of such extent
							that it will furnish an inexhaustible supply of marble superior in
							quality to the finest of Carrara.— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>My wife</persRef> is still confined to her bed, with a racking
							Catarrhal cough.— <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef> went to bed sick last
							Night, and between one and 2 this morning I left the Bed chamber, and
							made my couch of the Sopha in my chamber, which <persRef
								ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goods</persRef>
							had occupied— She went in to M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams— I
							wasted the morning in Newspaper reading. At the House <persRef
								ref="medill-william">William Medill</persRef> of Ohio, a member of
							the Committee of Elections had the floor; and after another abortive
							attempt of <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> to get the
							rules suspended to six to-morrow, and every day after except Monday for
							the Treasury note Bill, made a speech of about four hours, chiefly of
							invective upon the <persRef ref="pennington-william">Governor</persRef>
							and Council of New-Jersey— He reproduced all the ex parte Documents
							which <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> had read before
							the case was referred to the Committee of Elections; and assumed for the
							first time, that where as in New-Jersey the elections are held by
							ballot, there can be no proof that any votes admitted were illegal— And
							this will ultimately settle the question— He said further, that it had
							been the common practice of receiving votes of unnaturalized foreigners—
								<persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron V. Brown</persRef> of Tennessee,
							after a short Speech, moved the Previous Question.— <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> had moved as an amendment
							to <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson’s</persRef> amendment the
							words lawful, before evidence; and to strike out the word forthwith,
							from the Instructions to the Committee to report—he finally withdrew the
							motion to strike out forthwith, and the first question was on the word
							lawful—96 to 96. carried by the casting vote of the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>— Then came the question on
							Cave Johnson’s amendment thus amended. Carried 103 to 90—and the
							resolution as amended was carried without taking the yeas and nays, and
							almost without a negative vote— <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> then moved to adjourn—over till Monday— After a
							long struggle, and a count by tellers to take the question by yeas and
							nays, when decided to be so taken, the motion was rejected 62 to 93. and
							close to 8. O’Clock the House adjourned— <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas"
								>Thomas</persRef> was there and walked with me home— It is now clear
							that the commissioned members from New Jersey will fail to prove the
							illegality of the votes by which their competitors had the majority of
							all the votes delivered; and that for this failure the adversary members
							will be forced upon the house and the Country— As usual, the whig
							absentees from the house, have left the field in possession of the
							enemy.</p>

							very body of corruption— At the House the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> commenced the day by calling for Reports from
							Committees. The Committee of Claims alone, consumed upwards of an hour
							in presenting Bills, and unfavourable reports— The latter were laid on
							the table, and some of them ordered to be printed— The Bills were read
							twice by their titles, and referred to the Committee of the whole House,
							and made the order of the day for to-morrow; the general formula even
							when the morrow comes on Sunday, and there is no sitting of the house.
							It means the first chance that may turn up in the Chaos of public
							business; or that the influence and importunity of the Member having
							charge of it may bring to bear upon the House— The Committee of Commerce
							was then called, and their <persRef ref="curtis-edward">Chairman
								Curtis</persRef> presented several Reports; but upon the approach of
							2. O’Clock <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> called for
							the orders of the day— A feeble effort was made to take up private

							for continuing the Office of Commissioner of Pensions, and for
							transferring to him the Navy Pension fund—
								Carried<space/>to<space/><persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garret

							the transfer of the Navy Pension fund from the Navy Department to the
							Commissioner of Pensions—which he thought the Officers of the Navy would

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell</persRef> that it had not

								>President</persRef> p. 536 on which the bill is founded— The house
