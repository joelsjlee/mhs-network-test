						<p>From 11. in the morning till 4 P.M. there were a succession of friendly
							visitors, as has been usual on the New years day since we left the
							President’s House. Neither <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> nor <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>
							received visitors, and I was left to entertain the Ladies as I could—
							This ceremony grows more and more irksome to me every year. The young
							and the prosperous may take pleasure in the recollections of the past
							and the anticipations of the future which associate themselves with the
							commencement of the year, but the idea which ought first and last to
							present itself to the mind of one who has already past through so many
							New years days as I have, is the great probability that it will be the
							last.— Among the visitors of this day were <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Scott</persRef>, who has been
							recently talked of as a whig candidate for the Office of President of
							the United States— <persRef ref="harrison-william">William H.
								Harrison</persRef> was however preferred both to him and to <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>. A very curious philosophical
							history of parties might be made by giving a catalogue raisonné of the
							Candidates for the Presidency voted for in the electoral Colleges since
							the establishment of the Constitution of the United States— It would
							contain a History of the influence of the Presidential Office upon the
							Government of the United States, and the reaction of the Government upon
							the President’s Office— Would not the retrospect furnish as practical
							principles in the operation of the Constitution— 1. That the direct, and
							infallible path to the Presidency is military service, coupled with
							demagogue policy— 2. That in the absence of military service, demagogue
							policy is the first and most indispensable element of success, and the
							art of party drilling is the second. 3. That the drill consists in
							combining the Southern interest in domestic Slavery, with the Northern
							riotous democracy— 4 That this policy and drill first organized by
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef> first
							accomplished his election, and established the Virginia dynasty of 24
							years a perpetual practical contradiction of its own principles— 5. That
							the same policy and drill invigorated by success and fortified by
							experience has now placed <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van
								Buren</persRef> in the Presidential chair, and disclosed to the
							unprincipled ambition of the North the art of rising upon the principles
							of the South and 6. That it has exposed in broad day the overruling
							influence of the institution of domestic Slavery upon the history and
							policy of this Union— How this power may be counteracted is no deep
							mystery, but I have not time to set the machine in motion, and shall say
							nothing about it; but leave it to posterity to wait the good time of the
							Lord— Meanwhile the consummation of the Peace and Alliance between Van
							Buren and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> was manifested
							by the appearance of Calhoun, this day at the New year’s gathering at
							the President’s House— My Grand daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef> was ill, confined to her bed the whole of
							this day <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Smith</persRef> went to <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">her husband</persRef>— The weather was
							fine but intensely cold. In the Evening I went to the Theatre, and saw
							<persRef ref="vandenhoff-john;vandenhoff-charlotte">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Vanden Hoff</persRef> in
							<persRef ref="knowles-james3">Sheridan Knowles’s</persRef> Tragedy of the Wife—or a Tale of Mantua—and in the
							farce of Catherine and Petruchio, from <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> Taming of the Shrew—
							The plot of the Tragedy is concocted from the Vicar of Wakefield and
								<persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef> Zaïre, and all
							the humour of the farce consisted in the smacking of Petrucchio’s whip—
							Home at Midnight.</p>

						<p>One of the severest trials of cold weather that I have known in this
							City— <persRef ref="bates-joshua2">Doctor Bates</persRef> heretofore
							President of the College at Burlington in the State of Vermont paid me a
							morning visit, and told me that at the last annual commencement of that
							institution, he had resigned the Office which he had held many years. He
							said that his motive for resigning was that he had found by experience
							that as he grew old his faculties for the exercise of Government over
							boys were failing— He believed that a middle-aged man, was better suited
							to those functions— He had therefore concluded to retire from there and
							seek for some occasion by which he might settle down, as the Minister of
							some country parish— He was going to pass the winter at the South, and
							had already been several weeks here.— He had not offered himself as a
							Candidate for the chaplaincy of the House, but some of his friends had
							offered to propose his name, and if he should be elected it would be
							very acceptable to defray his expenses for the winter— He said he was
							preparing an elementary Book for college exercises, upon the
							Constitution of the United States— He was desirous of knowing my
							particular views with regard to the questions of State rights—State
							Sovereignty and nullification— He had seen them so far as they were
							exposed in my 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July Oration at Quincy
							in 1839. and enquired if I had enlarged upon them since that time— I
							said I had in a 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July Oration at
							Newbury Port in 1837. and more especially in the Jubilee of the
							Constitution at New-York on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of

								>Mary-Louisa</persRef> continues confined to her bed, and gives me
							extreme uneasiness— <persRef ref="sweeny-george">M<hi

							to the joint Committee on the Smithsonian bequest last Winter came to
							enquire if his services would not be again wanted now— I said they
							would, if the Committee should ask and obtain permission to employ a
							clerk— I asked him to procure copies of all the documents which have
							been hitherto published in relation to the subject— He said he had most
							of them and would endeavour to procure the rest— M<hi rend="superscript"

							to the Legislature to recall the Senators from the State in the U.S.
							Senate—a step which I thought not expedient— I said that as it would be
							voluntary they could not complain of being unrepresented— And as the
							Senators must ultimately return, there might be aukwardness in fixing on
							the time for it— <persRef ref="dunglison-robley">D<hi rend="superscript"

								>Elizabeth Pierce</persRef> this morning; both craving my influence
							which is nothing in support of their claim, and soliciting charity or

							proclaimed that the rights of the South had been assailed, by <persRef
								ref="chinn-thomas">Chinn’s</persRef> motion to suspend the rules,
							for a Resolution to refer the abolition Petitions to a select Committee—
							For this inflammatory appeal to the South, <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>, Jenifer, and
								<persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Ogden Hoffman</persRef>, had scarified
							Bynum severely— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> then
							moved the previous question— Bynum asked him to withdraw it, that he
							might reply to the personal attack of three members upon him. Garland
							refused and Bynum said it was the practice of the party to get three or
							four of their <hi rend="italic">bullies</hi> to insult a Gentleman in
							the debate; and then to deny him the opportunity to reply— Jenifer said
							that he had not heard the use of the term <hi rend="italic"
							>bullies</hi>, in Bynum’s remarks, and if he had should probably not
							have noticed it—for ever since the memorable 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of June 1836. he had made it a point of honour, never to
							notice any thing said by that member. But here was a publication in the
							Globe, in which Bynum was said to have charged him with being a
							bully—three days had passed over and it had not been disavowed— Jenifer
							then lowered the tone of his voice and I did not hear what he said; but
							Bynum heard and smarted under it— He avowed the use of the word bullies,
							and said his remarks had been correctly reported in the Globe— That he
							had used the word bullies in a political sense, and if it was offensive
							they might substitute the words political champions— That ever since the
								7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1836, he had on his part
							made it a rule to notice nothing said in this house by Jenifer, but if
							he meant to insinuate that on that occasion, any the slightest deviation
							by him from the point of the most punctilious honour, he denied it and
							defied him— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanley</persRef> then rose and
							said that at the last Session of Congress he had made remarks with the
							express intention of insulting Bynum, and had told him and the house so
							at the time—that Bynum had blustered much about what he would do out of
							the house; but he, Stanley had never heard a word from him on the
							subject from that day to this— Here the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> interposed— Stanly told Bynum that he was a
							beggar of his life and of whatever character he had left, and Bynum told
							Stanly he was a puppy—whereupon <persRef ref="keim-george"
								>Keim</persRef> pronounced a flatulent panegyric upon <persRef
								ref="potter-william">W. W. Potter</persRef> who died last Summer,
							and offered the usual resolutions of deep sensibility and to wear crape
							30 days and the house adjourned— On my return home I found <persRef
								ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas’s</persRef>
							gig standing at the door, and he told me <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef> was very sick— He was here four times this day; and
							at Midnight had 8 leeches applied to her stomach— <persRef

								ref="williams-henry4">Henry Williams</persRef> absent. There were

								ref="alvord-james">James C. Alvord</persRef> the Representative
							elect from the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District
							of Massachusetts should be announced to the House—and 2. what disposal
							should be made of the several sets of Resolves of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts adopted last Spring after the close of the Session of
							Congress; copies of which have been received by us all from the
							Secretary of the Commonwealth. After some discussion it was agreed that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun was the most proper person to
							announce the death of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alvord, having been
							much acquainted with him personally, and representing the district
							adjoining that for which he had been elected— And as to the resolves it
							was agreed that I should present one set of them; which ever I pleased,
							and distribute the others to be offered by other members of the
							delegation as I should designate— In the House <persRef
								ref="evans-george2">G. Evans</persRef> by leave introduced a Bill
							making a partial appropriation for the support of Government for the
							year 1840— The Bill for paying the members of both Houses their
							compensation, and the Officers and expenses of the Houses— This bill is
							usually introduced by the Committee of Ways and Means and passes through
							both Houses like a flash of lightening— But the Chairman and sundry
							members of the Committee of Ways and Means are gone for Christmas
							Holidays, and the Committee have not yet had a meeting. So Evans
							introduced it by his own authority. It was twice read; referred to a
							Committee of the whole House on the State of the Union <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair, reported to the
							House without amendment—engrossed for a third reading and passed, all
							within the compass of a quarter of an hour— <persRef
								ref="ramsey-william">Ramsay</persRef> of Pennsylvania moved a
							suspension of the rules to present a petition from Philadelphia against
							the election of <persRef ref="naylor-charles">Charles Naylor</persRef>—
							The vote upon the suspension of the rules was<space/>to 67. not two—
							Then came <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompsons</persRef> motion
							to reconsider the order for 5000 copies extra of a map of Florida
							appended to the report of the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
								War</persRef> accompanying the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President’s</persRef> Message— It appeared that the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> of the House had given the
							engraving of this map as a job to <persRef ref="langtree-samuel"
								>Langtree</persRef> the Editor of the Democratic Review— After some

								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Smith</persRef> of Maine took part, the order
							for the 5000 copies extra of the map was reconsidered, without a

						<p>No language can express the feelings which agitate and convulse my frame,

								>Child’s</persRef> disease is wasting her by degrees as it did

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> from Nehemiah
							8.10.—for the joy of the Lord is your strength— And in the afternoon at

							read the service for the second Sunday after Christmas, and preached

							spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord, 3. and shall make him
							of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge
							after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his
							ears.” The condition of my mind is a state of excitement equivalent to
							stupefaction— I cannot command its attention, and have scarcely any
							memory of what passes around me— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward</persRef> of Boston, an elderly

							History of the Bible, but could get through only a few pages, upon the
							condition of <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef> and <persRef ref="eve"
								>Eve</persRef> in Paradise. It was insupportable— I then turned to
							the Report of Education in Europe, by <persRef ref="bache-alexander"
								>Alexander Dallas Bache</persRef> President of the Girard College at
							Philadelphia, to the Trustees of that Institution by whom in the year
							1836. he was sent to Europe to visit the Charitable foundations of
							schools in the principal Countries of that region; and to collect and
							digest such information respecting their history, organization and
							management as may be useful to the institution at Philadelphia. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bache was absent upwards of two years; and
							this 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> volume of 666 pages is the result
							of his researches and enquiries— It is divided into two parts the first
							of which consisting of three chapters is confined to the description,
							history and examination of Orphan house schools and institutions for the
							education of destitute children in Great Britain, Germany and Holland.
							The second and most voluminous part relates to institutions for
							education in general, of which there are 13 chapters and an appendix of
							13 documents. The existing School systems of Great Britain, France,

							has been utterly impossible for me to think about that matter, and I
							requested him to call again in a fortnight which he promised— <persRef
								ref="feuchtwanger-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Feuchtwanger</persRef> was here more than two years ago at the
							special Session of Congress with a project for coining cents of the
							metal called German silver— He had brought me then a Letter
							recommendatory from <persRef ref="abert-john">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> J. J. Abert</persRef>, and brought another of the same
							kind now. His project for a German silver coinage met with no
							encouragement then but he reproduces it now with an improvement— It was
							objected that his german silver cent would be mistaken for a dime—his
							guard against which is a round hole near the centre of the cent, an
							expedient which I did not approve;—but he has now a mineralogical
							cabinet to dispose of very cheap, for the purchase of which he supposes
							the Smithsonian bequest would supply funds; which again—I did not
							approve— At the House, <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John
								Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina chairman of the Committee of
							Elections moved Resolutions that all the papers relating to the
							contested New-Jersey election should be referred to that Committee, and
							that notice of this reference should be served upon the ten claimants of
							the five New-Jersey seats.— But <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef>
							of Tennessee offered as privileged question a Resolution that the five
							claimants having not the commission of the <persRef
								ref="pennington-william">Governor</persRef>; but a certificate from
							the <persRef ref="shunk-francis">Secretary of the State</persRef>, that
							they had the majority of all the votes returned, were not entitled to
							Seats in the house— He raised this as a privileged question from the
							fact of which he said he had been informed that these persons had been
							from the commencement of the Session in constant attendance upon the
							house; occupying Seats with their names on the desks; exercising the
							franking privilege and receiving stationary from the Officers of the
							House— There was much dodging and skulking, and equivocating to evade
							the question in this form, till at last <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef> said he was authorised to say that since the
							decision of the House against the Commissions of the Governor, the
							adverse party did not claim a right to sit at present as members— A
							dirty trick was then tried to get Campbell’s Resolutions, admitted for
							consideration by general consent, when <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> sprung the previous question upon them.— This was
							defeated by <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef>— I had
							moved as a preliminary Resolution to those of Campbell that the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> be directed to inform the
							Executive Government of New-Jersey that the Commission issued by the
							Governor to the five members from the State had been rejected by the
							House.— I had suggested this Resolution to <persRef

							to receive Campbell’s Resolutions, for which Bell immediately moved a
							substitute, in which at Randolph’s request he introduced my motion that
							the Speaker should inform the Governor of New-Jersey of the rejection of
							his Commissions— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> took

						<p>The <persRef ref="adams-mary4">child</persRef> still lives, and <persRef
								ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef>
							has a trembling hope that her life may yet be spared— Some of the most
							alarming symptoms have abated, but others remain, and agonize the hearts
							of the <persRef ref="hellen-mary">mother</persRef> and parents by duty
							of the fatherless sufferer— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas
								Frye</persRef> was here this morning, and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thomas as for the last week four times in the course of the
							day. To me, all my occupations of business are inexpressibly irksome;
							and it is with extreme difficulty that I have kept this diary from
							running again into irretrievable arrears— I have yet been punctual in my
							attendance upon the house, but my attention to its business is much
							disabled, and my correspondence suffers beyond all redemption. At the
							House, <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell’s</persRef> substitute for the
							Resolutions offered by <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>
							as chairman of the Committee of elections, was the business of the day;
							but <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of Ohio had the
							floor, and was delivered of the three hours speech with which he has
							been labouring ever since he lost the floor, by tardiness of attendance
							at the Meeting of the House.— Duncan is a democrat of the rabid species,
							violent and furious, and always exposing his nakedness without reserve—
							He seizes instinctively the points of a discussion which bear upon
							popular intellect and feeling, and fills them with a rattlesnake’s
							venom— He is persevering and laborious, collecting with the industry of
							an emmet multitude of facts trifling in themselves, but to which he
							gives weight by cumulation— His application of facts to principles is
							cunning and ingenious; but with so total a disregard to truth, that of
							this he seems to have no moral perception. He can hardly be charged with
							wilful falsehood; for his passions have deluded him before they attempt
							to pass their deceptions upon others— His abuse of the <persRef
								ref="pennington-william">Governor</persRef> and Council of
							New-Jersey in this speech was sublimated by the dread of my motion that
							the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> should inform them of
							the rejection by the House of the Governor’s Commissions— He charged
							them with Treason— Said he was no friend to capital punishments, and
							doubted the right of Government to take the lives of men— But that if
							any men upon earth deserved to be executed, it was this Governor and
							Council of New-Jersey— He said he rejoiced at their reelection this year
							though a majority of 4000 of the people of New-Jersey were against them,
							because the democracy in the midst of their triumphs wanted some slight
							check to keep the spur on their vigilance— He wandered to the Harrisburg
							Convention discoursed about prayer, and cited numerous cases of prayer
							by the Patriarchs and prophets in the bible— Thus he completed his three
							hours; after which <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> of Virginia
							took the floor for a metaphysical speech— There was some wrangling about
							references of certain parts of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President’s</persRef> Message to the Committees; and about 4
							O’Clock the House adjourned. Our Coachman <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas"

							looking better than I had seen him for many years— He told me the

						<p>The abatement of the most immediately dangerous symptoms of our <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">child’s</persRef> disease continues, and we are
							permitted to hope that she may restored to our humbled and longing
							affections. Yet is she still in a condition so dangerous and critical,
							that I was not permitted this day to visit her chamber— The fever has
							intermitted, but not yet wholly subsided; and there is some
							encouragement in the fact, that the Doctors visits were this day reduced
							to three— At the House, <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall</persRef> appeared,
							returned last Evening from his Christmas and New-Years visits to Salem.
							No appearance yet of the reception of petitions, but <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence</persRef> obtained the reference of a memorial upon the
							present condition of our commerce with China, to the Committee of
							foreign Affairs— An explosion of Opium smuggling in that Country, has
							brought the celestial empire in collision with John Bull, and the
							British Government threaten to blockade all the ports of China. This has
							grievously alarmed our merchants, who thereupon memorialize Congress for
							protection— The report of the Committee on the revisal of the rules was
							the special order of this day at 1 O’Clock but <persRef ref="botts-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Botts</persRef> of Virginia had
							the floor on <persRef ref="bell-john">Bells</persRef> substitute; for
								<persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell’s</persRef> Resolutions on
							the New-Jersey election, and to accommodate him, the consideration of
							the report of the Committee on the rules was postponed till next
							Tuesday, and the temporary adoption of the old rules was continued till
							next Thursday— Botts made a powerful and eloquent Speech of more than
							two hours, but in which with the true Virginian maggot in his head, he
							took the position that there was and could be no contested election,
							because there was no law either of Congress or of the State of New
							Jersey for regulating contested elections.— He said there had been an
							act of Congress passed in 1798 for two years, continued in 1800 for four
							years and then suffered to expire— And he argued that since then there
							could be no contested election from New-Jersey— But there is a Law in
							New-Jersey for regulating elections, and the Constitution of the United
							States makes that quo ad hoc the Law of the Union, so long as Congress
							itself makes no Law on the subject— And then the House by the
							Constitutional power to judge of the returns qualifications and
							elections of its members, decides the contest of which party has been
							duly elected, conformably to the Statute Law of New-Jersey.— There was
							thus a crack in the corner stone of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Botts’s argument; but the superstructure was fair and solid— He scourged
								<persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of Ohio and
								<persRef ref="smith-albert2">Smith</persRef> of Maine; but they have
							the skin of the Rhinoceros.— When he closed <persRef ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> of New-Jersey took
							the floor, but though a sensible man, and not a bad Speaker, he was so
							much less interesting than Botts that the House grew impatient, and the
							members slunk away till there was scarcely <unclear>an</unclear> Quorum left. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Randolph sent to the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef> table sundry affidavits to be
							read; and they became so tedious, that three successive motions to
							adjourn were made, and taken by yeas and nays, the last of which after
							4. O’Clock succeeded. In the Evening I wrote a Letter to <persRef
								ref="curry-george">George L. Curry</persRef> President of the Boston
							Mechanic Apprentice’s Library Association, to send with a copy of my
							Address to them.</p>

								<persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> of Maine; all
							against the Commissions of the <persRef ref="pennington-william"
								>Governor of New-Jersey</persRef>— Clifford introduced as a part of
							his Speech the paper which the Clerk <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Hugh A.
								Garland</persRef> had prepared and attempted to produce for his own
							vindication at the commencement of the Session— The election of a
							Printer had been made the special order for this day, at 1. O’Clock; but
							Starkweather having taken the floor and being in the midst of a flaming
							speech—a question was made that the unfinished business took precedence
							of special orders, and the Speaker so decided, against the practice of
							the house of late years, though a decision to the same effect by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell, when Speaker was produced— <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> of Ohio appealed from the
							decision, and there was a confused discussion upon it— The
							administration party were evidently determined not to go into the
							election of printer this day, for it seems some of the members on whose
							votes they depend are absent— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>,
							who has the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> under his
							special protection to avoid appeals from his decisions is always
							interposing to have the questions brought up in other forms; he
							prevailed upon Giddings to withdraw his appeal, but it was immediately
							renewed by another member.— Then the previous question was called and
							seconded, and my name was about to be called; and I enquired what the
							decision of the Speaker was: for a distinction had been taken between a
							special order of the day and a postponement of a debate to a day certain
							which I did not understand, and of which I asked an explanation— But the
							appeal was again withdrawn and the yeas and nays were not taken. So the
							decision of the Speaker stands, and henceforth the unfinished business
							takes precedence of all special orders— The result will be to increase
							the arbitrary power of the majority who will always stop the debate upon
							unfinished business by the previous question, when it suits their
							purpose, and always consume the day on the unfinished business, when
							they wish to postpone the special order.— The <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef> Dissertation upon the Lex
							Parliamentaria was not half read through when the house adjourned— I
							despatched the copy of my address to the Members of the Boston, Mechanic
							Apprentices Library Association, with a Letter to their <persRef
								ref="curry-george">President George L. Curry</persRef>: and I looked
							up some of the Documents relating to the Smithsonian bequest which had

							reports of a system of meteorological observations at the various
							military posts of the United States established by <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							when he was Secretary at War in 1819. The object was to combine in the
							result comparative statistical information of the different climates
							with medical observations of prevailing diseases— The observations have
							accordingly been simultaneously made and registered for a series of
							twenty years, but no comparison between them or deduction from them has
							been published— This work D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forry has
							undertaken and prepared, but it will not pay for the expense of its
							publication without some assistance. The memorial was on the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month referred in the Senate to
							a select Committee consisting of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun,
								<persRef ref="linn-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Linn</persRef> and <persRef ref="spence-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Spence</persRef>. It has not yet been
							presented to the House, but D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forry gave me
							a printed copy of it, and commended it specially to my care. At the
							House the day began by the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef>
							reading the remainder of his Dissertation upon the Lex Parliamentaria
							concerning contested elections, as a part of <persRef
								ref="clifford-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathan
								Clifford’s</persRef> Speech— The reading took about half an hour and
							the remnant of Clifford’s speech two hours more Clifford is apparently a
							fluent young Lawyer, who has made himself a reputation by much speaking
							and by speaking much— What he said to the purpose might have been
							delivered in five minutes; but he discoursed by chapters and sections
							producing vouchers, documents and authorities to demonstate what no one
							denied—to set up men of straw as his adversary champions, knocking them
							down as formidable opponents and crowing over the victories that he
							achieved. There is not so much of the Tyger in his temper as in most of
							the leading democrats. Before Clifford commenced this morning <persRef
								ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> demanded an explanation of <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef>. Botts had in his speech
							charged Andrew Jackson with being a tyrant Smith stuffed his answer to
							this charge with a fulsome Eulogy upon Jackson, declared that the charge
							of his being a tyrant was a foul and groundless slander, and that
							history would give the lie to all such imputations— Botts said this
							language was personally offensive to him and called upon Smith to say
							explicitly whether he meant to apply it to him— Smith answered without
							hesitation that he did not intend to apply it to Botts, and that it was
							his invariable intention to treat every member upon the floor with
							respect— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> said he had
							not understood the remarks of Smith as intended to be personal or that
							he should have called him to order, and Botts said that after the
							unequivocal and explicit disclaimer of the Gentleman from Maine it was
							unnecessary that he should say any thing further— It was 3 O’Clock when
							Clifford closed and the floor was taken by <persRef ref="cooper-james"
								>Cooper</persRef> of Pennsylvania, a new member who began as if he
							was labouring with a set Speech; whereupon a motion was made to adjourn—
							The yeas and nays were called and refused and the House adjourned till
							Monday Noon— Our dear <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>

						<p>Yesterday the snow in the streets was rapidly melting away, and last
							evening when I went to bed there was a heavy fall of rain— As daylight
							came on this morning I found on looking out of my window, the street
							covered with snow, in a coat as thick as that of the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of last month—since which the snow has
							never disappeared— This morning after Sunrise the sky cleared away—the
							day was fair and warm—the walking in the Streets bad. I heard at the
							Presbyterian Church <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wood</persRef>—from Luke 13.3. [“]I tell you, Nay: but
							except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.” In preaching with much
							earnestness the duty of repentance M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood
							struck upon the Calvinistic snag, that the unregenerate sinner can do
							nothing to secure his own Salvation if he would— He started the
							objection without attempting to answer it.— After dinner I went out to
							attend at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church, but as I
							approached it, a young man on horseback passing that way told me there
							was to be no service there this afternoon. I read the remainder of the
							second, and part of the third chapter of <persRef ref="gleig-george"
								>Gleig’s</persRef> history of the Bible; more and more dissatisfied
							with the attempts to argue on the principles of human reason and
							experience, the literal accuracy of the recorded facts— I was engaged
							also part of the day in tracing back the Documents relating to the
							Smithsonian bequest. <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson’s</persRef> Message of 17. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							1835. was received by the Senate on the 21<hi rend="superscript"

								Crittenden</persRef>— On the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							January 1836. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leigh made the report of
							that Committee, with a joint Resolution to authorize and enable the
							President of the United States to recover the bequest—it appropriated
							5000 dollars, to defray the expenses of the recovery; and pledged the
							faith of the U.S. that the funds should be applied to the declared
							purposes of the <persRef ref="smithson-james">Testator</persRef>.— On
							the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February 1836. this Resolution
							was considered as in Committee of the whole, and on the motion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston laid on the table—on the 30<hi

							passed to be engrossed for a third reading by yeas and nays 31. to 7.
							and on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of May, passed without a
							division. On the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May this Resolution
							was transmitted to the House of Representatives where on the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of December the President’s Message of
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> had been referred to a select

						<p>An Italian Sculptor, or stone-cutter, an old man 70 years of age came
							this morning with a complaint, that he had been employed in the course
							of the last month, at his professional work 16. days, at a dollar and a
							half a day as he had understood; but when the time of payment came only
							8 dollars were tendered to him, which he refused to take, and came to me
							for redress of this grievance— He had a certificate from <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef> dated in 1822.
							that he had faithfully worked 3. years on the University of Virginia,
							and another very kind Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Jefferson— I could only refer him to the Commissioner of Public
							buildings <persRef ref="noland-william">Noland</persRef>, to whom I
							promised to speak in his behalf if I should see him. <persRef
								ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hassler</persRef> also paid me a visit— He is yet employed under the
							direction of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> upon the survey of the Coast, and upon the
							construction of weights and measures for use in the different States—
							But I found him much disposed to take hold of the Smithsonian bequest,
							to which I gave no encouragement. His plan was for the establishment of
							an Astronomical School, before the erection of an Observatory— At the
							head of this Astronomical School he would naturally find his place, and
							would contrive to absorb the whole fund in the management of it— I
							promised again to visit his establishment here, and asked him for
							information, of the prices of the Astronomical instruments which he
							purchased for the U.S. Government at London in 1815. and concerning some
							of the principal Astronomers and astronomical establishments and makers
							of astronomical instruments in Europe at this time.— At the House
								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pickens</persRef> began the day with a blustering explanation, and
							denial of his having had any concern in a bargain, for giving <persRef
								ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> the printing for the House.—
							Some charge in the Madisonian Newspaper— Pickens said that from the
							moment he had heard of the nomination at the Harrisburg Convention there
							had not been an instant of hesitation as to the course he was to pursue.
							After this <persRef ref="cooper-james">Cooper</persRef> of Pennsylvania
							finished his Speech against the exclusion of the New-Jersey
							Members.<space/>of Pennsylvania moved the previous Question upon
								<persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell’s</persRef> Resolutions
								<persRef ref="ramsay-william">Ramsay</persRef> prevailed upon him
							under a promise not to make a speech and to renew the motion, to

							Harrisburg mob last winter and would be one of a mob again if necessary,
							presented his remonstrance against <persRef ref="naylor-charles"
								>Naylor’s</persRef> holding his seat; and demanded as a right, that
							it should be referred to the Committee of Elections. The <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> decided that the motion was
							not privileged: Ramsay appealed from the decision but upon due
							admonition from his own gang, withdrew his appeal and moved a suspension
							of the rules which was refused him— Petitions were call for— <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Smith</persRef> of Maine offered Ramsay’s

						<p>Upon the reading of the Journal in the house, this morning, <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> moved an amendment to
							shew that he had yesterday declared that he had made, and would make no
							motion to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> the abolition Petitions; but
							after about an hour of discussion, a majority of the house rejected the
							proposed amendment— <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef>
							then, the Chairman of the Committee on the revisal of the rules called
							for the special order of the day; which was the report of that
							Committee— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> had
							decided the other day that the unfinished business of the preceding day,
							took precedence in the order of business over the special order for the
							consideration of this same report— On the ground of this decision, I now
							called for the unfinished business of yesterday, the presentation of
							petitions The Speaker decided that it had the preference; but <persRef
								ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> a member of the revisal
							Committee told him he was mistaken, that the presentation of one
							petition was not the unfinished business of the presentation of another
							petition and one of the Clerks told the Speaker that the revisal report
							had been unanimously made the special order of this day—whereupon the
							Speaker reversed the decision he had just made, and pronounced the
							report of the Committee entitled to the preference.— The Speaker had
							taken the ground that the special order by a vote of two thirds
							suspending the rules gave a preference over the unfinished business— He
							now took the ground that the entry on the journal of a special order by
							unanimous consent gave preference once over the unfinished business, and
							I was obliged to submit— The report was taken up— The amendments to the
							rules, proposed by the Committee were trivial and insignificant; with
							one exception— That was a feeble restriction upon the tyrannical abuse
							of the Previous Question. Against this amendment <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef>, many years Speaker of the
							Virginia house of delegates, made an elaborate Speech, and <persRef
								ref="biddle-richard">Richard Biddle</persRef>, a whig of
							considerable talent, but of unsound principle, morose disposition,
							arbitrary temper, and overweening self conceit, with no small portion of
							sneaking craft under a mask of lofty punctilious honour, followed him in
							the same strain. I thought the amendment blasted, and was sure it would
							be so, if I said one word in its favour— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> made a short speech to
							sustain it; and upon taking the yeas and nays, to mu great surprize it
							was carried by a vote of 101 to 95. Adjourned about 4. I sent

							Bill to meet at the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures at half

								>Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina who is chairman of the

						<p>At half past ten this morning, the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest
							Bill met in the Chamber of the Committee of Manufactures— Present Adams,
								<persRef ref="ogle-charles">Ogle</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="shepard-charles">Shepard</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> of Virginia, <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="corwin-thomas">Corwin</persRef>— Absent <persRef
								ref="lewis-dixon">Lewis</persRef> of Alabama, who by accident was
							not notified, and <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, who came in after the meeting adjourned, having been
							engaged on the Committee of Elections— The Bill was read. I proposed
							that the Chairman should be authorized to prepare a Report to be
							submitted to the Committee, containing a review of what has been
							hitherto been done by Congress on the subject and a brief exposition of
							the reasons for the several provisions proposed by the Bill— I proposed
							also that when it should become necessary I should ask the permission of
							the House to employ a Clerk, and to employ <hi rend="strikethrough">a
								Cler</hi>k <persRef ref="sweeny-george">George Sweeney</persRef>
							and that when the report is ready I shall call another meeting of the
							Committee; all which was agreed to una voce. In the House— Campbell of
							South Carolina, moved that the Committee of Elections should be
							permitted to employ a Clerk, opposition was made; but the motion was
							carried with a proviso that the compensation of the Clerk should not
							exceed four dollars a day for the time he should be employed— The report
							of the Committee on the Rules was <hi rend="italic">then</hi> taken up—
							They had reported a Resolution, that after the close of the present
							Session, the desks of the members should be removed from the Hall— I
							objected to it as not in order; it not being within the competency of
							the Committee to report a Resolution which had no relation to the rules
							of the House.— The Speaker decided it to be in order, and <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Banks</persRef> said the decision was right, but
							made a warm speech against the Resolution itself.—and said he agreed
							with me that it was not competent for the Committee to report it.
								<persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> moved to lay
							it on the table which was carried 119 to 52. <persRef ref="coles-walter"
								>Coles</persRef> of Virginia then offered as an amendment to the
								54<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 55<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> rules, the substance of <persRef ref="patton-john"
								>Patton’s</persRef> gag—that all abolition papers and petitions
							shall be laid on the table, without reading—printing debating or any
							other action of the house— I offered at the same time a substitute which
							the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> pronounced out of
							order. Coles moved the previous question upon his resolution, but after
							much haggling to prevail upon him to withdraw his motion, his resolution
							itself was laid on the table by a vote of 102 to 98. Then <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> offered the Resolution
							that the motion to receive abolition petitions and papers shall always
							be laid on the table; and after a speech moved the previous question;
							but upon being taunted with his chivalry by <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Grainger</persRef> and at the supplication of
								<persRef ref="monroe-james2">James Monroe</persRef> he withdrew the
							motion, and opened the flood— <persRef ref="monroe-james2"
								>Monroe</persRef> and Grainger immediately broke out with Speeches,
							followed by <persRef ref="crabb-george2">Crabb</persRef> of Alabama and
								<persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> of Tennessee till
							past four, when <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Cooper</persRef> of Georgia
							took the floor, and the House adjourned— Walked home in Snow— Went to
							the Theatre in the Evening with <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss
								Cutts</persRef>— Saw Mischief-Making—and Foreign Airs and Native
							Graces. <persRef ref="fitzwilliam-edward">He</persRef> and <persRef

								Holmes</persRef> of South-Carolina, and to a distinguished Senator
								(<persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef>) who pronounced
							its gross bribery.—The whole Story was then told in the Globe after its
							own manner, with the charge of bribery upon Mitchell; who had kept no
							copy of his Letter to Green— Fisher made a statement rather unfavourable
							to Mitchell which was corroborated by Holmes, but both and the Speaker
							disclaimed having stigmatized the transactions as bribery— After this
							little incident, the question upon <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy

							always be laid on the table, came up and <persRef ref="cooper-mark"

								<persRef ref="fisher-charles">Fisher’s</persRef> statement of the

								Thomas</persRef> now attends our Grand child <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, once every day— She has
							been several days convalescent and we hope with the blessing of God, now
							out of danger— Further particulars were this day received of the
							dreadful catastrophe, of the burning of the Steamer Lexington last
							Monday Evening; and the loss of the lives of every soul on board, except
							four— They were from 75 to 80. passengers, and upwards of 20 persons
							belonging to the boat— This discomposed me so much last Evening and this
							morning, together with the severe cold weather that I was disabled from
							writing, and all my business falls in arrear— At the House <persRef
								ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> has the floor upon <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson’s</persRef> Resolution, by a
							rule of the House to lay on the table, every motion to receive abolition
							Petitions— <persRef ref="leet-isaac">Leet</persRef> of Pennsylvania
							first intreated him to yield the floor for a motion that the house do
							now elect a printer, but he declined. Then <persRef ref="biddle-richard"
								>Biddle</persRef> asked the same favour to present a petition about
							a project for a guard against the explosion of Steamboats— He again
							declined though he said he would cheerfully accommodate both the members
							if he could do it without losing the floor. Biddle moved to suspend the
							rules, but Slade told him he had not the floor to make the motion upon
							which he sat down— But Slade did yield the floor to <persRef
								ref="fisher-charles">Fisher</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mitchell-charles">Mitchell</persRef> for personal explanations;
							upon which they exchanged shots of mutual crimination and recrimination
							in decent language— Then <persRef ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef>
							complained of an Article in the Globe, charging him with a finesse, in
							withdrawing yesterday his motion to reconsider the vote to lay on the
							table <persRef ref="coles-walter">Coles’s</persRef> resolution, when the
							same motion could not be renewed, the day having passed over, within
							which it could be in order. Graves made an explanation to shew that his
							withdrawal of his motion for reconsideration had been fair, and to
							gratify <persRef ref="colquitt-walter">Colquhitt’s</persRef> desire to
							make his anti-abolition Speech— Graves further complained of having been
							misreported in the Globe, in another case, on the debate upon the New
							Jersey election. He said a Colleague of his friendly to the editor of
							the Globe had mentioned to him this misrepresentation, and <persRef
								ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> had said he would publish in the
							globe and corrective communication from Graves— He said he chose to make
							no such communication, for he knew it would be replied to with new abuse
							and falsification if he made it; but he gave notice that if he should be
							again so misreported he would move for the expulsion of the reporter
							from the Hall— <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Linn Boyd</persRef> confirmed
							Graves’s statement— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> said
							if they were to rectify all the falsifications of the Globe, they could
							have time for nothing else— <persRef ref="thompson-jacob"
								>Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi said it had not been his
							intention to move the reconsideration, on the day when Coles had moved
							it— Slade then commenced his anti-slavery Speech; and after speaking
							about two hours, yielded to a motion of <persRef ref="parris-virgil">V.
								D. Parris</persRef> to adjourn; which was carried; Slade s<unclear>ti</unclear>ll
							retaining the floor. I sent notice to the members of the Committee of
							manufactures to meet Monday Morning at half past 10— And had sundry
							papers from the files of the <persRef ref="garland-hugh"
								>Clerk’s</persRef> Office referred to Committees.</p>

						</list>
						<p>Four weeks of sleighing, and of slippery snow and ice clad Streets are
							this day completed—returns and a duration of severe cold, beyond all my
							former experience here, have hitherto signalized this winter— At the
							Presbyterian Church this morning, <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> preached from Isaiah
							54.7. “For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies
							will I gather thee. 8. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a
							moment: but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith
							the Lord thy Redeemer.” It was a melancholy discourse, having reference
							to the forsaken church itself, now without a pastor, and with little
							prospect of procuring one; being from its poverty unable to support one—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood’s engagement is for a short
							time, and I suppose about to close— The attendance is now constantly so
							small that I conclude many of the former pew holders have gone
							elsewhere— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood alluded to an appalling
							incident of the recent heart rending catastrophe, the destruction by
							fire of the Lexington Steamboat, in which <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Russell Jarvis</persRef> with
								<persRef ref="u;u">two small children</persRef> perished— She was
							last seen on a floating bale of cotton with one of her children in her
							arms, shrieking in calling her fellow sufferers to bring her other child
							to her to die with her— They were all forsaken— They perished— But a
							merciful God has not forsaken them in a better world.— The subject of
							the Sermon was deeply affecting, not only in its application to this
							church, but to numberless others in the land. The Churches forsaken of
							God, and forsaken by Man are multitudes.— But there were four lines in
							one of the Psalms given out by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood to be
							sung more cheering and more pathetic than his discourse— They are in the
								126<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> verse</p>
							<lg><l>“The Lord can clear the darkest skies, Can give us
							day for night</l>
						<l>Make drops of sacred sorrow rise, To rivers of delight.”</l></lg>
						<p>This power and mercy of God are the only reliance of man for relief from
							the calamities of life, but when we see the service of God himself
							deserted and Indifference surrendering his worship to parsimony and his
							cause to Infidelity we hang the head in sorrow and in shame.— In the
							afternoon I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s another
							almost forsaken Church— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> was there; but the
							service for the second Sunday after the Epiphany was read by a stranger,
							quite a young man, and the Sermon was preached by <persRef ref="boyd-fw"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. W. Boyd</persRef>—from
							Ephesians 2.8—“For by Grace are ye saved through Faith: and that, not of
							yourselves: it is the gift of God.”— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss
								Cutts</persRef> was in our pew. The cold was so intense that I was
							prevented from writing morn and eve— Much of the day was consumed in
							reading in the New-York Emancipator of last Thursday, a series of
							Letters from <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef> to the
							Committee in behalf of the captured Africans, detailing from day to day
							the proceedings of the U.S. District Court at New-Haven, in the case and
							the decision of the <persRef ref="judson-andrew">judge Andrew
								Judson</persRef>, that the Africans except one shall be delivered to
							the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President of the United
								States</persRef> to be sent home to Africa; and that one, the boy
								<persRef ref="antonio2">Antonio</persRef>, to be sent home to
							Cuba.</p>

								Thomas</persRef> first intermitted his daily visit to <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, who blessed be God
							continues convalescent, and this day sat up about two hours— <persRef
								ref="lewis-isaiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I. W. P.
								Lewis</persRef> of Boston brought me a recommendatory Letter from
							his brother in Law, <persRef ref="willard-joseph3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Willard</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis claims to have effected a great
							improvement in the illumination of the Light house at the entrance of
							Boston harbour, and complains that injustice has been done to him by a
							contract of <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Stephen
								Pleasonton</persRef> with <persRef ref="lewis-winslow2">Winslow
								Lewis</persRef> to extend the same improvement to all the other
							light-houses in Massachusetts, without regard to his claim of priority

							advised him to apply personally to the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>—make the statement of facts to
							him, and present the claims to his justice— He would probably require
							the statement and claim to be presented in writing, which he must do;
							and then I thought the Secretary would grant him some redress— And I
							told him, if I could render him any Service in the case I would
							cheerfully give it— This visit delayed me so that it was 11. O’Clock
							before I reached the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures at the
							Capitol— I had summoned the Committee to meet at half past ten, and
							found assembled <persRef ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbet</persRef>,

							<persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> and <persRef ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef> were

								Cook</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef> were in attendance upon the Committee. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook stated the grounds upon which the
							manufacturers of pins, claim the alternative either of laying a duty of
							25 percent ad valorem upon imported pins, or of taking off the duty of
							the same amount of duty upon brass wire of which the pins are made— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook said they asked not for favour or
							protection but mere Justice, to be placed on the same footing with the
							importing foreigner— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nisbet said that of
							the alternative he should prefer taking off the duty from brass wire,
							rather than lay the duty upon pins— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dromgoole enquired if there were no manufactures of brass wire in this
							Country, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook answered that there were;
							and Dromgoole asked whether they would not be dissatisfied with the
							removal of the duty on that article, a question which somewhat perplexed
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook— The Committee postponed the
							further consideration of the subject, and of others referred to them,
							till the next Meeting— And agreed to meet on Mondays and Thursdays at
							11. O’Clock A.M. till further order.— On entering the House I found M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade on the floor upon <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson’s</persRef> Resolution for a
							rule to exclude abolition Petitions; into the vortex of which he had
							drawn the whole subject of Slave-trade Slavery and abolition— He took
							nearly three hours to conclude the Speech that he had commenced on
							Saturday, and delivered himself of the burden that has been four years
							swelling in his bosom— The house was nearly deserted before he finished—
								<persRef ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef> of Virginia took the
							floor to answer him— Adjourned by yeas and nays 55 to 52— <persRef

								<persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> intreated

								<persRef ref="force-peter">Mayor of the City</persRef>, to be
							distributed among the poor, suffering by the severity of the Season—
							Garland refused for he was aware that Johnson’s Resolution if once
							admitted might be debated the whole day— <persRef ref="pope-john">John
								Pope</persRef> begged the floor the make a report from the Committee
							on the Territories, upon the boundary dispute between the Territory of
							Ioway and the State of Missouri, merely to have it printed— But he was
							told there was yet no printer to the house, and no provision extant for
							printing any thing— Garland held the floor, and made a speech of about
							two hours, in answer to that of <persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>; and against the reception of
							abolition petitions. He took the ground that Congress have no power to
							abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia—no authority to legislate
							upon the subject whatever. and therefore that they are not bound to
							receive any petition relating to it. After him <persRef
								ref="butler-sampson">Samson H Butler</persRef> of South-Carolina
							made a short, and most forcibly feeble Speech, upon the blessings of
							Slavery, and upon the reasons of the nullifiers for supporting not the
							present Administration but its leading measures— Because they conformed
							to the interests and principles of the South. <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> now got the floor, and
							moved an amendment to <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy
								Thompson’s</persRef> Resolution; made a speech in support of his
							amendment, and gave notice that he would move the previous question, as
							soon as the question upon his amendment should be put; calling at the
							same time upon the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> to put
							the question— I denied his right to call upon the Speaker to put the
							question, which discomposed him— It was then objected that his amendment
							was identical with the Resolution offered last week by <persRef
								ref="coles-walter">Coles</persRef> and laid on the table—therefore
							not now in order. The Speaker after considerable discussion so decided—
							Dromgoole appealed from his decision, which was affirmed by yeas and
							nays 120 to 64— I immediately moved my amendment, but Dromgoole still
							claimed possession of the floor, and the Speaker decided that he had it.
							He then moved the Previous Question on Thomson’s Resolution; and
							resisted most pathetic appeals from W. Cost Johnson and <persRef
								ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> to withdraw it— There was a
							call of the house, and the vote by tellers on the question of the second
							to the previous question was 98 to 99—whereupon after a struggle of a
							week and at least ten abortive attempts, I succeeded in getting my
							amendment before the house, and obtained the floor. I was willing to
							take the question without debate— But some of my friends insisted that I
							must speak—and urged me to move an adjournment which I did, and which
							was carried— It was past 4.</p>

						<p>At the meeting of the House this morning, I had the floor upon my
							amendment to <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson’s</persRef>
							Resolution, which I have had such extreme difficulty in getting before
							the house. Knowing that it would not be adopted, I had prepared it
							merely to serve as a protest against the rule which they will adopt in
							some form to exclude abolition petitions from consideration by the
							House. <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="chinn-thomas">Chinn</persRef> came to my seat yesterday and
							told me they could not vote for my amendment, but were very desirous of
							having the abolition petitions referred to a select Committee— I told
							them they might move that as an amendment to my amendment— Expecting
							this, or that there would be an immediate motion to lay my amendment on
							the table, and I had not prepared myself for debating it at all— But the
							desperate effort of <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> yesterday to exclude my amendment from
							admission to debate; and <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef>, who
							came to offer me his seat for speaking, and said it would be expected of
							me to support my own proposition, made it necessary for me to speak,
							without more preparation than a brief synopsis of my argument which I
							made this morning after breakfast—and in this as in every case when I
							speak without long premeditation my most pungent regret is at the
							failure to do justice to my own cause— I yielded the floor to the
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>J. W. Jones</persRef>, to report the Army Appropriations Bill; but
							when he moved for the printing of certain documents objection was made,
							and he moved a suspension of the rules— I saw this would engage a debate
							which might consume the whole day, and I resumed my right to the floor—
							I spoke about two hours, very unsatisfactorily to myself but not without
							constant attention of the House— <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef> thanked me for it, and said he had though not
							concurring with my opinions, listened to it with great pleasure—
								<persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> told me that he
							entirely concurred with full three-fourths of it. <persRef
								ref="taliaferro-john">Taliaferro</persRef> told me that he concurred
							in it altogether; but intimated that the prejudices of his constituents
							would not allow him to vote with me— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac"
								>Holmes</persRef> of Charleston S.C. said it was a very able, very
							powerful and very dangerous Speech— He took numerous minutes to answer
							me— <persRef ref="alford-julius">Alford</persRef> of Georgia took the
							floor immediately after me, and made a ludicrously passionate Speech,
							not so much against me, as against the abolitionists and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="hunt-hiram">Hunt</persRef> of New-York then got the floor and
							moved to adjourn, he being indisposed— The House by yeas and nays 94 to
							85 refused to adjourn; but immediately afterwards did adjourn just after
							3. <persRef ref="gates-seth">Gates</persRef> came and said he and
								<persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> wanted a large
							number of copies of my Speech in pamphlet form. I called at the National
							Intelligencer Office, and mentioned this to <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>, who said he would
							send round a subscription paper, and if a sufficient number should be
							called for would print the pamphlet.</p>

							overrating confidence in his own judgment. But his habits are
							intemperate; and his indisposition yesterday for which the House

						<p>My Catarrhal cough has not been relieved by my participation in the
							banquet of yesterday— It would have been wiser to have stayed at home— I
							had an indifferent Night, and rose this morning not well— Yet was my
							usual occupation not superseded. Morning visit from <persRef
								ref="hall-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David A.
								Hall</persRef>, with <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> who now officiates in
							the presbyterian church— <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> having left them in
							September last— Going to the capitol I was joined by the Reporter
								<persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stansbury</persRef>, who gave me his manuscript of my Speech of last
							Wednesday which he had already written out— At the meeting of the House,
								<persRef ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> of North-Carolina had the
							floor— He allowed <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef> to
							move a continued temporary adoption of the rules of the last Congress as
							already amended, until otherwise ordered by the House— A great struggle
							was made to except the amendments to the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							and 42<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> rules; but Hoffman’s motion
							prevailed— <persRef ref="keim-george">G. M. Keim</persRef> presented a
							Memorial from <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, claiming the seat now occupied by <persRef
								ref="naylor-charles">Charles Naylor</persRef>, which was at the
							motion of <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John Campbell</persRef> Chairman
							of the Committee of elections referred to that Committee—to which also
							at his motion leave was granted to sit during the Session of the house—
							Bynum spoke nearly four hours with all his characteristic venom and
							vehemence; and his usual disregard of truth— At an early part of his
							speech, he alluded repeatedly to me, and said that I had contended that
							the People of the South ought to be influenced by the abolition
							doctrines of foreign, English periodical journals and reviews— I rose
							and said, <persRef ref="hunter-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Speaker</persRef>, the Gentleman refers to me what I never said— He
							persevered and said well Sir, the Gentleman’s speech will be published;
							and unless he suppresses, what he said it will then appear— I replied,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker I never said one word of what
							the member has imputed to me, nor any thing like it—and now he may
							proceed, and impute to me what he pleases.— He made no more allusions to
							me, excepting in repeating my name as recorded among the yeas and nays.—
							He ransacked these for the last five years upon all the gag-resolutions
							to prove that the whigs and abolitionists are identical; and that
							overwhelming majorities of the democratic party are anti-abolitionists.—
							In this process he brought himself into a ludicrous predicament by
							finding his own name recorded among those of his pretended
							abolitionists— But a deeper mortification awaited him— He repeated some
							words used last week by <persRef ref="peck-luther">Luther C.
								Peck</persRef>, with some epithet of execration and without naming
							Peck, said they were spoken by an abolitionist— Peck rose and asked if
							Bynum alluded to him—said Bynum, I alluded to a person by the name of
							Peck. Then said Peck, as to the words alleged to have been used by me, I
							have nothing to say, but the assertion that I am an abolitionist is <hi
								rend="italic">not</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">true</hi>— Said Bynum—if the gentleman is not an
							abolitionist according to my definition of the term— A shout of
							laughter. Bynum to Peck—did you mean to charge me with saying an
							untruth— Peck—I said that what had been said was not true.— Bynum—you
							are a liar, a scoundrel and a puppy— <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy
								Thompson</persRef> offered a Resolution of censure upon Bynum for
							using this language— Bynum humbled himself and asked pardon of the
							House— <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> then insisted
							that Peck should recant—which Peck sturdily refused— At length after
							much snarling Bynum had leave to proceed in his speech and the house
							adjourned—</p>

						<p><persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Miss Pierce</persRef> was again here this
							morning upon her final certificate claim, and enquired if I had spoken
							about it to any of the members of the Committee of revolutionary claims
							concerning it— I said I had conversed with <persRef ref="craig-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Craig</persRef> the Chairman of
							the committee and mentioned the difficulty which he had stated as the
							chief obstruction to the claim—a certificate from the <persRef
								ref="smith-ts">Register of the Treasury Smith</persRef>, that it
							appears of record in the Treasury that the identical numbers of these
							certificates have been paid— She said that record was certainly not
							correct, and Craig told me the Treasury minute did not shew to whom the
							certificate had been paid.— I advised Miss Pierce to see M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Craig, and also <persRef ref="hall-hiland"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hiland Hall</persRef>, who is a
							member of the Committee, and to exhibit her evidence to them— At the
							House after some explanatory remarks of <persRef ref="peck-luther">L. C.
								Peck</persRef>, upon the misstatements in this morning’s Globe, and
							some abortive attempts to introduce other matters, <persRef
								ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> resumed the floor and spoke about
							three hours before he concluded. The point of his whole speech was to
							prove that the whig party North and South was identified with the
							abolitionists, and that the Democrats with very few exceptions were
							anti-abolitionists and supporters of the rights of the South— To
							demonstrate this, after reviewing the Journals of the House for the last
							years for yeas and nays and announcing the number of whigs and of
							democrats upon each side of every question, he brought in the
							proceedings of State, Legislatures, the Resolutions of political
							meetings, Letters and speeches of individuals; all to be blasted with
							whiggery and abolitionism Among the rest he brought up <persRef
								ref="gates-seth">Seth M Gates’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef
								ref="smith-gerrit">Gerrit Smith</persRef>, and was about to read an
							extract from it, when Gates rose and said that if his object was to
							prove him an abolitionist he would save him the trouble by admitting the
							fact. So Bynum passed to <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>Harrison</persRef> and the Harrisburg Convention, and proved them
							all whigs and abolitionists— All this upon a resolution proposing a rule
							of the House that all petitions shall be received, except such as shall
							be objected to for special reason to be recorded on the Journal— And
							such is all debate in the House with very little exception. <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef> followed
							immediately after Bynum for about an hour. Johnson is a Southern whig,
							and to escape from the charge of being an abolitionist, is obligated to
							take an overcharge of zeal against the right of petition— He denies the
							right of Congress to act upon the subject at-all, and votes for refusing
							to receive all petitions relating to the subject— He boasted of having
							refused to present last winter a petition from some of his Constituents,
							who had claims upon the Haytian Government, for their recognition—and
							said his refusal had been universally approved by his Constituents who
							had re-elected him by an increased majority— His argument was mainly
							directed against that of my Speech of last Wednesday and was very
							ingenious and plausible; but he did not speak as if he himself believed
							what he said— He did not finish his Speech. The house adjourned about 4.
							I took to the Office of the National Intelligencer and left with
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef>
							<persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansburys</persRef> report of my Speech
							on Wednesday, revised by me in the House, yesterday and this morning—

						<p>At the Presbyterian Church, heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi

							“And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if

							discourse! what affecting incidents, what profound principles—what
							lessons of pure patriotism, of undoubting faith, of religious toleration
							are included in it! M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood considered it
							merely as a call upon sinners to repentance— Afternoon at S<hi

							Sunday after the Epiphany was read by a stranger, and <persRef
								ref="boyd-fw">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. W. Boyd</persRef>
							preached from Jeremiah 4:14. “O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from
							wickedness, that thou mayest be saved:[”] (how long shall thy vain

							note from <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef> in behalf of her mother <persRef ref="tudor-delia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor</persRef> requesting me
							to call on them the next Morning or when I might find it convenient— I
							went there from Church— The purpose of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Stewart was to prevail upon me to present in the House a petition from
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor for the allowance of an outfit
							of a Charge d’Affaires, to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor as
								<persRef ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor, jun<hi

							while Consul at Lima in Peru; during the time when he was acting in the
							absence of <persRef ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Prevost</persRef> as a diplomatic agent— As I wrote and introduced
							and carried through her former petition for an allowance on the same
							account, I had advised her to have her new petition first presented in
							the Senate; but she has found no member of that body willing to
							undertake that service for her; and <persRef ref="king-william2">W. R.
								King</persRef> of Alabama told me some days since that the only
							chance of success for her in the Senate would be that a bill should
							first come from the House— After some hesitation I finally took the
							commendatory Letters, and said I would converse with <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caleb
								Cushing</persRef> a member of the Committee of foreign Affairs of
							the House, to ascertain if there was a probability of obtaining a
							favourable report upon this claim from that Committee— At home I had
							hoped to find time this day for writing something on the Smithsonian
							fund Bill report, but was disappointed— Hours were consumed in
							assorting, filing and endorsing the Letters that I receive—chiefly
							trash;—I receive an average of one pamphlet every day; and scarcely ever
							have to read one of them— This day however I read a pamphlet with the
							singular title of Remarks upon <persRef ref="binney-horace">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney’s</persRef> Letter of January 3
							1840 to the Presidents of the Councils of the City of Philadelphia—by
							the writer of the Letter— He refused to take depretiated bank paper in
							payment of a debt from the City of Philadelphia to him; and found it
							necessary to publish this pamphlet in his own justification— It is
							admirably well written, and appears to have brought the City Councils of
							Philadelphia to the just sense of their obligations.</p>

							that on Saturday, <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">Cornelius P. Van

								ref="holmes-george">Holmes</persRef> case; against the power of a
								<persRef ref="jennison-silas">Governor of a State</persRef> to
							deliver up a criminal at the demand of a foreign Government— There was
							no argument on the other side— In the Committee of manufactures, all the
							subjects before the Committee were postponed to the next Meeting, but
							the Chairman was authorised to confer with the Secretary, upon the
							complaints of frauds practiced in the collection of the revenue, charged
							in sundry memorials from woolen manufacturers, referred by the House to
							the Committee— In the House, <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost
								Johnson</persRef> had the floor upon my amendment to <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson’s</persRef> resolution
							concerning the receipt of petitions— He yielded it to <persRef

							diplomatic appropriation bill—with a motion that the <persRef

								>Giddings</persRef> of Ohio, offered as an amendment and substitute
							that until the further order of the House, the printing should be given
							to the lowest bidder— And now began a series of manoeuvering, I scarce
							can say whether most diverting or disgusting.— Giddings’s amendment was
							carried by yeas and nays<space/>to 65. and in the face of such a
							majority, <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of Ohio,
							immediately moved a reconsideration— He was in favour of giving the
							printing to the lowest bidder but not now.— He made a Speech to muster
							up paltry objections, and then moved the previous question to cut off
							all reply.— There was a decision of the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> against a call of the house, reversed by yeas and
							nays,<space/>to<space/>then a call of the house—previous question— Motion to lay
							the whole subject on the table—lost by a vote of 108 to 110.— And at
							last the Resolution as amended by Giddings carried by yeas and nays 115
							to 97. whereupon John W. Davis immediately moved a reconsideration— It
							was found impossible through all this writhing, twisting and coiling, to
							rally the entire Kinderhoek party against Giddings’s lowest bidder—but
							they will reverse it to-morrow. <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
								>Pickens</persRef>, <persRef ref="griffin-john">Griffin</persRef>

								<persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> the pure—the
							immaculate— These operations consumed more than three hours; after which
							W. Cost Johnson resumed the floor, spoke about an hour more of his
							Anti-abolition discourse, and had not finished when the house adjourned
							I went into the library to find the date of the Piracy in the Schooner

								Telfair</persRef> came this morning, and expressed her fears that
							the Committee on Revolutionary claims would report unfavourably to the
							claim of her <persRef ref="pearce-elizabeth">Sister</persRef> and
							herself— She complained of unkindness and inconsistency from <persRef
								ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Taliaferro</persRef>, and said <persRef ref="hall-hiland">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hiland Hall</persRef> whom they had
							visited yesterday, had told them it was useless for them to remain any
							longer here— It is certain that I can do nothing for them, and the
							weight of Evidence is against their claim. I called on the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, and told
							him that sundry memorials from woollen manufacturers, complaining of
							frauds injurious to them in the collection of the revenue had been
							referred by the house to the Committee of Manufactures, who had directed
							me to see him and enquire if he had any information upon the subject,
							from the Collectors, which might be useful to the Committee in their
							enquiries— He said there was much complaint from the Collectors, not
							only of undervalued invoices, but of judicial constructions, and
							verdicts of juries, against the Government, of which he gave me several
							instances—chiefly with regard to silks—and which he said he would
							communicate to me in documentary form. Thence I went to the Department
							of State; where the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary
								Forsyth</persRef> not being there, I saw the chief <persRef
								ref="vail-aaron2">Clerk Aaron Vail</persRef>—and found some of the
							correspondence respecting the Pirates and murderers of the Schooner
							Plattsburg, particularly a Letter from me to <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef> of 11. November 1837—but
							I had not time to examine the whole correspondence— I told Vail, I
							should probably offer a Resolution for a call— Going to the House, I met
							in the Capitol Yard <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef>, and greeted him upon his recent return from his
							visit to England— I found the House in Session, and <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>, upon the floor
							concluding his anti-abolition Speech, which took him between two or
							three hours.— He was about half tipsey, and in his merriest and wittiest
							mood— In undertaking to answer my last speech, he took the course under
							the form of nauseous and fetid flattery, to make me as ridiculous before
							the house and the country, as he possibly could— He closed with offering
							a resolution as an amendment to mine, providing that no petition
							resolution or paper relating to slavery or the abolition of Slavery or
							the Slave trade in any State, District, or Territory should be received
							or in any manner entertained by the House— I objected to this as not in
							order, my own resolution being an amendment to an amendment, beyond
							which in the uniform practice of the house are inadmissible— But
								<persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Thompson</persRef> accepted Johnson’s
							Resolution as an addition to his own, and <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn
								Banks</persRef> who had been put by the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"

							Speech which he closed by calling the previous question the main
							question was on the combined Resolutions, carried by yeas and nays 116
							to 106. and then carried as amended 114 to 108—and thus it is made a
							rule of the house that no abolition petitions shall be received—

							abolitionists— Whittier is now the Editor of the Pennsylvania Freemason
							Newspaper, published weekly at Philadelphia— Whittier said he thought
							this last outrage upon the right of Petition, the establishment of a
							rule refusing to receive or entertain any abolition petition, might
							perhaps be the best thing that could have been done to promote the cause
							of abolition— It was at last casting off all disguise. I said it would
							depend upon the impression which it would make on the people; and I had
							little expectation from that.— They had been familiarized to the
							privation of the right, and could not be roused to take an interest in
							it— The difference between the Resolutions of the four preceding
							Sessions of Congress, and the new rule of the house, is the difference
							between petty larceny and highway robbery.— I had much conversation with
							these men, upon the dissensions among the anti-slavery men, and
							abolitionists, and concerning the late <persRef ref="lundy-benjamin"
								>Benjamin Lundy</persRef>. At the House <persRef
								ref="parmenter-william">W. Parmenter</persRef> asked leave to

							right of <persRef ref="baker-osmyn">Osmyn Baker</persRef> to a seat in

							order pending, upon an appeal by <persRef ref="jameson-john"
								>Jameson</persRef> of Missouri from a decision of the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> last Evening.— <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">Davis</persRef> of Indiana, had moved a
							reconsideration of the vote of the preceding day, to have the printing
							done by the lowest bidder; for the purpose of offering resolutions of
							his own; the first of which was to proceed immediately to the election
							of a printer; and then for a Committee of 5 to be appointed by the House
							to examine and report how the printing shall be done hereafter. The vote
							of the former day was reconsidered.— But <persRef ref="graves-william2"
								>Graves</persRef> got the floor; before Davis and offered a
							Resolution of his own; to which he allowed <persRef ref="garland-rice"
								>Rice Garland</persRef> to offer an amendment—so as to have
							precedence for consideration before Davis’s proposition— Jameson’s point
							was, that Davis’s motion for reconsideration having been made for the
							declared purpose of offering a specific resolution, he was entitled to
							the floor in preference to all others to offer his resolution— Against
							this the Speaker decided, and after a long trifling and ridiculous
							debate his decision was sustained 126 to 71— Graves then made a long
							speech in support of his proposition, and cited the editorial Article in
							the Globe warning the Administration party that the paper cannot be
							sustained, if deprived of the profits of the public printing— The day
							was consumed in this wretched altercation without advancing one step in
							business— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> got entangled in
							some cutting remark that he made offensive to <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Smith</persRef> of Maine, for which he was
							called to order, and a debate was got up whether he should be allowed to
							proceed; in the midst of which the house about four O’Clock
							adjourned.—There has been no more disorderly day during the Session, and
							the condition of the House is such as I never before witnessed—</p>

								Farnsworth</persRef> had some days since written me a Letter,
							proposing to travel in Europe for the benefit of the Smithsonian
							Institution— He came this morning to see me with the same purpose— He is
							a native of New-England—has been President of some College in the
							Western Country, which from ill health he has been obliged to leave, and
							he is now wandering about the world in the pursuit of health.— Of the
							speculators of the Smithsonian fund he is one among the most needy, and
							it was with some reluctance that I told him that I thought there would
							be no occasion for a traveller for the Smithsonian fund at least for the
							present— <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Isaac
								Chauncey</persRef>, President of the board of Navy Commissioners,
							died last Monday, and his funeral was announced for this morning at 11.
							O’Clock.— It was the hour for the Meeting of the Committee of
							manufactures, but there was nothing of importance upon which they could
							now act, and I attended the funeral, as a testimonial of respect to a
							gallant Officer who had served his Country in War, and to whom I was
							indebted for acts of personal kindness never to be forgotten— The
							funeral ceremonies were with military and naval honours—a considerable
							concourse of People—three uniformed companies of the District Militia—
							The <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>, and four heads
							of Departments were there—Generals <persRef ref="macomb-alexander"
								>Macomb</persRef> and <persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef>
							with many other army Officers in full uniform— <persRef
								ref="morris-charles">Commodore Morris</persRef> superintended the
							arrangements— President Van Buren offered me a seat in his Chariot which
							I accepted.— It was past noon when the procession left the house for the
							Eastern branch graveyard— My conversation with the President was about
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="morton-marcus">Marcus Morton</persRef>; the past and present
							Governors of Massachusetts; and about Banks and Banking; points upon
							which, there was no difference of opinion, except with regard to the
							remedy for the evil, between us— After passing by the Capitol yard, on
							the way to the cemetery, the Carriage turned out from the procession,
							and entering the yard at the Northern gate set me down under the arch
							beside the door leading to the Hall of the House of Representatives. It
							was one O’Clock— The House had been an hour in Session— I found the
							doors of the Hall closed upon a Call of the House, on a motion of
								<persRef ref="davis-john8">Davis</persRef> of Indiana, to lay on the
							table the Resolutions of <persRef ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> about the
							printing— My name had been noted as absent, and I had been excused— I
							was soon admitted into the Hall— Further proceedings in the call were
							superseded— The Resolutions of Graves and Garland were laid on the table
							by a vote of 116 to 108. and after much altercation and chicanery. The
							Printers were chosen viva voce— <persRef ref="blair-francis"
								>Blair</persRef> and <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef> 110.
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> 92. Scattering 5. whole number
							voting 207. Blair and Rives chosen— The house adjourned at 7. P.M—
								<persRef ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas Dumphy</persRef> was in waiting
							for me; and I walked home with him, in darkness.</p>

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="ratcliff-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff</persRef>, with two new
							Memorials praying for the aid of the Government of the United States, in
							procuring the construction of a ship canal across the isthmus between
							North and South-America, which he wished me to present to the House, and
							to have referred to a select Committee of which I should be chairman— He
							brought and left with me the report of <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C.
								F. Mercer</persRef>, chairman of the Committee on roads and Canals
							made on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1839.—(Report No.
							322. H.R.U.S— 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> Session) upon a similar memorial formerly
							in Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1838 presented by me— The Report
							closes with a Resolution requesting the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> to consider the expediency of further
							negotiating to ascertain the practicability of opening a ship canal
							communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans— This Resolution
							was adopted by the House, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff
							says the President declines doing any thing without an appropriation— I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff that if he wished the
							memorials to succeed, it would be better to have them referred to the
							Committee of Roads and Canals, than to a select Committee. I said too
							that I was so overwhelmed with other indispensable business that it
							would be impossible for me as Chairman of a select Committee to do
							justice to this— I said further that I thought he could not get a better
							Chairman than <persRef ref="ogle-charles">Charles Ogle</persRef> the
							present Chairman of the Committee of Roads and Canals. He said it would
							perhaps be advisable to have these Memorials first presented in the
							Senate. I thought it would; and I advised him to have it presented by a
							friend of the administration— After naming several, he finally fixed
							upon <persRef ref="linn-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Linn</persRef> of Missouri; which I approved— At the house, after an
							ineffectual attempt of <persRef ref="davis-john11">Davies</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, to proceed to the election of a chaplain, and the
							annunciation by <persRef ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> of a
							sort of bargain that the Committee of five to devise the cheapest mode
							of printing, should consist of <persRef ref="black-edward"
								>Black</persRef>, the mover of the Resolution as Chairman and two of
							each party as members, which was disclaimed as a bargain on the other
							side, a call of the house ensued— A motion was carried that the election
							should be made viva voce— <persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef>
							moved that the choice should be made, one by one—this was rejected by
							yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>The roll was called alphabetically, and each
							member named five for whom he voted to constitute the Committee— I voted
							for Black, <persRef ref="bond-william2">Bond</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>— <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
								>Hopkins</persRef> of Virginia made a very foolish speech, asking to
							be excused from voting— The House refused to excuse him— He said he
							would then excuse himself, and did not vote— <persRef
								ref="monroe-james2">James Monroe</persRef> declined voting, saying
							he looked upon the whole transaction as a humbug— So did I— But it is
							not wise to set the house at defiance upon small points— Three hours and
							more were consumed in taking the vote, and it would have taken as many
							more to count and sort the votes— The Clock had Struck 4—and after a
							protracted and tumultuous struggle the House adjourned over to Monday—
							Evening visit from <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef>.</p>
