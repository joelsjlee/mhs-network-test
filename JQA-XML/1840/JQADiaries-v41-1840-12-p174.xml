                        <p>I called this morning at the Franklin insurance Office, but found no one
                            there— At the Bank of Washington and left my book to be balanced.— At a
                            quarter past 11. <persRef ref="harris-dc">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Harris</persRef> came to my door with a hack and took me to the
                            railway depot, and took tickets for us to Baltimore— At a quarter before
                            12 they started with not more than twelve passengers, and travelling
                            slow; with many stoppages reached the depot at Baltimore a quarter
                            before 3. P.M.— There I found <persRef ref="harris-james5">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>Harris</persRef> the President of
                            the Mercantile Library Association, with a Hack, ready, in which, he
                            accompanied me to <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> hotel—
                            Here I was ushered to the two apartments which I had repeatedly occupied
                            when President of the United States; but never since; and the
                            stateliness of which belong not to my present condition— The Association
                            have apparently determined that the cost of my visit to Baltimore at
                            their request shall be defrayed by themselves, and I have not thought it
                            necessary to be punctilious in rejecting their purpose— I would have
                            dined at the ordinary; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnum
                            insisted on having my dinner served in my parlour. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris dined with me. It so happened that
                            I was quite unwell—suddenly taken, in the Cars, soon after leaving
                            Washington, and had so totally lost my appetite that I could scarcely
                            swallow any thing of the sumptuous dinner which was served. The day was
                            frosty and raw; and I had taken a chill in the Cars— I was fearful I
                            should not be able to perform my engagement of the Evening; and had the
                            utmost difficulty to conceal from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
                            my discomposure.— I received and answered a second note of invitation to
                            dine to-morrow, from <persRef ref="gilmor-robert">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Gilmer</persRef>.— I had
                            numerous visitors, among whom several old acquaintances, whose names and
                            persons, to my great mortification had alike vanished from my memory.— I
                            remembered <persRef ref="munro-isaac">Isaac Munroe</persRef>, Editor of
                            the Baltimore Patriot— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnum sat and
                            chatted with me for an hour after dinner; and <persRef
                                ref="finley-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Findley</persRef>, heretofore Marshall of the District another.— The
                            Lecture had been fixed for 8 O’Clock— At half past 7. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris and another Gentleman came and took
                            me to <persRef ref="duncan-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Duncan’s</persRef> Church, which was so crowded that I had no small
                            difficulty to get in— My chill had passed off, but left me with a hoarse
                            and broken voice. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan was in his
                            pulpit, and announced to the auditory that my Lecture, was introductory
                            to a course proposed to be given by the Mercantile Library Association—
                            I spoke from a platform fronting the pulpit, and delivered the Lecture
                            on Society and civilization— It was well received— The Stanzas and the
                            close, applauded. All heard with deep attention— Sundry persons were
                            introduced to me, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilmer came to
                            shake hands with me. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>introduced
                            himself— Asked me if I had read <persRef ref="swedenborg-emanuel"
                                >Swedenborg’s</persRef> treatise on conjugial love, and said he
                            would send it to me— He said too, that he had heard my Lecture on Faith
                            at the Tabernacle in New-York, and agreed with me in every thing except
                            that belief depends upon the Will—and he spoke of some treatise by
                            somebody upon the will. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, the
                            President of the Association—and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>took
                            me back in the hack to Barnum’s, and sat half an hour with me in
                            conversation. They were chiefly pleased with the two Stanza’s on
                            connubial love.</p>

                        <p>The precaution of taking pen, ink and paper with me has been unavoidable—
                            I rose at 5. and wrote till 8. Breakfasted at the Ladies ordinary, where
                            there were few boarders— Visits immediately after from Mess<hi

                            the Temperance Society, to request me to deliver an address to that
                            association; which I was obliged to decline, as at present
                            impracticable; and as certain to be so during the approaching Session of
                            Congress— But after its close, I promised either to deliver such an
                            address, or to give them notice that it will not be in my power.

                                Harris</persRef> came also to enquire how I was this morning. I
                            returned with a card the card visit of <persRef ref="johnson-reverdy"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reverdy Johnson</persRef>, and

                            conversation with him, upon the North-eastern boundary question, upon
                            which he said he proposed to deliver a Lecture before the Mercantile
                            Library Association— He shewed me <persRef ref="kitchin-thomas"
                                >Kitchin’s</persRef> Atlas of Maps in which there are two published
                            by <persRef ref="laurie-robert">Laurie</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="whittle-james">Whittle</persRef> 12. May 1794 one of which
                            marked the boundary as now claimed by the British Government, and the
                            other as claimed by the U.S. he said he had supposed until he saw these
                            maps that the present British claim was a recent pretension; and he
                            could not now account for the fact that these two map were published by
                            the same persons on the same day.— Returning from Col<hi
                                rend="superscript">l.</hi> Howard’s I went to the column at the end
                            of North Charles street erected to <persRef ref="washington-george"
                                >George Washington</persRef> by the State of Maryland.— There is a
                            cubic basement, within which is a man who receives 12 1/2 cents for the
                            admission of a visitor, and furnishes him with a lantern to ascend the
                            winding stairs between the outer and inner column— There are 28 steps of
                            ascent to the top of the basement, and 200. thence to the top of the
                            shaft and of the entablature over it— At every 25<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> step the stepping stone is wider than the rest to afford a
                            resting station—over the entablature is a cap, cylindrical and round
                            top’d over which stands a colossal statue of Washington in a Roman toga,
                            with a roll in his extended right hand meant for the constitution— There
                            is also a Statue of him in a corner of the basement below, and a bust in
                            a Niche, copied from that of <persRef ref="ceracchi-giuseppe"
                                >Ceracchi</persRef>— The whole is in elegant taste and the front of
                            the column forms a beautiful object to the eye, at different distances
                            throughout the whole length of Charles Street. After returning to

                            for the last five weeks, are too flattering, and more than my honest
                            nature can endure— It augurs some deep humiliation awaiting to teach me
                            in the last stage of my existence on earth, what I am, and the real
                            estimation in which I am held by the very small portion of my fellow

                            for which I ask for aid. A meek and quiet but genial spirit— I walked to
                            the capitol hill, and gave a sitting of nearly an hour to <persRef

                            and has scarcely painted half a dozen since.— It were well if she knew
                            that the word applicable to all her works is not paint, but daub.— The
                            poor woman said she had met with domestic affliction since my former
                            sittings, by losing a little boy <persRef ref="u">her Son</persRef>; a
                            calamity in which I deeply sympathised with her— I promised her another

                            conversation— One can scarcely imagine the degree of detestation in
                            which they are both held— No one knows what is to come— In four years
                            from this time the <persRef ref="harrison-william">successor</persRef>
                            may be equally detested. He is not the choice of three fourths of those
                            who have elected him— His present popularity is all artificial— There is
                            little confidence in his talents or his firmness— If he is not found
                            time-serving, demagogical, unsteady and western-sectional, he will more
                            than satisfy my present expectations.— Jackson’s Administration
                            commenced with fairer prospects and an easier career before him, than
                            had ever before been presented to any President of the United States—
                            His personal popularity founded exclusively upon the battle of
                            New-Orleans, drove him through his double-term and enabled him to palm
                            upon this Nation the Sycophant, who declared it glory enough to have
                            served under such a chief for his Successor. Both the men have been for
                            twelve years the tools of <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos
                                Kendall</persRef> the ruling mind of their dominion— Their edifice
                            has crumbled into ruin by the mere force of gravitation, and the
                            wretchedness of their cement— But what is to come? No halcyon days— One
                            set of unsound principles for another— One man in leading strings for
                            another— Harrison comes in upon a hurricane. God grant he may not go out
                            upon a reck!— Perhaps these gloomy reflections are chilled by the fall
                            of snow, which began before noon, and continued through the day without
                            storming. It confined me to the house till 5. P.M. when I went and dined

                                >Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> with a Letter from the first
                            Comptroller’s Office, signed <persRef ref="burke-james">J. N.

                                Office</hi> and assigning as a reason for the refusal of the
                            Collector at New-London to issue American papers to the purchaser of the
                            Schooner Amistad, sold by the <persRef ref="wilcox-luis">U.S.
                                Marshal</persRef> under a decree of the <persRef ref="judson-andrew"
                                >judge of the U.S. District Court in Connecticut</persRef>, that
                            there was an appeal from the Decree of the judge, and that it had not
                            been usual to issue papers upon an interlocutory or other than final
                            decree. I requested that this opinion from the comptroller’s Office
                            might be reconsidered; observing that the decree of the District Court
                            operated in rem— That the sale by the Marshal under that decree was the
                            act of the Law, not at all affecting the right of the party appealing
                            from the decree of salvage, but done for the benefit of all the parties
                            to save the perishable article for him to whom it should finally
                            adjudged to belong— That the refusal of the papers would invalidate the
                            sale by the Marshal and the decree of the judge, and give the purchaser
                            a just claim of damages against the Government itself, whose officers in
                            the two departments would thus counteract one another— If the decision
                            of the Secretary should adhere to this view from the Comptroller’s
                            office I should be under the necessity of commencing a correspondence
                            with the District judge concerning his decree— M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>Snow—</p>
                        <p>I called yesterday at the Office of the <persRef ref="gilpin-henry"
                                >Attorney General Gilpin</persRef>; but he was not there, nor
                            expected to be there, for the day— I then came home and debarred from
                            writing by the shivering cold of an atmosphere of attenuated snow wasted
                            the remainder of the day in alternate desultory reading upon China, and
                            dosing; with faculties absolutely torpid— Finished the cursory reading
                            of <persRef ref="ellis-henry">Ellis’s</persRef> journal of the
                            proceedings of <persRef ref="amherst-william">Lord Amherst’s</persRef>

                            Miscellaneous notices relating to China published in 1822 and skimmed
                            over the Document 119. of the last Session of Congress— The Snow
                            continued, with occasional intermissions, all day yesterday, all last
                            Night and this day, the whole day long— I have no recollection of a snow
                            storm of three days duration before— There has been however no gale, and
                            very little drifting of the Snow. About 18 inches deep of snow upon a
                            level has fallen. I rode to the Presbyterian Church and found it closed,
                            and the doors blocked up with snow. I came home, and occupied the
                            remainder of the day chiefly in reading. <persRef ref="doane-george"

                            at the age of 24— Born at Boston in February 1815. a graduate of Harvard
                            University in 1835 he perished almost in the blossom, but his virtues
                            have been well commemorated in these tributes of his patron, relative
                            and friend to his worth— His life was a bright example of religious
                            faith and fervent zeal— His talents were highly respectable, and there
                            are cited two or three of his poetical effusions in this pamphlet, at
                            once melancholy and pleasing— I often think when reflecting upon the
                            depravity of human Nature, what multitudes there are of persons unknown
                            to fame, of blameless life and unsullied virtue in the world; and how
                            unjust it is to pass sentence of universal condemnation upon mankind,
                            without making allowance for all that is good among them.— In all
                            Christian Countries, there is an immense account of practical virtue,
                            always in operation though never made known to the world— I wrote a
                            short Letter to Bishop Doane thanking him for the pamphlet; and then
                            recurred again to the Books brought from the Library of Congress,
                            relating to China— Among these, the Fan-qui in China, by <persRef

                            1838 is one of the most amusing— It is an account of the manners and
                            customs—the condition of domestic life in that country, more particular
                            than I have found elsewhere—in three duodecimo volumes— I read several

                        <p>It was broad daylight when I rose— The sky had cleared away cold, and I
                            lay abed shrinking from the task of pinching my feet with cold water,
                            and of making a wood fire in a chilly chamber, which after all I was
                            obliged to perform, having in the meantime lost the two best hours of
                            the day for work. This day commenced the second Session of the 26<hi

                            compelled me to ride to the Capitol and a quarter before 12. I took my
                            seat, being that which <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice

                            of the members were called over by States. 95 answered to the call and 7
                            new members were presented and sworn by the Speaker, among whom was

                        <p>Sharp head-ache almost the whole night, and very little sleep. Rode to
                            the Capitol— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> took the
                            Chair at Noon; and the roll was called over of members who had not
                            answered— Fifty additional members now answered to their names— A
                            Message was sent to the Senate, to inform them that a Quorum of the
                            house were assembled, and ready to proceed to business; and an order
                            passed for the appointment of a Committee, to be joined by a Committee
                            on the part of the Senate, to wait on the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
                                >President of the United States</persRef> and inform him that a
                            Quorum of both houses are assembled and ready to receive any
                            communication that he may be pleased to make to them. <persRef

                            the Committee on the part of the house. I gave notice of my purpose to
                            offer to-morrow a Resolution that the standing role of the house,
                            numbered 21. adopted on the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January
                            last be rescinded— It is the rule that abolition petitions shall not be
                            received or in any manner entertained by the house.— No other business
                            was transacted— The Senate did not form a Quorum, five additional
                            members only to those present yesterday having appeared one of whom was
                            the <persRef ref="king-william2">President pro tem. W. R.
                            King</persRef>.— The house adjourned about half past 12. Of the members

                                Barnard</persRef> who travelled with <persRef
                                ref="barnard-catharine">his wife</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="barnard-cora;u">two children</persRef>, left Philadelphia on
                            Saturday morning in the Cars, and at 9. O’Clock that evening found
                            themselves 23 miles from Baltimore, in the middle of the road with the
                            snow falling and the storm howling around them; and unable equally to
                            proceed or to recede— There of eighty passengers in the train, thirty of
                            whom were women, the greater number remained the whole night of
                            Saturday; the whole day and Night of Sunday, and Monday till near noon;
                            when fresh engines came and took them up, and brought them last night
                            into Baltimore. A small part of their company found a refuge in two or
                            three hovels, near the place where they were arrested, but fared worse
                            than those who adhered to the Cars— These made themselves comfortable by
                            shutting out the tempest, keeping up good fires, and foraging
                            successfully round the neighbourhood, for a supply of provisions—
                            Sergeant says there was in all this not much of hardship— The passengers
                            from the South brought an account that <persRef ref="thompson-waddy"
                                >Waddy Thompson</persRef> just beyond Petersburg in Virginia, was
                            knocked down between the two rails, and the whole train of five cars,
                            engine and all passed over his body without hurting him much, or perhaps
                            at all. He did not come on however in the cars— After the adjournment of
                            the house, I walked over and gave a sitting of two hours, to <persRef
                                ref="towle-eunice">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Towle</persRef>,
                            during which once or twice I fell asleep— This infirmity of old age
                            frequently happens to me, to mortify my pride, and to remind me how near
                            I am to the caducity of the last Scene of all. I promised M<hi

                            possible next Monday— I walked home. <persRef

                            kept their chambers. I paid an evening visit to my neighbour <persRef

                        <p>On my way to the Capitol this morning, I called at the Bank of
                            Washington; took my balanced book and drew 100 dollars in bills of other
                            banks by check— A Quorum of both houses was this day formed— The joint
                            committee waited upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
                                >President</persRef>, who informed them that he would send forthwith
                            a Message to the two houses. It was accordingly received and read—ready
                            printed for the Senate— <persRef ref="atherton-charles"
                                >Atherton</persRef> of New Hampshire moved that the Message should
                            be referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—and
                            that 15000 copies of it with the documents, and 5000 copies without the
                            documents be printed for the use of the members of the house, which was
                            carried— I had offered my resolution to rescind the 21<hi
                                rend="superscript">st.</hi> standing rule of the house— Jenifer

                                Williams</persRef> that it be postponed— I said I was willing to
                            take the question immediately without debate— I offered the Resolution,
                            at the earliest possible moment for two reasons—first because the
                            commencement of the Session is the time for receiving petitions—and
                            secondly because so far as the discharge of my duty was concerned I
                            would not suffer that rule to stand one hour as the Law of the house—
                                <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> moved that it should
                            be laid on the table— I said that if the house did not choose to take
                            the vote directly on the resolution, I should prefer next the question
                            of laying on the table, because it could then be called up at any time—
                            I asked for the yeas and nays and they were 82 to 58—all the South, and
                            Northern serviles voting in the affirmative— The house adjourned about
                            3.— I took out from the library of Congress, <persRef ref="barrow-john"

                                Greenhow</persRef> had stated to me last evening that in the
                            manuscript the word Ladino is inserted in the translations of both the
                            permits to ship the negroes, for which in the printed document the word
                                <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> is substituted— At the meeting of the
                            house Stanly moved to reconsider the vote for printing 15000 copies of
                            the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> Message with
                            the Documents—upon which the vote by yeas and nays was 89 to 90. I then
                            moved that a select Committee of five members be appointed to ascertain
                            and report to the house, whether the house document of the last Session
                            N. 185 has been falsified; and if so, by whom the falsification was
                            made; with liberty to send for person and papers— I stated the fact of
                            the difference between the manuscript and the printed document—then read
                            the note, on the false translation of the word ladino in the reprint of
                            the document at New-York and the censure upon it in <persRef

                            October last to <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef>,
                            published in the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter N. 8 and 9.—
                            No answer was made to me, and no objection to adoption of the
                            Resolution, but when the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>
                            put the question, several voices in the negative were heard—a division
                            was called and the vote stood 87 to 46. there were of course upwards of
                            40 who did not vote.— An order passed for the appointment of the
                            standing Committees; and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"
                                >Tillinghast</persRef> offered a very long resolution calling upon
                            the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for
                            information respecting the execution of the sub treasury law; which
                            after some discussion was rejected by the house. The annual report of
                            the Secretary of the Treasury upon the finances was received—and
                            referred to the Committee of Ways and Means and 5000 extra copies were
                            ordered to be printed. A Message from the President was received
                            recommending an immediate appropriation of 151352 dollars 39 cents for
                            the Navy Pension fund to meet payments which will become due on the 1<hi

                            were offered, and the house adjourned over to Monday— As I was returning
                            home, I met in the Avenue M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenhow, who
                            enquired if I had examined the document N. 185 in manuscript— I told him
                            that I had—and found it as he had said— And that I had offered a
                            Resolution to ascertain by whom the fraud has been committed— And that I
                            had taken care to exonerate him entirely from all blame in the matter— I
                            met at my door a man named <persRef ref="smith-john22">J. J.

                        <p>Mild and fair day. The Snow gradually melting away— I called this morning
                            on my neighbour <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Daniel D. Barnard</persRef>, and returned the manuscript
                            of his Lecture on the Morals of Politics— I had some conversation with
                            him upon our political prospects concerning which I feel far more
                            solicitude than hope— Barnard is one of the ablest men of the whig
                            party. His principles generally are of the best; dashed with errors the

                            humouredly, and with no small self complacency assured him that all was
                            right— Clay said he had visited <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi

                                Winthrop</persRef>. I called at the Office of the <persRef

                            that he had seen the President of the United States, concerning the case
                            of the Amistad negroes, and he had concluded that the case could not be
                            dismissed from the Supreme Court without an argument because the
                                <persRef ref="deargaiz-pedro">Spanish Minister</persRef> insisted on
                            the delivery up of the men as slaves to be sent to the Havana, as
                            Slaves—and further that the motion to dismiss the case was made in the
                            Circuit Court, and there refused— I said that the refusal of the Circuit
                            Court to dismiss the cause seemed no reason for precluding the
                            dismission of it from the Supreme Court, and that the Spanish Minister
                            had not only not demanded the delivery of the men as Slaves, but had
                            explicitly so demanded them as Assassins— He said there was a subsequent
                            Letter from the Spanish Minister in April last insisting upon the
                            delivery of the men as Slaves, upon the principles of certain
                            Resolutions of the Senate, adopted at their last Session— I denied the
                            right of the Spanish Minister to claim them as property—the pretended
                            owners having claimed them—and not having appealed from the decision—

                            next, when a discourse is to be delivered by <persRef

                            the Hall of the House of Representatives that evening for that
                            purpose—and wished me to offer the Resolution that it be granted; which
                            I promised to do.— They said the Institution was likely to flourish, and
                            that great interest was taken in it, by the people here— M<hi

                            have not yet returned.— The day was fully occupied and quickly passed
                            away— I made out my list of the persons to whom the documents of which
                            extra-copies are printed by order of the house, are to be sent— My rule
                            of distribution is 1. One copy to each of the Editors of the Newspapers
                            published at Plymouth (the Old Colony Memorial[)] Hingham Patriot and

                            District of Massachusetts— My portion of the extra documents, is seldom
                            sufficient for the whole of this supply— Often for not half of them— My

                            others are furnished according to the numbers of my allowance— I keep
                            lists of the extra documents printed by order of the house at each
                            Session, and of the names of the persons to whom I send them— I made out
                            my lists for the present Session; and despatched by the mail 17 copies
                            of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Presidents</persRef> annual
                            Message.— But the lists are imperfect till the meeting of the
                            Massachusetts Legislatures shall ascertain the Senators for the Counties
                            of Plymouth and Norfolk, and the Representatives from the 24 towns of
                            the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional district— I thought
                            it necessary to look into the case of the Amistad captives, to prepare
                            for the argument before the Supreme Court in January; of which I dare
                            scarcely to think— I read especially the Article in the American and
                            foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter of 1. October 1840. entitled the Amistad
                            case—p. 48–51. with deep anguish of heart, and a painful search of means
                            to defeat and expose the abominable conspiracy executive and judicial of
                            this Government against the lives of these wretched men— How shall the
                            facts be brought out? How shall it be possible to comment upon them with
                            becoming temper—with calmness—with moderation—with firmness—with
                            address—to avoid being silenced, and to escape the imminent danger of
                            giving the adversary the advantage in the argument, by over heated zeal.
                            Of all the dangers before me, that of losing my self possession is the
                            most formidable— I am yet unable to prepare the outline of the argument,
                            which I must be ready to offer the second week in January. Let me not
                            forget my duty.</p>

                        <dateline>Washington Sunday 13. December 1840.</dateline>
                        <p><date>13. VI. </date>Sunday </p>
                        <p>A bright sky overhead; a mild but snow-chilled atmosphere to breathe, and
                            a slushy carpet in the streets under foot was the circumstantial
                            condition of this day; and emblematical of the social and political
                            condition of the country.— I attended this morning at the Presbyterian
                            Church, and heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Wood</persRef> preach, from Hebrews 9.16. [“]For where a
                            Testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator
                            17. For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of
                            no strength at all while the testator liveth.” The argument of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood was, that the Gospel was the last
                            Will and testament of Jesus Christ; but he did not carry out the idea
                            suggested by his text, that the validity of this testament depends
                            entirely upon the death of the testator— This may be essential to the
                            orthodox doctrine of the atonement; but he did not dwell upon it. He
                            gave a summary account of the life of Jesus Christ: in a somewhat
                            singular manner and said he was until the age of thirty, professionally
                            a mechanic— Of this I know not what evidence there is— Certainly none in
                            the Gospels— Nor is the gospel any where denominated a Testament— He is
                            said by <persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef> to be the mediator of
                            the New <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>, and that is the Greek title of
                            what we call the new Testament— The congregation was very small— After
                            dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church,
                            where <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Hawley</persRef> read the Evening Service for the 3<hi
                                rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday in Advent, reading only the second
                            lesson, and preached from Ecclesiastes 9.1. [“]For all this I considered
                            in my heart, even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise
                            and their works, are in the hand of God”—there is a remnant of the verse
                            that he did not read. I slumped through the Snow to get to the Church;
                            and the frequency of the worshippers was on a par with the edification
                            of the discourse— At home my attention was diverted from the Amistad
                            Africans to <persRef ref="barrow-john">Barrow’s</persRef> travels in
                            China, which absorbed me for the remainder of the day— Barrow was the
                            private Secretary of <persRef ref="macartney-george">Lord
                                Macartney</persRef>, and his book is a valuable supplement to that
                            of <persRef ref="staunton-george2">Sir George Staunton</persRef>; and
                            they form altogether a marvelous account of that said Empire of China— A
                            patriarchal despotism realized over 300 millions of population, and
                            continuing from time immemorial.— A nation floating upon their rivers,
                            and never navigating the Ocean— Polygamy, Bestiality, Infanticide,
                            Idolatry, and brutal filthiness, commingled, with extreme politeness,
                            and high accomplishments in many of the useful and elegant arts.— The
                            extremes of civilization and of the savage state blended together in one
                            condition of human existence are portrayed with vivid colouring in these
                            narratives. Barrow was left at the Palace of Yuen Min Yuen while Lord
                            Macartney went to Zhe hol, and his description of the Consternation of
                            the Chinese household on learning the refusal of the Embassador to
                            perform the Ko-tou sheds some additional light upon the account of Sir

                            came this morning to ask my assistance to obtain work for them on the
                            new Treasury building, yet unfinished, but the last appropriation for
                            which is exhausted— The great body of these workmen were discharged on
                            the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of September. These two and eight
                            others were continued till the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this
                            month, and then dismissed at a time when they could not obtain work
                            elsewhere— They applied to the Executive Commissioners of the Public
                            buildings, the Secretaries of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
                                >Treasury</persRef>, <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">War</persRef> and
                            the <persRef ref="paulding-james">Navy</persRef>.— The men offered to
                            work without immediate pay, in reliance that Congress would make the
                            necessary appropriation. The answer from the Secretary of the
                            Commissioners is that they neither authorise nor prohibit the men from
                            resuming their work, and that they must apply to the superintendant
                                <persRef ref="noland-william">Nolan</persRef>; who like <persRef

                            without orders, and so the men and their families were left to starve— A

                            came and jabbered half an hour in a jargon composed in about equal parts
                            of French, Italian and English, with the same complaint. The Irishmen
                            told me they had been to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
                                Lincoln</persRef>, but he told them that he would no longer serve on

                            objected—debate—yeas and nays 200 to 3.— The two additional votes,
                            carried the motion to reconsider— More debate—final vote to print 10,000
                            copies with the documents.— Committees announced. As nearly as possible
                            the same as at the last Session— Committee of Manufactures all the same.

                            Patriot and sage, who at the last Session boasted that he had been one

                            should be. Instead of which he shot himself about two months ago, at a
                            Tavern in Baltimore— He had just been re-elected to Congress; and as
                            Leet was not ashamed to say, lived and died an honourable man— The
                            Resolution to wear crape for him passed of course, and the house
                            adjourned— I gave another sitting for my portrait to <persRef

                            a silly, self conceited fellow— Adjourned before 3— Returning from the

                            1840—to the Old Colony Memorial— I drew a check for the same sum, and
                            took it to <persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel to give

                            which from inadvertence to the manuscript direction upon it had been
                            thrown upon the heap of my castaway newspapers—of which I receive about
                            a dozen every day.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln was not at
                            his lodgings, and at Noon he left the City in the Cars for
                            Baltimore—leaving word with the Barkeeper at Brown’s that he would write
                            to me— On reaching the Capitol at 10. I found that the magnificent
                            Chandelier suspended in the hall of the house since the close of the
                            last Session of Congress, and said to have cost six thousand dollars,
                            had just broken down with a tremendous crash, and crushed several desks
                            of the members in its fall. I attended the select committee on the
                            falsification of House document N. 185— All the members present.

                            that he knew nothing of the alteration till after my resolution was
                            offered in the house— Trendholm testified that the alteration was made
                            by his direction to the compositor, and his reasons for it were that he
                            did not know the meaning of the word, Ladino and Ladina as applied to
                            negro Slaves he supposed the meaning of it must be sound— He said it was
                            usual in printing for the proofreader to correct manifest errors in the
                            copy and he produced several other instances in which it had been
                            done—one particularly in which some German manuscript writing had been
                            ludicrously disfigured— This man said he was a native of France,
                            educated in England; had been 16 years engaged in printing offices;
                            eight of the years in this City— At Noon the Committee took a recess of
                            half an hour, anticipating the adjournment of the house, within that

                        <p><date>20. V:30. </date>Sunday</p>
                        <p>I attended public worship this morning in the Hall of the House of
                            Representatives, and heard <persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi

                            Timothy 3.16—“And without controversy, great is the mystery of
                            godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen
                            of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
                            received up into glory.” A Christmas discourse; on the Godhead of Jesus
                            Christ. And he read the first chapter of the gospel of <persRef
                                ref="john">John</persRef>— The delivery of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Cookman is vehement and impassioned to excess— It is highly
                            popular, and I am of those who relish that style of speaking, which many
                            persons of cooler temper and calmer judgment disapprove. He began his
                            sermon this day thus—“Says the objector to the Christian Religion, and
                            to the holy scriptures, I cannot believe this system; for there is too
                            much of the marvellous too many miracles, too many <hi rend="italic"
                                >mysteries</hi> in it; I cannot reconcile it to my
                            understanding.[”]— Then he replied, if the objection of mystery could be
                            a sufficient ground for disbelief a man can believe nothing— The
                            simplest operations of nature, the growth of a blade of grass from the
                            seed, the course of the Sun round the heavens are mysteries as far
                            beyond the comprehension of the human mind, as any of the miracles
                            recorded in the Scriptures.— He then divided his subject into the six
                            particular properties, which constitute in their combination, the
                            greatness of the mystery of godliness, and commented upon each of them
                            in turn: and in expounding each of the properties he introduced the
                            texts of Scripture which explain or confirm them— The effort was to
                            demonstrate the divinity of Christ—certainly countenanced by numerous
                            texts, taken according to the Letter; but all susceptible of a spiritual
                            sense or requiring a different translation from that of Jamess Doctors.—
                            There was nothing new in the argument or in the authorities cited by
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman—nothing that produced a new
                            impression upon my mind— After the service I returned the visit of
                                <persRef ref="hunter-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Hunter</persRef> the Speaker; an amiable good hearted, weak headed
                            young man, prematurely hoisted into a place for which he is not fit;
                            precisely for his Virginian quiddities.— I sat and conversed an hour
                            with him but could make absolutely nothing of him— Another hour I passed
                            with <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel

                            observed at dawn of day. I hastened to the Capitol, as I found three
                            quarters of an hour before the time, and employed them in writing a

                            that he set the types according to the manuscript, and that the word

                            Greenhow brought with him the original manuscript of his translation,

                            the words negras ladinas— Greenhow said there was no possible sense in
                            which the word sound was a correct translation of the words Ladino or
                            Ladina— The examination of witnesses was closed; but there was no
                            definitive action of the Committee, the House being already in Session—
                            It was 20 minutes past 12. when I went down, and French the sub-clerk
                            was reading the vote of yeas and nays upon <persRef ref="davis-john8"

                            Bills, by general consent— This consumed the time so that when the

                            before the call for Resolutions could be announced a motion to adjourn

                            called up the Report of the Committee of Elections made at the last

                            debate he varied his motion, so as to take it up on the first Tuesday in
                            January which was carried— The States were called for petitions, but
                            very few were presented— Few Reports of Committees. <persRef

                        <p>I went this morning to the house, expecting to take little or no part in
                            the business of the day— But the States were called over for Petitions;
                            of which there were not a dozen presented— One of them was by <persRef
                                ref="james-francis">Francis James</persRef> the Pennsylvania Quaker—
                                <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef>
                            objected to its reception under the gag rule— It was sent to the
                                <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> who looked into it
                            and declared it within the rule— James insisted that it was not and the
                            reading of it was called for and refused— Someone moved to lay the
                            motion of reception on the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 99
                            to 53 When the State of Massachusetts was called, I said I had no
                            petition to present, but asked leave to offer my Resolution of Call upon
                            the Postmaster General, for a list of Post masters removed since the
                                3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1829— The Resolution was
                            received, but at <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay’s</persRef> motion was
                            ordered to lie over one day under the rule— The Committees were called
                            for reports— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> from the
                            Ways and Means reported the Navy and Indian annuity Appropriation
                            Bills.— When the Committee of Manufactures was called, I said I had no
                            report to make, but a motion that the bill N. 100 of the house of the
                            last Session, as it was when the Session closed should be referred to
                            the Committee— And now came an explosion totally unexpected by me—
                                <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> came out with a
                            gunpowder blast against the bill— The Speaker said my motion was not in
                            order— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> moved to suspend
                            the rule, to enable me to make the motion, which brought down <persRef
                                ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> with a broadside upon him, which he
                            returned double shotted— The rules were suspended by a vote of 131 to
                            45.— Wise then moved that the reference should be to the Committee of
                            Ways and Means, and made another Speech— Pickens called for the reading
                            of the title of the Bill which was done— Wise called for the reading of
                            the whole bill, which was begun; and he then modified his motion to the
                            reading all after the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section, which
                            was done— He insisted that the subject belonged to the Committee of Ways
                            and Means; and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef>
                            replied to him— <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>
                            all the time in a low almost inaudible voice repeating
                            question—question— <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef>
                            moved the previous question, which wise moved to lay on the table, but
                            withdrew his motion. It was carried, and the vote to refer to the
                            Committee of Manufactures was carried 109 to 50— Adjourned just before
                            3. But the New-Hampshire, Maine and New-York serviles flinched at the
                            last, and voted against the reference— Wise moved instructions to the
                            Committee to strike out, after the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            Section, all the remainder of the Bill; but withdrew the motion.

                        <p>I was roused just after four O’Clock this morning by a violent knocking
                            at the front door of the house by a man with two chimney sweeper boys
                            whom I let in to sweep the kitchen chimney. It was a little earlier than
                            my usual rising hour, and I did not return to bed. At half past ten I
                            met the Committee on the falsification of document N. 185— Present

                                >Dennis</persRef> was not in the house yesterday so that I could not
                            notify him of the meeting this morning— I suppose he has gone home to

                            clerks, were sworn and examined concerning a small slip of paper,
                            attached to the 87<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> page of the written
                            document, and containing merely the names given in Spanish upon that
                            page of the manuscript, anglicised— They testified that it was a loose
                            paper received with the manuscript document as returned from the
                            printers— French attached it by a wafer to the manuscript page— <persRef
                                ref="u">Trendholm</persRef> the proof reader of the printing Office
                            had acknowledged that the loose paper was in his hand-writing, but did
                            not recollect why he had written it— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            Barnard came in after the examination of French and Berry was over.—
                            There was conversation as to the principles on which the Report should
                            be drawn up— M’Kay and Medill appeared averse to any expression of
                            censure upon the practice either of the Printing Office or of the
                            Department of State— M’Kay requested me to state the principles on which
                            I thought the report should be prepared— I said I would state the fact
                            of falsification, and that it was done by the proof reader of the
                            printing Office—to express disapprobation of the altering of documents
                            at the printers, without authority and especially on matters so
                            material—to state also the interpolation of the word negros in the
                            copies and translations of the permit to <persRef ref="ruiz-jose"
                                >Ruiz</persRef>, and the omission of the name of <persRef ref="u"
                                >Francisco</persRef>, from the copy of the translated permit in the
                            manuscript from the Department of State— All this M’Kay and Medill
                            thought was not within the Commission— And I asked how the
                            printing-office, and the Department would stand with a report of the
                            falsification, and the name of the falsifier. Trendholm the proof
                            reader— Medill thought the reference to the testimony would be
                            sufficient— M’Kay was more wary— After much discussion, he proposed that
                            I should draw up a report according to my own views and lay it before
                            the Committee; to which I agreed— In the house the day was consumed upon
                            a Memorial from the Legislature of the State of Illinois and a motion of
                                <persRef ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> to refer it to the
                            Committee of Public Lands with Instructions to report a Bill to graduate
                            the price of the public lands down to nothing— This started the Land
                            robbery passion, and Reynolds, <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
                                >Pickens</persRef>, <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost

                            immediately after a refusal to adjourn by yeas and nays<space/>the house did
                            adjourn over to Monday without them— <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Frank

                            me in his own way to tell me that he was going to call up immediately
                            his bill <hi rend="italic">concerning</hi> the navy pension fund; which
                            he said could not take five minutes to pass, and asked whether I had any
                            particular enquiry to make about it— I found he knew nothing about his
                            own bill and set him upon his enquiries— <persRef ref="connell-john"

                        <p>Having heard last Sunday morning at the Capitol a very orthodox Christmas
                            Sermon, and having this day great need of my time, I dispensed with

                            had just called at my house while I was out.— Shortly before dinner, I
                            had visits from <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            Christmas days; but the condition of the family on the last and two or
                            three preceding years has deprived us of this pleasure, and of the
                            exercise of almost all acts of hospitality— At this time, <persRef

                            family is irksome—we could not all meet; but I invited a few members of
                            the house, and <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Connell</persRef>, the nine names first on the margin

                                Ogle</persRef> had promised to come, but did not. We had only men at
                            table—the Ladies preferring to dine together. The day went off
                            pleasantly, but I had no time, either to prepare for the argument before
                            the Supreme Court, so soon to overtake me—or to draw up the Report on
                            the falsification of the document N. 185, or to examine the condition of
                            the Navy pension fund, for the debate, which I intend if possible to
                            raise upon that appropriation Bill— I did however find a few of the most
                            important documents of the last Session relating to the Navy pension
                            fund and to the system of investing public monies and trust funds in
                            stocks of the States, which I consider equivalent to assuming so much of
                            State debts. In the search for the first authority to make investments
                            in stocks of the States, I must have recourse to the Journals and
                            Documents of both houses, the Register of debates, and the Laws for
                            several past Sessions. In the course of this pursuit, I trace the
                            investments in Stocks of the States to <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas

                            called at 10 O’Clock this morning, and I went with him first to the
                            Office of <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Stephen Pleasonton</persRef>
                            fifth Auditor of the Treasury to remonstrate against his arbitrary
                            attempt to cut down by a deduction of more than 4000 dollars the account
                            of <persRef ref="hammond-leonard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Hammond</persRef>—without allowing him even the right of petitioning
                            Congress for allowance of the deduction— Pleasonton refusing to abide by
                            the award of arbitrators, appointed by his own direction, had referred
                            the Bill to some dependent of his own office who reduced it ad libitum
                            and then reported to the Secretary of the Treasury the reduced bill, to
                            be paid upon Hammond’s signing a receipt in full of all demands.
                                <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Woodbury</persRef> directs another petty retrenchment, and orders
                            the bill to be paid accordingly. I insisted that the whole bill ought to
                            be paid according to the award of the referees, but M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed only demanded what Hammond himself
                            had brought his mind to consent to; that is that he should take the
                            amount of the reduced Bill, reserving the right to petition Congress for
                            the remainder— Pleasonton shuffled about this, till at last said he was
                            willing, but the Secretary of the Treasury had directed otherwise— We
                            then went to the Secretary himself, who told us that he had not
                            examination of the case at-all; and that he had directed one small
                            charge which he thought inadmissible to be struck out in all other
                            respects had merely confirmed Pleasonton’s report and particuly in
                            requiring a receipt in full of all demands from Hammond. That he had no
                            objection to Hammond’s reserving the right to petition Congress, and
                            would so direct if Pleasonton would write him a line advising it— We
                            next returned to Pleasonton who shuffled again insisting that he had not
                            recommended the exaction of the receipt in full, till at last he went
                            and fetched the copy of his letter to the Secretary, and there it was in
                            so many words— I almost lost my temper, and as M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Hammond last evening had requested me to do spoke to him
                            very plain— Reed teazed him to write the Letter to the Secretary which
                            he had promised, and to which Woodbury had promised to conform, leaving
                            to Hammond the right to Petition Congress, but he preferred making
                            another trial to compromise and settle with Hammond himself—to which we
                            agreed; but I told him if he did not agree with Hammond, it should go
                            before Congress, for I would introduce it there— At the house, <persRef
                                ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of
                            Naval Affairs, called up the Bill appropriating upwards of 151000

                            The house went into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union—
                                <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> in the Chair— The

                            the Chair; but I asked him to excuse me; as I intended to address the
                            Committee on the Bill. I did so, and opened a debate not soon to close—
                            The Bill was reported to the House— <persRef ref="shepard-charles"

                            referred them; all which he had already done yesterday— I told him that
                            I had heard all this yesterday, and could not possibly judge of the
                            correctness of estimates so widely differing from each other for the

                                >r</hi> Pleasonton and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hammond were
                            to have agreed together and settled the account between them— He said
                            that was what they proposed to do this day; but M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Pleasonton was apprehensive that I might mention the subject
                            in the house— I assured him I should not do this unless it should turn
                            out that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasonton and M<hi

                            were not so incredulous— They thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            was postponed to the next Tuesday at half past ten, whether the Senate
                            Bill should also be reported— When I entered the house I found them
                            debating a motion by <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef>
                            of Ohio, to reconsider the Section of the Navy pension appropriation
                            Bill, repealing the Act of 3. March 1837—moved yesterday by <persRef
                                ref="shepard-charles">Charles Shepard</persRef> and carried— And the
                            Bill actually so passed— This debate continued about an hour, and I took
                            part in it— Shepard rose and began to reply when a message from the
                            Senate announced the death of <persRef ref="grundy-felix">Felix
                                Grundy</persRef>, a member of that body from Tennessee—whereupon
                                <persRef ref="brown-aaron">A. V. Brown</persRef> pronounced the
                            regular Eulogy upon him, and moved the crape-veiled Resolutions, and the
                            immediate adjournment of the house—adopted of course— I went to the
                            chamber of the Committee of Manufactures—drew up a short report on the
                            falsified document, and assorted the papers for publication— At 4. p.m.
                            I went to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

                        <p>Two Ladies whose names have escaped me, called this morning with a
                            subscription paper, for a one dollar annual contribution for the poor of
                            the foundery methodist church— They took the dollar as a donation.— A
                                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rudolph</persRef>, came and informed me that he
                            was from Boston— That he was poor, and had come and brought his family
                            with him to get a place— He believed the Commissioner of public
                            buildings had one to bestow, and he would thank me for a Letter of
                            recommendation to that Officer— I told him I was not in that habit of
                            recommending any person for Officer; and especially that I could not
                            recommend any person with whom I had no acquaintance— I went to the
                            Capitol an hour before the meeting of the house, and spent it in
                            preparing the Bill for the more effectual collection of the revenue to
                            be reported to the house; and I gave it with the draught of a report on
                            the falsified document, to <persRef ref="berry-brooke">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berry</persRef> of the
                            <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef> Office to be copied— At the meeting of the house, I asked leave
                            to present the four Resolutions in relation to investments of public
                            monies in the stocks of the States and the sales of such Stocks which I
                            had prepared at the last Session of Congress, but which the house then
                            refused to receive— No objection was now made to receiving them, and the
                            <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> was about taking the question upon their adoption when <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
                            Johnson</persRef> objected and they were laid-over; with an order that they be
                            printed— <persRef ref="mason-samson">Samson Mason</persRef> asked leave to introduce a Resolution of enquiry
                            concerning the cost of certain Indian schools stipulated by Treaties—but
                            Cave Johnson stopped that, as being out of order; insisting that <persRef ref="shepard-charles">Charles
                            Shepard</persRef> had the floor on the motion to reconsider the Section of the
                            navy pension appropriation act which repeals the Act of 3. March 1837—
                            Accordingly Shepard proceeded for about an hour, in a venomous,
                            sophistical and unprincipled speech, in which he vented a long gathering
                            burden of spleen against me, for which I had in readiness, a castigation
                            which I shall not be allowed to administer; for after Shepard finished,
                            several other members discussed and discoursed upon the act of 3. March
                            1837. almost without touching upon its real merits, till 3. O’Clock when
                            <persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jameson</persRef> of Missouri moved the previous Question; which cuts off my right
                            of reply.— A motion was then made and carried to adjourn— <persRef ref="brockway-john">Brockway</persRef> has
                            got up a subscription to print my Speech of Monday in a pamphlet— I
                            called at the Office of the National Intelligencer and took from <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> a couple of copies of this day’s
                            paper in which the Speech is reported by <persRef ref="u">Wheeler</persRef>—to revise it, which I
                            was yet not able to do this Evening— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Seaton gave me a budget of Letters which he has received from

                        <p><date>31. VI. </date>Thursday.</p>
                        <p>I had yesterday notified the members of the Committee on the falsified
                            document, to meet this morning to consider the report that I had
                            prepared to be presented to the house. <persRef ref="dennis-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Dennis</persRef> is gone home to keep the Christmas holidays, and <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef> forgot my notification, so that
                            <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> and <persRef ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef> were my only associates at the meeting— In the
                            discussion at the last Meeting upon the principles on which the report
                            should be drawn up, I had proposed to touch upon the other mutilation of
                            the document charged by <persRef ref="jay-william">judge Jay</persRef>—upon the practice of allowing proof
                            readers to depart from their copy, in the printing of public documents,
                            upon the omission of one of the names of the 49 negroes in the
                            translation of the Passport for the Ladinos of <persRef ref="ruiz-jose">Ruiz</persRef>, in the document
                            from the Department of State, whence I inferred that it had been
                            transmitted from the Department without being collated—to all which
                            M’Kay and Medill had objected; and said it was not within the authority
                            of the Committee; that they were charged only to report facts; and that
                            all these circumstances to which I alluded might be very proper for a
                            speech, and not for a report— I told them then what the consequence of
                            their tight lacing would be; but I prepared the report according to
                            their measure, simply stating the fact of falsification—and by whom it
                            was committed—referring to the testimony, without one word of comment.
                            It did not suit them— They wanted to acquit the proof reader of all bad
                            intention and the house printers of all responsibility—the
                            administration of all knowledge or participation in the wrong— I said if
                            the report must give opinions, I could not forbear to pass censure upon
                            all those parties— It came to be 12. O’Clock— They did not know whether
                            to agree to the report or not. They would consult together and let me
                            know.— M’Kay took the testimony which he afterwards returned to me in
                            the house: but postponed telling me whether they would agree to my
                            report or not— In the house numerous Bills from the Senate were twice
                            read and referred—and Two Messages from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>, one of them the
                            answer to my call for documents relating to China— I reported from the
                            Committee of Manufactures for the more effectual collection of the
                            revenue. <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> attempted to prevent it from getting in; but failed—
                            Referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union.— I
                            asked <persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jamieson</persRef> to withdraw his motion for the previous question to
                            enable me to reply to <persRef ref="shepard-charles">Charles Shepard</persRef>— Jamieson refused— I appealed to
                            the Justice of the house in vain— They sustained the previous question,
                            and refused to reconsider.— A Letter form <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef>, one from the house
                            printers complained that the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> had given much of the house printing
                            and binding to <persRef ref="langtree-samuel">Langtree</persRef>— After debate referred to a Select committee of
