						<p>We had fixed on to-morrow as the day of our departure upon our return to
							Quincy, but <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> was
							so unwell in the former part of this day that it was doubtful whether we
							should not be under the necessity of postponing our movement, one or
							more days— Towards evening however she so far recovered her strength and
							Spirits that she concluded to proceed in the morning— We were all
							intently occupied and none more so than <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams</persRef>, in packing up,
							settling accounts and bills, and getting ready to go at six O’Clock
							to-morrow. Mary has concluded to go, and take her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, with us. As the order of
							the <persRef ref="selden-william">Treasurer of the United
								States</persRef> in favour of myself as Attorney to <persRef
								ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer Lobdell</persRef>, promised me by
							the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, to
							be forthcoming yesterday was not yet in hand, I called this day noon at
							his Office and received it from him— It was drawn on the Collector of
							the Customs at Boston, instead of the new <persRef ref="hill-isaac"
								>Receiver General Isaac Hill</persRef>, as I had requested and he
							had promised— He now said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hill had
							not yet quite completed his arrangements for entering upon the execution
							of his office— I asked him what was the present condition of the
							Smithsonian funds invested in bonds of the State of Arkansaw.— He said
							the interest upon the bonds had been hitherto punctually paid, and he
							was just now receiving proposals for a new investment of the interest of
							the last half year—and he read to me several Letters containing these
							proposals.— They were of the States of New-York and others at 5. per
							Cent a year, and at about 90 per Cent, and of Kentucky and Arkansaw at 6
							per Cent interest—the Kentucky bonds at 90 per Cent, and those of
							Arkansaw at 70. He said he should take the lowest bid. I expressed my
							strong disapprobation of the Sale by the <persRef ref="paulding-james"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef> of Stocks of the States, at a much
							lower price than he had purchased them at— He said there had never been
							any sale of the Stocks of the States by the Department of the Treasury.—
							Besides the struggle to redeem the arrears of my Diary which accrued
							unavoidably in the last fortnight of the Session, I answered and
							declined the invitation of <persRef ref="downing-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> A. J. Downing</persRef> to visit his
							Botanical Garden, and Nursery at Newburgh opposite <persRef
								ref="dewindt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Wint’s</persRef>— My wife visited this evening her brother <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas B.
								Johnson</persRef>, who has been very sick, but is convalescent.
								<persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> left us this day, and removed to
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye’s</persRef>. My neighbour <persRef ref="parris-albion">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="cutts-mary">his daughter</persRef> visited us this
							Evening; and <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee, with whom I had a long
							conversation, upon the prospects of the Presidential Election— We agreed
							that the present appearances were favourable, though by no means certain
							for a change; but I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell, what were
							the expectations beyond the change, and found him quite unprepared to
							answer— He knew not who would compose the Cabinet of <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Harrison</persRef>, and was not disposed to bestow much confidence
							in advance upon whoever it might be— I told him that at all Events he
							must be the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and he confessed
							that it would be the summit of his ambition— I was up packing till near
							midnight— Dismissed <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas</persRef> with a
							warm recommendation—</p>

						<p>From Washington through Baltimore to Philadelphia.</p>
						<p>At six this morning, with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, my deceased son <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">widow</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef

								ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy Leary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="flinn-mary">Mary Flinn</persRef> a waiting man and woman,
							natives of Ireland I took the Rail-road Cars from Washington to
							Baltimore, which city we reached at half past eight— The Cars were
							filled as usual, but of the other passengers the only one with whom I
							was acquainted was <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph R. Underwood</persRef> a member
							of the House of Representatives from Kentucky; who left our company at
							the viaduct house seven miles short of Baltimore— He is returning home
							and was to join company with <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Pope</persRef> on the road to
							Frederick this day— After waiting one hour at Baltimore we started in
							the Railway Cars for Philadelphia—crossed the causway between two waters
							24 miles from Baltimore, and the Susquehanna river at Havre de Grace 36
							miles from Baltimore—snatched a scramble dinner, the Ladies not
							alighting from the Cars at Wilmington Delaware 36 miles from
							Philadelphia, and reached Grays ferry nearly an hour before the Cars
							from Philadelphia, for Baltimore came out to meet us.— The Horses which
							took them out took us in and at 4. P.M. we alighted at the depot in
							Market Street— Here was bustle and confusion, but we found good lodgings
							at the Union Hotel in Chesnut Street, now kept by <persRef
								ref="jones-john10">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>,
							who was formerly the bar keeper at the United States Hotel— Many of the
							passengers from Baltimore, proceeded immediately in another line of Cars
							to New-York— The distance between that City and Washington being now
							regularly one day’s journey— We met in the drawing room at Jones’s,
								<persRef ref="williams-elizabeth2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Williams</persRef>, daughter of the late <persRef
								ref="pinkney-william">William Pinkney</persRef> of Baltimore, in
							deep mourning, and on her return alone from the North where she has been
							with her <persRef ref="williams-cumberland">sick husband</persRef>— She has so much changed since I had last seen her
							that I did not know her till she recognized me and named herself to me—
							Towards evening I walked out and called at <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> John Sergeant’s</persRef>. At his door, as I rung the bell I met his
							third daughter <persRef ref="wise-sarah">Sarah</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry A.
								Wise</persRef> to whom she is engaged to be married— They were
							walking out together, and as soon as she had ascertained that her father
							and <persRef ref="sergeant-margaretta">mother</persRef> were both gone
							out, I hastened to take leave, conscious of being quite a supernumerary
							in that company. In the evening M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sergeant called upon us at our lodgings,
							but my wife and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams had both gone
							to bed. <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Connell</persRef> likewise paid me a visit, and I had conversation
							with him respecting the Bank of the United States and <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas
								Biddle</persRef>— It has been recently charged that he is indebted
							to the Bank far beyond his means of solvency; and the stock of the bank
							has within a few days fallen from 73 to 61— Connell says that the charge
							is false and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle owes nothing to
							the Bank— I suppose he means on his own account. There is a heavy debt
							due from the late Cashier <persRef ref="cowperthwaite-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cowperthwait</persRef>. Connell says
							he believes it is all secured? Oh! quantum est in rebus inane! I saw
							this Evening also <persRef ref="sears-david2;sears-miriam">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								David Sears</persRef> of Boston, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Aylwin</persRef>, the daughter of
							<persRef ref="langdon-john3">John Langdon</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>31. V. </date>Friday.</p>
						<p>From Philadelphia to New-York. Long-Island Sound.</p>
						<p>This morning we left our lodgings at the Union Hotel, and at 7. O’Clock
							departed in the Steamer, for Bordentown; and thence proceeded in the
							Cars to South Amboy; and thence in the Steamer Independence to
							New-York—as we were drawing up to the wharf, a man was leaning against
							the slight railing round the bow of the boat—the railing gave way and
							the man was precipitated into the river—before the alarm could be given
							he was far astern of the Steamer, and apparently could not swim; she was
							immediately backed to endeavour to save him, and the aid of several
							small boats plying in the vicinity of the spot was called and given, but
							before he could be reached he went down and was ushered into eternity—
							The steamer went in to the side and I gave no sign of feeling more than
							others, but the heart knew its own bitterness.</p>
						<p>At the same wharf where the Independence landed at 3. in the afternoon
							was lying the Steamer Massachusetts to depart at 5 for Stonington and
							Providence— I merely crossed the wharf from one boat to the other, and
							went not in to the City at all— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef> took a stroll,
							and returned— At 5. P.M we parted from the wharf, and the first
							operation of the Steamer was to run down and swamp a small row boat in
							which were three men, who in an instant found themselves floating in
							deep waters, to struggle for their lives. They were however all saved,
							and we made no stay to apologize for the cold bath into which we had
							plunged them— I met some old acquaintance and made some new ones in the
							course of this day— Among the morning passengers from Philadelphia was
								<persRef ref="moore-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Moore</persRef>, some time Director of the United States Mint in
							that City, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wharton</persRef> a Lawyer of some standing— <persRef
								ref="fisher-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Fisher</persRef> said to be <unclear>86</unclear> years of age, who
							accosted me, and told me that the first time he saw me was at the house
							of <persRef ref="johnson-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua
								Johnson</persRef> on Tower Hill at London in 1796 or 1797— He
							introduced me now to <persRef ref="fisher-nancy">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Fisher</persRef>, his wife and said they were going on
							a visit to <persRef ref="king-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Alsop King</persRef> on Long-Island—his son, <persRef
								ref="king-charles4">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								King</persRef> having married a <persRef ref="king-hannah">grand
								daughter</persRef> of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher— We had
							also as Messmate passengers <persRef ref="warren-john;warren-susan">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								John Warren</persRef> of Boston, and <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef> daughter of <persRef ref="sears-david2"
								>David Sears</persRef>, and wife of <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">B. W. Crowninshield’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="crowninshield-george">son</persRef>. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren has been to Philadelphia, to
							testify in a trial upon habeas corpus, for the possession of an <persRef
								ref="dhautville-frederick">infant</persRef> between a young Genevan
							named <persRef ref="dhautville-paul">d’Hauteville</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="dhautville-ellen">his wife</persRef> a daughter of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sears—a Marriage of disappointed
							ambition made by the mother under a delusive belief that d’Hauteville
							was a Count, when her daughter was with her in her late European tour.
							When they found that he was a mere plebeian his wife deserted him,
							returned to her mother, and came back with her from Europe— Meanwhile
							this child, a son was born; and she has kept him in her charge— But
							d’Hauteville has followed them from Europe, demanding first his wife;
							but upon finding her reluctant, waiving that claim and insisting only
							upon his paternal right to the child— There has been much extra-judicial
							negotiation, and much litigation in state tribunals in the case which is
							now under advisement upon a habeas corpus before a judge at
							Philadelphia— I took two State Rooms in the Massachusetts and we cleaved
							the waters of Long-Island Sound, through a smooth sea a light eastern
							breeze, and a dark Evening till I turned in at 10 p.m.</p>
