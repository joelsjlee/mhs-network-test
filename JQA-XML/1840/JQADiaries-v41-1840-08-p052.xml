						<dateline>Quincy. Saturday 1. August 1840.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. II:30 </date>Saturday</p>
						<p>Stonington— Providence. Boston— Quincy.</p>
						<p>Heavy rain in the Night—but little wind, and a smooth Sea so that I slept
							nearly four hours, a rare fortune for me, in a Steamer— We landed at
							Stonington in the midst of the rain, a few minutes before 3.— There were
							upwards of 300 passengers, and of course a scramble for the seats in the
							Cars.— There is one which they call the Ladies Car, and when my <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">Ladies</persRef> had gone
							into it the conductor stoppd me and told me it was reserved for the
							Ladies— I said I was with Ladies; upon which he said the Car was already
							full.— With much difficulty I found a place in the foremost Car, and he
							turned <persRef ref="leary-jeremy">Jerry</persRef> in the Deck Car—that
							is a Car next to the Engine, and exclusively for the Deck or half price
							passengers— These are regulations not used in the Southern boats, and
							were new to me here— The scramble for places is a vexatious and
							unnecessary annoyance which would be removed by numbering the seats and
							furnishing the passengers with tickets correspondingly numbered— The
							rain continued and the cars flew till we reached the river, at
							Providence and snatched a cup of Coffee and a cracker while crossing the
							river in the Steamer. Then took seats again in the line of Cars, and at
							half past eight O’Clock landed at the railway depot in Boston— There we
							found a Hack-Stage belonging to the American House which we engaged and
							in which we were taken out to our residence at Quincy— Here we landed
							once more at half past nine in the morning—fifty two hours from our
							house in F. Street Washington and 16 1/2 hours from the wharf at
							New-York— My first movement is of grateful acknowledgment to a benign
							Providence which has preserved and protected us all safe and unhurt
							through the perils of a long journey though performed in a very short
							time, and to the melancholy catastrophe of one of which I was an
							afflicted eye-witness. And to the blessing of our own safe arrival is
							added that of finding all our family here in good health and comfortable
							tranquility— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Sons</persRef> two elder
							sons <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles7">Charles Francis</persRef> were at our house
							when we alighted— He came over immediately after and then <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> with her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef> all with cordial
							greeting— The pangs inexpressible in words of the deep affliction in
							which we left this place last November, were too acute for the fortitude
							of a mother’s heart—my own feelings could be and were suppressed.
								<persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kirk-elizabeth">his wife</persRef> were here expecting us, and
							prepared to receive us— The rain continued with intervals through the
							day, and confined me almost entirely to the House I did however visit my
							garden and Nursery, which I found in no satisfactory condition; but I
							have lost almost all my interest in them— I unpacked my trunks, and
							began to write as I could, a Letter to <persRef ref="lobdell-ebenezer"
								>Ebenezer Lobdell</persRef>, and this Diary from the day before we
							left Washington.— This occupied the day; and I spent the Evening with my
							Son and his wife at their House; where I saw their youngest son <persRef
								ref="adams-henry4">Henry Brooks</persRef>— All their children are
							thriving.— The <persRef ref="angier-joseph">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d</hi> Joseph Angier</persRef>, of Milton was a fellow
							passenger with us from New-York and gave me a pamphlet containing two
							Sermons, preached at Mobile, Alabama, on the 10<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> and 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May last, by
								<persRef ref="simmons-george">George F. Simmons</persRef>—which I
							read this morning in the Cars—</p>

						<p>Communion day at Meeting— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached his morning
							Sermon, from Acts 17.21. “For all the Athenians and Strangers which were
							there, spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear
							some new thing”— It is the doom of the Christian church to be always
							distracted with controversy; and where religion is most in honour, there
							the perversity of the human heart breeds the sharpest conflicts of the
							brain— The Sentiment of Religion is at this time perhaps more potent and
							prevailing in New-England, than many other portion of the Christian
							world— For many years since the establishment of the theological school
							at Andover the Calvinists and Unitarians have been battling with each
							other upon the atonement, the divinity of Jesus Christ and the Trinity—
							This has now very much subsided—but other wandering of minds takes the
							place of that, and equally lets the wolf into the fold. A crack-brained
							young man named <persRef ref="emerson-ralph">Ralph Waldo
								Emerson</persRef>, son of my once loved friend, <persRef
								ref="emerson-william">William Emerson</persRef>, and a Classmate of
							my lamented son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, after
							failing in the every day avocations of a Unitarian preacher and
							school-master, and starts a new doctrine of transcendentalism, declares
							all the old revelations superannuated and worn out, and announces the
							approach of new Revelations and prophesies— <persRef
								ref="garrison-william">Garrison</persRef> and the Non-resistant
							abolitionists, <persRef ref="brownson-orestes">Brownson</persRef> and
							the Marat Democrats, Phrenology and Animal Magnetism all come in
							furnishing each some plausible rascality as an ingredient for the
							bubbling cauldron of religion and politics— <persRef
								ref="cranch-christopher">Pearce Cranch</persRef> ex-ephibis preached
							here last week, and gave out quite a stream of this transcendentalism,
							most unexpectedly— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s discourse this
							morning was intended to counteract the effect of these wild and
							visionary phantasies, and he spoke with just severity of the application
							of this Spirit of hurly burly innovation to the most important and
							solemn duties of the Christian faith— He treated the subject but in
							part; and promised to discourse further upon it hereafter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s opinions favour a compromise
							between the past and the future; disapproving alike the obstinate and
							bigoted adherence to establishments and dogmas, merely because they are
							old; and the restless and reckless pursuit of mere innovation— <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef> was not in the pulpit and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt administered the Communion alone. After dinner, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s Sermon was from <persRef
								ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef> 28.19. “Go ye, therefore, and teach
							all Nations, baptizing them, in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
							and of the Holy Ghost.” This is also a deeply controversial text, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt admitted that it was one of
							those upon which the doctrine of the Trinity was built, and is
							advocated— But he thought that Doctrine so incompatible with the first
							principle of the unity of the supreme Creator of the universe, that it
							was not worth discussing, and that the Holy Ghost was but the emanation
							of the Spirit of God, pervading all time and all space but giving no
							countenance whatever to the Creed of a divine Trinity. I read part of a
							Sermon of <persRef ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef>, upon rash
							judgments— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The Midshipman <persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy Adams</persRef>,
							and his <persRef ref="foster-francis">Cousin Francis Foster</persRef>
							were here this morning. The Midshipman has recently returned from a two
							years cruise in the Sloop of War John Adams <persRef ref="wyman-thomas"
								>Captain Wyman</persRef>, in a Squadron under <persRef
								ref="read-george">Commodore Read</persRef> Captain of the Frigate
							Macedonian. They have been in the Chinese, Indian and South Seas and
							visited Brazil, Chili and Peru, the Islands of the South Sea, Canton,

								ref="foster-frances">his mother</persRef>, who is passing the Summer
							with <persRef ref="adams-ann">her Sister</persRef>, my brother <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">Thomas’s</persRef> widow— After dinner two young
							men from Boston <persRef ref="fields-james">James Thomas
								Fields</persRef> and <persRef ref="hobart-e">E. Hobart</persRef>
							came as a Committee from the Mercantile Library Association, to invite
							me to deliver an address before them at their anniversary meeting some
							time in the course of the next Month— Without positively declining, I
							prepared them to receive my excuses hereafter— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went to Boston, but returned
							home to dine and spent the Evening with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— How great a change in my
							way of life, from the perpetual action of fourteen hours a day at the
							Capitol in Washington, to the repose and meditation of this place, with
							no defined call to business of any kind— Yet my time is wholly absorbed
							here as well as there. And here as there the only labour of my life is
							writing— I have not yet retrieved the arrears of my Diary towards and at
							the conclusion of the Session of Congress; but as always happens, when I
							have any choice of my own occupation my attention is scattered upon a
							variety of subjects instead of being concentrated upon one— I would now
							prescribe for myself the following order of employment for the four
							months of interval till the next Session of Congress. 1. The Diary—two
							hours each day 2. Reading the Newspapers two hours. 3. Hearing my
							Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, read one
							Chapter in the French Bible of <persRef ref="desacy-louis">Silvestre de
								Saci</persRef>— She began this morning, by reading the first chapter
							of the Book of Joshua—and I read in the English Bible after her—verse by
							verse. Breakfast half an hour. Dinner an hour and a half, including a
							visit to my garden, Nursery, Seminary and Orchard, writing one Letter
							two hours.— Wastage three hours— Miscellaneous reading two hours,
							exercise two hours— Writing out Speeches, Lectures, addresses,
							discourses, two hours—and lastly—Biography of <persRef ref="adams-john"
								>my father</persRef>— What time is there left for this; the most
							important of all— I have already looked into <persRef
								ref="leclerc-george">Buffon’s</persRef> natural history of Man;
								<persRef ref="butler-samuel3">Butler’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hudibras">Hudibras</persRef>—<persRef ref="plautus"
								>Plautus’s</persRef> Mercator, and Charles brought me out this
							Evening from Boston, <persRef ref="brownson-orestes"
								>Brownson’s</persRef> Boston Quarterly Review<hi
								rend="strikethrough">ing</hi> for July 1840—containing an Article
							upon Transcendentalism, and one upon the laboring classes— Brownson is a
							broken Parson, who after losing his Capital of Atheism and Hypocrisy in
							the pulpit, has transferred the rags and tatters of his religion to the
							field of politics, and swindles for <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren</persRef>, under the mask of democracy.</p>

							returned the two Volumes of <persRef ref="winthrop-john2"
								>Winthrop’s</persRef> Journal, and the old Manuscript Volume of the
							Braintree town records, which he had borrowed last Summer.— I despatched

									>r</hi> Anthony Collamore</persRef> of Pembroke, enclosing a
							pension certificate for <persRef ref="stetson-lydia">Lydia

								>Thomas P. Beal</persRef> of Kingston, respecting the act for the
							relief of <persRef ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer Lobdell</persRef>.— I
							had forwarded the Treasurer’s draft in favour of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lobdell to him yesterday; and this day began a reply to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Beal whose Letter burns with politicks— I
							have yet but partially visited my seedling trees, but enough to find, as
							I never fail to do; upon returning to them an abundance of
							disappointments, and here and there encouragement to hope and gratified
							expectation— No new seedlings of the last Autumns sowing. The cruel
							distress in which we passed the last six weeks, before our departure;
							the agonies of our separation from that <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>adored child</persRef>, the pang of which will go with me to my
							dying day, the anguish of her long protracted sufferings, and that
							frightful creeping upon her of Death, from hour to hour for weeks and
							months in succession disqualified me for all energetic action and
							extinguished almost all the interest I had so long taken in the
							cultivation of trees. There were two small plats in the seminary which I
							had specially given to her and in which she took delight— There were
							various seedlings upon them— One of them is now entirely overgrown with
							weeds, except one peach of the second year of stunted growth— On the
							other a black currant yet stands and bears its first berries, with an
							unthirsty apple seedling at its side— A self planted violet covered it
							with blossoms through the whole of last Summer, and there is a remnant
							of them there now. Oh! if I could describe the Sensations, which I feel
							on looking upon those two plats, it would be conceived how all the
							pleasure has vanished with which I was wont to look at the plats which I
							had given to each of my other grandchildren, as tokens to them of kind
							remembrance of me, when I shall sleep with their and my fathers. I have
							thought it would be to them a pleasing though perhaps a melancholy
							recollection— I did not think of the withered violet—the flower cut off
							in it bloom— Was not this trial fixed upon me as a warning? I spent part
							of the Evening in <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							porch; with him and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt— <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> in the meantime came down here, and Charles came
							to return with her at the close of the Evening— In the intervals between
							my spells of writing, I attempted to read the atheist priest <persRef
								ref="brownson-orestes">Brownson’s</persRef> Article upon
							Transcendentalism which is as dull as it is impudent, hypocritical and
							provoking.— If his account of <persRef ref="cousin-victor"
								>Cousins</persRef> philosophy is correct, Cousin himself is no
							better.</p>

						<p>I had from the age of sixteen when the beard first presented itself on my

							considerably fallen off—the Shoe and boot business fares still worse—
							The <persRef ref="u">Curtis’s</persRef> who kept at least thirty men

							Transcendentalism in <persRef ref="brownson-orestes"
								>Brownson’s</persRef> Boston Quarterly Review— Hypocritic, perhaps
							self-delusive Atheism, into which every man irretrievably falls, who
							begins by setting aside the Bible, and betakes himself to the standard
							of reason to measure the infinite and the finite—spirit and matter—God
							and the Universe— All such speculations find no end, in wandering mazes
							lost— They are all words differently significant to different minds and

						<p>Having retrieved the recent arrears of my diary, I began this day the
							assortment of my Letters, received many, of which however I packed in my
							chest to follow me from Washington— This was the first clear morning
							since I reached home, and I went up to see the Sunrise from the corner
							of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— I finished
							the reading of Brownson’s Articles on Transcendentalism, and on the
							labouring Classes— The disorganizing principles of politics, morals, and
							religion—which belonged to the most ferocious and bloody period of the
							French Revolution are returning upon us all their savage brutality,
							modified, by hypocritical professions of religion— <persRef
								ref="brownson-orestes">Brownson</persRef> has been successively a
							universalist minister, an avowed atheist, a Unitarian minister, a
							newspaper politician, and a democratic pamphleteer— <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef> has given him the place of Steward of the Marine
							Hospital at Chelsea, and he earns his stipend by
								undermin<unclear>ing</unclear> the foundations of civil Society. He
							is the Editor and almost only writer of a periodical pamphlet called the
							Boston Quarterly Review, the main objects of which are to unsettle all
							faith in religion, and to kindle inextinguishable War between the
							different classes of men— He assumes the mask of profound reverence for
							Christianity and its founder; but fills his sheets with furious
							invectives against Priests—and by Priests he means the whole body of the
							clergy of every denomination— His invective against them is in general
							terms, without specification and without exception—to expose them to
							public hatred and obloquy— Next he rails against all the employing class
							of the people, whom he arraigns as oppressors and tyrants over the
							labouring classes, whom he instigates to exterminating and
							indiscriminate butchery against them— He distinctly avows that Slavery
							is a much preferable condition to that of labourers at wages; and
							proclaims without hesitation or disguise that the only remedy to raise
							the labouring classes to his proper level is to abolish the relation
							between the employer and the workman, and to abolish all hereditary
							property— He then says that his party must not be held responsible for
							this particular doctrine, for it belongs exclusively to himself: but
							that he is sure it must ultimately prevail.— <persRef ref="owen-robert"

								Kneeland</persRef>, <persRef ref="garrison-william"
								>Garrison</persRef>, Brownson and <persRef ref="emerson-ralph"
								>Emerson</persRef> are all of one school, and all by different
							instruments are inflaming to fury the passions of mankind against one
							another— Is it not every man’s duty to take the field against them— I
							answered the Letter from <persRef ref="adams-thomas11">Thomas Adams
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> which I had received
							at Washington respecting the proposed Pic Nic of the Ladies next Month—

						<p><persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> was here this

							farm rent, ending the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of March last—
							Nearly the whole of one Quarter’s rent is absorbed in Bills for
							repairs—and he told me crustily enough that he could not pay the third
							Quarter’s rent due the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June— He
							complained bitterly, that he could not get paid for any thing, and that
							the town have treated him with barbarous cruelty, by defeating him in a
							suit at law, which he in wanton obstinacy commenced against them, for
							denying to his children the right of attending one of the town Schools,
							upon a doubtful question, within which of two School districts, his
							dwelling house is situated— This is a hard working, industrious,
							ignorant obstinate, self-conceited man, ruined, body, mind and estate by
							the prevalence of the democracy.— Rival and competitor of <persRef
								ref="field-harvey2">Harvey Field</persRef>, his mind was first
							unsettled by Harvey’s election two years successively as a
							representative of the Town in the Legislature of the Commonwealth—
							Alpheus’s quarrelsome disposition, and his Lawsuit with the town blasted
							all his hopes of election for himself, but he canvassed successfully for
							his brother <persRef ref="spear-lemuel">Lemuel</persRef> who was elected
							for the year 1839. and in attendance on the General Court caught his
							death— In the progress of political and religious excitement Alpheus
							became last Winter became raving distracted, till he was bled and
							blistered into comparative sobriety; but he is even now on the verge of
							fractious and fretful insanity. He grumbled about a want of much fencing
							upon the farm till I told him the lease had not much longer to run, and
							that when it should expire, I contemplated raising the rent— From the
							prospects of his present condition he will be no longer a trusty
							tenant—though I shall have much difficulty and no small hazard to supply
							his place— I called at the Quincy Stone Bank, made a deposit there, and
							left my book to be balanced— I then rode with <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>John Kirke</persRef>, and my Grandson <persRef ref="adams-charles7"

						<p><date>8. V. </date>Saturday</p>
						<p>Showery day— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> quite sick;
							confined to her chamber— I am dissatisfied with my waste of time without
							knowing how—seeming to myself day after day, exceedingly busy and
							finding the day gone, without leaving a trace of usefulness behind— I
							visited my grounds; garden, nursery, seminary, orchard, all overgrown
							with weeds—great numbers of my seedling trees perished; others suffering
							from drought—insects—worms, and causes unknown, for which I am unable to
							devise a remedy.— The seedling appletree, near my old hickory, and the
							seed of which was sown in October 1833. bears fruit this year; so that I
							have my own experience to prove that an apple-tree may bear fruit the
							seventh year from the seed; but why that tree more than all the rest has
							been of so rapid growth, and so precocious bearing is a mystery the
							secret of which I shall never discover.— The one Philadelphia Maple, of
							a row in the seminary, the seed of which I sowed on the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of June 1835. is about fifteen feet
							high, and measures<space/>inches round the stock at the surface of the
							ground. Most of the Medford Appletrees planted in October 1830 are in
							full bearing— The thrifty and fast growing trees, are the Buttonwood,
							Ash, English white Oak and Elm— Of these trees, if I were now 30 years
							of age, I would raise a forest covering many acres, with an intermixture
							of red and white Oaks, and of shagbark hickory, horse chesnut and white
							walnut— One of my Nettle trees ten years old bears berries for the first
							time.— The dwarf Apple-tree; barren last year bears abundantly now; but
							the fruit is stunted, blighted and worm eaten The look of all the
							apples, pears and peaches is very unpromising— Both parts of the divided
							blackjack oak are alive; but the stem of the one in the Nursery has died
							down within a foot of the ground, and there thrown out a
								sh<unclear>oot</unclear> already five feet high—the one transplanted
							to the garden has died down to th<unclear>e g</unclear>round, and thrown
							out shoots from the root— The two Medford Apple-tree
								<unclear>st</unclear>ocks which had been girdled by field mice, and
							which <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E.
								Price Greenleaf</persRef> budded last summer have taken, and are
							growing, tolerably well— The Orchard Nursery is so totally overgrown
							with gigantic weeds, that I can only perceive that at least four fifths
							of the seedling fruit-trees have perished and the remaining fifth have
							made no growth— My inter<unclear>es</unclear>t in these plantations is a
							dream, passing away— I have found, and begun to read the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> volume of <persRef ref="grahame-james"
								>Graham’s</persRef> history of the United States which I had mislaid
							last Summer, while reading the third— I read also <persRef

							before the Mercantile Library Association on the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1838. upon accumulation,
							property, capital and credit— An Admirable, eloquent, argumentative, and
							affecting discourse. There is with it an amusing poem by <persRef
								ref="fields-james">James T. Fields</persRef>, one of the young men
							who recently visited me. At Sunset, I went to <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— He and <persRef

								Lunt</persRef> this morning, from 1. Corinthians 14.19. “Yet in the
							Church, I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my
							voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown
							tongue.” This was the second part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s discourse of last Sunday Morning, against the atheism now
							fermenting in this Country in the shape of what they call
							trancendentalism— He was very animated and eloquent; but there are grave
							difficulties in the subject which he discussed; and others in the text
							and in the Chapter which contains it upon which he did not touch— The
							preceding Chapter, in the small compass of 13 verses sets forth the
							supremacy of Charity as the first and greatest of the Christian virtues,
							and in which the Apostle seems to include the whole sum and substance of
							Christianity. That chapter alone gives the key to the purest and most
							perfect code of morals, ever promulgated to the race of Man— Let that
							chapter alone be impressed upon the heart, and carried out in the
							conduct of men, and this world would be a paradise regained— The 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter is a comparative estimate of the
							faculties of speaking a variety of tongues, and of prophesy the latter
							of which is much preferred over the former— But Faith—Hope, Charity are
							all acquirable properties, attainable by human energy and exertion— The
							gifts of speaking tongues and of prophesy were preternatural, and the
							exercise of them seems to have been hardly a fit subject for
							exhortation— The argument in the chapter depreciates the gift of
							tongues, as if it was the practice of those who professed it, to speak
							in languages which the heares did not understand— The word <hi
								rend="italic">unknown</hi> in the text, is an interpolation—not in
							the original greek— But when the miraculous gift of tongues was bestowed
							on the apostles on the day of Pentecost, it was not that they should
							speak to any one in an unknown tongue; but that the should speak to each
							in his own— Throughout this chapter, prophesy evidently means preaching
							and not prediction— <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Degrand</persRef> came out from Boston, and dined, and
							spent the day and Evening with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s text after
							dinner was from 1. John: 2.15. “Love not the world, neither the things
							that are in the world— If any man love the world, the love of the Father
							is not in him.” A somewhat beaten subject, but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt’s discourses are always interesting— At the close of
							the afternoon he requested all those who took an interest in the
							theological institution at Cambridge to remain and hear a communication
							which he had received relating thereto— It was a written statement
							shewing the condition of the school, and that unless 10,000 dollars can
							be raised and added to its funds it must be shut up and abandoned— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt said that a collection would be taken
							up next Sunday afternoon, for the contribution of this Society towards,
							raising the sum required— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy</persRef> and <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">his Son</persRef>

								<persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Boylston</persRef> will come for that purpose to-morrow.— There is a
							small spot of Land in Corn Court Boston, belonging to the Estate, about
							the sale of which he has been in Treaty, first with the Suffolk and
							afterwards with the Massachusetts Bank. He had a Letter from a young
							lawyer, <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">N. Bowditch</persRef>, Counsel
							for the Bank, questioning the validity of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Boylston’s recorded title to the land.— The original deed he says, is
							dated in 1724. and he supposes there may be some claim in the right of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s Aunt <persRef
								ref="gill-rebecca">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gill</persRef>,
							and also in <persRef ref="elmsley-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Elmsley</persRef>, and in the heirs of the late admiral <persRef
								ref="hallowell-benjamin">Hallowell</persRef>.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch enquires also as to the right of
							the Executors to sell the Land, and proposes that they should insert the
							Deed a Warranty in their own names; but this we have heretofore agreed
							in no case to do.— The form of all our deeds expressly excludes it— The
							Will gives the Executors power to sell real Estate, with the
							restriction, that those portions of it which came from his ancestors
							shall be the last sold— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis had
							proposed to grant a lease for 999 years; but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bowditch thinks that this might by a late Statute of the
							Commonwealth be considered as a sale in fee-simple. (Revised Statutes of
							Massachusetts p. 411) I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis to
							prepare a copy of the deed of 1724. and to look up the indentures
							between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston and his brother and
							Sister, by which they conveyed to him all their rights in Estates coming
							from their common ancestors in this Country— A young shoemaker, named
								<persRef ref="faxon-horace">Horace Faxon</persRef>, son of <persRef
								ref="faxon-benjamin">Benjamin Faxon</persRef> came to enquire, if I
							could accomodate his father with a loan of 500 dollars for a year— No.—
							The new married couple from Fishkill landing, <persRef
								ref="whittemore-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whittemore</persRef>, and <persRef ref="dewindt-louisa">Louisa de

							school— <persRef ref="whittemore-amos">Whittemore</persRef> is the son
							of an inventor of a machine for making wool cards, of whom I have some

							his invention, of which this youth inherits a part. <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> came and visited with me, my garden, Nursery and

							Spring an old pear-stock with sundry slips of Bartlett pears, which had
							once or twice failed before, but now succeeded: we found on two trees
							nests of voracious worms.— <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter

							the benefit of the Congregational Society of which the <persRef

							with interest to accumulate, till it should be sufficient, to build a

							They are leading a strolling life; by the indulgence of a propensity,
							which has swayed him many years, and which he has communicated to her.—
							With a numerous family of children, they find nothing that attaches them
							to home— <hi rend="italic">Sweet</hi> home is unintelligible to them—
							Home to them is bitter, sour, vapid, any thing but sweet— And so it is
							to great multitudes of our People in this Country—perhaps to the wealthy
							throughout the world— The facilities and rapidity of modern travel, give
							great additional impulse to this propensity— Home is an English word for
							which there is in the French language no corresponding term— Perhaps
							there is no stronger indication of National character than in words of
							peculiar significancy in the language spoken by them— The compound
							association of ideas in the English word home consists of elements which
							form the choicest and purests enjoyments of human life.— The word home
							carries us back to the place of our birth, to the tenderness and anxious
							solicitude of a mother’s love; to the cares bestowed upon us in
							childhood, to the affectionate kindness of family relations, of friends
							and neighbours— It is the place of conjugal, parental, filial, and
							fraternal endearments— The place where alone we can possess and exercise
							the practical blessings of freedom— The French language has no word
							including all these Sentiments— They have a favourite popular song,
							expressing them all in its first line— “Ou peut-on être mieux qu’au sein

							day—Nine years old; and she spent it here. A day of entire leisure, with
							no interruption, save of a <persRef ref="livingston-benjamin">way-faring
								man</persRef>—who stop’d at the door to beg, and said he was of the
							Livingston family of New-York. A vagabond, but apparently a man of
							education— About Sunset I went up to Charles’s house, and he and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> came down with me
							and spent the Evening here— I wrote nothing but the Diary of yesterday,
							and an answer to a Letter from <persRef ref="bache-alexander">A. D.
								Bache</persRef> President of the Girard Collage, Philadelphia— My
							time is absorbed by three different classes of reading, which scatter
							into many others— 1. The Daily Newspapers— Most unprofitable— I
							apologize to myself for yielding so much precious time to them, by the
							plea of necessity to keep up with the course of Events— 2. <persRef
								ref="grahame-james">Grahame’s</persRef> History of the United States
							of North America—Volume 4. The title is a Misnomer. It should have been
							called the History of the English Colonies in North America, from their
							Settlement, till their Declaration of Independence— 3. <persRef
								ref="rousseau-jean">Jean Jacques Rousseau’s</persRef> letter to
								<persRef ref="dalembert-jean">D. Alembert</persRef> on his
							recommendation of the Establishment of a Theatre at Geneva. Of the
							Newspaper reading, there remains nothing useful upon the Memory. The
							attention is distracted by such a multitude and variety of subjects that
							it fixes upon none. They succeed one another day after day, and have not
							even the privilege of the Lord Mayors day in the Dunciad, to live in
							Settles’s numbers, one day more The Boston Papers, Courier, Daily
							Advertiser, and Atlas, are now filled with election returns from
							North-Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, and Alabama— All for the State
							Governments and all hitherto more or less favourable to the whigs, as
							the opposition to the present <hi rend="strikethrough">Opposition</hi>
							Administration of the General Government call themselves. The imposture
							of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef> democracy, would seem to
							be drawing to its Catastrophe—and yet falsehood, injustice and wrong are
							permitted by divine Providence to have such sweeping sway over the
							affairs of men that I scarcely dare indulge the hope that the day of
							retribution will come even when it seems to approach— Twelve years I
							have submitted almost in silence to the foulest and basest aspersions
							upon myself, my administration and <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, of which Jackson took the lead by denouncing me,
							in his inaugural speech; while at the same time the remnants of the old
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef> federalists
							assailed me with a furious onset here in my native Commonwealth. It
							would have been a waste of time and toil, to have attempted my defence,
							hitherto. The public ear was not open to me and I have lived slumbering
							under a cloud— Is the time arriving for me to speak? or must I go down
							to the grave and leave posterity to do Justice to my father and to me?
							In humble submission I prostrate myself before the footstool of God, and
							implore the act of his Spirit, to nerve my will and to prescribe my
							path</p>

						<p>Morning rain storm— Sun set clear 7.4. </p>

							they have a bathing house— Kirke and Charles bathed with me on the open
							beach— Jerry kept the Carriage and horses, and the rest of the company
							bathed at the bathing house.— A drowsy weariness after dinner succeeded
							my bath— A short Letter to <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>, and five lines to
								<persRef ref="butterfield-john">John Butterfield</persRef> Lowell,
							declining to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum at that place next
							November, were all the writing that I could accomplish besides my diary
							day. Charles went to Boston and returned home to dine— I went up and saw
							the Sunset from his porch, at 7:4 by the American Almanac, but about ten
							minutes before, just a disk North of the apex of the sloping hill in
							front of the porch—the hill interposing between the Sun and the horizon—
							Charles and his wife spent the Evening with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and we had visits from
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah;quincy-mary2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Quincy</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="quincy-maria">Miss Sophia Quincy</persRef>.— My
							regular reading progress in two books at once is slow.— The 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="grahame-james"
								>Grahame’s</persRef> History begins with the year 1757. and the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of the 10<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Book embraces three years of time.— The inglorious
							campaign of 1757. which is attributed in considerable degree to the
							incapacity of <persRef ref="campbell-john8">Lord Loudoun</persRef>, yet
							one of the Counties of Virginia still bears his name— The controversy
							between him and the Colonial Legislature of Massachusetts Bay, about
							quartering troops involved the question of the enforcement in the
							Colonies of Acts of Parliament. The General Court in a remonstrance
							written by <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas">T. Hutchinson</persRef>
							admitted the unlimited authority of Parliament to extend their
							Legislation over the Colonies when named; but not otherwise.— Loudoun
							was superseded by <persRef ref="abercrombie-james"
							>Abercrombie</persRef>, of whom the historian speaks not less
							contemptuously. In 1758 the change of Ministry took place which brought
								<persRef ref="pitt-william">William Pitt</persRef>, afterwards Earl
							of Chatham to the head of Affairs, and with it a remarkable change from
							weakness, languor and discomfiture to active energy, vigorous action and
							success— The Conquest of Cape-Breton was effected in 1758—and the
							repulse at Ticonderoga was suffered; where Lord <persRef
								ref="howe-george">Howe</persRef> was killed— The reduction of Forts
							Frontignac and Duquesne was of the same year, and the substitution as
							commander in Chief of the British forces, of <persRef
								ref="amherst-jeffery">Amherst</persRef> instead of Abercrombie. The
							year 1759 is signalized by the campaign which terminated in the conquest
							of Quebec and the memorable battle on the plains of Abraham; where the
							commanders of the hostile armies—<persRef ref="wolfe-james2"
								>Wolfe</persRef> and <persRef ref="montcalm-louis"
								>Montcalm</persRef> were slain—as if Providence intended to foreshew
							the final event of the War to both Nations. The account of the death of
							Wolfe is deeply affecting.</p>

							<persRef ref="prentiss-samuel">S. Prentiss</persRef> and invite their

							the pendency of the Presidential election, I considered it as a
							necessary consequence that I ought not to take any part in the formation
							of such meetings; as there would be an obvious inconsistency, in my
							giving invitations to others to attend meetings, which I do not attend
							myself. He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prentiss was now on a
							visit to his relations in the State of Maine, and was to address a
							public meeting at Portland next Tuesday— He had some thoughts of going
							down to Portland on Monday, to hear him, and to invite him to come to
							the Pic Nic—and he asked me, if, in case he should conclude to go, I
							would give him a Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prentiss;
							which I promised I would— I had next a morning visit from <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>,
							and a long conversation with him; or rather a talk, for it was almost
							entirely on my side— I spoke of the pernicious doctrines promulgated
							with so much perverse zeal, and mischievous pertinacity at this time,
							and connected with the politics of the day.— He mentioned the collection
							which he had given notice last Sunday, would be taken up to-morrow, in
							aid of the funds of the theological institution at Cambridge and said
							that <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> and he had thought this was the best mode of
							proposing a contribution for that object to the members of the religious
							Society here— But he was apprehensive that some prejudice against the
							appropriation had arisen from the fact that <persRef ref="emerson-ralph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Emerson’s</persRef>
							transcendentalism had been first broached there— I said I had no doubt
							it was so; and that I must acknowledge, my share of that prejudice. He
							said some of the professors of that institution, were among the most
							strenuous and vehement opponents of the transcendental school; and had
							even written against it. He further said he had lately been on a visit
							to Plymouth, where he had heard enquiry made whether I should be a
							Candidate for re-election as a member of the House of Representatives of
							the United-States; and some suggestion of an intention to address the
							inquiry to me— I said it was perhaps high time for me to retire
							definitively from all public life, and I was receiving daily admonitions
							of the fact from the continual erosions of Time and from the casualties
							of chance. But having as yet received none from my Constituents, I
							thought I should leave to them the determination whether I should
							represent them two years longer in the Councils of the Nation, or bid
							adieu to the service of my Country at the close of the present Congress—

								Lothrop</persRef>, Minister of the Brattle street church Boston, but
							having his Summer-residence on Milton hill, was the preacher for
								<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> this day. His morning text was from Romans 10.10.
							[“]For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness”—a Discourse upon
							Faith—ingenious, discriminating, argumentative, written in a style of
							polished elegance and bating a little affection of manner, well
							delivered— He traced Religious conviction to three
							sources—Reason—Experience—Faith and the last as belief founded upon
							Reason and Experience— He distinguished between the Faith of Reason,
							that of Experience and that of the heart; the belief as described in the
							text, unto righteousness— The faith of reason is a cold, unimpassioned
							conclusion of the Judgment, not dependent upon the will, and liable to
							err from all defects of that faculty— The faith of experience is the
							belief of facts as they are made known to us by the testimony of our own
							senses; also greatly liable to err—but the faith unto righteousness is
							the belief of the heart founded on our confidence in the testimony of
							others.— This belief is one of the Laws of Nature implanted in the heart
							of man: for man is so constituted that he must and will believe the
							testimony of his fellow man, unless he can perceive some motive of the
							informer to deceive— This is the foundation of historical faith, and the
							principal basis of belief in the historical part of Christianity is the
							notorious fact that the evangelists who wrote the historical books could
							have no possible motive for falsifying the narrative— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop’s analysis of faith was confined
							to its passive signification of belief in the testimony of others— He
							took no note of it as the motive of action; as the reciprocal basis of
							confidence of others— It is the connection existing between these two
							properties of Faith and their mutual dependence upon each other in the
							human mind that I wish to see analysed and illustrated, and will attempt
							it if I can command the time— After the morning service, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop read the same statement of the
							condition of the theological school at Cambridge which had been read
							last Sunday by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt; and gave notice that
							the collection would be taken up this afternoon. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lothrop and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>.— As we
							were going over the Hill after dinner to Meeting we saw a large Steamer
							passing rapidly up the harbour, which we took for the Acadia expected
							from Liverpool. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrops afternoon text
							was from Colossians 1.9.—[“]that ye might be filled with the knowledge
							of his will, in all wisdom, and spiritual understanding.” The collection
							for the theological institution was taken up; and produced about 40
							dollars:— I read the first Sermon of <persRef ref="barrow-isaac"
								>Barrow</persRef> upon [“]quietness and doing our own business”—
							Doctrines suited to the restoration age of <persRef ref="charles-ii"
								>Charles the second</persRef>; but not to this time and Country.—

							upon this Diary to-morrow morning— The Steamer which we saw go up the
							harbour yesterday was not the Acadia from Liverpool, as we supposed, but
							a boat from Portland—Maine— But the Acadia did arrive this morning,
							after a passage of 12 days and 14 hours, the shortest ever made from
							England to Boston—and she had touched to land the mail, and passengers
							at Halifax—where she lay 6 hours at the wharf— This travelling by Steam
							is producing wonder upon wonder in approximating to each other the

							the conquest of Canada continues interesting, and in all the approaches
							or premonitory symptoms of the conflict between the Mother Britain and
							the Colonies, the bias of the Historian in favour of the Americans is
							constant and overruling— In the Appendix 3. p. 147. Is a statement with
							a proper mark of reprobation, that in the year 1764 there was despatched
							from England to America a pack of blood-hounds to assist the British
							troops in tracking the Indians— He says that the British never stooped
							to the employment of such auxiliaries, except in their contests with
							Indians, or with negro slaves.— There is some account from Soskiel of

							of the Writs of Assistance.— Grahame never saw the Massachusetts State
							Papers, nor Novanglus.</p>

							received small grants of land proportioned to the number of heads in

							another, and the daughters by marriage departed from the paternal
							fire-side, and went abroad to find new Settlements for themselves
							leaving the youngest son, to cultivate the farm with the father, and to

							he walked with us to view the ground staked out for the road, from

							decline—especially as for the first time since I have represented the

							easily accomplish the conquest of all China; there being no organized
							military force, and the people having no weapons except bows and arrows.
							I said that with such an immense population, invasion itself would soon
							organise a defensive military force, and if they should have no other
							weapons than the stones of the Streets they would be sufficient to crush
							a European army of 15000 men. He said he had, and would send me a

							preached this morning from 2 Timothy 2.5. “And if a man also, strive for
							masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.” This was
							his third discourse against the new, or old vamped up transcendental
							doctrines— He waxes warm as he proceeds, and gave this day a broadside
							at <persRef ref="carlyle-thomas">Carlyle</persRef> without naming him
							for having in his history of the French Revolution, dressed up the
							character of <persRef ref="riqueti-honore">Mirabeau</persRef> into a
							pattern of patriotism— The deadly sophistry of the transcendental school
							consists in the alliance of Atheism with hypocrisy.— The characteristic
							of the age is to unsettle all established opinions, and to put into
							perpetual question all the foundations of human Society— We are to argue
							pro and con—whether parricide be a crime or a virtue; whether property,
							is by the law of Nature, or the mere creature of conventional
							law—whether the contract of marriage constitutes an obligation of duty
							restrictive of promiscuous social intercourse—in short whether justice
							or force is at the root of all human institutions— In the process of
							this argument the transcendentals not only dig up the cornerstones of
							human Society; but pronounce them decayed, rotten and worthless— The
							dregs and the froth of the cauldron are boiled up into one impure and
							poisonous compound and administered to the body politic for healing
							medicine.— Religion is sapped and undermined by this fraudulent
							philosophy; the labouring classes are instigated to hatred and violence
							against the proprietors, and the elements of a civil war of
							extermination, are stimulated into deadly conflict with one another—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt has not yet finished with this
							subject, but with discourse upon it again— <persRef ref="whitney-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> preached in
							the afternoon, from Job 14.14.— “All the days of my appointed time will
							I wait, till my change come.”— Upon Death— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Whitney has been forty years the settled minister of this
							Church and Congregation, and he cannot have long to wait for his change—
							The marks of age are sinking upon him deeper and deeper, every day. The
							argument of his discourse that Death was not to be dreaded as an evil,
							but as the necessary proper, and happily devised termination of life,
							which must of course have an end.— I read two Sermons of <persRef
								ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef>—the second upon quietness, and
							doing our own business—and the first upon the Love of God.— The
							following extract is from the Discourse on quietness. “Especially we
							should not make ourselves parties, in any faction, where both sides are
							eager and passionate, for then, even they who have the juster cause, are
							wont to do unjust things in which, it is hard for any man engaged not to
							have share, at least not to undergo the imputation of them: it is wisdom
							therefore in such cases, to hold off, and to retain a kind of
							indifferency; to meddle with them is (as the Wise man saith) to take a
							dog by the ears; which he that doth, can hardly take care enough of his
							fingers.”— What a seasonable admonition to me! <persRef

							my dear and ever lamented son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>
							I had left in chaotic disorder here, and had until now, never since
							inspected, I found, out of place, and time, the very Letter from
								<persRef ref="follen-charles">Charles Follen</persRef>, 1. Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1831. for which the Letter from <persRef
								ref="cabot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel
								Cabot</persRef>, received last week had set me, upon the search— I
							enclosed and despatched it this day to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cabot— I have a Letter from the <persRef ref="adams-josiah4">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Josiah Adams</persRef> of
							Parkersburgh Virginia, containing some genealogical enquiries— I began a
							Letter in answer to him, which I intended should not exceed five lines,
							but in which I was interrupted to view from Charles’s porch the setting
							of the Sun; for which, clear and beautiful as it was, I was not quite a
							Sun’s disk too late. My Miscellaneous and involuntary reading continues
							desultory as ever— I have now just read <persRef ref="milton-john"
								>Milton’s</persRef> Areopagitica; A Speech for the Liberty of
							unlicensed printing—to the Parliament of England— This speech was not
							delivered but published in 1645. against an order of the Rump
							Parliament, prohibiting all publications without the
							imprimatur—published he says as a certain testimony if not a trophy of
							his Country’s Liberty— [“]For this is not the Liberty which we can hope,
							that no grievance ever should arise in the Commonwealth, that let no man
							in this world expect; but when complaints are freely heard, deeply
							considered and speedily reformed, then is the utmost bound of civil
							liberty attained that wise men look for.”— The argument against
							restrictions upon the press is founded on two principles &amp;
							authority—the practice of all republican Government, before that time
							having been adverse to such restrictions—and 2. that the corrections of
							the abuses of the press belong to the pulpit and not to legislation. The
							style is throughout oratorical, repeatedly addressing the imaginary
							auditory in the second person— Lords and Commons of England!— The
							discourse is replete with beautiful imagery, and fortified with cogent
							argument; though in antiquated language.— The writers and speakers of
							modern English can derive little benefit from any of the composers of
							that age, and from none less than from Milton.</p>

						<p>Boston— Quincy.</p>
						<p>I went to Boston in the Carriage alone, and took with me the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef ref="grahame-james"
								>Grahame’s</persRef> history of the United States to pass the time—
							I stop’d first at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef>, but he was
							not at home— At <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> office
							I found <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, and Charles
							himself soon after came in from Medford— <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spooner</persRef> was also
							there— I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis, to the probate
							office, where was the judge, <persRef ref="phillips-willard">Willard
								Phillips</persRef>, and <persRef ref="fuller-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef> the Administrator
							upon the Estates of the <persRef ref="gill-moses2;gill-moses">two Moses
								Gill’s</persRef>— A question had remained over upon the allowance by
							the judge last November of my Account as Administrator de bonis non,
							with the Will annexed of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas">Thomas
								Boylston</persRef>, whether the amount of the Note of the second
							Moses Gill to <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Boylston</persRef> of 5. Jan<hi rend="superscript"
								>y</hi> 1830. for 984 dollars 78 cents with interest should be
							deducted from the sum to be paid over by me to the Representative of the
							Gill’s— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller still doubted whether as
							Administrator, he could consent to this deduction, without making
							himself liable to the creditors who had claims on the Gill estates. I
							then made a conditional offer, to relinquish on the part of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston, the interest upon the Note
							amounting to 860:63. and the allowance of 600 dollars made by the judge
							to me as Administrator, if after deducting the amount of the Note I
							should be authorised to pay over the remainder to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller for the heirs of the last Moses
							Gill—but I added this was not to be understood if the amount to be paid
							over by me, would go, not to the last Moses Gill’s heirs, but to
							claimants upon his or his uncle’s Estates, of the validity or justice of
							which I knew nothing. The judge urged the acceptance of this offer upon
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller, and said it could easily be
							accomplished in legal form—but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller
							declined doing any thing without advice of Counsel— The judge therefore
							adjourned his decision to some future day, to be notified hereafter— I
							then went to <persRef ref="ward-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								T. W. Ward’s</persRef> Office; and returned to his clerk M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Story, the single order for £10 Sterling,
							upon the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> London, for which he
							returned to me the 50 dollar Bill, which he had taken for it— I went to
							the Store of <persRef ref="sprague-phineas;sprague-seth">P. and S.
								Sprague</persRef>. 13. Commercial Wharf, and there received a set of
							three Bills at 3 days sight on the same Baring’s payable to me or my
							order, and upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phineas Sprague
							gave me 2 dollars and 12 1/2 cents change for the 50 dollar Bill— I
							attended at Noon a Meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
							where numerous donations were received and the <persRef ref="friedrichsthal-emanuel">Chevalier Friederichsthal</persRef>
							was elected a foreign member.— I went to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s, where I found <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, returned
							from Medford with her daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3"
								>Louisa-Catherine</persRef>— Charles and his wife, returned to

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef>, just
							returned from the white Sulphur Virginia Springs, with his family very
							little improved in health.— <persRef ref="shaw-robert">R. G.

									>r</hi> Sewall</persRef> of Washington, and <persRef

								Loring</persRef> from Hingham was here this morning with two young

								<persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Joseph L. Tillinghast</persRef>
							the member of Congress from Rhode-Island— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Loring said they had fixed upon the day after tomorrow for the fishing

								Bancroft</persRef>, upon the third volume of his History of the
							United States which is shortly to come out; and of which he told me that
							my father would be the hero— But I have learnt to estimate the
							assurances of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft at their value— I
							promised to shew him the original Letter of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> to <persRef ref="webb-nathan">Nathan Webb</persRef>
							of October 1755. and the minutes of his journal upon his argument before
							the Governor and Council on the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
								Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1765. as one of the Counsel of the
							Town of Boston, upon their petition for the opening of the Courts of

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lawrence</persRef> had written
							me a note, inviting my company at <persRef ref="lawrence-james">her
								son’s</persRef> rooms at Commencement this day— I called at their

							not intending to go to commencement— And I gave the same answer to
								<persRef ref="shaw-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. G
								Shaw</persRef>, who gave me an invitation to the rooms of <persRef
								ref="shaw-joseph">his Son</persRef>, also to be graduated this day.
							I dined this day with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
							and was conversing with him after dinner upon <persRef ref="plautus"
								>Plautus</persRef> and his Translators French and English, when
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E.
								Price Greenleaf</persRef> came in with a copy of a Resolution, which
							he said had been adopted at a large whig meeting, that a committee be
							appointed to wait on me, and inform me that it is the wish of the whigs
							at Quincy, to invite the whigs of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							congressional District, in particular, and the Electors generally to
							meet with them in Quincy, on an appointed day agreeable to me, to pay
							their respects to me, and request me, to favour them with an Address on
							the present state of the country, the present administration of the
							national government, and the prospects of the whig party— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf that I was greatly obliged to
							the whigs of the town, for their kind proposal, and especially for the
							personal accommodation to me intended by calling the meeting here; but
							that I had already declined attending at a similar meeting to which I
							had been invited to be held at Rochester in the County of Plymouth, and
							at many others out of the District— I stated the reasons which had
							induced me to decline attendance at all the recent meetings considering
							it a duty resulting from my peculiar situation, and desired him to make
							them known to the whigs of Quincy, and suggest to them the wish that
							they would receive this informal answer rather than by sending a formal
							committee cause the necessity for a written answer from me for
							publication of my reasons, some of which were rather to be felt than
							argued— He said he would satisfy the whigs entirely with my answer.—
							Charles’s <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> was very unwell
							all this day—and could not spend the evening with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— Charles himself did.</p>

						<p>I had intended to go this day to Cambridge, to attend the Boylston prize

						<p>Hingham. Cohasset. Fishing party— Quincy—</p>
						<p>At half past five this morning, I left home in a Gig, with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>, and went to <persRef
									ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Loring’s</persRef> at Hingham where we breakfasted; with him and a
								<persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sprague</persRef> living in his
							house; another young woman was also there, and the two little girls who
							came with him to Quincy on Wednesday. After breakfast I went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring in his Gig, and the <persRef
								ref="stearns-oliver">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns</persRef> with my Son to the
							small shed at Cohasset, whence we had been upon a fishing party last
							Summer. A small party soon assembled there now, and six or eight of us
							embarked from the rocks in a good sized Sail-boat and went out between
							four and five miles from the shore, and fished for cod and haddock—we
							changed our position once and caught about 30 fishes, of which I took
							nine.— At one O’Clock we brought the boat round and returned to the
							rocks. I should have liked much to continue fishing three hours longer,
							but the rest of the company were weary and sharp set for dinner, and
							impatient to return, to which I interposed no obstacle— The Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns,
							Minister of the Parish where <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Brooks</persRef> was settled,
								<persRef ref="brazer-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John
								Brazer</persRef> of Salem with his <persRef
								ref="brazer-john2;brazer-william">twin sons John and
								William</persRef>, boys about twelve years of age, were of our
							party— The Chowder dinner company at the shed were about 30 in number
							among whom were <persRef ref="lincoln-solomon">Solomon</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="lincoln-jotham">Jotham </persRef>and <persRef
								ref="lincoln-jairus">Jairus Lincoln</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="thaxter-edward">Edward Thaxter</persRef>
							<persRef ref="doane-james">James C Doane</persRef> and others whose
							names I could not retain— The <persRef ref="greenwood-francis">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. P.
								Greenwood</persRef>, seemed to be in the last stage of a
							consumption.— After the chowder and some general conversation, I walked
							an hour with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brazer and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring to and upon the beach; on returning
							from which we had a second dinner of fried fish and lemonade, after
							which I returned with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring to his house
							at Hingham, where by his invitation the whole company repaired together
							with <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah
								Quincy jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and his Son
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah4">Josiah</persRef>, who had come at 6 in
							the evening instead of 6 in the morning, as he had been invited— We took
							tea at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s and with the light of a
							bright Aurora Borealis returned home, and alighted at my gate just
							before the 9. O’Clock Evening Bell.— There was a cold morning fog barely
							sufficient to discolour the Sun till we reached Cohasset—then a clear
							sky, smooth water and alternate calm and cool eastern breeze, barely
							enough to curl the surface of the glass; as fine an autumnal day as the
							earth ever rolled round her axis— The distant shores of Gloucester and
							Cape Ann and Gloucester, and the Light house at the entrance of Boston
							harbour on one side, and the Scituate meeting house on the other bounded
							the horizon, with the boundless Ocean, dotted with numerous spots of
							white canvas all over the scene— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring
							and Solomon Lincoln told me that the abolitionists of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District had held a
							meeting last Tuesday at Hanover twelve persons present and nominated
								<persRef ref="sprague-seth2">Seth Sprague jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> as their Candidate for the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress— That the administration party
							would nominate <persRef ref="turner-john">John B. Turner</persRef>, and
							that <persRef ref="jackson-william3">Joseph Morton Jackson</persRef> the
							old Candidate for the present Congress would be set aside to his sore
							disappointment.</p>

						<p>This <persRef ref="bradley-justus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="whitney-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

							the occasion of the fire which last autumn consumed his house.— He said

							with me under great political excitement— The whole country throughout
							the Union is in a state of agitation upon the approaching presidential
							election such as was never before witnessed.— From the organization of
							the Government under the present Constitution of the United States, the
							nominations of Candidates for the Office of President were made in
							Caucus Convention by members of Congress—and by the members of the State
							Legislatures. The Congressional Caucus nomination of 1824 was in favour
							of <persRef ref="crawford-william-harris">William H. Crawford</persRef>,
							and signally failed.— The State Legislature nominations produced only
							cross purposes; and have been superseded by party popular conventions,
							increasing in numbers till that of last May at Baltimore of the young
							men, to confirm the nomination of <persRef ref="harrison-william">W. H.
								Harrison</persRef> made before, by a select Caucus Convention at
							Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, last December, amounted it was said to twenty
							thousand delegates— This has been followed by numerous assemblages in
							all the States where the opposition is in any strength, and not a week
							has passed within the last four months without a convocation of
							thousands of people, to hear inflammatory harangues against <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef> and his
							administration, by <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, and all the
							principal opposition Orators in or out of Congress— I received earnest
							invitations to attend these Meetings and address the People at
							Nashville, Tennessee, Chillicothe Ohio, Wheeling Virginia, Baltimore,
							Alexandria, Georgetown, and many other places, all of which I declined
							both from general principles and from considerations specially and
							peculiarly applicable to myself— One of these assemblies was held
							yesterday by a public dinner given to <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb
								Cushing</persRef> by some of his constituents at Newburyport, and a
							Ball in the evening by him to them— I was invited also there but did not
							attend— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster and <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Saltonstall</persRef> were there, and a stump speech scaffold, and
							it is said a procession of 6000 people or more, and a dinner of 1800.
							Here is a revolution in the habits and manners of the people— Where will
							it end? These are party movements, and must in the natural progress of
							things become antagonistical— At the Baltimore meeting one of the
							marshals of the procession was killed upon the spot— These meetings
							cannot be multiplied in numbers and frequency without resulting in yet
							deeper tragedies— Their manifest tendency is to civil war.</p>

							though much indisposed performed all the services of both parts of this
							day. His morning text was from 1. Corinthians 6:20—glorify God in your
							body, and in your Spirit, which are God’s— A Dissertation to show how it
							is possible for so poor a creature as man to glorify God— By his natural
							disposition, his experience of the world, his failure of success in his
							struggles for a respected standing in society, his infirm and alarming
							state of health, the prospects of a destitute family to survive him, and
							the warnings of history. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt has not a
							very favourable opinion of mankind; and being of a meek and quiet
							Spirit, he thinks of himself almost as humbly as of mankind generally—
							Piety, tenderness, benevolence, with a tinge of melancholy pervade all
							his Sermons, but I have never been more affected and pleased with any
							discourse of his than this afternoon when his text was from Ruth 1.16.
							“And <persRef ref="ruth">Ruth</persRef> said, Entreat me not to leave
							thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I
							will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my
							people, and thy God my God. 17. Where thou diest will I die, and there
							will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but
							death part thee and me.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt began by
							remarking on the peculiar character of the Book of Ruth as distinguished
							from all the other books of the Scriptures— He said the Bible was
							generally spoken of as one book; but it was a collection of many books,
							of very different descriptions— He then enumerated the historical,
							poetical, prophetical books of the old Testament, the books of <persRef
								ref="job">Job</persRef> and of the Proverbs, without mentioning the
							Ecclesiastes or the Song of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>;
							but considered this Book of Ruth as differing from all the rest— I
							consider it as belonging to the historical class, an appendage to the
							book of Judges, and as most essential in tracing the genealogy of
								<persRef ref="david">David</persRef> and Solomon, and of Jesus
							Christ— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt dwelt upon the transcendent
							excellence of the character of Ruth—upon her admirable fidelity and
							affectionate attachment to her mother in Law—upon her fortitude in the
							endurance of extreme indigence; upon her active exertions in gleaning
							the fields for the subsistence of <persRef ref="naomi"
							>Naomi</persRef>—and he descanted upon the wonderful vicissitudes of
							human events in raising from this woman of the detested race of <persRef
								ref="moab">Moab</persRef>, in the deepest wretchedness of poverty,
							reduced to glean from a harvested field for daily bread, David and
							Solomon, kings of unrivalled magnificence and glory; and Jesus the
							Saviour of Mankind— He finally pointed the moral of his discourse, by
							exhorting his hearers of both sexes, and of all ages, but especially the
							young, to emulate those virtues which, exerted in the humblest condition
							of life under the severest trials with which human nature was ever
							afflicted, have crowned with unfading glory the name of an obscure
							Moabitish woman, to be revered through a thousand generations throughout
							the civilized world— Evening visits from <persRef ref="miller-caroline"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Miller</persRef>; her <persRef

						<p>Preparations for departure on our voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia—
								<persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis</persRef> came over from Jamaica Plains to concert
							arrangements for our voyage.— I despatched a Letter, and a parcel of
							pamphlets to the <persRef ref="adams-josiah4">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

							Letter to <persRef ref="adams-thomas11">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							for my non-attendance, at the Norfolk County, whig Ladies Pic Nic next
							Thursday. There was an advertisement in this Morning’s Boston Newspapers
							requesting that the Passengers by the Steamer Acadia should be on board,
							by half past 10. to-morrow morning, and that their baggage should be
							sent on board this evening. but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis
							said <persRef ref="miller-edward5">Captain Miller</persRef> had told him
							he should leave the wharf punctually at noon.— <persRef

							to his claim in the right of <persRef ref="gedeon-rene">Rene
								Gedeon</persRef>, to bounty Lands, for enlistment in the Legion of

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowen that I had left his papers on a file
							at Washington, to be sent round by water to Boston; but after he was
							gone I found the papers, and a Letter of 30 December 1839. from <persRef
								ref="gordon-william5">William Gordon</persRef>, chief clerk of the
							Bounty Land-Office to me, adverse to the claim.— I made up a packet of
							all the papers, and enclosed them to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bowen— <persRef ref="bowditch-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><space/>Bowditch</persRef> and <persRef ref="barnard-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>Barnard</persRef> came
							out from Boston this afternoon and repeated an invitation renewed from
							last year, and which I had some weeks since received from the Warren
							street Association, to deliver the introductory Lecture to their course
							for the approaching Season.— Without positively declining, I referred
							them to a definitive answer after my return from my proposed excursion.—
							The <persRef ref="cornell-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
									M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell</persRef> was here this
							Evening with young<space/><persRef ref="wood-william">Wood</persRef>;

								<persRef ref="tower-zealous">Zealous B. Tower</persRef> is to vacate
							the place of Cadet from the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congressional District of Massachusetts— The young man is exceedingly
							anxious to obtain the appointment; and I promised to do all in my power
							to obtain it for him; giving him fair warning of the crosses, and
							difficulties and dangers and pernicious temptations of the life that he
							was aspiring to encounter, and fervently exhorted him if he should
							persist in his purpose and obtain the appointment, to use all his
							exertions to make good the place of his predecessor, who for three
							successive years and ever since his admission has been at the head of
							his class— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was
							much indisposed all this day and evening— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"

								<persRef ref="u">Miss Henshaw</persRef> came out from
							Boston and is to stay with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
