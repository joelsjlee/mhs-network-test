						<dateline>Boston— Steamer Acadia. Tuesday 1. September 1840. At

						<p><date>1. IV. </date>Tuesday</p>
						<p>Went into Boston in the Carriage, with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-charles7">Son Charles</persRef>— Stop’d at

								Frothingham’s</persRef>— Then M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Charles went with me to <persRef ref="u">Chaffin’s</persRef> shop, and
							chose for me two black Stocks, according to order. Then at Charles’s
							Office alone— Found <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis</persRef> there— <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef> came in and gave me some
							Newspapers— Snarl between <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>— Queer
							correspondence between <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef> and <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">Nicholas
								Biddle</persRef>; about National and State Bankruptcy, and the
							examples of France and England— I had received a note from Lieutenant
							Sturges of the Revenue Cutter, offering to take me in his barge from
							India wharf to the Steamer— Degrand promised me to return my thanks to
								<persRef ref="sturgis-josiah">Lieutenant Sturges</persRef>, and to
							make my apology for not accepting his offer— Return with Charles to D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s.— Took leave of him,

								<persRef ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy Leary</persRef> took Charles and

							There we left Jerry and the Carriage to return home, and went over in a
							Hack from the Tremont House; and embarked in the British and
							North-American Royal mail Steam packet Acadia <persRef
								ref="miller-edward5">Captain Edward C. Miller</persRef>, bound to

							some time since received to deliver a Lecture next November before the
							New-York Lyceum. I said I had delayed answering the former application
							from unwillingness to decline and uncertainty whether I could comply
							with it. I feared this would not be in my power, but I would send a
							definitive answer after my return from this excursion— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis was already on board the boat, and
							my trunk which <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet</persRef> the Stageman
							had brought in from Quincy; and sent on board— Two minutes before 12
							O’Clock the Mail came on board, and the boat immediately cast off from
							her moorings at the wharf—passed by the Columbus line of battle ship
							lying in the stream, and glided down the bay with smooth water beneath,
							a gentle breeze around, and a glowing Sun above, at the rate of 9 1/2
							knots an hour.— The wharf at East Boston whence we parted, and the line
							of wharves on the western side of the stream were crowded with
							Spectators, cheering with shouts the Steamer as she passed along The
							Steamers John W. Richmond, and General Lincoln, thronged with passengers
							escorted her down, the latter to just below Castle Island, the former to
							point Alderton and the Light at the entrance of the harbour, where they
							respectively took leave of her with reciprocated huzzas and returned to
							the City— And now vogue la Galere, East North East for Cape Sable; and
							before dark we had lost sight of the Boston State house, the blue hills,
							the Northern shores of Marblehead,—Gloucester and Cape-Ann, the South
							shore of Cohasset, Scituate and Marshfield; and were floating on the
							boundless expanse of waters— The day and Evening continued fair—the
							Sunset not altogether unclouded, but with a clear sky above— At 10 I
							retired to my berth N. 56. and turned in for the Night.</p>

						<p><date>2. V:30. </date>Wednesday</p>
						<p>Quiet Night— Gentle breezes— The Sun was rising, not clear, not much
							beclouded when I went first upon deck— I had slept till day light—
								<persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis</persRef> and I have one State room, with berths N. 55. and
							56 between us—he came to his berth in the Night and left it this
							morning, unperceived by me. The day was variable, cloudy and clear
							alternately with symptoms of approaching fogs but none present—moderate
							breezes, weather alternately chilly and mild. Sails alternately set and
							furled— Breakfast at 8. A.M— Luncheon at Noon. Dinner at 4. P.M— Tea at
							7. and a range of Tumblers and Wine-glasses set on the tables, with wine
							and Spirits, and a Tea-kettle of boiling water and sugar, for messing
							till bed time. Below, Cards, Backgammon and draughts. I spent great part
							of the day, at intervals in our State room writing to <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; a Letter, which I
							closed and sealed to have it ready to put into the Post Office
							immediately after our landing at Halifax— There are 37 passengers in the

							Regiment of Halifax Militia— The ship is over 200 feet long. The rigging
							of the masts very slight, but much of it in iron chains instead of
							ropes— The Steam engines and boilers, are between the fore- and main
							masts, between which the very large chimney is also placed— There are
							berths and accommodations for 100 passengers— The ships company consists
							of 82 persons divided into three classes 1. for navigation 2 for the
							management of the Steam machinery— 3. For attendance on the
							passengers—about 20. at the kitchen and bed chamber service, with a
							Steward and <hi rend="italic">Stewardess</hi> at their head— The table
							fare is magnificent and profuse—the dinner of four courses with a
							variety of fruits and wines— There is great order and discipline in the
							respective services and no interference with each other— Six waiting men
							at the dinner table moved in perfect harmony under the direction of the
							Steward— Great attention is paid to the cleanliness of the boat— The
							Engines are of 480 horse power— The iron, brass and woodwork neatly
							finished, and of infrangible solidity. Her burden is of 1200 tons, and
							she has now 600 tons of coal on board for the voyage to Liverpool— The
							consumption at her full speed is of about forty tons a day, and as she
							is lightened of the load the momentum of her speed is increased. She
							began on leaving the wharf yesterday at the rate of 9 1/2 knots an hour,
							which towards this Evening increased to ten. The course of the ship was
							E.N.E from Boston harbour till she turned Cape Sable at 2 this
							afternoon, and thence N.E. We did not see the cape, and barely discerned
							the Coast of Nova-Scotia as far distant as the eye could range, with
							here and there between us and the shore a fishing Schooner under sail—
							The threefold motion of the boat, pitching, rolling and thrilling was
							barely perceptible to me, but confined the Lady passengers to their
							berths and we did not see them.— The most talkative and amusing of our
							companions was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jasigi.</p>

						<p><date>3. IV:15 </date>Thursday</p>
						<p>I slept little, and from about two in the morning lying in my berth,
							heard the Pilot on the fore-castle giving his steering orders to the
							helmsman— Shortly after 3. a gun was fired upon deck which was returned
							from the shore; and just at 4. the boat was moored to the wharf at
							Halifax. I rose immediately, and as daylight came on viewed the river
							and harbour, and the opposite shore, where the small town of Dartmouth
							in a valley between the slopes of two hills covered with forests of
							pines forms a picturesque landscape— Halifax itself, like our towns of
							Haverhill, and New-London, and Georgetown, ranges along in streets
							ascending like stairs in lines parallel to the course of the river— As
							the Sun rose, <persRef ref="cunard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Samuel Cunard</persRef> and his <persRef
								ref="cunard-edward">Son Edward</persRef> came onboard, and invited
							us to breakfast with him at 8. In the meantime we landed and took
							lodgings at the Masonic Hall, kept by a man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Coblentz</persRef>, said to be the best house of entertainment in
							the town— We breakfasted at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunard’s and
							there saw his four handsome daughters, <persRef ref="francklyn-sarah"
								>one</persRef> of whom two days since was married to a Captain of
							the 37<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Regiment, named <persRef
								ref="francklyn-gilbert">Franklyn</persRef>.— We here met also for
							the last time, and took leave of <persRef ref="miller-edward5">Captain
								Edward C. Miller</persRef>, a Lieutenant in the British Navy, and
							Commander of the Royal Steam packet Acadia.— Half an hour after
							breakfast, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunard took us in his chariot,
							and introduced us to His Excellency <persRef ref="campbell-colin">Sir
								Colin Campbell</persRef>, Lieutenant Governor, of the British
							Province of Nova-Scotia; who received us politely and invited us to dine
							with him at 7 this evening— The weather had become stormy, and the rain
							confined us some hours at the inn, which I was enabled to employ in
							writing. We met for one moment at the door of the inn <persRef ref="u"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Butler</persRef>, who had
							been in 1816 one of the Schoolmates of <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2">my Sons</persRef> at Ealing.— He was
							now about to embark in the Acadia, as a passenger to Liverpool. I had
							through the day a number of visitors, inhabitants of the town, and full
							of kind and courteous hospitality— Among them <persRef
								ref="archibald-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Archibald</persRef>, Attorney General and Speaker of the provincial

								<persRef ref="u">little daughter</persRef> of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Starr. I took a ride of an hour and a
							half in an open Barouche, in a circle of the country round the town— At
							7. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunard came and took <persRef
								ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis</persRef> and me in his Carriage to the Governors to dine.
							But <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> had been taken, with
							a severe sick head ache; and could not go with us— The dinner was
							splendid—served altogether on plate.— The company, eighteen chiefly
							military officers all in full uniform—Sir Colin wearing the Star of the
							Bath and the Medallion of Waterloo— <persRef ref="fitzroy-charles">Lord
								Charles Fitzroy</persRef> appointed Governor of Prince Edward’s

							Between 9 and 10. a messenger came with advice that the Canadian Mails
							and Passengers had arrived from Picton, and that the Acadia was
							unmooring to depart for Liverpool, whereupon M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cunard and one of the guests were called out, and M<hi

						<p>The Steamer Unicorn was to have arrived here yesterday at 3. P.M with the
							Mails and Passengers from Quebec and Prince Edward’s Island, to go by
							the Acadia for Liverpool— She was to have departed hence this day to
							return to Quebec at Noon, and we had proposed to take passage in her.—
								<persRef ref="fitzroy-charles">Lord Charles Fitzroy</persRef> with
							his family are here waiting to take passage in the Unicorn, to be landed
							at Charlottes town on Prince Edward’s Island— But on her passage from
							Quebec down the river Saint Lawrence she took ground and was detained
							twelve hours— Her Mails, and passengers were landed at Picton, and came
							thence by land 102 1/2 miles— They arrived at 9 last Evening and at 1/2
							past 11. the Acadia departed for Liverpool— The Unicorn arrived at 8.
							this morning, and we were flattering ourselves that we should embark in
							her at Noon for Quebec. But her Engine took some damage by her grounding
							in the river, and she is detained here for a survey and repairs at least
							until next Tuesday; and perhaps longer. She is then to take Lord Fitzroy
							to his Government of Prince Edward’s Island, but will not proceed to
							Quebec until after the arrival from Liverpool here of the Britannia,
							expected on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— Our expedition to
							Quebec is therefore blown up, and we are put to our shifts to get home
							as we may— I had many kind visitors again this day among whom <persRef
								ref="howe-joseph2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Howe</persRef>, and <persRef ref="forrester-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Forrester</persRef>,
							representatives of the County and town of Halifax in the general House
							of Assembly. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe invited us to dine with
							him at 6. O’Clock, and in the mean time they both took us a ride of nine
							miles to the head of the bay which runs up above Halifax, navigable, all
							the way up— Before going I called with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef> upon <persRef ref="blowers-sampson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sampson Salter Blowers</persRef>—a
							refugee from Boston—said to have turned shortly since, his hundredth

							the Official defenders—the lawyers in that prosecution, on both sides
							sustaining the party <hi rend="strikethrough">to which they were
								opposed</hi> of Preston and the Soldiers— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Blowers came from Boston with the British troops, and never
							returned.— He is one of the Patriarchs of the Province of Nova-Scotia,
							and was successively Chief Justice of the Superior Court after being
							Attorney General, Speaker of the House of Assembly, Councillor, and
							sometime acting Governor— He is now in retirement, said to be wealthy,
							enjoying bodily health, but with all the faculties of the mind impaired—
							He received us courteously, and thanked us for calling upon him. I told
							him I was the son of John Adams whom he formerly knew, but he made no
							answer— I introduced my Son to him and he enquired what was his age. I
							said we had arrived in the Steamer Acadia from Boston; he said that was
							his native place, and he had always retained his affection for it, and
							rejoiced in its prosperity— He had said it would prosper, and believed
							it was now the most prosperous place in North-America; and this place

						<dateline>Halifax— Windsor. Kentville. 5. September 1840.</dateline>
						<p><date>5. V. </date>Saturday</p>
						<p>Disappointed in the purpose of embarking in the Unicorn for Quebec, we
							concluded to return home, by the way of Annapolis and the Province of
							New-Brunswick.— We took the Stage first for Windsor, and left our
							lodgings at the Masonic Hall, at 6 this morning with four travelling
							companions; <persRef ref="frothingham-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Frothingham</persRef> a native of New-England, and
							merchant of Montreal in Canada, with his son <persRef
								ref="frothingham-frederick">Frederic</persRef> a youth of about 17.
							and a Bostonian named<space/>settled as a merchant at Mayaguez in the
							Island of Porto Rico, about 30 years of age, with his wife, travelling
							for their health.— We came to Windsor 45 Miles from Halifax in three
							Stages of 17. 15. and 13 miles with the same Carriage and driver twice
							changing horses— We reached Windsor about 1. P.M. but found no Steamer
							there nor any expectation of one before next Tuesday—wherefore, we
							determined to proceed immediately, and came on 13 miles to Gasperaux
							river and ten miles further to Kentville, which is a part of the
							township of Horton. We landed just at Sunset having travelled 68 miles,
							in one Carriage, and with one driver— The first forty miles of the road
							are nearly one continued forest of what the Germans call needle wood
							trees—white and pitch pine, cedar, spruce, fir and Larch; with
							intermixture of white and yellow, birch, beech, maple, and here and
							there, red and grey Oak— Many of the trees were tall and straight, but
							none of them large— The soil generally sand or rock, with few
							settlements on the road— One country seat between Halifax and Windsor,
							belonging to the <persRef ref="jeffery-thomas">Honourable Thomas
								Nickleson Jeffery</persRef> the Senior member of the Executive
							Council, was the only mansion the elegance of which and of the ground
							around it, indicated opulence— Scarcely one village on the road—but at
							distances of a quarter or half mile from each other single farm-houses
							with elderly looking barns, were surrounded with green pastures,
							indifferent apple-orchards, a stout and strong breed of horned cattle; a
							few sorry horses, pigs and swine of ordinary size— Turkies and ducks not
							remarkable—fine looking and numerous flocks of geese, and dunghill fowls
							in abundance— Very few ragged and no squalid looking persons, and no
							beggars— The general aspect is of a healthy quiet and contented
							population. The children especially remarkable for fair complections
							handsome faces, and rosy cheeks— On approaching Windsor, and part of the
							way thence to Kentville, the soil is more fertile; the country much more
							cleared of wood and the farms more productive— The recollection that
							Halifax leaves upon the mind of the traveller, is of a very moderately
							prospering, and not enterprizing city. A garrison of three regiments of
							infantry 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> and 37<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> with a Corps of
							Artillery and of Engineers, gives it the appearance of a City besieged,
							and the accomodations for the army and navy account for its population,
							much more than any of its adaptations for commercial enterprize which
							are very small. As we stop’d at Windsor only to change our horses we had
							no opportunity to deliver our Letter of introduction to judge
							Haliburton— At Windsor we saw a large ship of 600 tons upon the Stocks—
							It is one of the Ports upon the bay of Fundy, in Steam boat
							communication with S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns, New
							Brunswick.</p>

						<p>The Stages in this Province do not travel on the Sabbath and we were
							necessarily detained here this day; much to my satisfaction, for I was
							glad to escape from the overflowing civilities of Halifax, before we
							could be made conscious that they were burdensome to those who paid
							them, and as time advances, I long more and more for one day of repose
							in seven— After breakfast this morning my first enquiry was for a Church
							where we might attend public worship and were informed of a presbyterian
							Church two miles and an episcopal church four miles distant both in the
							town of Cornwallis, and of a methodist church nearer, where there would
							be service in the afternoon— Sallying out to walk to the presbyterian
							church we soon met <persRef ref="hardy-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"

							where he and his family attend, and where the <persRef ref="owen-henry"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> H. L. Owen</persRef> read the
							morning service of the Church of England for the 12<hi

							drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that
							thou mayest look on their nakedness.” (mark the grammatical
							transposition of persons, to the verbs—) a plain and sensible discourse

							were illustrated by quotations from Scripture preceptive and exemplary;
							not excepting <persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>, <persRef ref="lot"
								>Lot</persRef>, and <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>.— The
							preachers reading and delivery were very monotonous and sluggish— The

								<persRef ref="harris-wilhelmina">wife</persRef> and part of his

						<dateline>Kentville— Annapolis. Nova Scotia 7. September 1840.</dateline>
						<p><date>7. V. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>Our Stage carriage and driver were both changed this morning to our
							disadvantage, but the substitutes brought us safely in the course of the
							day from Kentville to Annapolis, 60 miles, over a road the first part of
							which was heavy with sand, and the last hilly and studded with rocks;
							but altogether a very good road— We had besides our company from
							Halifax, an outside passenger taken up on Saturday at Windsor, and
								<persRef ref="whidden-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Whidden</persRef>, Clerk of the House of Assembly, and now a
							Candidate for election as a member of the house—for there is an election
							to be held in November, and we are told that it will be generally and
							warmly contested— The Government and popular parties are strongly marked
							and ardently opposed to each other— <persRef ref="webster-wb">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> told us last Evening
							that <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>brother</persRef> were Government men, but that he was of the
							popular party— This D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster is what the
							French call an original, and the English an oddity. Curiosity and
							mobility seem to be the characteristics of his temper, without depths of
							observation or brilliancy of imagination— His motive for taking us to
							see the Cornwallis dam yesterday, with the invitation to tea at his
							father’s house, must have been pure kindness and hospitality— He has a
							taste also for natural history, and shewed us a number of birds stuffed
							and minerals indigenous in this Province; all collected by himself. We
							left Kentville which is a part of the township of Horton, named from the
							late <persRef ref="edward">Duke of Kent</persRef>, after his death at
							half past 6 this morning, with an accession of two outside passengers to
							our company, and an exchange of a very good carriage for one of doubtful
							solidity and unpromising appearance; but which brought us however safely
							to Annapolis with the setting Sun— The first stage was of 17 miles to
								<persRef ref="u">Crane’s</persRef>, that being the name of the man
							who keeps the house—there we had a good breakfast, and the house though
							standing alone had a neat and comfortable aspect— The sound of a
							spinning wheel in a room adjoining to that where we breakfasted brought
							back sixty years or more of reminiscences familiar to my childhood, but
							which from that time have never been revived— To <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> it was an unwonted and
							unpleasant sound, but to <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis</persRef> it was as to me a
							pleasing revival of incidents in early life long since passed away.—
							From this place we proceeded by a stage of 12 miles to Gibbons; another
							of 17 miles to Bridgetown, a small and neat looking village, but where
							there was no dinner in preparation for Stage passengers, and we took up
							with a collation or lunch of bread and cheese and a bottle of nut brown
							ale— Here we crossed a lofty bridge, necessarily so from the common rise
							and fall of the river at the place which is of more than thirty feet of
							the tide from the bay of Fundy— Our last stage of the day was 15 miles
							to Annapolis, the Old French Settlement of Port Royal, and formerly the
							chief town in the Province. No trace of France is now seen in it; nor
							would one imagine it to be a capital of any colony—but it is a good
							looking village, where we find comfortable lodgings though at two
							different houses; and the Steamer Maid of the Mist, to depart to-morrow
							Morning for the City of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John in the
							Province of New-Brunswick.</p>

							New-Brunswick 8 September 1840.</dateline>
						<p><date>8. V. </date>Tuesday</p>
						<p>Our ride yesterday was through a country much resembling that which he
							had traversed on Saturday— The first part over a heavy sand, and the
							latter part, through pine clad hills, interspersed with fertile vallies
							and solitary farmhouses around which we seldom failed to see oxen and
							cows of large size and in good condition— Fine looking sheep— Flocks of
							Turkies, Geese and dunghill fowls in abundance— Swine, not so numerous;
							nor of breeds so choice, yet good looking. Altogether the appearance of
							the Country, much like that of the interior of Massachusetts sixty years
							ago— This morning before our departure a gentleman called on me at the
							inn, and announced himself as a <persRef ref="pickman-francis"
								>Son</persRef> of my old and valued friend <persRef
								ref="pickman-benjamin">Benjamin Pickman</persRef>, heretofore of
							Salem, now residing in Boston— He has been settled here, he told me
							about eight years in consequence of having married a <persRef
								ref="pickman-elizabeth2">Lady</persRef> of this place, or as
								<persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis</persRef> conjectures because he inherited some of his
								<persRef ref="pickman-benjamin3">Grandfather Pickman’s</persRef>
							sentiments and opinions— We met here also last evening a Scottish
							Gentleman of the name of <persRef ref="u">Smith</persRef>, with his arm
							in a sling from some recent accident, with which I sympathised,
							according to <persRef ref="swift-jonathan">Swift’s</persRef> But should
							some neighbour feel a pain, just in the parts where I complain &amp;c—
							He told us he had crossed the atlantic 13 times; one of which last year
							in the British Queen. He was visited while we were at supper by a young
							man, collector at the Port of Digby, a nephew of <persRef
								ref="campbell-colin">Sir Colin Campbell</persRef>; and who came down
							with us in the Steamer this morning to that place, where he landed as
							did several other passengers, while others came on board there— Among
							them was a tall elderly, cheerless looking Indian, and a young stout,
							handsome, active ship carpenter from the settlement at Clare about
							twelve miles from Digby, the still existing remnants of the old Acadian
							neutral French— We anchored for about an hour at Digby 18 miles from
							Annapolis whence we had departed, between 7. and 8 this morning— The
							collector of the Port, brought on board, and lent us <persRef
								ref="haliburton-thomas">Thomas C. Haliburton’s</persRef> History of
							Nova-Scotia, which he had casually mentioned in conversation with
								<persRef ref="frothingham-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef>— He requested that the books might be left
							with <persRef ref="u">Captain Hennenbury</persRef>, in the Steam boat,
							to be returned to him when she came back. I would have purchased the
							books, but he had not a copy to spare— I occupied no small portion of
							the passage across the Bay of Fundy, in turning over the pages of the
							first Volume of this Book— The passage between Annapolis and Digby is a
							narrow basin, like a river broken in from the Bay of Fundy, through a
							passage between two rocky cliffs not half a mile wide or long. The
							course from this gap over the Bay of Fundy to S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John is directly North 36 miles.— We had left Kentville
							yesterday morning, with rain and mist and dark smoky clouds hanging over
							the sides of all the hills, but it cleared away by noon, and we had a
							clear night at Annapolis, and a bright Sun this morning— We opened upon
							the Bay of Fundy about 11. A.M. and could barely discern the opposite
							coast of New-Brunswick like far off mountains turning into clouds. The
							Steamer maid of the mist is small and slow and growing old; but the day
							was fair and without fog, though clouding up, and with a freshening
							breeze till 5 p.m. when we landed at the wharf in the City of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John. The gradual receding of the Coast
							of Nova-Scotia, with the corresponding rise and approach of that of
							New-Brunswick had a pleasing effect upon the spirits but the rapid tides
							of the Bay produced a swell which with the briskness of the breeze
							sickened some of our passengers— A family from Boston a man, his wife,
							and five boys, from 4 to 12 years old, were among them. We took our
							lodgings at the S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Hotel. named La
								<unclear>Hain</unclear>—</p>

						<p><date>9. IV:30. </date>Wednesday.</p>
						<p>I rose this morning an hour before day-light, and wrote till breakfast

									rend="superscript">r</hi> A. W. Whipple</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="perley-mh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M. H.
								Perley</persRef>, inhabitants of the City, visited us, and offered
							their services, to shew us any of its objects of curiosity.— They took
							us first to the Officers barracks of the 69<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> regiment of British infantry which is stationed at this
							place. They introduced us to <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Blackburne</persRef> the Senoir Captain in command The Colonel being
							upon a tour in the States, and now at Boston; and the Major gone home to
							England on leave— Captain Blackburne is a modest and very gentlemanly
							man, of pleasing deportment, and courteous manners, without affectation,
							studiously but not fawningly civil— He and several Officers with him
							shewed us the barracks of the soldiers; their mode of living, their
							muskets, which he said were not equal to ours, and the curious furniture
							of their knapsacks, a list of the articles composing which I was tempted
							to ask, to compare with ours, but refrained— We saw the apartments in
							which the Soldiers lodge, six, eight or ten in a room, the apartment
							where they mess—the kitchen where their food is cooked, and the meat and
							vegetables, in preparation for their dinner.— All which was neat,
							cleanly, economical, and comfortable— Also the hospital where in two
							chambers were the sick men in their beds; one of the chambers containing
							only the cases of ophthalmia which Captain Blackburne told us was a
							disease more common among the troops than all others put together. He
							took us also to the room where the musical band were practicing under
							the direction of the band master; and they regaled us with several
							beautiful marches and airs conducting with <persRef ref="kearney-kate"
								>Kate Kearney</persRef>— From the Barracks we went to the reading
							room where our names were entered—to the building now in process of
							erection for a City Hall and Exchange, and to the foundations laid for a
							large Custom-house— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whipple then took

								Curtis</persRef> and me, [(]while <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> staid behind to write a letter home) to a
							saw-mill on the river two miles above the City, where we saw the
							operations of sawing logs in to boards and blocks into shingles— On our

							the place, among whom the Recorder, who in the absence of the <persRef
								ref="black-william">Mayor</persRef> welcomed me to the City, with an
							offer of a public dinner which I declined, as we are to depart to morrow

						<p><date>10. IV:30. </date>Thursday</p>
						<p>At 1/2 past 6 this morning we left the City of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t</hi> John literally built upon a rock, and said now to contain
							upwards of 33 thousand inhabitants— We came in a Coach from the inn, to
							Indian town two miles above the City; and there embarked in the Steamer
							New-Brunswick, and ascended the river S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John to Fredericton, the seat of Government of the Province 90 Miles—
							There was a heavy rain all the morning, and the boat was detained a full
							hour by falling foul of a raft close above the wharf whence we departed—
							The course of the river is first North, then North-east, then North,
							Northwest and North North West about 12 or 13 miles each town—about half
							way up lies on the western bank of the river, Gagetown, named I suppose
							from <persRef ref="gage-thomas">General Gage</persRef>, and the only
							village settlement, between the City and the seat of Government. The
							Banks of the river near S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John are on both
							sides steep—lofty and precipitous rocks covered with seemingly
							impenetrable forests, but after the first turn the hills fall a way to
							distances sometimes of a mile or more with intervale lands of great
							fertility with solitary farm houses, small barns and stacks of hay piled
							upon stakes to preserve them from the tides— The face of the river’s
							banks all the way poor but comfortable—the landscapes fair and varied
							but neither endowed by nature with sublimity nor cultivated into the
							beauty of art; between Gagetown and the eastern bank there is an island,
							which interrupts it from the view so that we saw it only from below and
							from above.— About 7 miles below Fredericton, there is another Island
							with a shoal and a bar, which goes wholly across the river, and
								whe<unclear>re</unclear> the water is so shallow that our boat
							touched the ground and rubbed over it— There were as passengers in the
							boat, named <persRef ref="babbit-daniel2">Babbit</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">Worden</persRef>, men approaching 70. both of whom came with
							their <persRef ref="babbit-daniel;worden-gabriel">fathers</persRef>;
							loyalists from New-York in 1783— Also <persRef ref="u">Major
								Cairnes</persRef> of the 37<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> regiment
							stationed at Fredericton who introduced himself to me with numerous
							civilities and kind attentions—he introduced me to <persRef

							distinction in the Province, also a passenger in the boat—as were
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Ross</persRef> of the 37<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> regiment and several other Officers— We
							landed at Fredericton just after Sunset, and took lodgings at <persRef
								ref="u">Jackson’s</persRef> Hotel; where within half an hour, I
							received a note from his Excellency <persRef ref="harvey-john">Sir John

							Province of New-Brunswick, with the most obliging offers of service,
							horses and a kind invitation to us to dine with him to-morrow— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> answered his note with many

							hotel <persRef ref="vanzandt-antonio">Signor Blitz</persRef>, who gave
							us tickets of admission to his exhibition of ventriloquism, and of leger

							this morning— We had visits also last Evening, and this morning from six
							or seven Indians two of whom named John Francis—and Neptune—were of our
							Passamaquoddy tribe, and the rest of the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s or Micmac tribe within this province. They had all been to a

								Francis</persRef> is the <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi> of the

							speaks a little English acted as interpreter. They wanted a certificate
							or paper in the nature of a Passport from me, and said last Night that
							they were to have one this morning from Sir John Harvey— I asked Neptune
							if they had got their certificate from Sir John this morning— He said he
							was too busy.— I told him that I had been, but was no longer a Chief in
							my own Country, and that a certificate or passport from me, would be of
							no sort of use to them— The paper of advice from the Canadian Indians
							which they shewed to me, was an earnest exhortation to them, to adhere
							inflexibly to the roman Catholic religion, and not to sell one inch of
							their Lands— On another paper, there was a statement of the motive of
							their Journey, and a contribution of £5. annexed to the name of <persRef
								ref="harvey-john">Sir John Harvey</persRef>, upon their journey to
							Canada in July; from which they are now returning.— The parade of the
								36<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> regiment was to have been at 10.
							this morning; but there was rain and a lowering sky and there was no
							parade. At 11. we went in a Carriage to the Government house, where we
							were received, with great cordiality by Sir John Harvey— He invited us
							to take a ride with him to view the country round and to name the hour—
							I named 2. p.m. he said he should then be at leisure, and had sent for
								<persRef ref="vanzandt-antonio">Signor Blitz</persRef> to come and
							exhibit before his family— We returned to the Hotel, and called at the
							House of <persRef ref="u">Major Cairnes</persRef> to return his visit—
							Not at home— A Committee of 3. Gentlemen came and invited us to visit
							the reading room which we did at 5 O’Clock p.m. Sir John Harvey’s open
							waggon had called and taken us to the Government House at 2.— Signor

								<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>, 3 years old, on <persRef

							and one of the springs on which the thorough braces were supported was
							loosened— We nevertheless proceeded—the first Stage was of 18 miles— 35
							miles from Fredericton there was a ferry to cross— The Stage and four
							horses crossed in a flat bottom boat, to serve which there were two
							ferrymen only— The passengers had alighted from the Stage, and the
							approach to the landing place was inaccessible to them for the mud.—
							There was a small boat at hand, grounded on the bank, with a foot deep
							of water at the bottom— Some of our fellow passengers baled out the
							water, and one of them rowed us, with crosshanded oars over the river—
							All save one, a Frenchman, named <persRef ref="u">Baire</persRef>; from
							the disputed territory at Madawaska—jumped into a small canoe, and
							paddled himself over.— The road thence for seven miles was heavy with
							hills, deep with sand and studded with rocks; through a region covered
							with forests of pine, cedar, spruce, fir, and hemlock, a primitive
							growth tall and slender, with here and there small birch, beech and
							maple and rarely red and grey oak interspersed with burnt stumps, and
							tall strip’d trunks of pines looking like the stacks of chimneys of
							burnt dwelling houses.— Then prostrate pines, fit for the masts of some
							high <unclear>ammiral?</unclear>, with their roots torn up from the soil
							like the side wall of a mud built hovel; or fallen till sustained by the
							dividing branches of other yet standing trees Here and there a small
							cleared lot, with a small house, and perhaps a barn, cattle, sheep and
							domestic fowls— The proportion of dead trunks of trees standing in the
							midst of others, gives the whole landscape an appearance of desolation,
							and the almost total absence of birds, adds a darker gloom to the
							solitude of the wild. But the river flows through all this scenery; with
							strings of narrow long islands, most of which are cultivated and present
							an aspect of fertility. 42 miles from Fredericton, we dined at the house
							of a Scotchman name <persRef ref="u">Munro</persRef>.— We got a
							tolerably good dinner to which our driver sat down with us.— We had
							witnessed no such usage in Nova-Scotia. The carriage had broken down two
							or three times, and at Munro’s, was detained nearly two hours for a
							blacksmith’s repairs— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Munro with much
							complaisance told me that he had heard me spoken of very respectfully,
							in the ould country— We had at one stage after dinner, a third pair of
							horses tackled to the Stage.— The accidents we met with, were
							fortunately without hurt to our persons, but delayed our progress till
							after dark— But the weather which had been rainy and gloomy cleared off
							towards Night, leaving bright moonshine— We crossed without difficulty
							at 8 the second ferry five miles from Woodstock; and the creek there, to
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grover’s</persRef>
							house at 9. She is a widow, born at Halifax, and says she kept the
							Masonic Hall at that place, till five years ago, when <persRef ref="u"
								>he</persRef> died—after which she came here with <persRef ref="u"
								>her mother</persRef>, who is yet living. She has also a Sister
							married here— We found on our arrival here a fire made in the common
							parlour— The first we have met since we left Boston.</p>

						<p>There was a frost last Night, and <hi rend="strikethrough">frost</hi> ice

								Baire</persRef> the Frenchman from Madawaska, went off this morning
							in the stage for that place— An open waggon with 3. Seats, for 6 persons
							including the driver— There were 8 persons in it, and an enormous load
							of baggage, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baire called le butin,
							before they left the tavern door; and they were to take up two
							passengers more. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baire had been silent
							all day yesterday in the Stage, of which I had not known the cause— On
							finding that he was French, I spoke to him in that language, and found
							him very willing to converse and apparently glad to talk; but I had so
							little time for discourse with him that I learnt very little about the
							Madawaska settlement— On enquiring for an opportunity to attend public
							worship we found there were in the neighbourhood of our Inn two
							Churches—one Episcopal Church of England—the other, Wesleyan Methodist;
							but that the ministers of both were absent, and that there would be no
							divine service at either. Afterwards however, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> English</persRef>, brother in Law to
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grover</persRef>,
							and the Postmaster of the place, came and accompanied us to the
							Methodist Church, where a young man, a native of the Province (vulgarly
							called a blue nose) named <persRef ref="williams-george">George
								Williams</persRef>, performed the services of prayer, and giving out
							by semi-couplets the hymns to be sung, and read a Sermon of <persRef
								ref="wesley-john">John Wesley</persRef> from Luke 12.7. “Even the
							hairs of your head are numbered.” A sensible and not enthusiastic
							discourse upon a general, and particular Providence— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams repeated the prayers with
							fluency, but is a very indifferent reader.— The <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> was the regular preacher, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams announced that he would preach
							the next Sunday— The Church is small, but very neat—the congregation not
							numerous, but well dressed, of grave and decent demeanour, and highly
							respectable in appearance— We dined at Woodstock. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grover our hostess, and her family, a son
							and daughter dined with us— The weather being fair, and an open waggon
							the only Stage carriage to Houlton, we concluded to take the ride this
							afternoon, to escape the chance of rain to-morrow Morning— We started at
							3 p.m in a Carryall with 3 seats for 6 persons, a pair of horses and a
							yankee driver. We had 12 miles of good road; through a wilderness of
							spruce, pine, birch and fir woods to Houlton where we arrived at 5.
							O’Clock— The dividing line between the Province of New-Brunswick and the
							State of Maine is about 2 miles short of Houlton, and just before we
							reached it, a solitary, long, narrow, and apparently empty house,
							separated by three partitions, our driver told us was a smuggling
							shop—on the American side; near the line were two Cash stores.— We saw
							the boundary line, and the summits of Mars Hill, at the distance of 30.
							Miles— About an hour after us, arrived at the same Inn <persRef

						<p><date>14. IV:30. </date>Monday</p>
						<p>Notwithstanding the fair promise of last Evening’s Sunset, there was a
							copious rain in the night, and through the greatest part of this day;
							with occasional intervals, but not a glimpse of the Sun— I rose early,
							and wrote by candlelight more than two hours— Immediately after
							breakfast, <persRef ref="eustis-abraham">General Abraham
								Eustis</persRef>, commanding the first Regiment of U.S. Artillery
							stationed at Houlton, called on me, and invited us to visit the
							barracks— I accordingly walked with him to them and as we approached
							them, a salute of 13 guns was fired, which he told me was intended for
							me— The Officers of the Regiment were introduced to me, and the men were
							ordered out for parade— General Eustis observing that I had been
							heretofore the commander in chief of the armies of the United States,
							enquired if I would review the troops— I answered that being no longer
							in the capacity of Commander in Chief I should ask to be excused from
							that service, to which he readily assented— The regiment was however
							paraded, and went through the exercise and marching with great accuracy
							and precision. I said to the general that they were quite as expert and
							rapid in their movements as any part that I had seen of the British
							army— He said the scarlet coat had an advantage over the
							blue—immediately after the parade, one of the companies were marched off
							to repair to Eastport and the whole corps escorted them about a mile on
							their way— Another company is to march the day after to morrow for
							Portland. There have been eight companies here, while there is room at
							the barracks only for six— Several of the Officers have therefore been
							obliged—to board at the Inn, which has a bad effect on the discipline.
							General Eustis said he had deeply regretted that <persRef ref="u">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Pierce</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kirby-reynolds">Major Kirby</persRef> had visited me last
							Evening—that they had both returned to the barracks under a very high
							degree of excitement— I said I had not observed any thing of it, at
							which he said he was surprized. They were the only two Officers in the
							regiment liable to such susceptibilities— We visited <persRef
								ref="eustis-patience">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Eustis</persRef> a Lady from South Carolina—and whom the climate of
							Houlton does not suit. The General said, he had thought as badly of the
							place, before he came to the place, as was possible; but had found it
							much worse than he had anticipated— He has lost since last May 250 men
							by desertion, and there are not 500. men now here— We returned and dined
							at the Inn— It is the annual and congressional election day at Houlton,
							and throughout the State of Maine— The Barmaid at our inn was told that
							a man who had offered to vote, had been rejected as an Alien— An Alien?
							what’s that?— A blue nose— Well, said she, I hope <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harrison</persRef> will be chosen President of the United States
							next November and if he is not, I will leave this place— At 3. p.m we
							left Houlton in the Stage for Bangor— We had as travelling companions
								<persRef ref="wayne-henry">Lieutenant Wayne</persRef>, a son of the
								<persRef ref="wayne-james">judge of the U.S. Supreme
							Court</persRef>—a Soldier this day discharged and going to New-York; and
							a woman weighing at least 200 lb avoir du pois, and with a face for one
							of <persRef ref="macbeth">Macbeth’s</persRef> witches— We came in heavy
							rain, through a dreary wilderness 25 miles to Hainesville; a solitary
							house, and a new Landlord, who served us up Moose, killed by an Indian,
							and gave me a log-cabin, down East for a bed room to sleep in—</p>

						<dateline>Hainesville— Bangor, Maine 15. September 1840.</dateline>
						<p><date>15. II:30 </date>Tuesday</p>
						<p>The rain continued through the Night and all this Morning. At half past
							two we were summoned from our log-cabin beds, and proceeded 20 Miles to
							breakfast at Mattawamkeag. Our Amazon fellow-passenger came no farther
							than Hainesville, where she had until recently been the keeper of the
							house at which we lodged—a good (not a fair[)] sample of the female
							pioneer of the wilderness.— From Mattawamkeag, we came a 9 mile stage to
							Lincoln. 13 miles to Enfield. 16 to the place where we dined—then 16
							to<space/>and 16 to Bangor, where at half past 7 in the Evening, we
							alighted at the Bangor Hotel, the best public house we have seen since
							we left Boston— We travelled this day ninety miles, almost entirely
							through a wilderness, covered with spruce, pine, fir, and birch trees
							resembling exactly what we had seen in Nova-Scotia, and in ascending the
							river S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John— There was one extensive
							tract, known by the name of the burnt district, where great ravages have
							been committed by fire among the woods— The lots of ground covered with
							stumps from 3 to four feet high, looking like a huge bowling green with
							the nine pins set up in order upon it were numerous. Many of the trees
							appeared to have been burnt off. The living trees were lofty, with stems
							of no unreasonable size, but perfectly straight, from 30 to 50 feet
							high, and suitable for masts of different sizes— Scarcely any ground
							cleared, and scarcely an attempt to eradicating the stumps. In some
							places there was grain, rye or Indian corn or grass on the soil, where
							the stumps were still standing— We came part of the way, along near the
							Bank of the Penobscot river, on which Bangor is situated— Yesterday was
							the election day—throughout the State of Maine, and at every stage at
							which we stopp’d, and every Post-Office by which we passed we witnessed
							great excitement of anxious curiosity to learn how the vote of yesterday
							had gone in the towns through which we passed.— At one town, Lincoln,
							the Postmaster was in fine Spirits, and said they were looking up;
							because the democrats had gained 4 votes upon the election in 1838—that
							of 1839. not having been seriously contested—but in all the other towns
							the gain had been on the whig side—much to the annoyance of our driver
							and of most of the Postmasters— About 20 Miles short of Bangor, we took
							up as passengers a man named <persRef ref="u">Haines</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="u">a young man</persRef>, a son of <persRef
								ref="cleaveland-parker">Professor Cleveland</persRef> who said he
							had come 150 miles, for the single purpose of depositing his vote, and
							we shall elect Fairfield, said he, by 5000 majority—ten minutes after he
							said—if we do not carry Fairfield by more than 2000 majority I will go
							for <persRef ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> in November—
							Shortly after he asked <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
							if he was acquainted with John Quincy Adams—upon which Charles pointed
							to me, and said that’s he—upon which he offered me his hand which I
							readily took. At the Bangor house they shewed me into the Ladies
							parlour, where there were two ladies and a gentleman— In a few minutes
							the room filled up with visitors, all strangers among whom were <persRef
								ref="carr-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr</persRef> the
							Mayor of the City—<persRef ref="kent-edward">Edward Kent</persRef>,
							Ex-Governor and now a candidate for election to that Office; and
								<persRef ref="moody-george">George Barrell Moody</persRef>, both
							Classmates at Cambridge of my dear departed <persRef ref="adams-george"

							graduate of 1810—<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jerome</persRef>, formerly of Boston and others almost numberless—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr the Mayor invited me to receive
							the visits and greetings of the Citizens generally, to which I assented
							appointing the hour of 10. O’Clock to-morrow Morning, but I said I must
							ask them to excuse me from addressing them in a speech.</p>

						<p><date>16. IV:15. </date>Wednesday</p>
						<p>The Bangor Hotel, is one of the public houses, set up in many of our
							large towns in imitation of the Tremont house at Boston, and in point of
							accommodation for lodgers is the best that I have yet visited— At half
							past seven the lodgers were roused to breakfast, by the sound of the
							Gong, a very noisy and discordant substitute for the Bell.— The two
							Ladies and the Gentleman whom I had found in the Ladies parlour last
							evening were at the breakfast table, and I apologized to them for the
							interruption and breaking up of their musical party by the numerous
							visitors who came in.— At 10. O’Clock, the Mayor, <persRef
								ref="carr-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr</persRef>
							came, and proposed to me to receive the Citizens who wished to see, and
							shake hands with me, in a large upper dancing hall in the Hotel to which
							I assented— There for about half an hour, I received and shook hands
							with all that came—two or three hundred— They were named as they came,
							but were all strangers, not one of whose names I can recollect— Many
							others came merely to look on, and to hear.— They soon filled the hall,
							and I saw it was impossible to dismiss them without an Address— I told
							the Mayor that although I had requested to be excused from addressing
							the Citizens to day; yet as they were now assembled, I could not
							possibly part from them after this meeting without saying a few words;
							whereupon, a gentleman named <persRef ref="u">M’Gaw</persRef>, I suppose
							some City Officer, in a style far more complimentary than agreeable to
							me; and I mounted on a Sopha at one end of the Hall, and spoke for about
							an hour and a half to the People— I gave them my reasons for the request
							I had made to the Mayor to be excused from addressing them in public— My
							position as an Ex-president of the U.S. and as possibly a Candidate for
							re-election as a member of Congress— Reasons for which I had declined
							attending any of the large public meetings which have been held within
							the year, from that of Baltimore last May, to that of Bunker hill last
							week— I should continue to decline attending all such meetings in
							future, and should now confine myself to two topics specially
							interesting to the People of the State of Maine, and to myself— I then
							rectified certain misrepresentations of my opinions made by <persRef
								ref="lowell-joshua">Joshua A. Lowell</persRef>, a member of the
							present delegation from Maine in Congress, and spoke with disgust of
								<persRef ref="featherstonhaugh-george">Featherstonhaugh’s</persRef>
							recent report on the North-eastern boundary— The crowd still collected
							in the Hall, and the Mayor proposed to me to adjourn to the steps of the
							House for fear of breaking down the Hall— I preferred closing my
							discourse, which I did with an abundance of cheering. Then at 12.
							O’Clock <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce</persRef>
							accompanied me to visit <persRef ref="coombs-philip">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Philip Coombs</persRef>; a heavy lame

						<dateline>Bangor— Steamer Bangor. 17. September 1840.</dateline>
						<p><date>17. IV. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>Up again at four O’Clock this morning. At 5 we embarked in the Steamer
							Bangor <persRef ref="howes-samuel">Captain Howes</persRef> for Portland,
							and Boston— That was the hour at which she should have departed from the
							wharf: but although the Night had been clear, and the Sun rose bright,
							with the Sun there came up a thick fog and there was a bar of a few
							miles below the City, to pass which it was expedient to wait for the
							flood tide. It was near 7. when we loosened from the wharf with a
							multitude of passengers—Men—women and children, among whom as sedom
							fails in a Steamer one, excessively fractious and troublesome baby—
								<persRef ref="whitman-ezekiel">Judge Whitman</persRef>, U.S.
							District judge <persRef ref="ware-asher">Ashur Ware</persRef>, and judge
								<persRef ref="preble-william">William Pitt Preble</persRef> were
							also of the company— They all live at Portland and have been a fortnight
							at Bangor upon an arbitration— <persRef ref="fessenden-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fessenden</persRef>, an elderly member
							of the bar at Portland, father of the <persRef ref="fessenden-william"
								>young man</persRef> just elected to the 27<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Congress in the place of <persRef ref="smith-albert2"
								>Albert Smith</persRef> was also of the party, and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dwinell</persRef> a Gentleman to
							whom we were indebted for many civilities yesterday, but of whom I know
							nothing further— It is indeed impossible to conceive of the confusion of
							the mind, and forgetfulness of names upon the presentation of hundreds
							of persons at one time— In descending the Penobscot river, we passed
							first by Frankfort on the right and Bucksport on the left bank of the
							river— I had yesterday several visitors from Brewer; on the opposite
							side of the river to Bangor.— Frankfort is about 7 and Bucksport 9 miles
							below— As we approached Frankfort, guns were fired from the shore, and
							bells were rung—a crowd of people were assembled on the wharf, who as we
							parted from it gave three cheers— I supposed it a rejoicing of the whigs
							at their election victory— As we approached Bucksport, the firing of
							guns and ringing of bells were repeated— Judge Whitman said to me, that
							is for you— I said surely not—but for the whig victory— As we parted
							from the wharf the cheering was a hearty shout— The right of
							petition—the right of petition—huzza for the man who sustains the right
							of petition—left no doubt of the meaning of the guns and bells— It was a
							happy moment leaving me to lament to how little purpose I had defended
							the right of petition.— We afterwards passed by Waldo, and Prospect,
							Belfast and Castine on opposite sides at the mouth of Penobscot river
							and opening to the Bay.— Then Lincolnville and Thomaston—through the
							whole day, sudden and entire alternations of clear, bright Sunshine, and
							of impenetrable and perplexing fogs disclosed and concealed some of the
							most beautiful scenery upon earth— For several hours from 9. A.M. till
							noon there was nothing beyon the vessel to be seen, and I retired to a
							birth in the lower cabin and ruminated but did not sleep— We afterwards
							passed the Fox-islands, numerous ledges of rocks— Seguin island
							light—Pemmaquid point, and just at Sunset went in to Boothbay harbour
							and anchored at Townsend. Captain Howes was afraid to proceed in the
							Night, with a fog he said as dense as he had ever seen— Within half an
							hour after Sunset however the fog cleared away, and the anchor was soon
							weighed at 8. p.m. we passed by the mouths of the Sheepscut and
							Kennebeck rivers and Cape Smallpoint— I had a long conversation upon
							political topics with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fessenden; and then
							retired without undressing to a couch in the lower cabin, where I slept
							till awaked by the fastening of the Steamer to the wharf at Portland,
							precisely at One, in the Morning.</p>

						<dateline>Portland. Maine— Portsmouth New Hampshire 18. September

						<p><date>18. VI:30. </date>Friday</p>
						<p>We landed from the Steamer Bangor, on the wharf at Portland at one
							O’Clock this morning, and took lodgings at the Cumberland House; another
							good imitation of the Tremont— I went immediately to bed and slept till
							half past 6. when I rose in sound health, and fresh from the fatigues of
							four preceding days— At half past 7. we breakfasted at the ordinary, and
							there met <persRef ref="parris-virgil">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Virgil D. Parris</persRef> a member of the present Congress from
							Maine, but who has just failed as a candidate for re-election— We had
							barely breakfasted, when <persRef ref="daveis-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> C. A. Daveis</persRef>, called upon
							me, and proposed to me to walk with him to the hill, upon which <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> held his last interview with
								<persRef ref="sewall-jonathan">Jonathan Sewall</persRef> in 1774
							immediately before the commencement of the revolutionary War—as related
							by my father in the preface to the republication of the essays of
							Novanglus and Massachusettensis— I went accordingly with him upon the
							hill, which presents one of the most beautiful prospects, that I ever
							beheld an extensive view of islands; mountains, vallies, and the distant
							ocean with that own poor house, bosom’d high in tufted trees— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Daveis pointed out to me the spot where he
							supposed the interview between my father and Jonathan Sewall had been
							held— The place is now a grave-yard, and a deeply affecting spot for the
							monuments which it contains over the graves of <persRef
								ref="burrows-william2">Lieutenant Commandant Willian
								Burrows</persRef> commander of the United State Brig Enterprize, and
								<persRef ref="blythe-samuel">Samuel Blythe</persRef> commander of
							the British Brig Boxer, captured by the Enterprize on the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1813. and brought into
							Portland— The Commanders of both vessels were killed in the action, and
							here they sleep in death, and in glory side by side, as if they had been
							man and wife— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daveis said that he felt
							some mortification in stating that the monument over the remains of
							Lieutenant Burrows was erected at the expense, not of the citizens of
							Portland, collective or individual, but of <persRef ref="davis-matthew"
								>Matthew L. Davis</persRef> of New-York. Another Monument, which
							awakened long slumbering sensibilities in my breast was that of <persRef
								ref="preble-edward2">Commodore Preble</persRef>, one of our gallant
							naval commanders, whose name carries with it round the world the honour
							of our Country— On returning with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daveis
							to the Hotel, we met in the Street the Mayor of the City, <persRef
								ref="ilsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ilsley</persRef>,
							in former times Collector of the Customs and <persRef
								ref="wingate-joshua">Gen<hi rend="superscript"

							Representatives, U.S. and whose <persRef ref="wingate-julia"
								>wife</persRef> is a daughter of the late <persRef
								ref="dearborn-henry">General Henry Dearborn</persRef>— With them
							there was a throng of Citizens of the place whom the Mayor stated to be
							desirous of paying their respects to me and of shaking hands with me,
							which they did for about half an hour in a hall of the Hotel. We then
							went to a new yet unfinished Courthouse and Exchange building, with a
							dome on the top of it, which we ascended and there again beheld the fair
							city at our feet, and the exquisitely beautiful prospects of hills,
							around and the more distant view of the Ocean— Met <persRef
								ref="ware-asher">judge Ware</persRef>, in his chamber adjoining the
							Court room and <persRef ref="ware-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Ware</persRef> was with him. The throng continued to shake hands,
							and I gave them a short parting address of half an hour in the Court
							room— At 12. Met General Wingate, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Wingate and numerous Ladies at his house— <persRef
								ref="bailey-charlotte">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bailey
								(Charlotte Welsh)</persRef> Short parting address— Dined at the

						<p><date>19. VI. </date>Saturday</p>
						<p>At Portland yesterday <persRef ref="wingate-joshua">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Wingate</persRef> had expressly
							invited me to his house at 12 O’Clock to meet the Ladies, who wished to
							see me— There were many there; but none with whom I had any previous

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wingate</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bailey-charlotte">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Bailey</persRef>— Many fine women, but whose very names escape me—
							My parting address to them was extremely Laconic—on our way back to the
							Hotel, we met three young Ladies who were going to Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Wingate’s, and whom <persRef
								ref="daveis-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daveis</persRef>
							introduced to me in the Street— At his request we stop’d at one house,
							where he introduced to me two others— On our return to the Hotel, I
							received a polite note from <persRef ref="smith-albert2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Albert Smith</persRef> inviting me to
							dine with him at his boarding house— And while we were at dinner at the
							Hotel he came in, and I thanked him for his kindness and apologized for
							being deprived of the pleasure of accepting his invitation to dinner by
							our immediate departure for Portsmouth— In the Stage from Portland we
							had a very handsome young woman from Newburyport married at Portland,
							who was going to Newburyport; with a young man, perhaps her brother.
							Before reaching Saco, they left the Stage to proceed in a horse and
							Chaise. At Scarborough, the Innkeeper made himself known to me, as
							heretofore a Sea-Captain, introduced to me as Master of one of <persRef
								ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray’s</persRef>
							merchant vessels at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg— His name
							is <persRef ref="u">Hovey</persRef>.— But since 1811. I had thoroughly
							forgotten him— From Portland to Portsmouth is 50 Miles— We passed
							through Saco, and over the river—then through Biddeford, Kennebunk,
							Wells, York Kittery, in view of the Boon Island light, and across the
							long bridge over the Piscataway river to Portsmouth; we came to the
							Rockingham house, where we found <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi

							<persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel2">son’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="curtis-emily">wife</persRef>, with her <persRef

							Politics.— <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Henry Hubbard</persRef> a Senator in Congress from New-Hampshire was
							haranguing a loco foco convocation in one house and there was a crowded
							assemblage of whigs at another. The latter followed us, mob fashion,
							shouting, huzzaing, and calling me out by name— I went out to them, and
							as it was as dark as pitch, thanked them heartily for their kind
							reception—gave them good news from Maine, and asked them to excuse me
							from addressing them then whereupon they dispersed with three cheers—
								<persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Austin</persRef> called to see M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis— <persRef ref="upham-timothy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham</persRef> called upon me and
							apologized for the disturbance of our repose, by the tumultuous but
							friendly impetuosity of the people, which we cheerfully overlooked. He
							and several other gentlemen, urged me with great earnestness and
							pertinacity to stay at Portsmouth and address the whigs, and counteract
							the eloquence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hubbard— But we had
							irrevocably fixed to take the Stage this morning, and to close our
							excursion this day. We accordingly breakfasted at 6. A.M. and after a
							fruitless chase in the rain for a barber, We started in the Stage from
							the Rockingham house 16 Miles to Exter—then two Miles further to the
							place to which the railway from Boston to Portland has hitherto
							extended—there took the cars—landed at the Tremont house Boston at 1/2
							past 12. and there parted from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis who
							returned home to Roxbury— Found a Barber— Visit to <persRef

						<p>Clear morning— I went to the corner of <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house, and saw the Sun—just risen 5:44. Heard
							the <persRef ref="sibley-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> John
								Langdon Sibley</persRef>, this morning, from 1. Corinthians 1.12.
							“Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of <persRef
								ref="paul">Paul</persRef>: and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas, and I
							of Christ. 13. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
							baptized in the name of Paul?” This was a discourse on the diversities
							of Sentiment and opinions among men, as resulting from the constitution
							of human nature; and upon the duty of mutual toleration and liberality
							resulting therefrom— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sibley’s remarks
							were sensible and judicious, manifesting a Christian temper and
							benevolent disposition; but not much depth—of observation or of
							research.— His delivery is good, but not remarkable— Much superior to
							any thing that I have heard the last two Sundays, since I left home.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sibley was a Classmate of my son
							Charles at Cambridge— He dined with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— He expressed great
							curiosity to have mount Wollaston, and the place where <persRef
								ref="hancock-john">John Hancock</persRef> was born pointed out to
							him; which I did—walking over the hill to Meeting, after dinner— I had
							shewed him also at his request, my Library—the Volumes of my diary, and
							some of my Letter-books and <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> . The original Letter to <persRef
								ref="webb-nathan">Nathan Webb</persRef> of October 1755. and the
							Book copy of the Letter to <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my
								mother</persRef> of 3. July 1776.—I gave him also copies of my three
							Eulogies, of the Oration of 4. July 1837 at Newbury-port—the Speech on
							the right of Petition in June 1838. The Jubilee of the Constitution, at
							New-York April 1839. and the Speech of May 1840. on the English system
							of smuggling.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sibley’s afternoon text
							was from 2. Corinthians—6:14—[“]for what fellowship hath righteousness
							with unrighteousness.”— I had not time in the leisure of this day, even
							to read through all the Letters which have been received here for me,
							during my absence; among which are invitations of 1. September from the
							Whigs of Michigan to attend and take part in a whig convention at
							Detroit on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of September, from the
							whigs of North-Carolina to attend their Convention at Raleigh, on the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October, and from the whigs of
							the Western part of New-York to attend and address a Convention at
							Buffalo on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October— Letters also
							from <persRef ref="lee-edmund">E. J. Lee</persRef> of Alexandria, from
								<persRef ref="fendall-philip">Philip R. Fendall</persRef> and from a
							Committee of the Proprietors of the second Presbyterian church at
							Washington, upon various political topics and religious concerns which
							will require my particular notice, and early attention— <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, my Granddaughter read to me
							in the French Bible, the third chapter of the Book of Judges, to which
							she had read before I went away.— Charles and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="adams-john3">Midshipman John Quincy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> spent the Evening

							last Friday, and gone herself into Boston to <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Keating’s</persRef>, and now directed
							Elizabeth to come to her— I went up the hill to Charles’s house it being
							the equinoctial day, but the Sun rose beclouded—and I could not note the
							time or place— With the exception of a short visit to my garden,
							nursery, orchard and seminary, the day was occupied with this diary, in
							which I have a new arrear of eight days to redeem— About Sunset, I
							walked to <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams’s</persRef>, and found her recovered from a recent
							indisposition— Her Sister <persRef ref="foster-frances">M<hi

							to-morrow, going on a visit to Bangor— The <persRef ref="adams-john3"
								>Midshipman John Quincy</persRef> walked home with me, with the
							illumination of a splendid Aurora Borealis— With this sets in the sharp
							autumnal cold, which kindled a fire in our dining room; and I found one
							at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s— At home I found
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Price Greenleaf</persRef> as a visitor, and my Son had a proof print
							of the portrait of <persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef> to
							be published with the volume of her Letters which he has prepared for
							publication, and which he expected would have been published before our
							departure for Nova-Scotia. The print is a copper plate engraving, from
							the Portrait in water Colours taken about 1764 or 1765 shortly after my
							mothers marriage—during her absence in England, about 1785. this
							portrait with that of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							taken at the same time were removed from the house at the foot of Penn’s
							hill, by <persRef ref="cranch-mary2">my aunt Cranch</persRef> to her
							house, where they remained upwards of 50 years, till about the this time
							last year, when I took my father’s portrait to lend to <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bancroft</persRef> at Boston, to be engraved for a forth coming
							volume of his history of the United States— Since then, Charles has
							undertaken to publish this small volume of my mother’s Letters, and had
							this portrait engraved, to front the title-page. But it is wretchedly
							executed, and he doubts whether to accept and use it, or to publish the
							book without any portrait. I thought, bad as it is, that it is better
							than none—and better than to delay the publication till another plate
							can be engraved— The inconvenience of this would be increased by the
							fact, that there is already a favourable review of the Book in the
							North-American Review for the present quarter, which will be published
							the first of next Month— And so think the <persRef

						<p>And now that I shall at least for some time have no memorable daily facts
							to record, I ought from day to day to make up a summary of reflections
							resulting from my observations in a three weeks excursion to the British
							Provinces of Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and through the State of
							Maine, and a corner of New-Hampshire— For, to what purpose is travel,
							but to replenish the mind with observation? and to what purpose is a
							mind full of observation, but to impart?— Oh! for the mind of a <persRef

								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Adams</persRef>, went this afternoon over to Weymouth— I planted the
							stone of a very large peach, with two Nova-Scotia plum-stones 6.
							Shagbark walnuts in the drupe, and 6 English white-oak acorns in patch 3
							row 7 of the seminary, opposite the old plum tree— I had a large young
							Peach-tree, transplanted into this patch last autumn; which being now
							dead, I had taken out of the ground, and these Stones, nuts and acorns
							put down in its place— There is a black currant-bush, and an
							Apple-seedling growing in the <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Georgiana</persRef> patch, where the violet blossomed through the
							whole of last Summer, and is not yet extirpated. I cannot approach the
							place but with sweet and bitter tears— I paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Greenleaf</persRef> of the early part of this Evening— Charles and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> were here the
							latter part of it— We had fire in the dining room, and I had need of
							some self-controul to abstain from having one made in my Library where I
							was writing to retrieve these arrears— In our recent excursion the
							observation frequently recurred to me of the results upon the physical,
							political and moral face of the country, under the colonial, and the
							independent condition, compared with each other— The aspect of the
							Provinces of Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick constantly reminded me of
							that of Massachusetts-Bay, in the days of my childhood, as far back as I
							can remember. The Provinces are prosperous—their population increases
							from year to year— The British Government, taught by woful experience
							the absurdity of expecting to raise revenue from these Colonies, passed
							to the other extreme, and pours forth from her own funds, with a lavish
							hand— They maintain their authority over the Provinces at enormous
							sacrifices of men and money. The Salaries of the <hi rend="italic"
								>Lieutenant</hi> Governors of Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, fall
							little short of that of the President of the United States. An army of
							16000 men, is now maintained in these two Provinces and the Canada’s.
							The whole army of the United States is now 12500. Nearly doubled as it
							has been within the last 3 years— There are three regiments, the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and
								37<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> stationed at Halifax besides
							divisions of Royal Artillery and Engineers— Twenty-three regiments of
							Nova-Scotia-Militia, all armed, officered and trained—a Navy of 26 armed
							vessels and 6 armed Steamers—all together presenting the aspect of a
							community clad in complete steel and prepared for defence against the
							most formidable assaults— There is a regiment the 69<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John,
							and a Regiment the 36<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> at Fredericton— In
							the Canadas are many more; and a Governor General, holding a Court, and
							maintaining an Establishment little less than royall. All this for a
							population less than one half equal to that of the State of New-York—and
							all this maintained at the expense of the British Nation— These
							possessions are cherished as destined to hold in check, and under
							controul the growing power of the United States of America, an object
							for which John Bull considers no sacrifice too great.</p>

							Historical and Statistical account of Nova-Scotia, in two 8<hi
								rend="superscript">vo.</hi> Volumes, published in 1829. a very
							valuable work.— From this it appears that the population of the
							Provinces in 1790 was about 30000. in 1817. 82053. and in 1827.
							123,848—besides 30000 in the Island of Cape Breton: Hence within the
							last half century the population has more than quadrupled; and has kept
							a full proportion to the average increase throughout the United States;
							though in no wise comparable to the increase in our Western States, or
							New-York or Pennsylvania— Two thirds of this population of Nova-Scotia
							proper consists of the remnants and descendants of 20000 loyalists or
							refugees from the North-American States who settled there in 1783
							immediately after the close of the American revolutionary War— The
							numbers of the people now including the Island of Cape-Breton must
							exceed 200,000— The territory of the Peninsula covers an Area of 15617
							square miles nearly double that of the State of Massachusetts; and with
							a population of 100 to a square mile, which is about that of
							Massachusetts, would number more than one million and a half of
							inhabitants— It is not probable that it will ever feed such numbers— Its
							situation however is favourable to commerce, and its climate to the
							establishment of manufactures. Of these there are now none, the policy
							of the mother country being to furnish them for the Province— They are
							imported duty free, and there is neither capital nor shill in the colony

						<p>The day of the monthly meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
							which I did purpose to attend; but on reflection, I thought it would be
							a useless waste of time, and concluded to stay at home. Since my
							excursion of three weeks, I find propensities of dissipation stealing
							upon me which it is advisable to controul, and to return as far as
							possible to the duties before me— Returning home last Evening, I met
								<persRef ref="richards-lysander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richards</persRef> of the Quincy Lyceum who had called at my house,
							to solicit a Lecture from me for that Institution, which I promised to
							deliver before my departure for Washington— As yet the arrears of the
							Diary absorb all my time, excepting a morning hour, which I have devoted
							on resuming the perusal of <persRef ref="bancroft-george"
								>Bancroft’s</persRef> history of the United States— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> dined and spent
							the evening with us— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							attended a Meeting of the democratic party this Evening, at which George
							Bancroft, Collector of the Customs at Boston, Superintendant of
							Light-houses within the Commonwealth, and Commissioner for building a
							Custom house at Boston, delivered an electioneering democratic address—
							This practice of itinerant speech-making has suddenly broken forth in
							this Country to a fearful extent.— Electioneering for the Presidency,
							has spread its contagion to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> himself—to his now only competitor; to his
							immediate <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Predecessor</persRef>—to one at
							least of his Cabinet Counsellors, the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
								>Secretary of War</persRef>—to the Ex-candidates <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, and to many of the
							most distinguished members of both Houses of Congress— Immense
							assemblages of the People are held—of 20, 30, 50,000 souls, where the
							first Orators of the Nation, address the multitude, not one in ten of
							whom can hear them, on the most exciting topics of the day— As yet the
							parties call and hold these meeting separately and seldom interfere with
							each other— But at the Baltimore convention last May one of the Marshals
							of the procession, a respectable mechanic of the city was killed, by an
							attempt of individuals of the opposite party to break it up— At a
							meeting a few days since on long Island, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Webster in a speech of two hours and a half, observed that there was to
							be held a meeting of the opposite party another great meeting at the
							same place on the next day; and he gave what was equivalent to a
							challenge to <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef> and all
							the administration leaders to meet him on the stump.— A hand bill was
							this day circulated in this town, severely reflecting on M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft, for coming to deliver this
							address— Charles says that at Medford there has already been hostile
							collision between the parties—and the tendency of all this undoubtedly
							is, to the corruption of the popular elections, both by violence and
							fraud— Charles came in after hearing M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bancroft’s address, which was delivered at the Universalist Meeting
							house— Bancroft is an apostate federalist, as are almost to a man the
							leaders of the mock democracy of this State— Most of them, have cast off
							their caterpillar skin within the last five years— <persRef

								ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis’s</persRef> account of our expenses on our recent tour— Among
							my remarks during that excursion, was the contrast between the excessive
							election excitement, which we left behind us at Boston, and found again
							blazing out, on the very day of our entrance into the State of Maine,
							and the calm and almost lethargic condition of the British Provinces.
							The British Government makes itself felt there only by its favours—
							Levies no taxes; pays nearly all the charges of Government—keeps an army
							at great cost, and a considerable naval force, for the protection and
							defence of the Country; and humours the people in every thing— They have
							also made excellent roads through the forests of Nova-Scotia; and are
							now doing the same in New-Brunswick— No Government upon earth probably
							so assiduously labours to make itself acceptable to the people under its
							rule as these Colonial authorities— There are however representative
							assemblies in both Provinces, and in each a Legislative and an Executive
							Council— Their provincial Parliaments were like the House of Commons at
							home elected for seven years; but that of Nova-Scotia, is already
							reduced to four, and they are expecting the same alteration in New
							Brunswick— There is in Nova-Scotia, however, a sharp and sturdy
							opposition in the house of Assembly, and that body last year passed a
							vote of censure upon <persRef ref="campbell-colin">Sir Colin
								Campbell</persRef>, the king’s Governor.— The British privy Council,
							fully approved the measures, censured by the Assembly; but they recalled
							Sir Colin, and since we were there <persRef ref="cary-lucius">Lord
								Falkland</persRef> has arrived in the Steamer Britannia, at Halifax,
							and has taken his place— This is a very convenient mode of adjusting
							dissensions between the Legislative and Executive authorities— An
							election for a new house of assembly is now about to take and the
							prospect was of a large majority to sustain the last house, and against
							the Governor.— Lord Falkland will find no difficulty in disarming this
							majority; if he walks in the footsteps of <persRef ref="harvey-john">Sir
								John Harvey</persRef>— His qualification for the office is that
								<persRef ref="cary-amelia">his wife</persRef> is a cousin of

						<p>My daily task is the diary of the preceding day, and the redemption of

								<persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De

							and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							Miss Welsh into Boston left them at <persRef ref="otis-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Allyne Otis’s</persRef> and returned
							home this evening.— Charles was not here— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> De Windt had with her the first copy of the volume of
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail">my mother’s</persRef> Letters. It
							deserves notice how very little intercourse there has heretofore been
							between the People of the United States and those of the adjoining
							British Provinces, and most especially with Nova-Scotia— Yet they well
							deserve to be studied by a young American Statesman; for they are
							destined to have hereafter a very powerful influence over the condition
							of the North American Union and especially over its Northern and Western
							Sections. The Policy of the British Government has been to excite and
							main divisions of interest among the colonies themselves as well as to
							nourish and stimulate their animosities against the neighbouring States.
							In 1784. the Province of New-Brunswick was set off from Nova-Scotia, and
							constituted a separate colony— So was the island of Cape-Breton, which
							has however been since re-annexed to Nova-Scotia. There are very
							perceptible mutual rivalries and jealousies between the Provinces and, a
							great indifference in both to the Canada’s.— They levy an impost duty of
							five percent upon all imported goods from one to the other, and it is
							very apparently part of the political system at home to keep them as
							much as possible alienated from each other; that all my be more
							perfectly dependent upon the common parent— Another precaution at home
							is a rigorous prohibition to recruit any of the regiments in the
							provinces— Of the ten companies constituting a regiment they always
							retain four in England in depot; and send them out from time to time, to
							supply the vacancies by death or desertion. The last are very rare— The
							men are enlisted for life, and as they are all taken from the paupers of
							the three kingdoms, and are fed, clad and lodged at the king’s expense,
							and trained exclusively to the performance of military service, they are
							nested in a condition of existence from which they have little
							temptation to depart, especially at the risk of capture and severe
							punishment— Yet on the day that we were at Saint John, a Court martial
							was held upon a Soldier who had deserted from the 69<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> regiment, and who one of the Officers
							said had been taken at Portland— I mentioned this at Portland, to their
							great surprize—</p>

							years chum of my dear Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>
							at Harvard University— He was educated and ministered sometime in
							South-Carolina, as an episcopal clergyman, but upon consciencious
							conviction became a convert to the unitarian doctrine, and was for
							sometime settled as Minister of the Unitarian church, at Washington— For
							the last ten years he has been Minister of the South Congregation,
							Washington Street Boston— He preached this day at our Church, by
							exchange with <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef>— His morning text was from James 5:11. [“]Behold we
							count them happy, which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job,
							and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of
							tender mercy.” and he read part of the first, and of the last chapters
							of Job— Patience under affliction was the exhortation of his discourse,
							and I thought he had selected this Sermon for delivery here, with
							reference to my misfortunes, and to his former relations with my beloved
							Son— I felt grateful to him for his intention— He dined with us. But the
							conversation which seemed most agreeable to him, was upon European
							politics. His afternoon text was John 20.31. [“]But these are written,
							that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that
							believing ye might have life through his name.”— Upon the evidences of
							Christianity. My attention and thoughts were too much absorbed by the
							volume of <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mothers</persRef> Letters
							which <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> has published, and
							of which he sent me this morning a copy— An admirable Memoir of her

							affected me till the tears streamed down my face— It disabled me for all
							other occupation, and the arrears of this diary, and the Sermon of
								<persRef ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef> were forgotten Charles
							was here this Evening; but <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

								ref="bancroft-george">Bancroft’s</persRef> History of the United

							climate of that Country—upon the Indian Monarchs, <persRef

							before the New-York Lyceum— I answered again indecisively but
							discouragingly and promised an answer definitive at an early day. In the
							afternoon I had a visit from <persRef ref="curry-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James L. Curry</persRef> late
							President of the Boston Mechanic Apprentices library Association, with
							his Successor the present President of the same Society, requesting me

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> had encouraged them
							to expect that he would perform this service for them— But he is now
							itinerant as a political orator, and has informed them that his
							engagements will not admit of his being here in time to discourse as he
							had promised them. These perpetual, and almost numberless applications
							are to me very distressing: between the wish and the inability to comply
							with the request of a favour, itself importing kindness and respect— I
							have however declined, upon the chance that I may be called to
							Washington, before the close of the next Month— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Curry has ceased to be President of the Mechanic
							Apprentice’s library Association, because his apprenticeship has
							terminated. <persRef ref="haley-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Haley</persRef> was the Secretary when I prepared the two Lectures
							for them, and delivered one of them last November— I this day brought up
							the arrears of diary into which it fell during my recent excursion, but
							leave many remarks which I ought to have made, never to be recorded.— In
							the account of the visit that I made to <persRef ref="blowers-sampson"
								>Sampson Salter Blowers</persRef>, at Halifax I was mistaken in the
							statement that he had been the prosecutor of <persRef
								ref="preston-thomas">Captain Preston</persRef>, and the Soldiers of
							the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Regiment, for the Tragedy of the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1770— He was on the
							contrary one of the Counsel for the accused, with <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah3">Josiah Quincy</persRef>. The Prosecutors were
								<persRef ref="quincy-samuel">Samuel Quincy</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="paine-robert">Robert Treat Paine</persRef>— Blowers however
							named as one of the Counsel for the Soldiers, appears to have taken no
							part in the argument— There were five indictments, one for each of the
							five inhabitants killed in the fray, each charging first the soldier,
							whose fire killed the individual charged in the Bill as murdered, and
							then charging Captain Preston and other soldiers of the guard as
							accomplices in the murder— The first indictment against <persRef
								ref="wemms-william">Wemms</persRef> charged also four individuals
							not soldiers as accomplices in the crime; they were however separately
							tried, not till the next December, and were all acquitted—on the five
							indictments, Preston, and six of the eight Soldiers were acquitted— Two
								<persRef ref="killroy-matthew">Matthew Killroy</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="montgomery-hugh">Hugh Montgomery</persRef>, were found
							not guilty of murder, but guilty of Manslaughter, and were discharged
							upon the claim of the benefit of clergy and the brand of cold iron upon
							the hand— There is more curious matter in this trial which would make a
							good Lecture— <persRef ref="adams-john3">Midshipman John

							from whom I have an invitation to appoint some day, to go and address
							them upon the Presidential Election— I declined— Afternoon visit from
								<persRef ref="palfrey-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Palfrey</persRef>; and <persRef ref="lothrop-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop</persRef>, the Minister of the
							Brattle Street Church and Society. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Palfrey’s object was to repeat the solicitation to me to furnish two
							Articles for the North American Review—of which he is now the Editor and
							Proprietor— One a biographical account of <persRef ref="tudor-william2"
								>William Tudor jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and the
							other an Article upon the present condition of the Empire and trade of
							China; and particularly upon the case or prospect of War between
							Great-Britain, and the celestial Empire— It is impossible for me to
							prepare an Article upon either of these subjects because I have not, and
							have never been able to obtain the material facts of the life of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tudor—and because I have no particular
							information; nothing but loose, disconnected, Newspaper Reports upon the
							controversy between Great-Britain and China— I received a few days since
							from <persRef ref="forbes-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John M
								Forbes</persRef>, a folio volume of 458 pages, being the
							Correspondence relating to China, laid before both Houses of the British
							Parliament, last Spring by command of <persRef ref="victoria">Queen
								Victoria</persRef>— With the aid of this volume together with the
							information which I might collect from other sources, which it will
							indicate, I might make out a tolerable Article, but for the want of
							time. As it is, I shall have more than enough to do, to prepare a
							Lecture for the Quincy Lyceum, which I have promised, and the subject of
							which is yet floating in uncertainty upon my mind— In addition to all my
							other troubles, I took last Saturday, I know not how, a severe cold, and
							catarrhal cough, which torments me ever since. Visited my garden and
							nursery this afternoon— Gathered sundry Shagbarks and English white oak
							Acorns. Two rows of which, 6 of each in each row, I planted—at the left
							hand of the garden gate next North of the House— I have numerous fruit
							and forest trees of growth from one to ten years old—but twenty years
							are necessary to raise an orchard, and thirty years for a forest so that
							I might leave the accomplishment of that purpose to my Successors— At
							the dusk of Evening, I walked to <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef> to deliver a
							Letter to her daughter <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> which I had received this morning— But M<hi

						<p><persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef> was here this
							morning, and I had much conversation with him concerning my property in
							this town, and the necessary measures for the prudent and economical
							management of it; a subject exceedingly irksome to me, and for which I
							become from day to day more and more incompetent— The Mount Wollaston
							farm, the Penn’s hill farm—the Mansion house farm, the Salt-marsh and
							the woodlands, the repairs and preservation of buildings, the making and
							maintenance of fences, and the continual laying out of roads, all
							require persevering care, and skillful attention, nearly all of which I
							have committed in trust to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>, but of which a small portion remains sufficient to be
							burdensome upon my spirits, and to tax my time— I agreed to go into the
							woods some day next week with Deacon Spear, and <persRef
								ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemuel
								Humphreys</persRef> the Weymouth surveyor in search of a woodlot of
							which I am part proprietor, but how much, and with whom as tenant in
							common I know not— I am and for many years have been taxed for the
							whole; and as the wood upon it is now in condition to be cut off and
							sold, I propose to exercise that right of possession for the whole,
							responsible to each of the other proprietors for his part of the
							proceeds— <persRef ref="bass-lewis">Lewis Bass</persRef> was next here,
							collector of the town and County tax. 288 dollars which I paid by a
							check on the Quincy Stone bank— Bass and <persRef ref="field-harvey"
								>Harvey Field</persRef> are joint Lessees of my Penn’s hill farm—
							The lease expires next April and Field and Bass are desirous of having a
							new lease each for himself of the whole. I told Bass that I should
							prefer to have him sole tenant for the whole, but referred him for final
							arrangements to my Son.— He and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles7;adams-john17;adams-louisa3">three elder
								children</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>, and about an hour before dinner <persRef
								ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De
								Windt</persRef> came in from Boston with a young Clergyman named
								<persRef ref="simmons-george">Simmons</persRef>, who has acquired
							some notoriety by preaching two Sermons at Mobile in the State of
							Alabama, where he had been two years settled, exhorting his hearers to
							emancipate their Slaves— This was no longer ago than last May; and the
							immediate consequence was that he was exhorted to depart from the City
							and the State, which he did, without delay. Since then he has been some
							time preaching at Fishkill landing, and became an inmate in the family
							of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De Wint. They dined with us, and
							returned this Evening to Boston— After dinner I took him with me into my
							garden, Nursery and Seminary to view my seedling trees; and then up the
							hill to the porch of Charles’s house to view the prospect of Boston Bay
							and City, Mount Wollaston, and the villages of Quincy.— While we were at
							dinner, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef>, brother of <persRef ref="barnard-james">the one
								who came on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
								August</persRef> with <persRef ref="bowditch-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch</persRef> came for an answer
							whether I would deliver a Lecture before the Warren Street Association—
							I promised an answer within ten days.</p>
