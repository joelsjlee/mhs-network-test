						<dateline>Quincy. Thursday 1. October 1840—</dateline>
						<p><date>1. IV. </date>Thursday</p>
						<p>Rain all Night, and almost the whole of this day.— I had a fire at last
							made in my Library, having kept if off, for the last ten days, perhaps
							at the expense of a severe catarrh— I had been unable yesterday when I
							gave a check to <persRef ref="bass-lewis">Lewis Bass</persRef>, to find
							my Quincy stone bank check book, and after a vexatiously fruitless
							search for it, had conjectured that I might have left it at the Bank,
							the day before my departure for Halifax— I therefore walked this morning
							to the Bank and made enquiry for my book but it was not there. I then
							bethought myself of looking for it, where upon my return home I found
							it; in the pocket of my trunk. There I had deposited it for <hi
								rend="italic">special</hi> safekeeping; this is one of the now
							almost daily warnings of the decay of Memory, which is growing upon me,
							and for which I would in vain seek a remedy. The very excess of caution
							produces the effect of total heedlessness— My early rising enabled me to
							effect more this day than usual, though three hours of it were occupied
							in reading <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster’s</persRef> Speech to a great meeting of Merchants last
							Monday, at New-York— One of the most remarkable peculiarities of the
							present time is, that the principal leaders of the political parties,
							are travelling about the Country from State to State, and holding forth
							like methodist preachers, hour after hour to assembled multitudes, under
							the broad canopy of Heaven. Webster and <persRef ref="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="rives-william">W. C. Rives</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="buchanan-james">James Buchanan</persRef>, are among the first
							and foremost in this canvassing Oratory, while <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin van Buren</persRef> with his heads of
							Departments are harping upon another string of the political Accordion,
							by writing controversial electioneering Letters— Besides the prime
							leaders of the parties numerous subaltern officers of the
							administration, are summoned to the same service, and instead of
							attending to the duties of their Offices Rave, recite and madden round
							the land— <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bancroft’s</persRef> lecture last week, though said not to have been
							acceptable to his own party, because not sufficiently violent has yet
							given to the whigs of Quincy so much uneasiness that they applied to
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, to deliver a
							Counter-lecture to them this Evening, which he did at the same place,
							where Bancroft spoke, at the Universalist church— I went and heard him.
							He spoke about an hour and a half between 7. and 9. O’Clock, professedly
							in refutation of Bancroft’s Lecture— The house was crowded as full as it
							could hold, and the discourse was received with frequent, and finally
							with long continued applause— After he finished, <persRef
								ref="curtis-adam">Adam Curtis</persRef> one of the whig committee
							read a notice that to-morrow evening at the same hour, and in the same
							place, <persRef ref="cushing-abel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abel
								Cushing</persRef> of Dorchester, would deliver a Lecture in reply to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams— Charles rode home with me—
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">His wife</persRef> was here, but as it
							was raining and the road was muddy they both went immediately home in
							the carriage— I began a desperate attempt to write a Lecture upon Faith
							to be delivered here before the Quincy Lyceum. The subject is a perfect
							Chaos in my mind, and I dare not indulge the hope of shaping it into a
							discourse of at least an hour— But I must try.</p>

						<p>Another dull gloomy day, with alternate rain, mist and fog— It confined
							me to the houses, till the twilight of Evening suspended my writing.—
								<persRef ref="hardy-daniel">Daniel Hardy</persRef> of Hanson came
							while we were at dinner, to enquire concerning the condition of the
							claim of the widow <persRef ref="everson-eunice">Eunice
								Everson</persRef> to a revolutionary War Pension— I told him it was
							suspended upon two obstacles—first a deficiency of evidence; and
							secondly upon an empty Treasury, and a consequent stubborn opposition in
							Congress at their last Session, to all further extension of
							revolutionary War Pensions— He said she was very old, and destitute and
							greatly needed the pension— And that her friends had collected all the
							testimony, believed to be now attainable to support her claim— That
								<persRef ref="smith-john21">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Smith</persRef> of Hanson, who had heretofore corresponded with me
							on the subject, had requested him to call on me, and make these
							enquiries, and to ask my opinion of the prospect of obtaining the
							pension at the next Session of Congress— I told him that if M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Everson’s friends would transmit to me
							the testimony which they have collected, I would present the claim again
							at the Commencement of the next Session of Congress, and do whatever
							might be in my power to obtain a decision in its favour— But that with
							regard to my opinion I could give little encouragement to hope for its
							success, at the next Session—the short Session, with a worse than empty
							treasury, and either a prospect of immediate change of the responsible
							agents of public affairs, or a confirmed fixture of those in power,
							releasing them from the obligation of all pledges or bonds for good
							behaviour; and from all tender concern for the claims of revolutionary
							worthies or their families. their chance with the next Congress, might
							be more propitious— At dusk I walked to <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef>, and found
							her at home with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> and
							the Midshipman, <persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef> to whom
							I gave a Letter from his brother <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac
								Hull.</persRef>— <persRef ref="harrod-mary2">Miss Mary
								Harrod</persRef> was also there—yesterday from Portland— I walked
							home in darkness and through the mire, without stopping to hear <persRef
								ref="cushing-abel">Abel Cushing’s</persRef> reply to <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams</persRef>,
							at the Universalist Church. Charles went to Boston and returned home to
							dinner. He brought me <persRef ref="brougham-henry2">Lord
								Brougham’s</persRef> translation of the Oration of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> for the crown— Miss <persRef
								ref="adams-hannah2">Hannah Adams’s</persRef> Memoir of her own Life,
							published by <persRef ref="lee-hannah2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								H. F. Lee</persRef>; a gift from <persRef ref="miller-hannah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hannah Bigelow</persRef>—with a note
							from <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef> and an extract
							from a manuscript Memoir of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi><space/>Hay</persRef>, by her niece M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lee—and lastly, from <persRef
								ref="palfrey-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Palfrey</persRef>,
							a copy of his funeral Discourse on the late <persRef ref="kirkland-john"
								>President Kirkland</persRef>— What a scattering of temptations to
							read; with <persRef ref="bancroft-george">Bancroft’s</persRef> history,
							my mother’s Letters and the daily newspapers already on hand— I could
							not resist Lord Brougham’s introduction, where with self complacency
							somewhat ludicrous, and yet not without plausibility he insists that
							none but a practical orator can be competent to translate the Oration
							for the crown— He cites the example of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>—but Cicero translated into Latin the Oration of
								<persRef ref="aeschines">Eschines</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</persRef>, with that of Demosthenes for
							the crown.— Brougham should have done the same in English— The Oration
							of Eschines, is indispensable, to appreciate the full power of the
							answer to it, by Demosthenes.</p>

						<p><date>3. IV:30. </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>The third successive day of rain, mist and fog, confining me to the
							house, but enabling me, to write more of my Lecture upon <hi
								rend="italic">Faith</hi>—a subject upon which I have long meditated,
							and formed opinions, perhaps worthy of being communicated to the world,
							but immature in my own mind, and which can never be wrought into
							consistency, but in the form of a Dissertation— My principal difficulty
							consists in the dryness and hacknied nature of the subject profoundly
							metaphysical, and buried in the bottomless depths of religious
							controversy— Can I take it up without encroaching upon the province of
							the pulpit? Can I touch it, without getting entangled in the theological
							snarl, between Salvation by Faith and by Works? Can I trace, and unfold
							to demonstration the indissoluble union between religious and moral
							faith? can I show that it is the link of responsibility between man and
							his maker, and the only bond of Association between man and his brother?
							that it is the characteristic of his immortal nature? that it is the
							adamant of all human Society the cohesive principle of the gregarious
							animal man? Can I <hi rend="italic">define</hi> its legitimate powers—
							Its vitality to the institution of government? to the relations of
							domestic life? to the peace and justice of independent communities? to
							the intercourse of trade and commerce? to all the public and all the
							private duties of man? Can I mark its limits— Its modifications of
							active and passive faith—of confidence, and fidelity? Can I sift the
							question how far Faith, is or is not dependent upon the will? and above
							all can I approach the question when and how far Faith may be violated
							without wrong—when and how its violation may be matter of
							indifference—when and how it may become a dictate of indispensable duty?
							And can I dress up all this matter—with seasoning to make it palatable
							for an hour and a half to a popular auditory who would not endure for a
							half an hour in a Sermon? I make with intense and foolish anxiety the
							attempt— Foolish, because after all a dull Lecture, would not be a very
							crying sin— <persRef ref="adams-abigail">My mothers</persRef> Letters,
								<persRef ref="bancroft-george">Bancroft’s</persRef> History,
							<persRef ref="brougham-henry2">Broughams</persRef> Oration for the
							crown, and this Evening <persRef ref="brownson-orestes"
								>Brownson’s</persRef> defence of his Article on the laboring classes
							divided with newspaper trash, the reading hours of this day. I read half
							a dozen of my mothers Letters every day—economizing exquisite enjoyment,
							by taking it in small parcels— I can read scarcely one of them but with
							a stream of tears.— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							hopes the publication will succeed, and says the bookseller told him he
							had sold 200 copies in five days from its first exposition for sale—
							This is moderately promising, but if the whole edition is not sold
							within a month, there will be little demand for the book ever after— As
							a double monument of Memorial to my mother and Son, it affects me so
							deeply, that my judgment of it, is all absorbed in feeling. The <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-louisa-catherine">Ladies</persRef> took tea,
							and spent the Evening at Charles’s house— I walked there in the dark;
							but the road was so miry that I rode with the Ladies home— I took with
							me <persRef ref="auger-athanase">Augers</persRef> French translation of
							the Oration for the crown to compare him with Brougham— As to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Orestes Augustus Brownson I must use him
							at leisure, for a trial of temper.</p>

						<p>Communion day— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> preached this morning, from Matthew 11.25. “At that
							time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and
							Earth; because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
							hast revealed them unto babes”—an argumentative and eloquent discourse
							upon the character and history of the Christian religion, comparing the
							obscurity, and feebleness of its origin with the magnificence and
							grandeur of its results. The lowliness of its founder with the sublimity
							of its purpose, and the vastness of its expansion— This is a theme upon
							which it is easy to be impressive, and impossible to exaggerate— If the
							personal history of Jesus Christ were all a fable, the miracle of the
							system would remain as inexplicable to human reason as it is to account
							for the facts. <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whitney</persRef> joined, and took his part in the
							administration of the Communion—but he has passed the critical corner of
							three score years and ten, and is tottering to the last stage of all,
							which ends this strange eventful history— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s afternoon sermon was from Matthew 3.11. “I indeed baptize you
							with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than
							I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you, with the
							holy ghost and with fire.” The humility of <persRef ref="johnthebaptist"
								>John the Baptist</persRef>, in proclaiming himself only the
							precursor of the Messiah was particularly noticed—but I want from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt, an entire discourse upon the
							history, character, genealogy, birth, life and death of John the
							Baptist—of whom Jesus himself declared that among those that were born
							of women there was not a greater prophet— With regard to the language of
							the text M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt remarked that there in
							physical nature three materials of purification—Water Air and fire—and
							that the saying of John the Baptist, had allusion to this when he said
							figuratively that Christ would baptize with the holy ghost, and with
							fire.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave notice that from this
							time forward, for the winter the Sunday morning bell would be rung at
							half past ten, and the afternoon, at a quarter before two— The day was
							fair and the sky clear— I saw the Sunset in all his majesty from the
							porch of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— The
							midshipman <persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef>, and his
							Sister <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> spent the
							Evening here, as did Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef>— I read a few of <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my
								mother’s</persRef> Letters and a few pages of <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">Bancroft’s</persRef> History; but the burthen
							which now weighs me down is the Dissertation upon Faith, into the
							metaphysical part of which I am wading beyond my depth— My argument is
							assuming a religious complection from which I was desirous if possible
							of escaping, but which I perceive is unavoidable. As yet I am labouring
							it to lengthen it out, but before I finish, I may perhaps find it
							necessary to contract the field of discussion— I give myself till this
							day week to finish it, but shall find it necessary to labour in season
							and out of season, to bring it to a conclusion.</p>

							and if not, the first fair day, afterwards; to go into the woods and

							said he wished to see more of them.— This experiment is still upon

								Rogers</persRef> of Marshfield, with his Son <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rogers</persRef> came to converse with
							me concerning the petitions from the towns of Marshfield, Hanover and
							Pembroke, for a new survey, preliminary to an appropriation for the
							clearing out of obstructions in North-river— I told him that the
							petitions had at the last Session of Congress been referred in the House
							of Representatives to the Committee of Commerce, together with the old
							Petitions from Scituate for an appropriation to effect the improvement
							recommended by the report of the former survey— I observed that the
							petitions were in conflict with each other, and asked if the parties
							interested could not come to some compromise among themselves, as the
							effect of which their petitions would not clash with each other— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rogers complained that <persRef
								ref="turner-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. A.
								Turner</persRef>, and the people of Scituate harbour had not been
							quite fair, in their exertions to obtain the removal of the obstruction
							at the precise spot most favourable to them, who in point of numbers
							bore no proportion to those who wished for the new survey; but he did
							not encourage any expectation that the parties could come to any
							agreement respecting their opposite petitions— He expressed a wish that
							I would go and visit them at Marshfield, for which I fear I shall not be
							able to find time this autumn; and he requested me ask <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> for perusal of the papers which they sent to him
							with their Petitions last winter, which I promised to do— Charles told

								Fuller</persRef>, the Administrator of the <persRef
								ref="gill-moses;gill-moses2">two Moses Gills</persRef>, had
							determined to decline accepting the proposal I made at the probate Court

							had called upon <persRef ref="boylston-john">John Lane

							his father had secured to the second Moses Gill— He thinks M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller is advised to go into the Law, upon
							this matter, and that it will cost him more than the whole amount of the
							claim— I am so much engrossed with the Lecture upon faith, that I have
							no time now to give continuous attention to any thing else— Charles and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent the Evening

							Steam-packets from Liverpool to Halifax and Boston; arrived at the wharf
							East-Boston last Saturday Morning, having left Liverpool on the 19<hi

							from our excursion— The Acadia had arrived at Liverpool on Sunday the
								13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> at Midnight, the day of our
							arrival at Houlton— It is scarcely possible for me to realize the
							rapidity with which these Steamers accomplish the passage across the
							Atlantic— I chanced to be reading <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my
								mother’s</persRef> journalizing Letter to my <persRef
								ref="cranch-mary2">Aunt Cranch</persRef>, of her voyage from Boston
							to Deal in June and July 1784. fifty six years bygone an excellent

							performed their voyages in an average of 13 days, touching at Halifax
							both coming and going.— <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey
								Field</persRef> was here this morning, and spent with me two or

							an autograph of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>; and I
							promised to look up and send her one— Charles went to Boston, and

						<p>While we were at breakfast this morning, I was called out by two young

								>Bannister</persRef> and <persRef ref="moore-jonathan">Moore</persRef>— They
							wished to see the Library given by <persRef ref="adams-john">my

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore said that he was a lawyer, and might
							wish occasionally to consult the books in the Library. He had heard that
							it was open for the use of the Inhabitants of the town. I told him that
							it was so, and that if he wished to come and consult the books, I would
							have a table placed in the chamber for his convenience— I had heard that
							this young man had recently come to this town to practice the law, for
							which <persRef ref="gourgas-john">John M. Gourgas</persRef> appears
							already more than enough— The next visitors were <persRef
								ref="thatcher-ebenezer">judge Thacher</persRef> from the State of
							Maine, and <persRef ref="knox-lucy2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Thatcher</persRef>, a daughter of the revolutionary <persRef

								ref="swan-caroline">daughter</persRef> is at present the wife of
								<persRef ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Holmes</persRef>— Judge Thacher spoke to me of a claim of the
							children of General Knox, for 1100 acres of land under a resolve of the
							old continental Congress for his service in the revolutionary War. He
							did not know whether the General had ever received the land or not, and
							enquired if I thought the information could be obtained at Washington— I
							supposed it might, at the general Land Office, and offered to make
							enquiries when I should go on to Washington as I propose next Month— He
							promised to write me a statement of the claim, and of the particular
							information desired, of which I take note to be remembered at the proper
							time He said it was reported in Maine that the present Legislature of
							the State, now in Session had it in contemplation to take the choice of
							electors for the ensuing presidential election from the people, and to
							choose them themselves, which I can scarcely credit— <persRef

							here of course.— My excursion into the woods cut short my journal for
							the day, but I did not intermit the portion of writing on the Lecture
							upon Faith— Yesterday Morning I waked up not knowing the hour, and upon
							lighting my lamp, and coming into my chamber found it was two O’Clock—

								>Brownson’s</persRef> defence of his Article upon the labouring
							classes, and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my mother’s</persRef> Letters,
							occupying my reading time for the present— Brownson covers his attack
							upon religion—by pointing it against the priests—under which
							denomination he includes all regularly settled clergymen— He professes
							the Quaker creed, and greatly admires their meetings of silent
							meditation— But his greatest of all abhorrencies is poverty, as a remedy
							for which he proposes to abolish all hereditary property— Men are to
							dispose of their property at their pleasure while they live, but when
							they die it is to revert to the community— This he deduces as an
							irresistible consequence from the natural equality of men, and from the
							principles of Democracy. Brownson has a petty Office, given him by the
							Collector of the customs at Boston <persRef ref="bancroft-george">George
								Bancroft</persRef>, whom he accordingly bedaubs with fulsome
							flattery— The drift of all his discourse is to inflame the passions of
							the poor, against the rich, and as <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren’s</persRef> policy must be to sustain the institution of
							Slavery, Brownson stoutly affirms that Slavery is better than the system
							of free labour.— Some of his opinions are so odious that the leaders of
							his party dare not endorse them—they complain that he has brought them
							out too soon— He replies to this objection by repeating the doctrines,
							and blustering about his Independence—</p>

						<p>The last four days have been so warm, that I have had no fire in my
							library; but I was obliged to come to it again this afternoon. <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston this morning,
							and returned to dine— He and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles7;adams-john17">two
								elder Sons</persRef>, dined with us, and <persRef ref="lunt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>, who told us that
								<persRef ref="whitney-george2;whitney-augustus">George and Augustus
								Whitney</persRef>, had prevailed upon the Sexton of the Stone
							Meeting house to open the tomb in our grave-yard, where all the past
							Ministers of the church lie buried— That a parcel of bones was all that
							they found there except a small piece of wood, the remnant of <persRef
								ref="wibird-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wibird’s</persRef> coffin, and a tinplate— That his skull was
							entire—that George Whitney took it out of the vault, and expressed some
							desire to carry it away.— The whole procedure struck us, as neither very
							regular, nor very delicate— Charles and his wife did not stay to tea,
							but came in afterwards and passed the remainder of the Evening here— I
							was occupied nearly the whole day in endeavouring to retrieve the lost
							time of yesterday—without success— I got through the reading of <persRef
								ref="brownson-orestes">Brownson’s</persRef> defence, and incline to
							prepare a Lecture upon Democracy. I am drawing near to the close of that
							which I am now writing. It will be as long as I could have desired, but
							is altogether unsatisfactory to me, and I fear likely to be not less
							unsatisfactory to the hearers. I have not been able to gather into it
							all that I wished to say on the subject; nor to methodize it into a
							regular dissertation— The two main positions which I wish to establish,
							are truths infinitely important to religion and morals. 1. That
							religious faith, and moral faith are one and the same principle and 2
							That religious faith is dependent upon the will— The great fault of the
							subject is that it is Dry as dust, and I fear will prove as tedious as a
							dull Sermon, while it must be as long as three. The part which I have
							failed to work into the composition is the successive enumeration of the
								<hi rend="italic">Covenants</hi> of God with man, recorded
							throughout the Bible, and an impressive series of illustrations of the
							transcendent importance of faith as a rule of morals.— I ought to write
							this Lecture over again, or another on the same subject— <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">My mother’s</persRef> Letters continue deeply to
							affect me, as I read them; about half a dozen a day.— They bring back to
							my recollection so many scenes that I passed through, and which were
							almost obliterated from my memory, so many persons, with whom I was
							acquainted, and some of whom were my dear friends, and above all so many
							tokens of tenderness and affection more that maternal, which she heaped
							upon me throughout her life, that I can scarcely touch the book, without
							falling back into childhood— The merit of the Letters as literary
							compositions, though always known to me, never struck me so forcibly as
							in this collection. Very favourable notice of them has been taken in the
							North-American Review, the Boston Daily Advertiser, and this day in the
							Courier.— The Bookseller told Charles this day, that about half the
							edition of 1000 copies has already been sold.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="french-jonathan">Jonathan French</persRef> some time my

								<persRef ref="adams-elijah">Elijah Adams</persRef> of Medfield,
							which I shewed him— He said that Gillets son wanted to make out a
							similar table of his own family; but I imagine that the teacher wanted
							it as much as the pupil. This passion for genealogy, seems to be
							anti-democratic, but it is deeply seated in human nature— I feel it
							intensely myself, and often regret that the <persRef
								ref="adams-henry;adams-henry2">first and second Henry
								Adams</persRef>, left no memorial of their emigration from England,
							whence they came and when—and what relatives they left in England.— Of
							the <persRef ref="adams-joseph3;adams-joseph2">first and second Joseph
								Adams</persRef>, the birth, marriages and death are recorded on the
							parish or town books: the copies of their Will, and town records contain
							a few very scanty notices of incidents in their lives, but not a book or

							He was a Selectman of the town, and Deacon of the Church, but his

							much like that of the brothers <persRef

							kindling at the lamp of that call made my father a scholar, a lawyer, a
							patriot, a Statesman and one of the prime founders of the greatest
							republics that ever honoured the race of Man. That father, a mother
							worthy of such a husband, Harvard College, Leyden University, seven

							common-place personage, par negotiis nec supra—just able to sustain the

							leaving nothing behind me worthy of being remembered in after ages.—
							Having lived with unceasing aspirations for unfading glory as a

						<p>Morning Sermon from <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> Ezekiel 1.28.— “This was the appearance
							of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon
							my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.” He had read the whole
							first chapter of Ezekiel, and had given out the 100<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm, and the beautiful hymn of
								<persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts</persRef>, the 61<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of <persRef ref="belknap-daniel"
								>Belknap’s</persRef> collection— The Sermon was an admirable
							exposition of the vision, with the narrative of which the prophet
							introduces his Message from the Lord.— He noticed the time and place of
							the vision—the fifth day, month and year, by the river Chebar in the
							land of the Chaldeans— The whirlwind from the North, the living
							creatures with their four faces of a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle—the
							wheel within the middle of the wheel—the firmament over the living
							creature,—the noise of the wings like the noise of great waters—the
							throne above the wheels, and the likeness of a man upon the throne— The
							allegorical meaning of all this was explained with great ingenuity, and
							how it all concurred to form the likeness of the glory of the Lord— The
							connection between this Book, and the Apocalypse of the New Testament
							was not alluded to, nor the supposed designation of the four evangelists
								<persRef ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef>, <persRef ref="mark"
								>Mark</persRef>, <persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="john">John</persRef>— The remarks upon the temper of mind
							suited to the discharge of the duties of the prophetical office were
							impressive and their application to the prophetical functions of the
							Christian ministry of modern times, though not directly made were
							sufficiently perceptible in the tenour of the discourse— The afternoon
							text was from Acts 17:11. “These were more noble than those in
							Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind,
							and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so”— The
							comparison between the Thessalonians and the Bereans, with regard to the
							reception of the gospel, is more of a common topic for a sermon, than
							the vision of Ezekiel— There can be no novelty in the discussion, but
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt always commands the attention of
							his auditory, and always gives them matter for useful meditation. He
							read this afternoon a notification that the annual convention of the
							friends of education in Norfolk County would be holden in this first
							Congregational Church, next Wednesday at ten O’Clock in the forenoon—
							That an Address would be delivered by the Honourable <persRef
								ref="mann-horace">Horace Mann</persRef>, the Secretary to the Board
							of Education, and that several interesting questions would be discussed
							in relation to the best modes of governing and examining schools. All
							interested, as well ladies as gentlemen were requested to be present,
							especially School Committees and teachers—and friends of the cause from
							other parts of the State— The Norfolk County Association for the
							improvement of Common Schools are to hold their meeting at the same time
							and place, and a full attendance is desired— <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>
							came out from Boston; dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>, went to meeting with me this afternoon, and spent the
							remainder of the day and evening with us— He brought us the Boston and
							other Newspapers, which give favourable accounts of recent elections
							held in the States of Delaware and Maryland— The prospects at present
							are that <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren’s</persRef>
							Administration will terminate on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
							March next, and that <persRef ref="harrison-william">William Henry
								Harrison</persRef> of Ohio, will succeed him as President of the
							United States— Quod felix faustumque sit— I have not yet dared to
							indulge myself with the hope.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> was here this

								>th.</hi> of last Month— We left for after arrangement to which I
							must not fail to attend, the parish tax upon the Mount Wollaston farm,
							and the releasing of the farm, from and after the 31<hi

							this forenoon, and <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Loring</persRef> of Hingham after dinner.— He told me
							that the administration party of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							congressional District had held their Meeting yesterday, and had
							nominated <persRef ref="jackson-william3">Morton Jackson</persRef> as
							their Candidate for the next Congress, and he seemed apprehensive that
							the abolitionists of the District would also vote for him, and he was
							evidently more uneasy for the result than he was willing to acknowledge—
							The aggregate vote of the 24 towns in the District, last year was a
							majority for <persRef ref="morton-marcus">Governor Morton</persRef>,
							although the abolitionists voted for <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef>. The abolitionists
							this year have nominated <persRef ref="sprague-seth2">Seth Sprague
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> but he is absent in
							Europe, and Loring thinks they will vote for Jackson; a fiery
							abolitionist. He said that <persRef ref="may-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> May</persRef> of Scituate was friendly
							to me, and wished to see and converse with me, upon the subject— That he
							had been sore upon my declaration against the immediate abolition of
							Slavery in the District of Columbia, but that he was disposed overlook
							that on a pledge from me in favour of a prohibition of the Slave trade
							in the District— I told him I should be glad to see and converse with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> May; but I gave no encouragement to
							the idea, of calling upon me for a pledge— The whigs of the District are
							to hold their Convention at Plympton to-morrow. It is probable, but not
							certain that they will nominate me. If they do, and the abolitionists
							vote for Jackson, he will carry the election against me— If they vote
							for Sprague there will be no choice.— There is not in the United States
							a District in which the issue is more uncertain, and my mind must be
							made up to bear the last stroke of dismission from the public service,
							by the total abandonment of the people— <persRef ref="miller-caroline"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edward Miller</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="harrod-mary2">Mary Harrod</persRef>, were also here—

							and <persRef ref="apthorp-sarah">Sarah Apthorp</persRef> called to visit
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; but she was

							Morton is four-score years of age, and retains a ruin of her former

								>Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned to dine; and sent me

						<p>Sun rose 6.11. Set 5:22 both clear.</p>
						<p>This day was taken away from my ordinary occupations, when I could ill
							afford to spare it. Just before ten this morning I called at <persRef
								ref="u">French’s</persRef> tavern, and enquired for <persRef
								ref="mann-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann</persRef> who
							was there— I found <persRef ref="pettes-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pettes</persRef> with him, and <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>— I
							invited them to dine with me— They were both engaged to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt, but he released them in my favour—
							The meeting of the Norfolk County Association friends of education and
							the Society for the improvement of common Schools, was exceedingly
							slender, certainly not amounting to one hundred persons including at
							least one half women.— Even of the Committee of Arrangements who had
							been appointed to rally a numerous meeting, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pettes was the only one present; <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cozzens</persRef> being out upon a
							journey; and <persRef ref="cleveland-ira">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ira Cleveland</persRef> detained by the necessity of attending a
							political Caucus— A Committee of 3. was appointed to report sundry
							Resolutions for the Convention to consider and they reported them, all
							apparently prepared by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann, and which
							were adopted after some discussion, and an amendment of the first
							resolution which left it much as it was— <persRef ref="barnard-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef> a Secretary of
							the board of Education in Connecticut made some very interesting remarks
							respecting the condition of the School houses in that State. Between 12
							and 1. they adjourned till 2. and ten of the company whom I invited came
							home and dined with me, together with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>— While we were at dinner <persRef ref="wright-elizur"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E Wright</persRef> came with a
							subscription paper for a translation of <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean"
								>La Fontaine’s</persRef> Fables with a Lithographic caricature print
							to each fable.— As I could not well attend to this gentleman now he
							promised to come again to-morrow. As we were returning to the Church
							after dinner, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard said he was charged
							with an invitation from a joint literary historical association at
							Hartford, and New-Haven, to deliver an introductory Lecture before them
							on my way to Washington. I promised an answer at an early day— These
							invitations multiply upon me, most oppressively— The afternoon meeting
							was rather more thinly attended than that of the morning— The Officers
							of the Association were re-elected for the ensuing year and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann delivered his address; occupying
							nearly two hours, though he appeared to read not more than half what was
							written— A truly eloquent discourse upon the duties of Parents in the
							education of their children— The Convention adjourned at 5. O’Clock—
							Returning home I stop’d at Charles’s house and saw the Sun set. <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Josiah Quincy
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and <persRef
								ref="quincy-mary2">his wife</persRef> were there, and took tea. They

							the plan of the woodlot which we surveyed last Thursday, and for which I

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wright</persRef> came again with his
							subscription paper, for his translation of the Fables of <persRef
								ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaine</persRef>— There are to be three

							of those in the little volume he had left with me, and thought them very
							flat—much more so than the translations of several of the same fables
							that I had myself made,—a circumstance which doubtless biassed my
							judgment— I declined subscribing for the book— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wright told me that he had been a Secretary of an
							Anti-Slavery Society; but that has now become a very unprofitable

							Letter of Introduction from <persRef ref="trumbull-joseph">M<hi

							invite me to deliver a Lecture, before the young men’s Institute; the
							same which had been mentioned to me yesterday by <persRef
								ref="barnard-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Barnard</persRef>.— I told him that being uncertain when I shall proceed
							to Washington and whether I can take my way through Hartford, or not, I
							could not give him a definitive answer now, but would write to him in
							the course of a few days. <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi

							this afternoon, and returned one volume and took out another of <persRef
								ref="muratori-lodovico">Muratori’s</persRef> Annals of Italy from
							the town Library.— He told me that the whig convention, for the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District had their meeting
							at Plympton— That the meeting was numerous, and had unanimously
							nominated me for re-election to the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congress— That the Delegates from Quincy had been instructed to urge the
							nomination of me, but had no occasion to produce their instructions—
							That no other person was named or thought of— That there were several
							abolitionists among the delegates, but they all concurred with the rest—
							He said <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rowe</persRef>
							had been appointed a delegate from Milton to this Convention, but had
							mistaken the day, supposing it was this day, and had thus not attended
							yesterday; but that he would have voted with the rest.— I went this

							and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="forbes-margaret">his wife</persRef> to Milton to visit M<hi

							the printed volume of <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my mothers</persRef>
							Letters— They fill a duo decimo volume of 500 pages; and three volumes
							more might be published of those which she wrote, scarcely less

							at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> tavern, where he requested me to
							call and claim it— I went accordingly, and it was delivered to me by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French’s <persRef ref="u"
								>Son</persRef>.— It is an octavo volume of nearly 500 pages— At the
							Stone Bank where I called to make a deposit and draw 100 dollars by a
							check I found an Atlas extra with later and more favorable reports of
							the election in Pennsylvania than those received yesterday.— The
							election of <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef> to Congress, by a majority of more than 1600
							votes, in the third District, was a heavy damper to the exultation of
							the whigs, for it shews the public opinion has definitively settled down
							in the district, against the validity of <persRef ref="naylor-charles"
								>Naylor’s</persRef> election in1838. But the Atlas shouts Io
							triumphe for New-Jersey, where it boasts that the whole ticket of the
							whigs rejected last winter, has now been elected to the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress— This is five times in number,
							and 500 times in principle, an equivalent for the loss of the third
							District in Pennsylvania— Naylor had sometime since declined standing as
							a candidate for re-election, which had cast ominous conjecture on the
							whole success. <persRef ref="newhall-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John B. Newhall</persRef> now of the territory of Iowa,

							Burlington, the principal settlement in Iowa, where he says there is now
							a population of 1500 Souls.— He gave me a crooked stick which he said
							was cut off from the spot where had stood the wigwam of <persRef
								ref="blackhawk">Black Hawk</persRef>, and he shewed me a beautiful
							map drawn by himself of the territory of Iowa, shewing that he has no
							lack of talent.— He left me at Noon to return by the Plymouth Stage to

								James H. Foster</persRef> were also here before dinner, and <persRef

							I am making steady, but very indifferent progress in the composition of

							Lincoln, that I had felt myself under a peculiar obligation to abstain
							from attendance at all the public meetings which had been held in the

							Presidential Election— That a sense of propriety, had heretofore
							prescribed it as a rule to all Ex-Presidents of the United States, to
							abstain from all interference in the election of their Successors; and
							although the last President, <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> had departed from that rule, as the present
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President Van-Buren</persRef> has
							departed from another rule forbidding any candidate for the Presidency
							to canvass for himself, disapproving of these practices; I am unwilling
							to give countenance to them by following the example— That besides this
							any active electioneering on my part would be liable to the imputation
							of personal envy, resentment or revenge, and to the further interested
							motive of seeking to promote my own re-election to Congress. I had
							therefore refrained during this recess of Congress even from addressing
							my Constituents by Letter as I had repeatedly done before. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln intimated a wish that I should
							allude in my written answer to the Committee to these reasons for my
							silence, which I promised to do.— After dinner <persRef

							far as it can be sustained.— The necessity cannot be demonstrated any
							otherwise than by inference from the fact— It was necessary because it
							was the will of God—for independent of that what necessity was there for
							miracles then, any more than now— Miracles, exhibited now, would
							propagate the gospel more effectively than any merely uninspired
							preaching.— And we see not why the Christian system of religion and
							morals could not have made its way by its internal evidence then as well
							as now. The truth is that at this day, the history, is the chief
							obstacle to the belief in the doctrines— There is great difficulty to
							believe the Miracles— The religious and moral instructions are all
							surpassing beauty— And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt dilated with
							admirable eloquence upon the miracles achieved by Christianity upon the
							hearts and upon the conduct of mankind— This is a perpetual miracle and
							an inexhaustible theme. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt dined with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>; as did <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>. The afternoon text, following
							a prayer by <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef>, was from Matthew 22.30. [“]For in the
							resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as
							the Angels of God in Heaven”— This was the answer to a captious question
							from the Sadducees who disbelieved a future state. They enquired which
							of seven husband that a woman had married successively on earth would be
							her husband in Heaven. The answer is that the relation of husband and
							wife will not be continued in the future world—whence it follows that
							there will be no relation of parent and child there. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt speculated ingeniously, and feelingly
							upon the possibilities of our future state of existence; but there is
							little satisfaction in anticipations founded upon mere conjecture.— The
							resurrection of the dead to reward or punishment is a cheering promise
							and a tremendous commination, but what the reward or the punishment will
							be is veiled in impenetrable darkness— As there is no marriage, there
							can be no distinction of sexes; and though <persRef ref="milton-john"
								>Milton</persRef> says that Spirits can assume either sex at
							pleasure he had no warrant for the assertion, and knew no more about it
							than one of us.— There is no reason to believe that the Angels or
							Spirits of the just made perfect possess in Heaven the power of
							reproduction; or that they multiply otherwise than by recruits from
							Earth. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s visions are pleasant—but I
							cannot take them for promises. Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>his wife</persRef> spent the Evening with us.</p>

							a system of Universal Geography with very few maps, and those on so

							a fashion of modern printing which may be, or might be made instructive—
							I declined subscribing for, or taking the book, the price of which was 7
							dollars, and I supposed to be worth 3. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goodrich himself called on me this afternoon, and in the Evening
							delivered an Address of an hour and three quarters before the whig
							Association of Quincy, at the town Hall— He told me what had entirely
							escaped my Memory that about 15 years since he went to Europe, that he
							visited me at Washington with an introductory Letter from his uncle
								<persRef ref="goodrich-chauncey">Chauncey Goodrich</persRef> with
							whom more than thirty years I had sitten in the Senate of the United
							States. I have only an indistinct recollection of having received such a
							Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chauncey Goodrich— I went to
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house at their
							teatime, and met there <persRef ref="sampson-rachel">Miss
								Sampson</persRef> the seamstress— Charles went with me to the town
							Hall, where we were much amused with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goodrich’s Address— A species of Oratory which he possesses in an
							eminent degree— Free, fluent, familiar he mingles up desultory argument
							with frequent droll, laughable stories, exactly suited to the taste of
							his auditory. He was continually cheered by shouts of laughter and
							clapping of hands.— The Hall was crowded to over-flowing— His topics
							were the anti-tariff and anti-bank, and anti-currency policy of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin</persRef> of Kinderhoek, and most
							especially upon the great plea for the subtreasury that it will reduce
							the working man’s wages.— As soon as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goodrich closed his Address, <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham</persRef> read a notification,
							that next Friday Evening <persRef ref="hill-isaac">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac Hill</persRef> of New-Hampshire
							would deliver an Address to the Democratic Association of Quincy— The
							political excitement is so great that scarcely an evening passes without
							a political Address; and the parties take the nights alternately— It has
							opened a new school of Oratory, which I fear will not deserve the name
							of a school of eloquence— After returning home I answered the Letter of
							notification of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="lincoln-solomon">Lincoln</persRef>, Brigham and <persRef
								ref="richards-joseph">Richards</persRef> the Committee of the whig
							Convention of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional

							to fill the daily record of my existence, and two pages of preparation
							for a Lecture— I am so hurried with that upon which I am now engaged
							that the composition will be the worst that I ever delivered.</p>

						<p>I am hurried and worried with invitations to deliver lectures, till I
							know not what to do, and neglect business which ought to be
							indispensable— One of its consequences is that it sets my mind to
							wandering in search of subjects to make a variety and scatters my
							thoughts from those on which I have undertaken to discourse— I am
							drawing towards the close of the second of those which I am preparing
							for the present Season—and they are both too grave and dry— I rack my
							brain for one which will be amusing— This requires wit and humour of
							which I am lamentably destitute; and reflection whispers that the
							attempt to make others laugh recoils upon him who makes the experiment,
							and raises the smile at himself, when he is too heavy to carry the
							hearer with him— A very serious danger is that of ruining my Style by
							over hasty composition. <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General
								Dearborn</persRef>, and <persRef ref="sprague-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph E. Sprague</persRef> of Salem

							Sprague with an urgent invitation to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum
							which I now agreed to do on Wednesday the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of November. I had much conversation with these Gentlemen,
							on the recent news from Europe, and the prospect of a general War.— The
							Acadia arrived at Boston last Saturday Morning, having left Liverpool on
							Sunday the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month; and been
							detained 10 hours at Halifax— From the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>

							days both included, in which time this ship has completed both her
							voyages to and fro— This is marvellous in our eyes.— The prospects of
							War, are for the final dismemberment, and it is to be hoped extinction
							of the Ottoman Empire; and for breaking down the impenetrable barriers
							of the celestial empire of China— Here are two new doors opening wide
							for the extension of the power of man over the globe of earth— The
							prevailing opinion in Europe and here, yet is that there will be for the
							present no War, but there are strong indications of a kindling martial
							and mutually hostile spirit— The elections in the States of Pennsylvania
							and Ohio have just been held and the returns coming in daily keep up a
							constant excitement— There never has been so hotly contested an election
							and the result is yet extremely doubtful. My time was absorbed the whole
							of this afternoon from dinner till dark in searching for two papers,
							neither of which could I find— <persRef ref="sampson-rachel">Miss

							in 2. Volumes 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> Edinburgh 1750. with
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> name 1766. written
							with his own hand on the blank leaf before the title page; and the other
							one quarto Volume—London 1772. With his Letters and his trial in
							addition to his Discourses concerning Government— Looking into these
							books I found not only matter pertinent to my Lecture but leading into
							the temptation to write another Lecture exclusively concerning Sidney,
							his life and writings—but this absorbed a considerable part of the day.—
							There is a deep shade of melancholy hanging over the whole life of
							Sidney, whose opinions seem to have resembled in many respects those of
							<persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>.— The motto on his standard “Sanctus amor patriae dat
							animum”—the perseverance of his spirit—the harshness of <persRef ref="sidney-robert">his father</persRef>, who
							contrived to keep well with all the prevailing parties during the civil
							wars and at the restoration of the Stuarts resumed his seat in the house
							of peers and became a privy Councillor—the abandonment of him by all his
							relations, and friends—his long exile of 17 years before his pardon was
							obtained, and the horrible baseness and cruelty of his trial and
							execution sink the spirits to read.— This afternoon <persRef
								ref="green-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green</persRef> the
							editor of the Quincy Patriot, came with a message from <persRef
								ref="richards-lysander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lysander

							postpone till this day week the delivery of the Lecture which I had
							promised for this day, to which I readily assented, there being no
							prospect of an auditory in the foul weather of this Evening.— Charles
							spent it with us, but not his wife— I brought over also from the town
							library the report of the proceedings of the Convention of 1820 for
							amending the Constitution of this Commonwealth; but had not time to
							consult it this day. I read a few pages of the Correspondence,
							concerning the Affairs of China, reported last year to the British
							Parliament—</p>

							load of wood from the dead trees on the mount Wollaston farm— He spoke
							about his fence which he said he must remove if the Lease should not be

							would not give the same rent, on the renewal of the lease in the present

								ref="freeman-russell">Russel Freeman</persRef> was here this
							afternoon— He came from Sandwich on Tuesday, and now on horseback from
							Boston— He came to ask my advice about his prospect of recovering his
							place of Collector at New Bedford, from which <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef> removed him
							immediately after his inauguration as President in March 1829. He said
							he considered it as settled that <persRef ref="harrison-william">General
								Harrison</persRef> would be elected President—that the present
								<persRef ref="smith-robert">Collector Smith’s</persRef> commission
							will expire in January 1842. That all the respectable merchants at New
							Bedford are in favour of his restoration, but he believes <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clifford</persRef>, an
							influential whig would be glad to obtain the place for his father in
							Law— What would I advise him to do— I said, to wait— General Harrison
							was not yet elected— It was not certain that he would be— If he should
							be I thought it probable that <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> would be Secretary
							of the Treasury, in which case all the papers, which he Freeman had
							exhibited to the present <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary
								Woodbury</persRef>, would be on the files of the Department, and his
							prospects would be very fair. If <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> should be
							re-elected and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury should remain in
							the Treasury Department, there would be no chance for any application
							from him— He told me over again the story of his poverty and the gradual
							decay of the little property that he had: but he said he was much
							comforted by the advice and hope that I had given him— Good wishes are
							all that I have or shall have to bestow— I was buckled down to the table
							the whole day— I was hurried through <persRef ref="sidney-algernon"
								>Algernon Sidney</persRef> upon whom were it not that the theme is
							so melancholy I could occupy a month to great advantage. I took a short
							walk at Sunset, and plucked a few red wedge apples from the tree for
							seed— I finished my Letter to <persRef ref="dawson-henrietta">M<hi

							that I have; and that in flattering myself that I am yielding to the
							impulse of good nature and a hope to do good, I may only be giving way
							to egregious vanity, and a passion for applause— As far as I am able to
							judge of my own motives they are stimulated by the desire of performing
							my duty as a citizen and a man, and sharpened with an excessive anxiety
							to give pleasure and profit to those who invite me, and to obtain their
							approbation, perhaps their applause— There came again this afternoon
								<persRef ref="warrenn-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							between 6. and 7. O’Clock to take me over, and will send me back after

							dollars— He thought it would be best to publish the splendid edition by
							subscription first, and the cheap edition afterwards— We conversed much
							upon abolition and anti-slavery Societies, about which, and their
							dissensions I gave him very freely my opinions— I told him that many of

							instanced the ferocious attacks of <persRef ref="garrison-william"
								>Garrison</persRef> upon him, and his <persRef ref="garrison-helen"
								>crack-brained woman</persRef>, no government, and non-resistance

							He charged Garrison with having wronged him in publishing a private and
							confidential Letter which he Wright had written, but spoke of him with
							much reserve, and said the cause of abolition would prosper and triumph,

						<p><persRef ref="stearns-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stearns</persRef> of Hingham preached morning and afternoon from
							Ephesians 6.13. [“]Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that
							ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
							stand.” Fortitude against evil by the weapons of religion— This Epistle
							was written from Rome, when <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> was there
							in prison—written to cheer and encourage the church of Ephesus under the
							persecution which he and they were enduring— In this and the preceding
							chapter he has been urging upon them the system of Christian morals in
							contrast with their moral condition before they had been converted to
							faith in Christ— The whole epistle is a summary of Christian doctrine
							and ethics— He declares himself an Ambassador commissioned by God to
							unfold to them the <hi rend="italic">mystery</hi>, of the admission of
							the whole heathen world to the blessings which had in preceding ages
							been confined to the chosen people of God. He then exhorts them to the
							practise of all the virtues—of Temperance, Prudence—Benevolence—to
							observe the relative duties of husbands and wives of Parents and
							children, of Masters and Servants, and lastly he summons them to <hi
								rend="italic">Fortitude</hi>, to fervent prayer, to vigilance, and
							calls on them with reiterated solemnity to put on the whole armour of
							God, to stand against the wiles of the devil—a spiritual and defensive
							warfare, not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and
							powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
							spiritual wickedness in high places. This militant figure of speech is
							beautifully carried through in detail. The combatant must have his loins
							girt about with truth—he must have the breastplate, the greaves, the
							shield, the helmet, all defensive weapons, and lastly the Sword of the
							Spirit, which is the word of God. It is apparent that all this is
							especially applicable to the time when the Epistle was written, to the
							state and condition of the writer himself and to the Church of Ephesus
							to which it was addressed. Heathens converted to Christianity. This
							consideration should never be left out of sight in applying the precepts
							of Scripture to the present times. Christianity is still a spiritual
							warfare— Its powerful and inveterate enemies now are not the Jews and
							Heathen-Romans, but Infidels, and Profligates— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Stearns’s sermon took a different view of his text; and
							considered the Christian Fortitude enjoined in the text as bearing only
							on the ordinary evils incident to human nature. He dined with us; the
							weather was chilly and raw, portending snow. Charles and his wife spent
							the Evening here: but I was absorbed in the perusal of the voluminous
							Report to the British Parliament of the Correspondence relating to
							China. Not having time to read it deliberately through, and having
							undertaken to review it in a Lecture, I am compelled to skim it over,
							and I fastened upon it this Evening and glanced at the whole
							correspondence to the end, till it was near two O’Clock in the morning
							when I retired thoroughly chilled to bed.</p>

						<p><date>26. VI: </date>Monday</p>
						<p>When I went to bed this morning, a storm of hail was pattering on my
							windows— I dozed rather than slept through the Night. I was upwards of
							an hour recovering from the chill with which I went to bed. About 3. in
							the morning I was awaked by a tremendous long reverberating thunder
							clap, soon after followed by another— Rising by broad daylight, and
							looking out of my library windows, the whole surface of the ground as
							far as sight could range was covered with snow, like Lapland in January,
							and the snow continued to fall with intermission till near noon.—
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> had intended to go
							to Boston, but postponed his visit there till Wednesday— In the
							intenseness of my desire to make progress with my review of the
							parliamentary document concerning China I lost the day for the diary and
							it went in arrear— I got entangled with <persRef ref="vattel-emer"
								>Vattel</persRef>, and <persRef ref="derayneval-mathias"
								>Rayneval</persRef> upon the Freedom of the Seas; and <persRef
								ref="bell-john3">Bell’s</persRef> account of the Russian embassy to
							China in 1719. and th account of <persRef ref="macartney-george">Lord
								Macartney’s</persRef> embassy in 1792. in <persRef
								ref="mavor-william">Mavor’s</persRef> collection of Voyages and
							travels, and <persRef ref="selden-john">Selden’s</persRef> Hebrew Law of
							Nature and Nations; but above all the Newspapers swallowed up the
							daylight, till the dusk, when I went up the hill, and spent an hour at
							Charles’s, after which he and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> from 8 to 9 in the Evening were here— I was worn out
							with multitude of occupation and by 10. retired to bed— The Newspapers
							are full of the charges of conspiracy of frauds to carry the
							presidential election, bandied between the two parties at New-York— In
							these frauds, <persRef ref="seward-william">Governor Seward</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="grinnell-moses">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grinnell</persRef> the member of Congress, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wetmore</persRef> of New-York,
								<persRef ref="swift-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Swift</persRef>, now Mayor of Philadelphia, on one side, and
								<persRef ref="butler-benjamin">Benjamin F. Butler</persRef>,
							ex-Attorney-General, of the United States, now District Attorney for the
							Southern District of New-York, <persRef ref="hoyt-jesse">Jesse
								Hoyt</persRef>, collector of the customs at that Port, and a man
							named <persRef ref="edmonds-john">Edmonds</persRef>, with many others on
							both sides are deeply implicated. The explosion began by a clandestine
							examination before a party judge of a criminal court in New-York, of two
							worthless characters, named <persRef ref="u">Stevenson</persRef>, upon
							hearsay from the other named <persRef ref="ghentworth-james"
								>Ghentworth</persRef>, charging these distinguished members of the
							whig party with having imported from Philadelphia in 1838 men to vote
							and who did vote at the Election in New-York. The tables are now turned,
							and Ghentworth upon whose expected testimony the whole charge of whig
							fraud and bribery rested, has made an affidavit, charging Butler and
							Hoyt, and Edmonds with attempting to bribe him with promises of money
							and office to accuse Governor Seward, and the whig leaders with these
							frauds.— This mutual crimination and recrimination is exasperating the
							parties against each other to such a degree, that there is imminent
							danger both of fraud and violence at the approaching Presidential
							Election, which will terminate no otherwise than in civil War and a
							dissolution of the Union.</p>

								Loring</persRef> of Boston, and <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">M<hi

							called on me this morning, and earnestly intreated of me to assume as

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> of Connecticut, the
							defence of the Africans captured in the Amistad, before the Supreme
							Court of the United States at Washington, at their next January term— I
							endeavoured to excuse myself upon the plea of my age and inefficiency—of
							the oppressive burden of my duties as a member of the House of
							Representatives, and my inexperience after a lapse of more than thirty
							years, in the forms, and technicals of argument, before judicial
							tribunals, and said I would cheerfully do, what I had heretofore offered
							that is give any assistance of Counsel and Advice to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin, and any other person charged with
							the argument before the Court— But they urged me so much and represented
							the case of those unfortunate men as so critical, it being a case of
							life and death, that I yielded, and told them that, if by the blessing
							of God my health and strength should permit, I would argue the case
							before the Supreme Court; and I implore the mercy of Almighty God, to
							controul my temper, to enlighten my Soul and to give me utterance that I
							may prove myself in every respect equal to the task— They promised that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin would furnish me with a
							complete brief and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan left with me
							two scrap books, containing in slips from the Newspapers all the
							publications relating to the trials from the time of the capture by
								<persRef ref="gedney-thomas">Lieutenant Gedney</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							came to take leave of us previous to our departure for Washington—
								<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> came afterwards— He is about to compile a new
							Hymn-book, for the use of the Church and Society here, and he asked me
							for the loan of my version of the Psalms with liberty to select any of
							them for publication in his book, to which I agreed, but could not find
							my manuscript. I promised to look it up, and bring or send it to him— I
							lent him <persRef ref="goode-william">Goode’s</persRef> version of the
							Psalms— We dined at 1. and immediately after dinner, I went with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John

								ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.

							Quincy at the dusk of Evening.— I went to <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house, where I saw <persRef ref="adams-louisa3"
								>Catherine</persRef>— Then to <persRef ref="otis-mary">M<hi

								<persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>; but she was

								ref="dexter-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Samuel
								Dexter’s</persRef>, and found her confined to her house with
							Lumbago. She seemed however cheerful, and is always intelligent— I then
							found the Warren Street chapel—went and spent an hour with <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef>— Then at 7. to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Foster’s, but he was gone. <persRef ref="foster-charles3">Charles
								Foster</persRef> went with me to the Chapel where I delivered my
							Lecture upon Faith, from half past 7. to 9.— Then returned to Quincy in
							a Hack provided for me, by the Committee of the Association— Home at

								Bowditch</persRef> asked if I should be willing to give the

							but <persRef ref="barnard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef> promised to send him word, that I had previously

							some conversation with me about my farm, and a house and lot bordering
							on the Quincy Canal which Field wishes to sell— He returned last evening
							from a trip to Bangor to make a purchase of lumber, and brought back my
							Umbrella, which had been left on board the Steamer Bangor, when we
							landed in the Night at Portland. The Deacon spoke about making sale of
							the wood on the lot which we surveyed on the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this Month—but I referred him for all my business here
							to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, who went this morning

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Minott Thayer</persRef> was here with
							a young man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Ides</persRef>.— My Son
							delivered a Lecture last Evening, to the whigs at Braintree, with which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer was highly delighted. He
							promised to send me the 50 copies of my address of last year delivered
							before the Inhabitants of Braintree at <persRef ref="storrs-richard"

						<p>I began the day this morning with the record of yesterday which I
							finished before breakfast— I then resumed my Chinese Lecture, and from
							the multiplication of matters for discussion in treating it, found that
							it cannot be properly considered in the compass of one Lecture; and made
							still more clearly the discovery of my own incompetency to discourse
							upon the subject at-all— And yet having undertaken it I must go through—
							The very first principles of the Laws of Nations are involved in the
							controversy, and the accredited writers, especially <persRef
								ref="vattel-emer">Vattel</persRef>, rather offuscate than clarify
							the investigation— The History of China, and especially of the
							twenty-second of Tsing dynasty now occupying the throne, gives occasion
							for earnest enquiry, which I have not yet found the means to satisfy. I
							have thumbed over Vattel and <persRef ref="ward-robert">Ward</persRef>,
							and found sundry questions for debate. The <persRef
								ref="raynal-guillaume">Abbé Raynal’s</persRef> Philosophical and
							political history of the European Establishments in the two Indies has
							an article concerning the origin of the Portuguese Settlement at Macao
							and a summary of the history of China, absolutely romantic— There was a
							fashion at the time when the Abbé wrote, among the philosophical French
							writers of extolling the Governments of all other Nations over that of
							France.— He himself was ultra-republican in all his opinions, and
							declamatory in his manner of presenting them; and yet he puffs up the
							Chinese government as if it were a model of perfection. The most
							absolute despotism upon earth, rotten with the filthiest corruptions
							affecting to look down with scorn upon all other Nations, one would
							suppose from his narritive the very model of perfection— It is
							impossible it shoul be true— A general description of China, translated
							from the French of the <persRef ref="grosier-jean">Abbe
								Grosier</persRef> 1788 from which I have been unable to collect
							nothing of any value— An abstract in <persRef ref="mavor-william"
								>Mavors</persRef> collection of voyages from the writings of the
								<persRef ref="lecomte-louis">Jesuité Le Comte</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="duhalde-jean">Du Halde</persRef>; not more profitable; and

							account of <persRef ref="macartney-george">Lord Macartney’s</persRef>
							Embassy to China in 1792, which I had not even time to skim— There was

							with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> and <persRef

							<persRef ref="spear-harriet">Harriet Spear</persRef> who has <persRef

							letter to the <persRef ref="paulding-james">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef> soliciting his discharge, and to send her Letter to
							me, promising to forward it, with an additional recommendation of my
							own— I have accordingly received her Letter, and this day, wrote to the

								ref="moore-nelson">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nelson
								Moore</persRef>, at Waltham; offering to deliver a Lecture there
							Saturday Evening of next week— At the dusk of evening I walked over the

							investigations for my Chinese Lecture, and deeply regret that I have not
							another month to examine, and discuss the whole subject— I am now on a
							critical analysis of the three first principles of the Law of Nations,
							laid down, by <persRef ref="vattel-emer">Vattel</persRef>, and shewing
							their inconsistency with each other.— I am looking also for Chinese
							history, and especially for the succession of Emperors of the Mantchoo
							Tartar or Tsing Dynasty being the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> I
							find in the great Work of <persRef ref="duhalde-jean">Du Halde</persRef>
							that Tsong-te ascended the throne by conquest in 1644—but died

							years till 1722—then his son <persRef ref="yongzheng"
								>Yong-tching</persRef> 13 years till 1735. the reigning Emperor when
							Du Halde’s work was published.—Then came <persRef ref="qianlong"
								>Kien-Long</persRef>—another reign of 61. years till 1796. when he
							abdicated in favour of his Son <persRef ref="jiaqing"
							>Kia-king</persRef>— Kien-Long died in 1799 and Kia-King reigned till
							1820. when the present <persRef ref="daoguang">Emperor</persRef>
							succeeded— The newspapers still teem with the New-York plot and
							counterplot; the basest part of which is the tampering of the U.S.

						<p><persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went this morning into
							Boston, with his family for the Winter— I was distracted with the
							settlement of monthly bills, and with arrangements for our departure
							next week for Washington. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> and family propose to go on Monday. I have to deliver
							Lectures next week at Charlestown, at Salem, at Waltham, and perhaps at
							Boston— And I propose to stay till after Monday the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next Month being the day of the
							Elections— I called at the Quincy Stone Bank, and took an assortment of
							Bills and specie for the expenses of my family’s journey to Washington—
							At the town Hall where the Selectmen gave me a minute of the particulars
							of my tax bill for the town and County.— The Selectmen, are <persRef
								ref="brown-charles2">Charles A. Brown</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cummings-charles">Charles A. Cummings</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="baxter-daniel">Daniel Baxter</persRef>— Cummings said he could
							not find the particular statement of my personal property, which my Son
							had given in— I called also at <persRef ref="gill-caleb">C.
								Gill’s</persRef> shop and paid his bill for book-binding— Met
								<persRef ref="green-john3">J. A. Green</persRef> in the Street, and
							requested him from this time to send my Quincy Patriot weekly to
							Washington— <persRef ref="carr-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carr</persRef> came with a subscription book for the whig
							Association reading room— I gave him a small contribution to purchase
							books for the room, but declined joining the association as a member
							having never been a member of any private political Society— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> dined and spent
							the Evening here. Her brother <persRef ref="adams-john3">John
								Quincy</persRef> came and escorted her home.— I received this
							morning a Letter from <persRef ref="johnston-charles2">Charles
								Johnston</persRef> member of Congress from Dutchess County New-York,
							inviting me to deliver a Lecture at Poughkeepsie— I have also received
							similar applications, from Schenectady in New-York, and from Springfield
							in this State— Also from the College at Brunswick, to deliver the ΦB.K—
							Oration there next Summer. I find it impossible even to answer all these
							Letters; and fear I shall be obliged even to leave my lecture upon China
							unfinished— I took up this day <persRef ref="staunton-george">Sir George
								Staunton’s</persRef> account of <persRef ref="macartney-george">Lord
								Macartney’s</persRef> Embassy, and found much matter of
							entertainment, and much to the purpose of my Lecture— The name of the
							present Emperor is <persRef ref="daoguang">Taou-Kwang</persRef> and he
							succeed <persRef ref="jiaqing">Kia-King</persRef> in 1820. This is
							therefore the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year of his reign—</p>
