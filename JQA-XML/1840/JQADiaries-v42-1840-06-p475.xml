						<p>The biennial election day for Mayor, Aldermen and common Councilmen of
							the City of Washington— <persRef ref="seaton-william">William W.
								Seaton</persRef> was elected Mayor in the place of <persRef
								ref="force-peter">Peter Force</persRef>, who has held the office
							four years.— I called this morning at the City Hall upon <persRef
								ref="rothwell-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew
								Rothwell</persRef> Treasurer of the Columbian College, to ask for
							payment of the years interest on their bond to me, this day payable. He
							said he had money; but was so much engaged in the city election that he
							could not attend to me this day; and I told him I would call again
							to-morrow.— At the House it was the day for offering regulations. But as
							soon as the Journal was read, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">C.
								Cushing</persRef> rose to a priviledged Question, and before he
							could state what it was, <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy
								Thompson</persRef>, acting chairman of the Military Committee moved
							a suspension of the rules, to take up a Bill for raising 1600 men for
							the defence of Florida: and he sent to the Clerk’s table a very urgent
							Letter from the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef>,
							and Advices from Florida of recent massacres by the Indians of our
							troops.— <persRef ref="downing-charles">Downing</persRef>, the delegate
							from the Territory, added his supplicating voice to that of Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thompson; but the democracy would not
							hear a word of it— The motion to suspend the rules was lost 118 to 94—
							Thompson then moved the suspension of the rules for this day—lost. 116
							to 85— <persRef ref="hunt-hiram">Hunt</persRef> moved a suspension for
							two hours—lost 111 to 98. <persRef ref="triplett-philip"
								>Triplet</persRef> moved a suspension of the rules to introduce his
							supplementary pre-emption bill. lost—72 to 121. Cushing finally moved
							his privileged question which was the reconsideration of the vote of
							Saturday, accepting <persRef ref="hillen-solomon">Hillen’s</persRef>
							report from the Committee of Commerce, which a majority of that
							Committee had reconsidered, and reversed— Cushing’s reason for moving
							the re-consideration was that he had found by the yeas and nays that it
							was a party vote— <persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef>
							moved the previous question <persRef ref="grinnell-moses"
								>Grinnell</persRef>, a call of the House— <persRef
								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> to lay the whole subject on
							the table—on each of which questions the yeas and nays were taken. The
							call of the house was refused—the motion to lay on the table
							rejected—the previous question carried; and the reconsideration refused
							84 to 108. And now came the recess— I rode home, dined and returned to
							the house— At 5 minutes past 4 there were more than 200 members present
							and debating <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton’s</persRef>
							motion, now offered by <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert
								Smith</persRef>— After a confused and riotous sitting this
							Resolution was carried and the reconsideration of it rejected— During
							the whole day, I was a silent, passive, humiliated, indignant, helpless,
							Spectator of the Scene.— I came home after voting for the last motion of
							reconsideration and while they were taking the yeas and nays— <persRef

								Vattemare</persRef> was here this morning with what he called a
							Runic Manuscript—consisting of about half a dozen slips of old pine
							wood, or cedar, 4 or 5 inches long 3 inches wide and half an inch thick,
							slung together by twine through gimblet holes at their sides, ruled with
							lines like those of written music, and traversed with fantastic pot
							hooks and trammels, seemingly traced by a sharp ten-penny nail, and
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vattemare assured me were perfectly
							identical with the figures on the Dighton rock— The resemblance appears
							to me imaginary. He thinks his manuscript at least 600 years old— He
							said he wished to give it to some Scientific public institution in this
							country, and asked my advice where to locate his treasure. I advised him
							to the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia— At the House to
							which <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Saltonstall</persRef> rode with me. <persRef ref="thompson-waddy"
								>Waddy Thompson</persRef> made another attempt to get up his army
							Bill of 1600 men to fight and be cut off the Indians in Florida; but he
							could not succeed— The morning hour was consumed in receiving a few
							reports from Committees, and postponing the motion to recommit the
							report of the Committee of Commerce on the Pilot Bill; and upon a snarl
							about an expected report for seven marine hospitals to be erected in the
							West, and a scuffle between Pittsburg and Wheeling for the location of
							one of these hospitals— The orders of the day arrested this discussion.—
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair— The sub-treasury
							Bill, and a two hours speech of <persRef ref="leet-isaac">Isaac

							were upwards of 200 members present; but as soon as Leet began, they
							began to evacuate the Hall—and in ten minutes there were about 50
							members left to hear him— When he finished <persRef ref="brockway-john"
								>John H. Brockway</persRef>, of Connecticut took the floor, and ten
							minutes after came the recess— I rode home and dined— <persRef
								ref="frothingham-thomas">Thomas B. Frothingham</persRef> dined with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— He is to leave

							followed in a panegyric upon the Bill, and an invective upon Banks; and
							especially the Banks of the United States, and <persRef

							<persRef ref="osborne-thomas">Osborne</persRef> of Connecticut took the floor— The Committee rose—the house

						<p>I enquired if they made no allowance of discount for payment in

							him to notify the board of Trustees that I should require payment of the
							principal in specie or its equivalent, which he said he would At the

							assurance or of fluency— But it was so insupportably destitute of
							original thought, and so redundant of commonplace party slang, that
							after wearing out my patience for an hour, it fairly drove me from the
							Hall, and I went into the Senate chamber.— There I heard the close of a
							Speech of <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, and the
							beginning of one of <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef>
							upon the Bankrupt bill, now before that body.— When I returned to the

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="raymond-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

							informed me settled in Allegany County Maryland— He was the author of a
							book upon political economy, once in some repute; but he appears not to
							take much interest in the subject now— I called at the Treasury
							Department at the Office of the first Auditor <persRef
								ref="miller-jesse">Jesse D. Miller</persRef>, with a Treasury Note
							for 1000 dollars which should have been paid the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month; but which the disability
							of my arm, and other avocations have delayed. I enquired at what rate of
							interest Treasury Notes were issued now— He did not know— I left the
							note with him stating my willingness either to receive payment here or
							to have it renewed at the same rate of interest, which it bore, 6
							percent, for another year. I found the house in Session; and <persRef
								ref="chinn-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chinn</persRef>
							offering again a Resolution which the house had refused to receive,
							calling on the <persRef ref="niles-john">Postmaster General</persRef>
							for a report concerning a defaulting Postmaster, at Baton rouge
							Louisiana; <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> now moved a
							suspension of the rules, for a resolution drawn by him calling upon the
							Postmaster general for a report whether the <persRef ref="waddill-abel"
								>Postmaster</persRef> at Baton rouge was a defaulter, and leaving
							out the call for the correspondence— Chinn said he had in his possession
							a Letter from the man himself—acknowledging that he was a defaulter and
							justly removed—and he said that he specially wanted the correspondence—
							M’Kay’s motion to suspend prevailed; many members supposing that the
							Resolution once introduced would be open to Chinn’s amendment; but to
							cut that off, M’Kay made a speech and moved the previous question.—
							Chinn asked him to accept the amendment calling for the correspondence,
							but he refused— Indignant at this base trickery <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> moved a
							reconsideration of the vote to suspend the rules; but it was too late—
							The daily practices in the house have degraded it into a meeting of
							Sharpers.— The morning hour was gone. The Orders of the day were of
							private business; but the Rules were suspended by a vote
							of<space/>to<space/>under the new rule not requiring a majority of two
							thirds— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Linn Banks in
							the Chair— <persRef ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> of Kentucky
							had the floor and occupied the whole day in a Speech against the
							sub-treasury-bill.— White is a man of fine talents and an able debater;
							but his manner was so vehement, and his articulation so rapid that it
							becomes altogether indistinct— He repeats the word, Sir, at least every
							fifth word, and his discourse is one continued stream without division
							into paragraphs or construction of Sentences— I listened to him about an
							hour, and then went into the Senate-chamber where I found <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> speaking on the bankrupt Bill, followed by
								<persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef>— The question

								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> had moved to strike it out— The Senate had already
							struck out the Section, which included the Banks within the operation of
							the Law. <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> now moved an
							indefinite postponement of the whole subject which started a debate of
							three hours when the motion was rejected by a vote of 16 to 28. I

							a mode of computation of the distance to his residence at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis, which nearly or quite doubled his
							allowance for mileage; and since that time all the distant members have
							followed his example— Thus at the special Session of 1837. the pay of
							each member for attendance was 344 dollars for 43 days. My allowance for
							mileage was and always has been 400 dollars for 1000 miles travel, and I
							received 744 dollars for the whole— At the same Session <persRef
								ref="yell-archibald">Archibald Yell</persRef> of Arkansas received
							2240—dollars— His allowance for travel was 4750 miles at 40 cents a
							mile— The Committee on Mileage propose now to measure the distances by
							the nearest mail conveyances, a very imperfect remedy for the evil, but
							which has roused in arms all the distant members— Attempts were made
							this morning to discharge the Committee, but they failed—the rules were
							suspended by yeas and nays 107 to 48 to receive their report and bill—an
							effort was made to pass it without discussion; but that was defeated; as
							was a motion to make it the order of the day for next Monday or Tuesday—
							I foresee that there will be great zeal for the passage of the bill in
							one quarter, and cunning and successful contrivance to defeat it on the
							other— Private business was again set aside— <persRef

							the whole house on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="banks-linn"
								>Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair— The Independent Treasury-Bill,
							and <persRef ref="ramsey-william">William S. Ramsey</persRef>, the
							cadaverous Harrisburg mob manager, the Orator of the day— I expected he
							was to pour out a torrent of burning lava; but he was dull and heavy,
							doling out a chapter from <persRef ref="mcculloch-john"
								>M’Cullock</persRef> upon political economy, on the history of the
							Banks of Venice, and Amsterdam and Hamburg and London; with details
							about the consumption of wheat in France and England, and parallel

							the Committee of Manufactures, and read newspapers till 4. then returned
							to the house, where I found the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> in the Chair and about 40 members present

						<p><date>7. V. </date>Sunday</p>
						<p>A tempestuous night, with torrents of rain and very heavy thunder— The
							rain continued till noon of this day, and then gradually cleared up,
							cold— I rode to the capitol, and heard <persRef ref="cookman-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman</persRef> from
							Revelations 22.4. “And there shall be no more curse”— He gave a brief
							and very summary account of this book of the apocalypse, written by the
							evangelist <persRef ref="john">John</persRef>—the beloved disciple— This
							part of the discourse might have been well enlarged by allusions to the
							peculiar character of this apostle, an ardent, enthusiastic,
							affectionate Spirit, indicating the causes of that preference of the
							heart—which Jesus bestowed upon him over all his other disciples. The
							general character of the book was noticed— Its avowedly prophetic
							character— Its wild and sublime imagery. Its obscure and mysterious
							language; its progressive and still progressing
								<unclear>eccom?</unclear> far very far yet from their final
							consummation; and its ever blessed promise of a day to come, when there
							shall be no more curse upon the Earth— He then actuated to the curse
							itself—as pronounced by God, in the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							chapter of Genesis v. 14–19. first upon the serpent—then upon the
							woman—then upon the man—and finally upon the Earth— He amplified by
							specific enumeration, many particulars of the curse upon the woman, the
							man and the earth—and after describing the aggravations of human misery
							in this present condition of the world, he pointed out in his text and
							in the whole purport of the book of Revelation the divine promise of
							redemption from the curse— He then argued that the cause of the curse
							was Sin— Disobedience to the Will of God— And the removal of the curse
							was the voluntary self-subjection of Christ to the penalty. The
							atonement of Christ is the commonplace of Calvinism always terminating
							in declamation, in words of indefinite meaning— So it does with every
							Calvinistic preacher whom I ever heard; and so it did with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman— But his final appeal to his
							auditory was solemn and pathetic— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the evening service for Whitsunday and preached from Zechariah 4.8.
							“Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying— 9. The hands of
								<persRef ref="zorobabel">Zerubbabel</persRef> have laid the
							foundation of this house, his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt
							know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. 10. For who hath
							despised the day of small things?” a copious text, and very inadequate
							commentary— The last 4 lines of the version of the Psalms of <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef> in the prayer books before 1832. read
							thus</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Would he (God) his saving power employ </l>
							<l>To break his People’s servile band, </l>
							<l>Then shouts of universal joy </l>
							<l>Should loudly echo through the land.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>In a general convention of the episcopal church at Philadelphia 29
							October 1832 a revised book of Psalms selected from the Psalms of David
							was substituted for them to be read in the episcopal churches, and in
							that revisal, the above verse is in the 11<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Psalm is altered, to read thus</p>
						<lg>
							<l>O that from Sion he’d employ</l>
							<l>His might and burst th’ oppressive band!</l>
							<l>Then shouts of universal joy;</l>
							<l>Should loudly echo through the land</l>
						</lg>
						<p>the last two lines are the same. The debasement both of the thought and
							of the expression in the alteration of the first two lines, is the brand
							of Slavery upon the Episcopal Church, in these United States.</p>

								Trist</persRef> called on me this morning to ask the return of the
							great mass of papers which he had left with me relating to his affairs—
							I had read only a part of them and asked him to leave them with me a few
							days longer to which he consented— I looked over the Laws for the
							increase of the army since 1829. and as in the institution of all such
							enquiries I found only matter to search for more—and meanwhile my time
							slipped from under me— By the most assiduous employment of my hours from
							5 when I rise to 11. when I attend the house it is with the utmost
							difficulty that I keep up my daily Diary. If I turn aside for enquiry
							upon any subject whatever—political or literary, the Diary falls in
							arrear— I rode this morning to the Capitol, and met at the entrance
							door, <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Abbott Lawrence</persRef>, now first able to come there, after a
							confinement by sickness of more than three Months— But he came only to
							take leave of the Hall and leaves the City with his family to-morrow
							Morning to return home. He gave me the key to the draw of the desk
							before his Seat— His brother <persRef ref="lawrence-samuel2"
								>Samuel</persRef> was with him; and asked me when my Speech of the
								9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							would be published— I told him I hoped to finish it in the course of
							this week— He said they were anxious to have it at Boston, and would
							republish the whole in a pamphlet— This was the regular day for the
							receipt of Petitions, but at 5 minutes past 11. I found them in
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Banks</persRef> in the Chair and <persRef
								ref="ramsey-william">Ramsey</persRef> drawing to the conclusion of
							his discourse— He finished between 12 and 1. as he begun, superlatively
							dull, and was followed by <persRef ref="strong-theron">Theron R.
								Strong</persRef>, from Palmyra Wayne County New-York, who took for
							his text the Resolutions of the Legislature of that State against the
							subtreasury, and in commenting upon them assigned his reasons for the
							determination to support and vote for that Bill. They were venomous,
							sophistical and disingenuous like nine tenths of the reasonings of the
							mock democracy— He recognized the right of instruction from the
							constituent to the representative, and the duty of the representative on
							receiving instructions from his constituents to obey them or to
							resign—but he maintained that the Resolutions of the Legislature of
							New-York were not instructions—that the Legislature themselves did not
							speak the Sentiments of the people of New York— That the People of
							New-York would soon shew their real opinions to be directly the reverse
							of those of their present Legislature, and that next November would
							display the triumph of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren</persRef>, and democracy—and down he dropped into his seat—
							Then rose <persRef ref="marchand-albert">Albert G. Marchand</persRef> of
							Greensburg, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, a squat little jew-faced
							rotundity, said to be the youngest member of the House, not more than
							28, and the first thing that I heard of his Oration, was a reference to
							a Letter from <persRef ref="plinytheyounger">Pliny</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="trajan">Trajan</persRef> about Corporations— He was afterwards
							abundant in classical lore—and in the history of the ecclesiastical

							recess when I returned to the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures,
							and received a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my

						<p><persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> was here this morning,

								<persRef ref="adbalrahman">Emperor of Morocco</persRef>—and
							directing that they should be sold, and the proceeds thereof placed in
							the Treasury.— The amendment was that the proceeds should be distributed
							equally between two charitable institutions in this City— The Amendment
							was adopted by yeas and nays 97 to 65— The previous question had already
							been ordered, and the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> was
							already putting the main question of engrossment when I rose and
							enquired whether Congress had ever authorised the acceptance of presents
							from foreign powers— The Speaker answered that he did not know; but the
							previous question had been ordered and there could be no debate— I
							persisted in the enquiry— The <persRef ref="garland-hugh"
								>Clerk</persRef> produced the joint Resolution of 13. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1835. for disposing of a Lion and two
							horses received by the <persRef ref="carr-thomas">Consul of the United

							against the Resolution— <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>
							sent the Constitution to the Clerk to read the prohibitions of the

								>Cooper</persRef> of Georgia moved to lay the whole subject on the

								<persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef> moved to recommit
							the Resolution to the Committee of Foreign Affairs by general consent;
							Pickens objected but finally consented upon condition that it should

								>Cushing</persRef> that the Committee should consider the case of
								<persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">Thomas Pinckney</persRef> in 1798.
							After this flurry, and an abortive motion of Cushing to suspend the

							Bill, <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair—
								<persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> resumed and

								ref="smith-william-steuben">William S. Smith</persRef>, from prison
							where he has been upwards of 14 months confined— I freely told the judge

								Attorney</persRef>, after next November he might be discharged by an
							order of the Court—and that the only other alternative was an
							application to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President of the

								>Secretary of War</persRef>, and the Memorial of the American

								ref="montgomery-william">Montgomery</persRef>— Only four attended
							this morning.— Adams, Davee, Naylor and Wise— No Quorum being present
							nothing could be done.—Davee and Naylor were perfectly well disposed to
							the object, but Wise, thought the proposal might be made an excellent
							handle for ridicule at the stump, and thought Poinsett had shifted the
							responsibility of the proposition from himself upon me— He said he
							should propose a Letter of enquiry to Poinsett to know whether he
							recommended this measure, and said he could throughout all Virginia
							drive off any Loco foco Candidate from the field on this mere
							proposition.— I notified another Meeting of the Committee for next
							Monday morning at 10.— In the House, <persRef ref="curtis-edward"
								>Curtis</persRef> finished a very good and earnest speech on the
							motion to recommit the New-York Pilot Bill, as it is called and <persRef
								ref="hillen-solomon">Hillen</persRef> of Baltimore began his Speech
							in support of the repealing Bill— The facts are that until the year
							1837. a small number of Pilots in the City of New-York had the monopoly
							of all the business of their profession in that port: and they had
							consequently become so neglectful of their duties that it had become a
							proverbial saying among mariners that a man was as lazy as a New-York
							Pilot— In March 1837. an act of Congress took away their monopoly; and
							since that time they have been diligent and vigilant upon compulsion;
							and are now clamorous for the repeal of the Law.— This Bill from the
							minority of the Committee of Commerce is a electioneering partizan
							measure to gratify and secure them— At the expiration of the hour the
							subtreasury Bill came up in Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union <persRef ref="banks-linn">Banks</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef
								ref="lucas-william">Lucas</persRef> had finished his Speech last

							confirmed the sentence, and <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President
								Van-Buren</persRef> endorsed upon the proceedings that he saw no

							a Resolution, calling for copies of the proceedings on this
							Court-Martial, with a preamble of bitter censure upon the Court for
							admitting the testimony of the two Negroes. Botts came to my seat before
							he offered the Resolution, and asked if I should object to it— I said
							certainly not as a call for papers— But I said I should not view the
							transaction in the same light that he did— He said nothing to me of his
							preamble— Objection was made to his Resolution—he moved a suspension of
							the Rules— He carried a majority to suspend but not two thirds. 95
							to<space/>The servile phalanx was broken— All the whigs North and South

						<p>The wind came round last Evening to the North west and cooled the
							atmosphere and this was a pleasant and beautiful day. I took the
							manuscript Report of my Speech of 9. May to the Office of the National
							Intelligencer, and left it with <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>. In the Hall of the
							house of Representatives, I heard <persRef ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates’s</persRef> discourse upon
							intellectual education; being a sequel to the Sermon which I had heard
							him deliver, this day fortnight— His text now was Proverbs 8.10.
							[“]Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than
							choice gold.” The Doctor’s views of intellectual education, were chiefly
							confined to boys, and to the process of schooling and of collegiate
							discipline— He surveyed the various sources of influence to be used in
							stimulating youth to diligent study— Filial duty—curiosity—the love of
							praise—ambition—but not emulation—no competition—no prizes. No placing
							of one boy above another for better spelling— Nothing in which the
							gratification of one boys pride consists of another’s humiliation.— The
							Doctors opinions are practical, judicious, and benevolent, but the seats
							of the members were not half-filled with auditors; and the number of
							members of Congress present did not exceed 25. Yet the Doctor had given
							repeated notice in the Newspapers of his intention to preach the
							Sermons, and specially invited their attendance— But three fourths at
							least of the members of Congress never attend public worship in this
							City, any where— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> dined
							with us, and at 4. P.M went with me and <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef> to the Presbyterian Church in 4 1/2 Street,
							where we heard, the <persRef ref="kirk-edward">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> E. N. Kirk</persRef> an itinerant preacher highly
							renowned for eloquence— The house was full; but not overflowing— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirk is a young very good looking man, and
							an Orator better suited to a methodist camp meeting, than to a
							presbyterian Church— His text was the whole 26<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> chapter of the Book of Acts. and especially the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse “Then <persRef ref="herodagrippa"
								>Agrippa</persRef> said unto <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>,
							Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian”— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Kirk told his hearers that a large portion of them were in
							the precise condition of Agrippa, almost Christians, and then he rung
							the changes upon almost Christians till I thought him almost an
							impostor— His manner of delivery is lively and deeply interesting—his
							language good—his imagery brilliant and impressive his earnestness much
							too agonizing—and his doctrines the most hacknied commonplance of
							Calvinism—the yawning precipice; the blood of Calvary, and the hottest
							of hell-fires— Much of his discourse was in the form of familiar
							dialogues between himself and his almost Christian hearers in which
							personating both parties he gave himself the victory, and sent his
							interlocutor without boil or main prize to Hell— I took a short walk
							with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> early this
							Evening— There was fire, by which <persRef ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goodes</persRef> daughter <persRef
								ref="goode-mary">Mary Mitchell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mitchell-thomas3">her husband</persRef> were burnt out of their

								Thomas</persRef> was here this day while I was at the house, and

							weak and sore, and of which I shall probably never more have the perfect
							or even vigorous use; but which might henceforth furnish me the occasion
							to exercise the virtues of fortitude and resignation if I possessed
							them— I had nearly forgotten my own call of a meeting at 10 this morning
							of the select Committee on the Memorial of the American Philosophical
							Society at Philadelphia praying the aid of the Government for the
							establishment of stations of Magnetical and meteorological observations
							in concert with those instituted by the British and other European

								>Poinsett</persRef>, for his opinion, upon the application of the

							the House, immediately after the reading of the Journal, <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Jones</persRef> moved to suspend the rules
							(Resolution day) to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the

							but he declined— The Rules were suspended. <persRef ref="banks-linn"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Banks</persRef> took the chair

								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pope came in, and commenced a random
							rambling Speech against the sub-treasury Bill which continued until the
							recess— He said the Speech was made for his constituents and not for the
							house— I could not stand it, and found other occupation, in commencing a
							poetical address in Ottava-rima, to the Marble Statue of <persRef
								ref="clio">Clio</persRef> over the Clock at the front entrance of

						<p>My Speech on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May, furnishes four
							columns to the National Intelligencer of this morning. But a spirit of
							indolence is coming over me; and I am tasking my brain too much for
							Stanzas to <persRef ref="clio">Clio</persRef>— I called this morning at
							the Franklin Insurance Office to receive my dividend and when I reached
							the house, they were taking the yeas and nays on a motion of <persRef
								ref="bond-william2">William K. Bond</persRef>, Chairman of a select
							Committee on a memorial of <persRef ref="wright-william2">William
								Wright</persRef>, for an enquiry into the settlement of Accounts
							between the United States, and the Commonwealth’s Bank at Boston, to
							suspend the rules to allow him to make a report from the Committee—but
							the house refused to suspend 55 to 84— The previous question had been
							ordered on the Bill to repeal the pilot law of 2. March 1837— The motion
							to recommit was of course set aside and the Bill passed to a second
							reading 93 to 89. At the second reading there was as usual much dirty
							trickery to snatch the floor from <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"
								>Tillinghast</persRef> who had risen to speak against the repeal;
							but the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> persisted in
							giving him the floor and he made his Speech—not a long one— He was
							followed by <persRef ref="toland-george">George W. Toland</persRef> of
							Philadelphia; also against the repeal; who was soon interrupted by the
							expiration of the morning hour, and the demand of <persRef
								ref="fisher-charles">Charles Fisher</persRef> of North-Carolina, a
							member of the Committee of Elections to be discharged from farther
							Service on that Committee— His only alleged reason for which was that he
							had other indispensable business to attend to, which he could not do and
							serve further on that Committee— Debate arose— The whigs were all
							against excusing him— He finally intimated that he would no longer serve
							whether the House should excuse him or not— The vote by yeas and nays to
							excuse him was 105 to 97. the New-Jersey intruders all voting with the
							Majority— <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> voted
							against it. The rest was a close party vote I believe, and told Fisher
							that it was unwillingness to pass sentence upon his friends— This he
							faintly denied. I had some conversation with him upon the sub-treasury
							Bill, which I said would be a powerful engine in the hands of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren’s</persRef> successor.— He said he had not the slightest doubt
							of Van-Buren’s re-election; but that he should vote against the
							sub-treasury. I told him I could hardly believe that; but he said I
							might— He may perhaps not vote for it.— When it came up this morning,
								<persRef ref="banks-linn">Banks</persRef> in the Chair, <persRef
								ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of Georgia emptied his bag of
							balderdash against his whig colleagues and especially against <persRef
								ref="gamble-roger">Gamble</persRef>, his competitor for the next
							Congress— <persRef ref="king-thomas2">King</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbet</persRef> occasionally interrupted him
							to explain but only quickened the crackling of his faggot fire— <persRef
								ref="crockett-john">John W. Crockett</persRef> followed him against
							the Bill till the recess. I came home and slept about two hours after
							dinner— Two of the work men employed on the Treasury building brought me
							a memorial which they requested me to present to the House praying an
							appropriation for the further extension of that building—which I
							promised to do—if I could— I went to the Capitol about 7. O’Clock, and
							found <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef> speaking against the sub-treasury bill— He had
							succeeded Crockett— A few minutes after I reached the House the
							Committee rose, and the house adjourned 55 to 55 by the casting vote of
							the Speaker.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="u">Professor Meiere</persRef> came to make enquiries
							respecting the house, next to <persRef ref="carbery-thomas">Captain
								Carbery’s</persRef>, which I gave to <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> some years since, and
							which <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> has leased for five years to a german mechanic on
							condition of his making upon it, certain annual repairs.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meiere wishes to purchase of this German,
							his lease, and he is willing to sell it; but he has admitted into the
							house as Co-tenants, a worthless man, and his wife no better, but a
							fortune-teller; and knew not how to get rid of them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meiere expressed great surprize, that in
							this enlightened age, there should be persons earning their living by
							fortune-telling—but said that Captain Carbery had assured him that the
							Carriages of many of the most respectable families in this City and in
							Georgetown, had been seen standing at the door of that house, and Ladies
							alighting from them to have their fortunes told— I referred M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Meiere to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye, for any information or arrangement concerning this matter: the
							property being left wholly to his disposal as my agent— I went to the
							House at 9 this morning and about a quarter before 10. we had a quorum
							of the Committee of Manufactures—Adams, <persRef ref="eastman-ira"
								>Eastman</persRef>, <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"
								>Tillinghast</persRef>, <persRef ref="mitchell-charles"
								>Mitchell</persRef>, <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"

								<persRef ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbet</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef>— The Bill from the
							Senate N. 218 for regulating the duties on Statuary and Paintings was
							taken up. I proposed to report against its passage, as a Bill to raise
							revenue, which by the Constitution could not originate in the Senate—
							All the members of the Committee present concurred in this opinion, but
							there was discussion upon the form of the report which I was directed to
							prepare in writing and then notify another Meeting of the Committee— In
							the House immediately after the reading of the Journal, <persRef
								ref="curtis-edward">Edward Curtis</persRef> of New-York announced in
							a very feeling and eloquent address, the decease of his Colleague
								<persRef ref="brown-anson">Anson Brown</persRef>, at his own home,

								>Montgomery</persRef>, <persRef ref="dawson-william"
								>Dawson</persRef> and <persRef ref="davee-thomas">Davee</persRef> to

								>Granger</persRef>, <persRef ref="sumter-thomas2">Sumter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> were absent, and

								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War Poinsett</persRef> for
							his opinion of the expediency of the appropriation— Naylor, Montgomery
							and Davee were ready for an appropriation of 20000 dollars— No

									>r</hi> Pickens</persRef> was in the adjoining chamber of the
							Committee of Foreign Affairs and drew me into a conversation of more
							than two hours, which he will misuse in making up his report upon the

								<persRef ref="gilliss-james">Lieutenant Gilliss</persRef> at his
							observatory— He shewed me his magnetic and astronomical instruments—for
							observing the variation the dip and the intensity— His Transit

						<p><date>19. IV.30. </date>Friday</p>
						<p>After a good Night’s rest this was the first day since my disaster—that
							the pain in my shoulder and arm is sensibly diminished— It has
							constantly been affected by the state of the atmosphere— Yesterday was a
							sultry day, and my walk home from the Capitol hill, under the burning
							Sun without an Umbrella, was a heedless experiment— There was a heavy
							thunder shower in the evening, after which it cleared away, cool almost
							to a frost, and followed by a bright sky and bracing air, all this day—
							At five minutes past ten I entered the house, and found them in a bustle
							upon an Alabama squatters pre-emption Bill, which the members from
							Alabama, were struggling to drive through without sending it to a
							Committee of the whole— There was a remnant of reluctance upon the most
							submissive of the party Slaves— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">Cost
								Johnson</persRef> denounced in the most abominable frauds of the
							Alabama Land sales— A motion was made to lay the Bill on the table— The
								<persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben;crabb-george2;dellet-james;hubbard-david;lewis-dixon"
								>Alabama members</persRef> called for the yeas and nays and could
							not obtain them, for tellers and could not get them— A vote of a large
							majority laid the Bill on the table— But <persRef ref="graves-william2"
								>Graves</persRef> of Kentucky hearing around him some whisper of a
							motion to reconsider moved it himself and the previous question— The
							party tocsin was in the sound of Graves’s voice— The Alabama members
							called again for the yeas and nays and they not only obtained them, but
							the vote just taken was reconsidered<space/>to<space/>and then the Bill
							was referred to the Committee of the whole and made the order of the day
							for to-morrow— Two or three other Reports from Committees were received
							till the expiration of the hour when at the motion of <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">J. W. Jones</persRef> the House went into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair, and <persRef
								ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> made a powerful Speech of
							three hours against the Independent Treasury Bill; closing prematurely
							at the recess, leaving several topics which he had intended to treat
							untouched— When he sat down <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Joseph L.
								Tillinghast</persRef> took the floor on the same side—and after the
							recess discoursed till Sunset when I left him speaking, without
							indicating any approach to a close— I then left the house and walked
							home, meeting on my way several members of the democracy returning to
							the house; one of whom <persRef ref="steenrod-lewis">Steenrod</persRef>
							I heard say that they intended to sit it out to Night and get the Bill
							out of Committee— During the recess of the house I went into the Senate
							chamber and found <persRef ref="white-albert2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> White</persRef> of Indiana descanting upon I could not
							discover what— <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							on the Evidence question, and concurred entirely with my principles. I
							went to the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures and commenced a
							report upon the Memorial of the American Philosophical Society—but I had
							not written half a page, when the hour of four came and I returned to
							the Hall— The Report ought to be at once a scientific and a political
							state paper but I am not capable of writing it.</p>

						<p>Soon after 9 this morning I attended at the chamber of the Committee of
							Manufacturers for a Meeting of the select Committee on the Memorial from
							the American Philosophical Society; but found only <persRef
								ref="naylor-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor</persRef>
							there— Engaged in a conversation with him till on repairing to the Hall
							we found the house in Session and receiving Reports from Committees— At
							the expiration of the hour, the rules of private business were
							suspended; the House went into Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in the
							chair—and <persRef ref="colquitt-walter">Walter T. Colquitt</persRef> of
							Georgia made a Speech of 3 hours in favour of the Bill, and against the
							Bank of the United States and all Banks.— Colquitt is a ranting
							methodist preacher; a middle sized man, of swarthy complexion, and
							crispy curls between hair and wool, raising ominous conjecture of an
							infusion of African blood in his animal mechanism— Low in stature, with
							eyes black as jet and Ladino platitude of face. His articulation is so
							rapid and indistinct—his gesticulation so violent and contortive, that
							he looks more like a stage-tumbler making somersets than like a decent
							pulpit preacher— I could not hear a twentieth part of what he said, and
							what I did hear was not worth hearing— He is one of the three Georgian
							Apostates from the party which elected him, and has with the other two,
								<persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cooper-mark">Mark A. Cooper</persRef>, been dropped from the
							whig ticket for the next Congress— He was followed by <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Robert Barnwell Rhett</persRef> a South-Carolina
							nullifier of the absurdest stamp a compound of wild democracy and iron
							bound slavery combined with the feudal cramp of State Sovereignty. The
							mongrel brood of doctrinal nullification— Rhett spoke till the recess,
							and resumed on the return of half a Quorum to the house—he finished
							about 5—there was for the second time a pause—a motion to rise and
							report the Bill; but there was a pending motion to strike out the
							enacting clause, and no quorum to take the question— <persRef
								ref="wagener-david">David D. Wagener</persRef> of Easton,
							Northampton County Pennsylvania, then rose and read a speech of about
							half an hour for the Bill, and against the Banks— Wagener is a quiet,
							peaceable Pennsylvania democrat who would be an honest man if he could—
							Mark A. Cooper then took the floor and moved the Committee to rise— They
							rose for want of a Quorum and the house adjourned by yeas and nays 45 to
							44— During the recess, and for an hour and a half after the adjournment
							I was in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures working at a
							report on the Memorial from the American philosophical Society—a
							desperate labour. I then went down and found in the Eastern yard the
							Musical Band of the Marine Corps serenading the public, with a cluster
							of Carriages in the Yard, and a gathering of people on the flight of
							steps and Portico— The Music continued till the splendid Sunset of a
							beautiful day— I walked round the eastern garden and then home— Found
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> here, and he spent the evening with me in
							conversation on my private business</p>

							8.2. “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman posesses a power of reason
							and of persuasion over my judgment, feelings and Memory, not inferior to
							that of any man whom I ever heard. By the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman understands eternal life, and
							resurrection from the dead— The great and vital article of Christian
							Faith— “I am the resurrection and the life.” M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cookman’s exhortations are tender and affectionate— He
							dwells upon the tender mercies of God— He calls the sinner to repentance
							by arguments implying that the hearer’s will is under his own controul—
							He made some very forcible remarks upon a doctrine very current among
							free-thinkers; that a man cannot be accountable for his faith or belief;
							which he said one of the master Spirits of the age had pronounced
							altogether involuntary and independent of the Will— He replied that man
							was accountable at least accountable for attention—for hearing—and
							quoted <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef>, that Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word
							of God— I glanced at this topic last October at Braintree, and wish I
							could examine it thoroughly. The Hall was well filled with hearers, but
							not many in the galleries—less than 30 members of Congress— Miss Cutts
							dined with us. <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> went Friday Morning on a

								Benjamin Rush</persRef>, eldest son of <persRef ref="rush-richard"
								>Richard Rush</persRef>, and Secretary of the Legation of the United

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush thinks the question will be
							amicably adjusted— He expects to depart about the 1<hi

							P.M. I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, where
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for the first Sunday after

									>r</hi> Tillinghast</persRef> at the chamber of the Committee of

							Call of the house, which was ordered and executed till the closing of

							refuting a lie about his election. I came home at the recess, and did

							took up the receipt for 100 dollars which I had given his father on the

							he thought it an improper mode of advertising the book. I said,

							Manufactures against the passage of Senate Bill N. 218. to regulate the
							duties on Sculpture and paintings. the Resolution at the close of the
							Report to postpone the bill indefinitely on the presumption that it
							passed the Senate by inadvertence, was adopted without discussion or

							that I was in the house last Evening, <persRef ref="holleman-joel"

							spoke for about an hour after I left the house, and then they
							adjourned.— This Morning he resumed, and regularly went over the same

							went to the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures and wrote, to the

							house, I found them all in a hubbub. Jenifer had quoted an insolent
							closing paragraph of a Speech of <persRef ref="strong-theron">Theron R.
								Strong</persRef>, and said he would reply to it. Banks the Chairman
							called him to order, before he had begun to reply. Jenifer appealed; and
							Banks put the question on the appeal, as if Jenifer had begun to reply—
							Jenifer reduced his appeal to writing, and demanded that the question
							should be put in his own language— Banks persisted in refusing to
							receive Jenifer’s appeal, and in putting the question in his own way—
							Tellers. Ayes to sustain the Chair 68. Nays—none.— Don’t vote! not one—
							Committee rose and reported no Quorum— Twice repeated— The third time
							Banks received Jenifers appeal—the house sustained the Chairman— Motion
							to rise 55 to 55. Chairman votes against rising. <persRef ref="allen-john3"

							widow of <persRef ref="angus-samuel">Captain Samuel Angus</persRef>,
							called on me this morning with her nephew to claim my assistance in
							obtaining a Pension for her. Captain Angus was Commander of the Sloop of
							War John Adams when in June 1814 I came in her from Gothenburg to the
							Texel— He had served with gallantry, and had been twice severely wounded
							in the head in that War in consequence of which his intellect was
							occasionally impaired— More than ten years afterwards he was dismissed
							from the service by sentence of a Court martial, for a grossly insulting
							Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
								>Southard</persRef>— Great exertions wer afterwards made by his
							friends to obtain his restoration to the service; but that was found
							impracticable— The highest rate of pension however allowed by the Law,
							was secured to him— He died a few weeks since, and his widow now comes
							to claim the benefit of a pension for her support; for which I promised
							her any assistance that it may be in my power to bestow— At the house,
								<persRef ref="botts-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Botts</persRef>, moved a suspension of the Rules to have read, the
							proceedings of the naval Court Martial upon the trial of <persRef
								ref="hooe-george">Lieutenant Hooe</persRef>; reported by the
								<persRef ref="paulding-james">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, in
							answer to the call made some days since upon Botts’s motion— <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Jones</persRef> of the ways and Means enquired if
							he proposed the suspension for the day or only for the morning hour—
							Botts agreed to confine it to the morning hour—and the rules were
							suspended by yeas and nays 145. to 25. my name being among the
							negatives— The papers were partly read: the first was a defence of
							excuse and apology of himself, sneaking enough—for having done his duty.
							Botts objected to this as a paper not included in the call— Before the
							reading was concluded the hour expired— Jones moved to go into Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union, but allowed <persRef
								ref="crabb-george2">Crabb</persRef> to move a reconsideration of the
							vote of yesterday accepting the copy of <persRef ref="raymond-daniel"
								>Raymond’s</persRef> book on political economy; with a view to have
							it referred to the Committee on the Library to examine and report upon
							it. Before I had an opportunity to understand Crabb’s motion, <persRef
								ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> moved the Previous question
							which was seconded and carried as by a whirlwind— I rose and asked leave
							to assign my reasons for presenting the book, but was told by the
								<persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> that the previous
							question had been ordered and there could be no debate— Crabb was in a
							furious passion at the chapter on Slavery that he had found in the book—
							The Speaker allowed him to vent his spleen, but the noise and confusion
							were so great that I could not hear what he said— <persRef
								ref="ramsey-william">Ramsey</persRef> moved to lay the whole subject
							on the table— Crabb called for the yeas and nays, and then for tellers,
							in vain— The subject was laid on the table, by a vote of four or five to

						<p>With <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary’s</persRef> assistance, I finished
							yesterday afternoon the draught of a report upon the Memorial of the
							American Philosophical Society, asking the aid of Government for the
							establishment of five Stations for observations of terrestrial magnetism
							and meteorology— I had used my hand so much in writing, particularly the
							day before yesterday that my shoulder and arm became quite painful. I
							have been obliged therefore yesterday and this day to ask Mary to write
							for me, which she has cheerfully done— <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">her Son Thomas</persRef> were here yesterday
							afternoon— It was his twentieth birth-day. The <persRef ref="u">Captain Hoskins</persRef> marked in
							yesterday’s margin was the Captain of the Great Western Steamer, and was
							introduce to me, by <persRef ref="monroe-james2">James Monroe</persRef>,
							at my Seat in the House. His visit to Washington is one merely of
							curiosity and he told me, that on this day week he should depart from
							New-York on his fourteenth passage across the Atlantic, within two years
							and two months— This morning at 9. I attended at the chamber of the
							Committee of Manufactures, for a Meeting of that Committee— But <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="eastman-ira">Eastman</persRef> were the only other members who
							attended— No Quorum— At the House, <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> immediately after the reading of the Journal moved
							the suspension of the Rules to go into Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, setting aside even the morning hour— This was to cut
							off the reading of the remainder of the proceedings of the Court Martial
							on the trial of <persRef ref="hooe-george">Lieutenant Hooe</persRef>—and
							the rules were suspended. <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> of
							North-Carolina made an attempt to introduce a resolution for the
							printing of the papers; but failed, entirely to his own satisfaction. He
							gave notice however that he should offer the same resolution again
							to-morrow— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> was
							equally unsuccessful in calling for the Bill from the Senate to continue
							for two years longer the charters of the District Banks— The house went
							into Committee of the whole; <persRef ref="banks-linn">Banks</persRef>
							took the Chair and <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef>
							concluded the speech against the sub-treasury bill which he had
							commenced yesterday morning— A masterly Speech—but so long and on a
							subject so trodden down into barrenness, that I found it impossible to
							give it undivided attention. I went into the Senate chamber where I
							heard closing speeches of <persRef ref="tappan-benjamin2">B.
								Tappan</persRef>, and <unclear><persRef ref="allen-william3">W.
									Allen</persRef></unclear> against the Bankrupt Bill; which
							nevertheless passed by a vote of 21 to 19.— Sergeant finished at 1/2
							past 1. and <persRef ref="hastings-john">John Hastings</persRef> of
							Ohio, began reading a written speech, from loose-leaves, and in so low a
							tone of voice that not twenty persons of his own party, clustered round
							him, could hear him—the rest of the hall was deserted— I came home at
							the recess, and did not afterwards return to the house—where Hastings
							finished reading his Speech. W. Cost Johnson made one of four hours, and
								<persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Andrews</persRef> of Kentucky
							occupied one hour more— They adjourned after ten at Night— I had
							employed the afternoon in dictating seven Letters to sundry persons
							which were written for me by my daughter M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							John Adams— The day was intensely warm and sultry.</p>

							had notified a meeting at 9 this morning of the select Committee on the

							concluded to give the Report to the members of the Committee separately
							to read, and thus obtain permission from the majority of the Committee
							to present the report— I accordingly gave the report to <persRef
								ref="sumter-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sumter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duncan</persRef> to read and they consented that I should make the

								ref="montgomery-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Montgomery</persRef> without reading it— I gave it also to <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee
							of Ways and Means to read, and shewed him the item of appropriation
							which I proposed to move as amendment to the army appropriation-bill
							when up for consideration.— He said he could move no additional

								<persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> moved again a
							suspension of the rules for a Resolution to discharge the Committee of
							the whole after Monday next from the further consideration of the
							Sub-treasury Bill, to take it up, and pass upon it in the house; and
							this time he carried it, by a vote of 123 to 58. more than two-thirds—
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> moved a suspension
							of the rules to take up the bankrupt Bill, received from the
							Senate—merely to have it referred to the judiciary Committee, and
							printed—the vote was 88 to 88. rules not suspended— <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> again feebly renewed his movement
							to have the documents concerning the trial of <persRef ref="hooe-george"
								>Lieutenant Hooe</persRef> printed, but failed again— The rules were

							of <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Charles F. Mercer</persRef>, who had
							taken the floor last Evening made a sensible Speech against the Bill,
							and was followed by <persRef ref="biddle-richard">Richard
								Biddle</persRef> who spoke till the recess without concluding— I
							came home to dine and did not return to the house, though greatly
							regretting that I could not hear the remnant of Biddle’s Speech— I class

								>Corwin</persRef>, Sergeant, <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
								>Barnard</persRef>, Biddle, each of whom might claim the first

							last Night. This Evening, I attended a meeting of the new American
							Institution for the promotion of Science— The Secretary of War, <persRef

								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury
								Woodbury</persRef>, as a member. The American Historical Society

						<p>I find it almost impossible to keep up my daily record, and to reach the

								ref="paulding-james">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>—with the
							documents relating to the trial of <persRef ref="hooe-george">Lieutenant
								Hooe</persRef>— <persRef ref="botts-john">John M. Botts</persRef> a
							busy Virginia electioneering whig had called up these papers by
							obtaining the suspension of the rules for one morning hour. At the
							expiration of that hour the papers had been read about half through— And
							now they cannot be taken up again without another suspension of the
							rules.— The Southern Administration Slaveholders now wish to get them up
							under the screw of the previous Question, to refer them with
							instructions to the Committee on the Judiciary to report a Bill to
							prohibit the admission of the testimony of coloured men, upon Courts
							Martial and this Bill when reported to be carried through and passed
							under a succession of previous questions, smothering all discussion— A
							cluster of these Slavers in front of the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speakers</persRef> chair, vociferated the instant after the journal
							was read, a motion to suspend the rules to take up these papers— Botts
							was absent—gone to Virginia— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
								Garland</persRef> said he had told him it was on account of
							circumstances in his family—and he asked if it was fair dealing to call
							up this subject in his absence?— Fair-dealing, and Slave-dealing!—
							“nigroque simillima cycno.” There was a call of the House—and the motion
							to suspend the rules failed by yeas and nays 105 to 58. very little
							short of two thirds— The Speaker announced a Letter from <persRef
								ref="storrs-william">William L. Storrs</persRef> a member of the
							house from Connecticut declaring that he has resigned his seat, which
							was read— He has been appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of the
							State in the place of <persRef ref="huntington-jabez">Jabez W.
								Huntington</persRef> now a member of the Senate of the United

							suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union, which was carried— <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair, and the
							Sub-treasury. <persRef ref="campbell-william2">William B
								Campbell</persRef> of Tennessee made a feeble speech against the
							Bill and <persRef ref="hand-augustus">Augustus C. Hand</persRef>, of
							Elizabethtown, Essex County, New-York, one, equally feeble, in its
							favour— The hour of recess came, before M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hand had finished— I visited the Room of the Senate’s Committee on
							Indian Affairs and saw <persRef ref="brackett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brackett’s</persRef> bust of <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef>, which is very
							good— I walked home and did not afterwards return to the house. After

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexandre Vattemare</persRef>, and an

						<p>The house, or rather a fragment of the house, part of the time not more

							United States from Georgia, would preach at the Methodist foundery
							Church at 11. O’Clock this Morning— I went to hear him, and liked him
							much better as a pulpit Orator than I do as a Congressional speaker,
							statesman or politician— His text was from Acts 24.25—“Go thy way for
							this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee”—an
							excellent theme for copious illustration and commentary— And his
							commentary was very good—there was great animation in his manner with
							out any of the fantastic gesticulation and rant so disgusting in his
							speeches to the house— Procrastination of repentance and conversion was
							the continual subject of his expostulations with his auditory, and they
							were not ineloquent— I thanked him for his instruction, and thought
							there was not a member of the house, who needed the practice of it more
							than himself— The house was crowded—the weather hot, almost to
							suffocation. A chair was given me nearly fronting the pulpit.— I saw
							there only two other members of Congress, <persRef ref="linn-lewis">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Linn</persRef> of Missouri with
								<persRef ref="linn-elizabeth">his wife</persRef>—and <persRef

								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> dined with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>. At 5. in the afternoon I

								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for the second Sunday

							I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
							father, but by me”—a written, cool, dispassionate, sensible discourse,
							terminating, like all calvinistic discourses in the atonement of Christ—
							The heat was again insupportable, and I barely escaped fainting. My
							shoulder and arm too were more troublesome than they have been any other
							day since the dislocation, and were almost constantly painful— I had
							enjoyed little rest last Night, disturbed as it was with the agony of
							diseased dreams— I passed this evening in solitude and darkness,
							alternately, sitting at my window to catch the fanning of a light breeze
							and pacing across my chamber in rumination, upon the extinction of how
							many good and wholesome resolutions, blasted by physical incapacity— I
							could neither read nor write; and these are the only honest modes of
							redeeming me from the burden of my own reflections.</p>

								ref="duncan-alexander">Alexander Duncan</persRef> of Cincinnati
							Ohio, took the floor, promising to be brief; and after three hours and a

							man, upwards of six feet high, stout in proportion, and with a handsome
							manly featured face made hideous by a wild savage and ferocious eye, is
							the prime bully of the Kinderhoek democracy. His eloquence is in keeping
							with his person and deportment.— He has no perception of any moral
							distinction between truth and falsehood, but he has abundant sagacity to
							discern and a brazen front to apply that which will be sure to touch on
							the ignorance, the envy, and the malignity of the Million— A
							thorough-going hack demagogue, coarse, vulgar and impudent with a vein
							of low humour exactly suited to the rabble of a populous city, and
							equally so to the taste of the majority of the present House of

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> all Night at 80.— I
							reached the House this Morning 5 minutes past 10—and they were taking
							the yeas and nays on a motion to suspend the rules during the morning
							hour to take up the papers of the Court Martial upon <persRef
								ref="hooe-george">Lieutenant Hooe</persRef>— The seats were already
							almost all occupied; but the vote was 122. to 17. and the rules were
							suspended— <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of
							Mississippi had moved its reference to the judiciary, and the previous
							question—he now enquired whether he could modify his resolution, and was
							told by the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> that he
							could— But he was dissuaded from offering his modification, and said he
							would offer it another time— <persRef ref="chinn-thomas">Chinn</persRef>
							moved that the papers should be referred to a select Committee and
							printed—also that the further reading of them should be suspended which
							was carried— <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> moved that the papers should be laid on the table and
							printed—question divided—printing ordered 188 to 2. to lay on the table,
							lost 68 to 123.— Previous question carried. the papers referred to the
							judiciary committee— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef>
							wanted to move the printing of an extra number of copies; but the hour
							of 11. came when by a suspension of the rules it had been ordained that
							the subtreasury Bill should be taken up in the house— <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> immediately moved the
							previous question— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost
								Johnson</persRef> was desirous of introducing a substitute for the
							Bill, of which he had given notice; but which he could not present in
							Committee on the motion to strike out the enacting clause. But
							Vanderpoel refused to withdraw; and the engrossment for the third
							reading was carried by yeas and nays 123 to 100— The vote for the third
							reading was 125 to 105— There was then a rush of members vociferating
							for the speakers eye, but he told them they must wait till the Bill
							should be read through; and the question put, upon its passage— This was
							done, and again at least twenty voices at once shouted M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker— He gave the floor to <persRef
								ref="graham-james4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef>
							who spoke against the bill till the recess—without concluding— I went
							into the Senate chamber where they were beginning the debate on the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> section of my revenue Bill—the adjourned
							after 3. and I came home to dine, intending to return to the house about
							sunset when I expected the final question would be taken—about 5.
							O’Clock one of the house boys came in a hack sent by <persRef
								ref="monroe-james2">James Monroe</persRef> to my house, informing me
							that there was a call of the house— I went up immediately, and found
							them taking the previous question which was carried 123 to 99.— The vote
							on the passage of the Bill was 124 to 107.— <persRef ref="cooper-james2"
								>Cooper</persRef> of Pennsylvania and Cushing moved amendments to
							the title, which were rejected and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> made a cutting speech which threw <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> into a paroxysm of fury
							which he disgorged in a rodomontade, ending with a call for the previous
							question— The title was finally carried without a division and with the
							approach of darkness the house adjourned— Whether the result of this
							measure will be to rivet or to rive the party fetters and manacles of
							this people is for God, in Time to determine— We had Evening visits from
								<persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. D.
								Barnard</persRef>—<persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Richard Cutts jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and afterwards from
								<persRef ref="vattemare-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vattemare</persRef>, who is to give a public exhibition
							to-morrow.</p>
