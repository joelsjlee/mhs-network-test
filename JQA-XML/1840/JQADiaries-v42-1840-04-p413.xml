						<p><persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis
								Johnson</persRef> called on me this morning, and stated the present
							condition of the claim in behalf of the late <persRef
								ref="otis-william3">William Otis’s</persRef> estate upon the
							Government.— The final settlement is now before the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> for his decision, which
							may be expected in two or three days. It makes allowance for the sale
							upon execution of the real Estate, but nothing for interest— The amount
							will be between ten and eleven thousand dollars, and pay all Otis’s
							debts leaving perhaps 2 or 4000 dollars for his heirs. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis spoke in terms of high commendation
							of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Keys’s</persRef>
							exertions and services in the case, both by influence and exertion. At
							the house, <persRef ref="medill-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Medill</persRef> occupied three quarters of the morning hour in
							closing his speech on the New-Jersey election papers, which has become a
							mere question of trickery between the floating majority and minority of
							the Committee— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> took
							the floor, not without a contest for the remaining quarter of an hour—
								<persRef ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> attempted to
							correct one of Medill’s false statement of facts, but was not allowed to
							do it— Fillmore asked <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>
							the Chairman of the Committee, whether the whole of a certain document
							had been read in Committee when they made their report? Campbell
							answered that as much of it had been read as had been called for—
							Fillmore repeated the question—had the whole of it been read? Campbell
							commenced a narrative of the proceedings in the Committee— Fillmore
							pressed his question again—was the whole document read—yea or nay?
							Campbell shuffled, without answering either yea or nay—when the orders
							of the day were called— <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bell</persRef> resumed his Speech upon his bill, for
							securing the freedom of elections, and spoke about four hours, upon the
							abuses and corruptions of the present and last
							administrations—signalizing the organization of an electioneering system
							of Government, by the admission of the <persRef ref="kendall-amos"
								>Postmaster General</persRef> as a member of the Cabinet—by a
							sweeping system of removals from office upon political grounds—by the
							attempt to turn the Bank of the United States into an electioneering
							engine—and upon its failure, the destruction of that Bank, undertaken,
							and accomplished— He said he could prove if the House would give him a
							Committee that there was a great organized central association with the
							President of the United States at their head, and branching out to every
							State in the Union, and by whose command every officer not only in the
							Government of the United States, but in every separate State.— And he
							concluded with a story of a Vampire with which he compared <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>;—but I did not hear
							this distinctly, and could not discern its point. Immediately after Bell
							closed, <persRef ref="watterson-harvey">Watterson</persRef> of Tennessee
							took the floor, and at the instigation of <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> moved an Adjournment which was carried and before
							5 O’Clock— The members of the delegation from Massachusetts received
							this day six sets of Resolutions, adopted at their late Session, and we
							agreed to meet Friday Morning at 10. to confer upon what to do with
							them.</p>

								>Eastman</persRef>— Absent <persRef ref="davis-john11"

								>Worthington</persRef>.— Davis is gone home, and told me, he should
							be absent about two weeks. Worthington was in the city, but did not
							attend the meeting, though he knew my Resolution was to be considered—
							We were in Committee 4 to 3. and I could thus have carried my Resolution
							Dromgoole said he wished to address the Committee against it; but should
							decline unless in full Committee— Had Worthington been present and
							compelled to vote; on party grounds he must have voted against the
							Resolution, and by making a tie would have prevented its adoption— The
							Committee waited for him, till within a quarter of 12. and then
							adjourned over till next Thursday— He told me that he had attended,
							after the adjournment— His absence was perhaps, because wedged between
							two responsibilities— The Committee discussed and postponed Petitions
							from <persRef ref="gage-isaac">Isaac Gage</persRef> and from
							Apalachicola, for a free importation of iron and the bill of the last
							Session for laying a duty upon imported Starch.— In the House, the
							report from the Committee on the printing was the special order of the
							day, but neither of the reports, majority or minority were printed, nor
							any of the documents, which <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef>,
							the Chairman said were voluminous—half an hour was consumed in debating
							to what day the subject should be postponed— It was fixed for next
							Tuesday week. <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>
							occupied the remainder of the morning hour, without concluding, in a
							reply to <persRef ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef>, upon the
							New-Jersey election Committee controversy— <persRef ref="alford-julius"
								>Alford</persRef> called for the orders of the day for the sake of
								<hi rend="italic">variety</hi>— But it was variety only of the field

							Tennessee, replied to Bell, upon his Bill to secure the freedom
							elections by anatomizing the Harrisburg Convention recently held which
							nominated <persRef ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> as
							a Candidate for election as President of the United States— He was
							called to order half a dozen times—as often pronounced out of order by
							the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>, and still went on in
							the same course.— He closed a little short of four O’Clock, when
								<persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> took the floor, and
							moved to adjourn, which was carried.— <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Davis</persRef> our Senator
							called me from my Seat to consult me upon a Bill which he has prepared
							making further provision against foreign Slave-trade, and to prevent the

							We had received six sets of Resolves adopted by the Legislature at their

							Massachusetts claim by Governor Lincoln— 2. Against the repeal of the
							duty on Salt, by <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi

							Cushing—and 6. Against the denial by Congress of the right of Petition,
							by me. I proposed that towards the close of the Session, we should sign
							a joint address to the People of the Commonwealth—accounting for the

								Fillmore</persRef> concluded his speech on the Election Committee
							controversy, and was followed by a few remarks from <persRef
								ref="crabb-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crabbe</persRef>—
							Cushing said the debate had become a nuisance, and moved the previous
							question. <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>, chairman of
							the Committee pleaded for a respite of ten minutes, but the impatience
							of the house denied him the indulgence—one amendment proposed by
								<persRef ref="garland-rice">R. Garland</persRef> was
							rejected—another adopted— Campbell called for the yeas and nays on the
							Resolution which was adopted 147 to 3.— The orders of the day were then
							called and several private bills passed, with a bare quorum in the

						<p>I attended this morning after an interval of several weeks at the
							Presbyterian Church, and heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> preach from John 6.67.
							“Then said Jesus unto the 12 Will ye also go away?” There were not more
							than 50 persons present; and at least three fourths of them women— The
							Church was exceedingly small and feeble, before the schism— It is now
							all but extinct— The text was so pointed that I expected M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood would give some explanation of his
							own motives for accepting the invitation of a bare majority of the
							pewholders so decidedly against the wishes of the other half: but the
							allusion to his own situation, and that of the Church was only in the
							text and not in the discourse. He said little of the occasion upon which
							those words were spoken by Jesus— They are among the most mysterious
							passages in the Scriptures— He had emphatically declared to his
							disciples in the synagogue at Capernaum that he was the bread of life,
							and that except they ate his flesh, and drank his blood they had no life
							in them— Now it must be admitted that to the ordinary sense of mankind
							this was a violent and harsh figure of speech; nor is it at all
							surprizing that it should have revolted many of the disciples even to
							the extent of deterring them from following him as a teacher of religion
							and morals— He explained to the twelve apostles that the sense in which
							he had spoken those words was spiritual—that they were merely
							figurative—and then it was that he called upon them to say, whether they
							also would go away?— <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef> answers him
							for the whole— Lord, to whom should we go? thou hast the <hi
								rend="italic">words</hi> of <hi rend="italic">eternal</hi> life—
							They were satisfied with his explanation— They understood his words, not
							as literal but figurative—not as relating to present physical existence
							but to eternal life— This passage however, and the use of the same
							figure at the last supper, declaring the bread and the wine then used to
							be his body and his blood, have given rise and countenance, to the roman
							catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the real presence— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood’s application of the words of his
							text, was to the general neglect of religion and the decline of piety;
							and the tone of his discourse was earnestly desponding— The empty walls
							of the church furnished a sad commentary upon the sermon.— After the
							morning service, I visited <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef>; and <persRef
								ref="hoffman-josiah;southard-virginia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hoffman</persRef>,
							at their lodgings— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening prayer for the fifth
							Sunday in Lent to the end of the second lesson, and then a stranger read
							the remainder of the service and preached from Luke 18.14. the latter
							part of the verse, “for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased;
							and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted”—a discourse upon
							humility— <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Connell</persRef> was here this Evening— He told me that
								<persRef ref="read-william">W. B. Read</persRef> of Philadelphia was
							in possession of a letter from <persRef ref="dickinson-john2">John

								<persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P Trist</persRef>, Consul of the
							United States at the Havana, concerning the fraudulent use of the flag
							of the United States for carrying on the African Slave-trade— They are
							voluminous, and manifest either the vilest treachery or the most
							culpable indifference to his duties— For the last three years it is
							apparent that there has been the most shameful prostitution of the
							American flag to carry on that traffic— That it has been openly,
							notoriously practiced before his face— That as Consul of the United
							States, and at the same time acting Consul for Portugal, he has actively
							lent his aid to it; and when detected in malpractices by the members of
							the British and Spanish mixed Commission, held a most grossly insulting
							and insolent correspondence with them; and then in a long series of
							Letters to the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of State</persRef>
							charges all this unlawful and unhallowed trade to defects in the Laws—
							There is a very long Letter from <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef> to the Secretary of
							State denouncing both the abuse of the flag, and the conduct of Trist,
							and Forsyth’s answer is as if one of the gang of pirates were appealed

								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> divination against <persRef
								ref="cecillius">Cecilius</persRef> presents the most parallel case
							to this that I have met with in history.— The prosecutor in secret

							for Resolutions— I offered one to discharge the Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union, from the consideration of so much of the
							message as relates to this fraudulent use of our flag, and to refer it
							to the Committee of Commerce, with instructions to investigate the
							subject, and to report a Bill to suppress the frauds— <persRef
								ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> objected and the Slavers were
							all agog. I sent the Message to the <persRef ref="garland-hugh"
								>Clerk</persRef>, and had the paragraph read. My Resolution was
							adopted— But objection was made to that for the amendment of the rule
							concerning the attendances of members, and it lies over I went into the
							Senate chamber and returned to him <persRef ref="davis-john4">John
								Davis</persRef> his draught of a bill: and all the manuscript

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Prentiss</persRef> about the Letter
							from a Newspaper editor, which he had delivered to me; and gave him my
							reasons for not answering it; with which he expressed himself entirely

							about his claim— I recommended it to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"
								>Governor Lincoln</persRef> chairman of the Committee on the public
							buildings— I called at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> but

						<p>In looking this morning over the answer of the <persRef

							from H.R.U.S. moved by me for a statement of public monies invested in
							State Stocks, with a Statement of the same thing made from the War

							at the Treasury Department to ask an explanation of it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury could not give it—the former
							report having been made wholly from the War Department, and the
							Commissioner of Indian Affairs having been since changed— He referred me
							to <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef>; whom I had not time this day to see— At the
							National Intelligencer Office and neither of the <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph;seaton-william">Editors</persRef> being there, I
							left a copy of my report on the Smithsonian bequest bill, to be
							published in the paper— The House barely met, scarcely read the Journal

							in procession, preceded by their <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef>, <persRef ref="garland-hugh">clerk</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="dorsey-roderick">Serjeant at arms</persRef>, into the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hubbard</persRef> of New

								>T. H. Benton</persRef>, who was there with <persRef ref="u">a

							almost disarms me.— <persRef ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi rend="superscript"

								Cookman</persRef> the Chaplain of the Senate made also an

							15.26. “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman delivered many solemn truths upon
							the character, the certainty, the consequences, and the awful terrors of
							Death— He said little of the deceased, but that little was good— He was
							with him in his last hours, and testified that he died with the faith,
							and the hope of a Christian.— I rode to the grave yard with <hi

							of members of Congress erected westward of the common receptacle, since
							I was last there—one of them of <persRef ref="goodwyn-peterson">Peterson
								Goodwyn</persRef>, with an inscription declaring him a member from
							Massachusetts—he was from Virginia— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thomas strayed from us at the yard, and a stranger from Maine took his

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="stone-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi> Stone</persRef> the engraver and <persRef ref="jager-b">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jäger</persRef>, a German, native of
							Vienna, now Professor of Botany and Zoology at the College of Princeton,
							where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone has a <persRef ref="u"
								>son</persRef> now a Student, and another preparing to enter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Yäger said he had heard of me, at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg where he resided from 1818 to
							1827. nine years.— We had an easy conversation of upwards of an hour in
							which the Professor expressed the opinion that too much time was devoted
							at our colleges and universities to the study of Greek and Latin— He
							spoke rather slightingly of <persRef ref="galitzin-alexander">Prince
								Galitzin</persRef>, and of the late <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor Alexander</persRef>, as infected with bigotry, from
							excessive reverence for the Bible—which he said was the disposition of
							all the Galitzins he had ever known.— I could not but surmise that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Yäger was a free thinker of the German
							school, and had a negative quantity of reverence for the Bible equal at
							least to the superfluity of it in the Galitzin’s.— That this had
							rendered the residence of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg
							inconvenient to him and brought him to this Country— This may be mere
							conjecture; but I have invariably found, that a light estimate of the
							Study of Greek and Latin and an irreverent estimate of the Bible, are
							inseparable companions— I see the same current of opinions in Professor
							Dunglison’s two Articles in the Southern Messenger upon the Smithsonian
							bequest— Of <persRef ref="dunglison-robley">Dunglison</persRef>,
							imported from Scotland by <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef> for his University of Virginia this might be
							expected; but how this professor Jäger should have got squeezed into the
							super-orthodox college at Princeton gives me pause.— I went to the House
							this morning before 11. to see that the two sets of Resolves of the
							Legislature of Massachusetts, which I presented yesterday; which were
							laid on the table, and not ordered to be printed should be entered in
							extenso upon the Journal.— I found they were so, by <persRef
								ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burch</persRef>;
							who is the real redactor of the Journal— I called at the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker’s</persRef> room and acquiesced in his
							opinion that the Petition of <persRef ref="raymond-d">D.
								Raymond</persRef> and <persRef ref="friend-w">W. Friend</persRef>
							was to be laid on the table.— <persRef ref="clifford-nathan"
								>Clifford</persRef> was with him, but left the chamber as I went in.
							He told me Clifford had informed him that the Legislature of Maine had
							passed Resolutions declaring that they would not submit to a new
							reference of the boundary question to arbitration— In the House the
							supplementary majority and minority Reports of the Committee on the
							public printing; and the majority and minority reports of the <persRef

								<persRef ref="langtree-samuel">Langtree</persRef>, were after some

						<p>I went early this morning to the Capitol, expecting that the Bill for the
							more effectual collection of the duties on imports would be taken up,
							and consumed nearly two hours in collecting all the papers relating to
							it, two of which however were missing— But the morning hour was
							frittered away by a fractious debate between <persRef
								ref="johnson-joseph">Joseph Jones</persRef> chairman of the
							Committee on public accounts and <persRef ref="johnson-charles2">Charles
								Johnston</persRef> the minority member of that Committee, upon a
							proposition to recommit the reports to the same committee against which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnston warmly remonstrates— The
							majority of the Committee have refused to examine the nature of the
							contracts made by the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> of the
							House with <persRef ref="langtree-samuel">Langtree</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="osullivan-john">O’Sullivan</persRef>.— At the
							expiration of the hour, the question of printing the reports still
							remained pending— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>
							called for the orders of the day, and the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> was announcing the call, as a motion to go into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the civil and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill, when I reminded him that there was
							another special order of the day, and appealed to the fairness and
							candour of Jones to abide by the agreement to which he had assented last
							week that this day should be devoted to the Bill reported from the
							Committee of manufactures. N. 100. Jones however insisted upon the
							preference for his appropriation Bill— I then proposed to move that the
							Bill N. 100 should be made the special order for every day after the
							passage of the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill, excepting
							Mondays Friday’s and Saturday’s— Jones would not agree to it with the
							exception; but said he would if I would make the motion without the
							exception.— I made it accordingly without the exception, but <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> opposed it for that reason— So
							that between the opposition of the two Virginians I lost both my
							motions— The questions were taken several times, by general voice, by
							rising, and by tellers— With great difficulty I obtained the yeas and
							nays upon the motion for an unlimited preference after the civil and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill—they were 95 to 61. a large majority but
							not two thirds— As a last resource I moved for a preference of one day
							immediately succeeding the passage of the civil and diplomatic bill—
							This was opposed by <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef>,
							as interfering with the special order upon the reports of the Committee
							on the public printing—but it was carried by a count of 110 to 28. Then
							came the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> in the chair, and the civil and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill. <persRef ref="ogle-charles"
								>Ogle</persRef> continued his speech about 3 hours, without
							concluding it—about 5. O’Clock the Committee rose, and the House
							adjourned— I had some conversation with <persRef ref="grinnell-moses"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Grinnell</persRef>, and with
								<persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef> relating to our Bill
							for suppressing the frauds on the revenue, which is very dissatisfactory
							to the importing merchants at New-York— Grinnell mentioned to me some of
							their objections; and promised a statement of others to-morrow.— The
							strongest objection to the Bill, is the provision, that persons
							interested in the question at issue in the Courts shall not be competent
							as witnesses.</p>

							and the Apalachicola company, for the free importation of iron.— After

							We have a pivot man here next door, in the Committee of foreign Affairs—
							Do you know how Davis will vote on your Resolution?— No— I’ll be—if I

							to this Resolution, if you strike out the latter clause relating to the
							manufactures? then said I it would leave nothing but the revenue
							question, and that belongs to the Committee of Ways and Means— This
							Committee has no jurisdiction— But do you know how Davis will vote?— No—
							Blast me if I do! he is the pivot man—but Ill come to-morrow, and will
							beat you— All this and a half hour of such talk was rattled off in boosy
							good humour—while I answered him in monosyllables; but in the assertion
							of his power there was too much truth in his whiskey. In the house
								<persRef ref="johnson-joseph">Joseph Jones</persRef> Chairman of the

						<p>A dark coloured mulatto man named <persRef ref="cartwright-joseph">Joseph

							this morning with a subscription book to raise 450 dollars to purchase
							the freedom of his three grand children, two girls and one boy, all

							twenty years in purchasing his own freedom, that of his three Sons—that
							after this <persRef ref="johnson-henry">Henry Johnson</persRef> late a
							member of the House of Representatives from Louisiana had bought his
							sons wife and her three children with many other slaves, to carry them

							consent to leave them here for a short time, in the charge of a man to
							whom he had ostensibly sold them, but with the consent that this Joseph
							Cartwright should purchase them for 1025 dollars— He had actually
							purchased and paid for the mother and was now endeavouring to raise 450
							dollars for the three children— There were in the subscription book,

						<p>I have been conscious of the necessity of making preparation for the
							debate upon the Bill for the more effectual collection of the revenue,
							N. 100. reported by the Committee of Manufactures, and which will be
							vehemently opposed by the delegation from the City of New-York; and from
							other quarters— I had some expectation that the civil and diplomatic
							appropriation Bill, would pass this day; and the house having at my
							instance fixed the day after the passage of the appropriation Bill, for
							taking up the Bill N. 100— I supposed it would come up next Monday,
							while I am yet wholly unprepared for debating it— I intended to have
							gone this morning to the Capitol, two hours before the meeting of the
							house to examine and compare the existing revenue Laws, with the
							proposed provisions in the Bill; but the morning wasted away like a
							candle with a thief upon the wick, and within five minutes after I
							reached the Hall of the house <persRef ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates</persRef> opened the meeting
							with prayer— <persRef ref="hall-hiland">Hiland Hall</persRef> a member
							of the Committee on the public expenditures, occupied the morning hour,
							in support of a Resolution offered by <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> chairman of that Committee, to repeal the rule by
							which it was established, and abolish the Committee itself.— He replied
							to <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, who had spoken against the
							Resolution, but had not finished when <persRef ref="jones-john9">J. W.
								Jones</persRef> called for the orders of the day— Civil and
							Diplomatic appropriation Bill in Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union, Casey in the Chair— <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> had the floor, and said he would discourse, not
							upon the appropriations, but upon the sub-treasury and the
							currency—<space/>raised a question of order upon this new topic of
							endless debate saddled upon the appropriation bill; to shew who was
							responsible for the delay to pass the Bill. The Chairman said that if
							the point of order was pressed, he must say that debate upon the
							sub-treasury was not in order, in the consideration of this Bill— A gang
							of Weller’s party flocked round him to persuade him to postpone his
							Speech till the next appropriation Bill should come up— He hesitated and
							wavered, and said he would shorten his speech because he was sick, but
							he was allowed to proceed; and as all his speeches are a compound of
							half froth, half venom ochlocracy, I went up to the chamber of the
							Committee of Manufactures to examine the revenue Laws— After about an
							hour I returned to the house, and found <persRef ref="brown-albert"
								>Albert Gallatin Brown</persRef>, of Mississippi, vapouring about
							the currency, banking, <persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef>, the sub-treasury and
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>.— When he closed, <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel"
								>Jenifer</persRef> asked him if he was the same Albert Gallatin
							Brown, who in a stump speech in Mississippi had said that if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren and his party should abandon the
							sub treasury, he would never say a word in its favour— He admitted he
							was, but explained away, and said he had afterwards in the State
							Legislature been the leader of the Anti-Bank, hard money party— Jenifer
							read from a paper a list of yeas and nays in the Mississippi Legislature
							in March 1839 upon a Bill authorizing the Banks to issue Post-Notes, and
							the name of Albert G Brown was recorded in the affirmative. He asked if
							that was the Gentleman’s name? Brown said it was, but the record was not
							true, and drop’d into his seat, as if he had been shot through the
							heart. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef> took the

							spent about 3 hours in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures</p>

							for at least five weeks, but which I shall probably not want within 5
							days— I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have furnished therefore the money,

							in the three Sermons nor the numerous prayers that I have heard from him

						<p>I went to the Capitol this morning at 10—to finish the examination and
							comparison of the existing revenue collection Laws, with the Bill now in
							my charge— I was fully occupied till the meeting of the House, and still
							left my work unfinished— <persRef ref="mitchell-charles"
								>Mitchell</persRef> came in while I was there, thinking there was a
							Meeting of the Committee of Manufactures—but their adjournment was till
							Thursday. It was the alternate weekly day for the reception of
							Resolutions, and I had a series of four ready to present on the
							investment of public funds in State Stocks—but the intelligence was
							received this morning of the death of <persRef ref="white-hugh">Hugh
								Lawson White</persRef>, late a Senator of the United States from
							Tennessee, and at the very last election of President of the United
							States a candidate for that Office— A few weeks since by the downfal of
							his party under the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>
							ascendancy, and instructions from the Legislature which he could not
							obey, he resigned his seat and went home, where he has speedily died,
							broken hearted— He made himself one of Jackson’s tools against me; for
							which retributive Justice has brought down upon him a punishment, from
							which I should have been too happy to see him redeemed.— The Senate
							adjourned on account of his decease, but sent no message announcing it
							to the house, and <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, after consultation concluded to
							pass it over unnoticed in the House— <persRef ref="cross-edward"
								>Cross</persRef> of Arkansas; offered a Resolution that members
							should be allowed to give in all admissible Petitions to the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> for reference to Committees— All
							petitions excluded from reception by the Rule of 28 January to take the
							course therein directed.— This was a mine sprung upon the house to crush
							all remnant of the right of petition.— Three fourths of the opposition
							fell into it, by the lure of having their admissible petitions
							received.— <persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-jacob">Thomson</persRef> of Mississippi, and two or
							three others of the mobocrats were startled and <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> objected— But the suspension
							of the rules was carried by large two thirds— The whigs now began to
							perceive their error— I offered an amendment to the Resolution; giving
							an appeal to the House, from the exclusion of any petition by the Clerk—
								<persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> moved a
							reconsideration of the suspension of the rules—but the house refused to
							reconsider, and <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> instantly
							intercepted my motion to amend, by moving the previous question— I
							appealed to my previous motion to amend— The <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> said I had yielded the floor
							to the motion to reconsider— I called on Banks in the name of fair
							dealing to withdraw his motion for the previous question but he refused.
							I remonstrated against the dictatorial power proposed to be given by the
							resolution to the Clerk, and the outrageous violation of the right of
							petition, in vain. <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef>
							came to Turney, who told him he would vote against the Resolution; and
							so said Smith do M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams and <persRef
								ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef>—
							There was a Babel of confusion in the House. <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> moved to lay the
							resolution on the table, and called the yeas and nays— My name was
							called and I answered ay—despairing of the question— In the midst of
							this hurly-burly, <persRef ref="leet-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leet</persRef>, a member of the
							house from <pb n="433" type="ms"/>Pennsylvania, came and invited me to
							go up to the Lady’s gallery at the request of the <persRef
								ref="brown-matthew">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthew Brown</persRef> of Canonsburg
							President of Jefferson College, and of his daughter, <persRef
								ref="riddle-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Riddle</persRef>, wife of a <persRef ref="riddle-david"
								>Minister</persRef> of a Presbyterian Church of Pittsburg.— I went
							up accordingly; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leet introduced them to
							me, and I spent half an hour in pleasant conversation with them. At M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Riddle’s request I wrote my name upon a
							card, which she handed me, and she and her father said, that being on a
							visit to this City they had been unwilling to return home without having
							to say that they had seen and conversed with me. While I was in the
							gallery the call of yeas and nays upon Lewis Williams’s motion to lay
							Cross’s resolution on the table was concluded— I thought the Resolution
							was adopted—but it was laid on the table 96 to 84 The morning hour was
							gone, so that I could not present my resolutions— <persRef
								ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> was in the Chair in Committee of
							the whole on the State of the Union, upon the civil, and diplomatic
							appropriation Bill, and <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace
								Everett</persRef> was on the floor speaking with so feeble a voice,
							that I could not hear him— He was followed by <persRef ref="keim-george"
								>George M Keim</persRef> a thickset squat-figured half-dutchman,
							unconquerably dull; but rich, affecting neatness of person, classical
							learning, wit, and patronage of the fine arts with sentimental and
							philosophical democracy— He was delivered with hard labour of a speech
							an hour long gotten by heart, inexpressibly flat, a compound of
							champagne and dishwater, in retaliation upon <persRef ref="ogle-charles"
								>Ogle</persRef>, who had given him a passing cut and thrust in his
							late Speech— When he sat down Ogle was instantly upon his legs to reply;
							but Casey gave the floor to <persRef ref="parmenter-william"
								>Parmenter</persRef>, who in a smooth, oily and candid manner
							characteristic of himself, commenced and carried through a personal
							attack upon <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef>,
							by a long history of the Hartford Convention, as a measure of the
							federal party; and assuming that the whig party now is identical with
							the old federal party.— It was past 5 when he closed, and Saltonstall
							was up to reply— <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Andrews</persRef> moved
							that the Committee should rise, for which there was a majority but no
							quorum voting— Casey reported that fact to the House; which adjourned—
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> imploring for a
							promise that the Bill should be passed to-morrow— No such promise
							made—but to morrow will be a long day in the house— <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> called me out to
								<persRef ref="hamilton-james3">James Hamilton</persRef>, with whom I
							had a cordial greeting— And I was called out to the <persRef
								ref="friedrichsthal-emanuel">Chevalier Friederichsthal</persRef>
							attached to the Austrian Legation who gave me an Index to a folio volume

							Letters to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> which I
							promised— <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> asked me some

							message of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> of the
							United States, warmly recommending a new militia Law, constituting in
							effect an army of 200000 men— To these statements are added a brief but
							pungent commentary— Nothing could be more incendiary against the

								<persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> to be read and it was
							read— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and <persRef

							was sitting near me in its most venomous convulsive laugh— Saltonstall
							was just reclaiming the floor, when Bynum left his Seat, crossed the
							Hall towards Rice Garland’s seat and grossly insulted him directly or in
							his hearing. Garland struck him a heavy blow; and they had a fisty cuff
							bout till they were parted— There was an electrical shock of confusion
							in the house— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> was
							loudly called for and took the chair, called the house to order, and the

						<p>The nervous agitation caused by the violent scene in the house yesterday,
							and perhaps upwards of twelve hours passed in the Committee room and the
							house without other refreshment than three or four small crackers were
							followed by a nearly sleepless night, and another weary day— <persRef
								ref="howison-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howison</persRef>
							was here this morning my neighbour who has purchased and lives in the
							house last Spring owned and occupied by <persRef ref="cammack-william"

							wishes a lease of the same lot adjoining that house which I rented last

								<persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Elizabeth Pierce</persRef> was here
							again and stated her own and <persRef ref="telfair-mary">her
								Sister’s</persRef> distress, their land lord actually crowding them
							out of their lodgings, for their inability to pay for them; and a
							doctor’s certificate that her sisters health is suffering for want of
							sufficient and wholesome food— She intreated me again to urge the
							members of the Committee for a speedy decision upon their claims. I rode
							to the Capitol and spent two hours in the chamber of the Committee of
							Manufactures, still examining the documents to support my revenue Bill,
							and still not nearly finishing the task— In the house, <persRef
								ref="leet-isaac">Leet</persRef> finished his speech against the
							Resolution for abolishing the Committee on the public expenditures.— I
							rose and addressed the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>,
							but precisely at the same time <persRef ref="morris-samuel"
								>Morris</persRef> of Pennsylvania rose and moved the Previous
							Question— I asked him to withdraw the motion— He said he would, if I
							would promise to renew it. This I declined. Morris insisted upon his
							motion, which was lost 59 to 62. no quorum voting— The Speaker said
							there was certainly a quorum present, and I proceeded till the
							expiration of the morning hour, when <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W.
								Jones</persRef> called the orders of the day, the Committee of the

								<persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garret Davis</persRef> finished his

							late sickly conservative, turned into a sturdy Van Burenite— <persRef
								ref="corwin-thomas">Corwin</persRef> followed close upon the
							turncoat, who writhed under his castigation. Hopkins is a weak man who
							for some time fancied that he could maintain a position as a Statesman
							independent of Party. When the Committee on the printing was chosen, he
							asked to be excused, and was excused from voting because there were but
							five men in the house fit to serve on such a Committee; one of whom was
							himself, for whom he of course could not vote—one was the Speaker who
							could not serve on any Committee and one <persRef ref="garland-james"
								>James Garland</persRef>, who for reasons of delicacy would decline
							serving on that Committee. This ridiculous pretension was so universally
							understood by the house that when <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert
								Smith’s</persRef> name was called he answered viva voce [“]I vote
							for one of the only five honest men in the house, George W. Hopkins.”—
							Hopkins took no notice of that— But when Corwin now alluded to his
							notable excuse for not voting in the choice of the Committee on the
							printing, he rose and flatly denied that he had said any such thing, and
							gave a lame and impotent explanation of what he did say. Corwin’s
							speech; wholly off-hand, and which he said was probably the last Speech
							he should ever make in that hall, closed just before 9. O’Clock—

							ground that the principle had been settled by the vote last week on my
							Resolution— I said I should offer a minority report and resolution to
							the Meeting of the Committee next Thursday— In the House, I had the
							floor from yesterday, on the Resolution for abolishing the Committee on
							the public expenditures. I had intended to speak not more than five

							moved the previous question— <persRef ref="hall-hiland">Hiland

							carried— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> called the yeas
							and nays on the reported Resolution which was rejected 6 to 148.— The

							upon the appropriation Bill and <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef>, who had taken the floor last Evening, made one of

								>Atherton</persRef> of New-Hampshire, the man of the mongrel gag. He
							had a speech of shreds and patches—scraps of old newspapers—extracts
							from my messages, from <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson’s</persRef> writings, from English reviews, from <persRef
								ref="blackwood-william">Blackwood’s</persRef> magazine, from

								>Tully</persRef> in support of the Roman <hi rend="italic"

						<p><date>25— V. </date>Saturday—</p>
						<p>The daily repetition of these long sittings in the House, not only robs
							me of nightly repose at home; but produces a nervous agitation, and
							musing, which wastes itself in tumultuary thought, and projects of
							speaking to the house of myself, which I have hitherto constantly
							suppressed— I spent an hour and a half this morning in the Committee
							room, nearly completing my preparations to support the revenue bill with
							which I am charged— But if I had a week longer for preparation, I should
							still not be ready— In the house, after the adoption of a Resolution
							authorising the clerk to purchase a Chandelier, the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> continued the call of the
							Committees for Reports— I reported from the Committee of Manufactures,
							the reference of several Petitions and Memorials for the suppression of
							frauds on the revenue, and for duties upon silks and umbrellas to the
							Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, who have before them
							the two Bills concerning the revenue, and duties on silks, reported by
							the Committee—and of several other petitions for the disuse of Ardent
							Spirits in the army and navy, and the levying of a duty on their
							importation, to the military and naval Committees and the Committee of
							Ways and Means.— I reported the Bill of the last Session, to authorise
							the importation of iron for ship-building by <persRef ref="gage-isaac"
								>Isaac Gage</persRef>, and the Apalachicola commercial company, and
							asked the discharge of the Committee from the further consideration of
							Memorials praying for the imposition of duties on starch and on Cigars.
							I moved also that several amendments which I propose to offer to the
							revenue bill should be printed for the use of members, which was
							ordered— I believe the Committees were all called, before the orders of
							the day; the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> Chairman and the general
							appropriation Bill— <persRef ref="dellet-james">Dillet</persRef> of
							Alabama took the floor and spoke nearly three hours, I know not upon
							what— The members drop’d off one by one till there were less than 100
							left in the house— I went myself to the chamber of the Committee of
							Manufactures for half an hour and compared together the expenditures for
							the Military establishment in 1834 and 1838. When I returned they were
							in the midst of a call of the house to get a quorum— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dillet had not finished his Speech; but
							had made a pause for <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>
							to present an unanimous report of the select Committee of five on the
							fray between <persRef ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef>.— The call was finally
							superseded without making a Quorum, and, by general consent Bynum read
							his report, which was a mere dry statement of facts, collected from the
							testimony of 22 witnesses. They use no expression of censure upon either
							of the parties, and propose no measure to the house— A motion was made
							that the report and testimony should be printed, but whether it passed
							or not non mi ricorda— An adjournment was moved, and carried by yeas and
							nays 51 to 45— The house was on fire with the Virginia Elections— The
							whigs claim victory.</p>

						<p>I attended public worship this morning with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> and my <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Granddaughter Mary-Louisa</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="cookman-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cookman</persRef> preached from Psalm 72:16 [“]There shall be a
							handful of corn in the earth upon the top of mountains; the fruit
							thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish
							like grass of the earth. 17. His name shall endure forever: his name
							shall be continued as long as the Sun; and men shall be blessed in him:
							all nations shall call him blessed. 18. Blessed be the Lord God, the God
							of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. 19. And blessed be his
							glorious name forever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory.
							Amen and amen. 20. The prayers of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>,
							the son of <persRef ref="jesse">Jesse</persRef> are ended.”— And it was
							a good ending said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman.— He analyzed
							and commented with great ingenuity and fervour upon every part of this
							text as prophetic of the Messiah’s kingdom—of that blessed time, when
							War shall be banished from the earth— The theme is to me delightful—
							These promises of the Scriptures—these transcendantly sublime prophesies
							of the old covenant, and these practicable means and irresistible
							tendencies to their fulfilment in the new are the most precious pledges
							of my faith— If I did not believe them, I should be compelled to reject
							the whole book— I do most faithfully believe them— Peace—perpetual
							Peace! what an inexpressible blessing to the race of Man! Not that I
							deem it necessary to believe that the Nature of carnivorous beasts shall
							be changed— These I suppose to be figures of speech—but that the
							murderous and treacherous passions in the heart of man shall be so far
							eradicated or restrained that there shall be no more public or private
							War— With the practice of War Slavery must of course be extinguished.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman was sufficiently enthusiatic
							in this belief to gratify me; and my faith and hope in the future advent
							of the kingdom of the Message, to pass among my friends for insane. That
							Christianity has already made immense progress in checking and
							controuling the anti-social passions of man is undeniable a religious
							principle that man has no right to take the life of man, will soon
							accomplish the abolition of all capital punishments, and the principles
							of Liberty are daily rendering the life of man more and more precious.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman quoted <persRef
								ref="maundrell-henry">Maundrell</persRef> for the size of the
							enormous Cedar of Lebanon, and spoke of what kings would do in the
							Millennium; if there should be kings; at that time, which was very
							doubtful.— The hall was more crowded than I had seen it for many years.—
							I met <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Taliaferro</persRef> there— A very heavy thunder shower prevented my
							attendance at Church this afternoon. The lightning yesterday struck a
							barn not far distant from the Capitol, and the barn was burnt down— In
							the hurricane of this day fortnight a black woman was struck dead by a
							thunderbolt, in the African church on the brow of the Capitol hill.</p>

							<persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stanbury’s</persRef> part of the report

							made a very handsome apology to the house for the violence of language
							and action used by him in the conflict with Bynum; who now stood mute—

								>Casey</persRef> in the Chair and the civil and diplomatic

								>Stanly</persRef> then followed, and <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Bell</persRef>, and <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> who gave notice that he would henceforth insist

								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> hoped the Committee would
							proceed with the Bill between nine and ten O’Clock this Evening he would
							begin a most eloquent Speech of an hour and a half— I said I too was

							upon this Bill, the passage of which I had determined from the day of
							its introduction into the Committee I had determined not to delay so
							much as one quarter of an hour— I was loudly called to go on but said
							no— I would make it upon some other bill—a desultory debate followed
							upon sundry motions to strike out various items of the Bill till near 9

							and refuse to adjourn— The quorum go into Committee again and in five
							minutes another question of order is started upon, which no quorum is

							Several of that number were so brought in called to answer, and ordered

							rescinded, after having been executed upon <persRef ref="smith-albert2"
								>Albert Smith</persRef>, before I returned, so that my name was not
							entered as an absentee nor was I called to account for my absence— But
							63 members were so called to account 28 were administration men and 35
							were whigs— There was at least an equal number of absentees 63 who were
							not brought in—many absent from the city and several who could not be

								Casey’s</persRef> decision that <persRef ref="ogle-charles"

							The debate upon the Bill was then resumed, with out allowance for the
							morning hour, and was continued upon the items of appropriation, till
							near 7. O’Clock in the Evening; during which snarling party scuffles of
							an hour or two for each question were held upon the restoration of 3000
							dollars for the salary of the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner

							abolish or reduce the three lately created branch, mint establishments

							which are perfectly useless and very expensive— It was curious to see
							the members of both parties from North-Carolina and Georgia, all except
							Stanly, bristle up against any diminution of the mint expenses in those

							Bill of between 2 and 300 dollars for flowers and plants and trees for
							the mint establishment at Charlotte which caused great discomfiture in
