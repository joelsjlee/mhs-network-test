						<dateline>Washington Wednesday 1. July 1840.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. IV:45— </date>Wednesday</p>
						<p>There was a corner of a thunder shower here last Evening, and this
							morning the thermometers were down as low as 74 and the feeling, cold—
							At the house <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> moved a
							Resolution for the adjournment of Congress on the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month. days before and after
							were proposed, and <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> who
							chuses to have every thing in his own way moved the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and the previous question, both of which
							he carried—the previous question by 113 to 22. and the day, the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> by 105 to 95.— This was no sooner
							announced than <persRef ref="watterson-harvey">Watterson</persRef> moved
							a reconsideration—carried 108 to 84. Question again taken on the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> rejected 88 to 113. Then the question
							upon the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> was carried without a
							division— This is a pattern specimen of the consideration and
							reconsideration of this previous question house— I asked the general
							consent of the house to present a report from the select Committee on
							the Memorial from the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia—
								<persRef ref="cooper-mark">Cooper</persRef> of Georgia objected and
							my Report was not received. But Cooper came afterwards to my seat, and
							when I explained to him my reason for asking that the report might be
							received and printed, he said he would not persist in his objection.—
							The Report from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> of the Commerce and Navigation of the year was
							received and after some altercation 10,000 extra copies were ordered to
							be printed.— The Bill from the Senate for continuing the Charters of the
							District Banks—all of which expire on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this month—was taken upon by general consent out of its
							time— Petrikin and Mark A Cooper immediately started budgets of
							burdensome conditions, as amendments, which were sharply debated till
							the recess— I made a short speech to urge the indispensable necessity of
							passing the bill in some form before next Saturday. During the recess I
							went into the Senate where they were debating with much earnestness, the
								9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of my revenue bill. Before
							the recess<space/>had moved to lay the Senate’s Bank Bill on the table,
							which had been rejected by yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>after the recess
							Cooper’s batch of Amendments in superfetation of Petrikin’s batch was
							taken up, and divided into parcels, upon each of which yeas and nays
							were taken—some adopted, some rejected; until about Sunset, when at the
							motion of Petrikin, the house adjourned.— I came home immediately, and
							after a very light dinner and went to <persRef ref="vattemare-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Alexander Vattemare’s</persRef>
							exhibition of Ventriloquism— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> and granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef> were also there— The sport began with sundry
							songs and duets by <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								Miss Manvers</persRef>, with accompaniment of the Piano—and the
							recitation of <persRef ref="collins-william">Collins’s</persRef> Ode on
							the passions, by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Manvers</persRef>, very well— Alexandre’s drama is called the
							adventures of a Ventriloquist or the rogueries of Nicholas, in which he
							sustained seven parts, old and young, male and female, and imitated the
							planing of a table, the frying of eggs in a pan, and sundry other
							strange noises— The House was crowded—and well pleased. I sat between
								<persRef ref="paulding-gertrude">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Paulding</persRef>, and <persRef ref="dickinson-julia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> B. O. Tayloe</persRef>— Home between
							10 and 11.— Weary.</p>

						<p>On attending this morning at the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures
							I found there <persRef ref="davis-john11">Davis</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef>—just enough to make

								<persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="mitchell-charles">Mitchell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="eastman-ira">Eastman</persRef>.— Davis referred to the entry on
							the minutes of 27 April of the decision upon my resolution of 26. March—
							The entry was that My Resolution was rejected 4. Ayes 5. Nays, whereas
							the question was upon striking out the words—respecting the protection
							and encouragement of Manufactures and the internal industry of the
							Country, and the ayes and nays had been taken on the striking out, and
							were 5 to 4. considering this as equivalent to a rejection of the
							Resolution I had so entered the minute— Davis complained that statements
							had been transmitted to his District, and reproaches against him there
							for having voted against the Resolution, which he said he had not done.
							After some discussion, we agreed to meet again Saturday morning; I
							promised to produce then a statement to be entered on the minute book,
							and Davis promised to prepare such a statement as he wished to have
							entered on the minutes— In the house, I did at last succeed in obtaining
							the reception and an order to print my report on the memorial of the
							American philosophical Society at Philadelphia— <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> objected to the resolution
							for an Appropriation; and I said I would not press for its immediate
							consideration— Two or three reports from Committees were received and
							Pickens was prepared to report an amendment to the Resolution from the
							Senate, concerning the Muscat and Morocco Presents—but the hour had
							expired, and the District Bank Bill was resumed—a succession of yeas and
							nays were taken upon the amendments proposed by <persRef
								ref="cooper-mark">Mark A. Cooper</persRef> and Petrikin, which with
							a request from <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> to be
							excused from voting on one of the amendments—and a discussion thereon
							continued till the recess— That interval I employed in the chamber of
							the Committee of Manufactures, preparing a statement to be entered on
							the minutes of the Committee, to rectify the misentry of 17. April, but
							I had not time to finish.</p>
						<p>After the recess, there was more discussion upon Cushing’s request to be
							excused from voting.— which he at last withdrew— The Senate Bill,
							top-heavy with amendments was denied engrossment as amended, for a third
							reading by yeas and nays 69 to 90. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W.
								Cost Johnson</persRef> then moved to take up the Bill reported by
							the Committee on the District of Columbia, but this required a
							suspension of the rules—vote 94 to 86. lost— <persRef
								ref="holleman-joel">Holleman</persRef> moved a suspension of the
							rules to introduce a Bill, allowing the Banks two years to close their
							affairs Rule suspended 155 to 18.— The Bill was introduced— <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">Francis Thomas</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> proposed amendments— I asked for a

								>Secretary of War</persRef> to report at the commencement of the

							War—but <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> objected
							because it would make a huge volume. <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel"
								>Jenifer</persRef> obtained an order for printing 5000 copies extra
							of a report on the Tobacco trade, and the District Bank Bill was
							immediately taken up by a suspension of the rules again cutting off
								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens’s</persRef> report concerning

								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> of Ohio had the floor from last
							Evening; and foamed at the mouth, half froth half-venom against the
							banks, for about an hour— Then followed a colloquy between <persRef
								ref="grinnell-moses">Grinnell</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef>, to which after sometime
							objected to its continuance. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost
								Johnson</persRef> moved the previous question, which was carried and
							the main question was first taken upon <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood’s</persRef> amendment, also carried 99 to 71. then upon
							the engrossment of the Bill as amended for a third reading 118 to 67—
							Previous Question again— Cave Johnson moved to lay the bill on the
							table—withdrew the motion upon expostulation; but it was immediately
							renewed by <persRef ref="keim-george">George M. Keim</persRef>—rejected
							70 to 120.— The bill was passed 115 to 75— Then about the title of the
							Bill— Keim wanted to move an insulting title, but was not allowed.—
								<persRef ref="hand-augustus">Hand</persRef> moved a reconsideration
							to introduce an abusive title which was read, but which after some
							altercation he withdrew— The title was then adopted, and the Bill was
							sent to the Senate— <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef>
							moved a suspension of the rules for a resolution of enquiry for copies
							of a correspondence between <persRef ref="renshaw-james">Commodore
								Renshaw</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="paulding-james">Secretary
								of the Navy</persRef>, about the dismission of a pump and block
							maker at the Brooklyn Navy-yard on account of his political opinions.
							The vote to suspend the rules was 101 to 68. lost for lack of two
							thirds.— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>, Chairman of
							the Committee of Ways and Means then moved to go into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, which was done, and the Navy
							appropriation Bill was taken up— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> had been all day, and yesterday in the Chair as
							Speaker— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker Hunter</persRef>
							having been absent—detained at home, it was said, by a sick child.— The
							Navy Bill was read through, and then taken up by Sections— It was
							apparently passing through the Committee without note or comment when to
							start some discussion till the return of the Bank Bill from the Senate I
							put some enquiry to the Chairman of the Ways and Means, about the amount
							of the appropriations at several Navy-Yards, which he answered; and then
							I moved to strike out the words “and for no other purpose whatsoever,”
							from a section of specified contingencies, the words being as I
							contended worse than useless and deceptive, holding up the idea of a
							limitation upon the application of the funds, when in fact there was
							none— Jones answered and I replied till the recess came when repaired to
							the Chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, and finished the statement
							to be entered on the minutes of the Committee to rectify the entry of
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April— After the recess the
							Navy Bill was again taken up my proposed amendment was rejected—

								<persRef ref="mitchell-charles">Mitchell</persRef> absent <persRef
								ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef>— I presented the
							statement which I had drawn up to be entered on the minutes of the
							proceedings in the Committee on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							April, upon the Resolution offered by me on the 26<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of March— Davis was unwilling that it should appear on the
							minutes that the rectification of the former entry was made by his
							desire, but he did not move to strike it out and it remained— He was
							unwilling that it should appear that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had
							objected to the words, “without resort to the expedient of Treasury
							Notes” he said that Nisbett had made the objection— The name of Davis
							was accordingly struck out from my Statement and the words “objection
							was made” were inserted in its place— He then complained that there was
							any minute entered of yeas and nays, and Dromgoole insisted that the
							Committee had no right to take yea and nays—nor to keep a journal. Davis
							made an argument to shew why he had voted to strike out the words
							relating to the protection of manufactures, and could not see why it
							should be made to him, and not M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eastman.—
							He desired however that the entry as prepared by me, and now amended
							should be made on the minutes, and it was so agreed by the Committee I
							then moved that the Chairman be instructed to report a Resolution, that
							the prayer of sundry Memorials and Petitions from Pennsylvania referred
							to the Committee since the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May,
							asking a revision of the Tariff for the protection of manufactures, is
							reasonable and ought to be granted— Davis enquired whether any of the
							Petitions were from Bucks County (his district.) There were not.
							Dromgoole said he should oppose this Resolution: but there was no time
							for the discussion this Morning— The house met at 10 O’Clock— There was
							a Quorum present, and <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> renewed a motion which he had made last Evening
							that private claims for revolutionary services and pensions should be
							taken up at 11 O’Clock— But a motion was immediately made to adjourn.
							Carried by yeas and nays, 66 to 63. I returned immediately to the
							chamber of the Committee of Manufactures and made on the minutes of the
							Committee the entry agreed upon this morning, and a minute of my motion
							for instructions to report in favour of the Tariff memorials, from
							Pennsylvania— This kept me till past one O’Clock— <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> was at the same time writing
							in the adjoining chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs, but left
							the Capitol before me— I walked home, and spent the remainder of the day
							quietly there. <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> dined with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and took
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> with her this
							Evening to <persRef ref="dickinson-julia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> B. O. Tayloe’s</persRef> to see the splendid fire-works
							on the President’s Square. The day was celebrated here, at Georgetown,
							at Alexandria, at Bladensburg, and all over the Country with more
							intensity than was ever known before— But they were all party
							celebrations, with none of which I could sympathize— I received a Letter
							from <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist</persRef>, with a
							Memorial to Congress concerning the case of the Ship Congress, <persRef

								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, at the Hall of the House of
							Representatives, where <persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman</persRef> preached from
							Ephesians 2–12 the middle of the verse—“the Commonwealth of Israel”—it
							was altogether a political discourse, specially suited to the place; and
							to the day next after the anniversary of Independence.— The argument was
							that the Hebrew theocracy was a republican Government, and that the
							Bible is a Book, containing the Supreme Law of Liberty— He illustrated
							the positions thus assumed, by numerous references to the institutions
							of the Levitial Law—the special division of the People into twelve
							tribes, the Separation of the tribe of <persRef ref="levi"
								>Levi</persRef> from all the rest—their peculiar privileges and
							disabilities—their exclusion from the possession of land, and their
							dispersion in 48 cities among all the other tribes— Their first
							government, after <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="joshua">Joshua</persRef>, by Judges— Then their transition to
							the rule of kings; effected entirely by the will of the
							People—disapproved by Samuel—disapproved by God—but yet commanded by
							him; because demanded by the People.— The remarkable interposition from
							time to time of Prophets, divinely inspired, but all laymen, and their
							extraordinary influence upon the affairs of the community— Then under
							the gospel dispensation, the pre-eminently popular character of the
							Saviour, and of all his apostles excepting only <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>.— He particularly
							noticed that in the answer of Jesus to the enquiry of the Messengers
							from <persRef ref="john">John the Baptist</persRef>, whether he was the
							Messiah or they should wait for another after enumerating his miracles,
							the last fact to which he refers and from which he leaves the Baptist to
							draw his own inference is that the Gospel is preached unto <hi
								rend="italic">the Poor</hi>— M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							Thornton thought the Sermon radical, and so it was; and so is the
							Christian religion— The preaching of Christ was to the multitude— The
							parable of the rich man and of <persRef ref="lazarus"
							>Lazarus</persRef>—the comparison of the salvation of a rich man to the
							passage of a Camel through the eye of a needle— The frequent invectives
							against the Scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, Priests and Levites, all shew
							the tendencies of the system to be democratic— Christianity is indeed
							above all, the religion. Its first principle historical and theoretical
							is that all mankind are of one family—descended from one common
							ancestor, and this is the foundation of the moral and political
							principle of the natural equality of mankind— From this fact also
							follows the principle that the state of nature between men is a state of
							Peace— Here are heads for a lecture or Dissertation—
							Moral—Political—Religious— I have no time to pursue the thought. After
							dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church—
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the service for the third Sunday after
							Trinity, and preached from Malachi 3.13. “Your words have been stout
							against me, saith the Lord; yet ye say, What have we spoken so much
							against thee 14. Ye have said, it is vain to serve God; and what profit
							is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked
							mournfully before the Lord of hosts?” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley takes most of his afternoon texts from the prophets. Evening dark
							and solitary in my chamber.</p>

						<p>I find a physical impossibility of keeping up in this diary with the

								>Atherton</persRef> moved to go into Committee of the whole on the

							the delegate from Florida got leave which he had been several days
							seeking, to introduce a Bill to protect the lives and property of the
							people of Florida, and to bring the Seminole War to an end.— It was a
							Bill of<space/>Sections constituting a new Government in Florida with power
							to raise an army of volunteers and giving away all the lands in the
							Territory— The title was a deception— The Bill was, read twice and
							Downing moved its reference to the Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved
							that it should go to the Committee of Military Affairs— Downing made a
							short, vehement speech against the administration, particularly for the
							gross mismanagement of the Florida War, and the total failure of
							protection to the people of the territory— Cave Johnson then moved to
							lay the Bill on the table—and called the yeas and nays 78 to 39. no
							Quorum. Second call of the roll 93 to 54. With some difficulty the order
							was obtained that the Bill should be printed— <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> wished to offer a Resolution
							for an appropriation of 25000 dollars for a survey of the Northeastern

							words, chiefly to call on the Committee of Naval affairs to know why
							they had not reported on the plan prepared by the <persRef
								ref="paulding-james">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, for abolishing
							the Navy board under <persRef ref="mallory-francis">Mallory’s</persRef>

							Mallory’s successor, and there it has slept. <persRef ref="reed-john"
								>Reed</persRef> replied effectively to Crary, and Hoffman in a

						<p><persRef ref="triplett-philip">Triplett</persRef> of Kentucky offered a

							account of all the expenses of the Florida War. <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> objected, because it would

							army. <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> said that the
							appropriations since 1. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1836. not only

							>Pickens</persRef>, chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs

							hour— <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> moved to pass
							to the orders of the day while I was speaking— The Bankrupt Bill from
							the Senate was first taken up— Pickens moved to lay it on the table—
							There was a call of the house; and the Bill was laid on the table by a
							vote of 101 to 89.— The house then went into Committee of the whole on
							the state of the Union, <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Lincoln</persRef>
							in the Chair upon the Navy Appropriation Bill— The question pending when

							<persRef ref="cripps-george">Cripps</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"

								>Pickens</persRef> remonstrated against it, and I was obliged to
							decline— I spoke about half an hour against the amendment and the

							the previous question. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>
							asked him to withdraw it, for he had a precedent to produce of authority

							89. and the Resolution by 75 to 86— <persRef ref="gates-seth"
								>Gates</persRef> and <persRef ref="ogle-charles">Ogle</persRef>
							congratulated me on this signal triumph of pure principle, but I told
							Gates they would reverse it by a reconsideration before to-morrow night—
							The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the

							was in order upon this Bill. from this decision <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> had appealed. After
							a long renewed discussion of the question this morning the decision of

							whether the rejected joint Resolution had been taken by the <persRef

							the disagreement to the whole thirteen Sections superadded by the Senate
							which after some discussion he modified to strike out the first of those

							in his hand the rejected joint Resolution from the Senate which it was
							the duty of the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> to have
							taken to the Senate yesterday, before Noon, moved a reconsideration of
							the vote by which it was rejected— I enquired why the Resolution had not
							been transmitted yesterday to the Senate, upon which a long debate
							succeeded— I offered a Resolution, that the Clerk of the House by
							delivering privately to a member a joint Resolution of the
							Senate—rejected by the House had violated his official duty—and I
							produced Section 16 of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson’s</persRef> Manual as authority— It is perfectly
							explicit— All the screws of party machinery were now used. Motions to
							lay on the table previous questions,—appeals from the decision of the
							chair—until the administration majority succeeded in smothering all
							debate and were panting to reject by yeas and nays my Resolution, when
							to their great mortification I withdrew it.— Clifford’s motion to
							reconsider was then carried 108 to 54.— <persRef ref="everett-horace"
								>Horace Everett</persRef> endeavoured in vain to introduce an
							amendment— <persRef ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef> moved a
							reconsideration of the vote yesterday which rejected the amendment
							proposed by the Committee of foreign Affairs—lost 70 to 75 because
							several members mistook the question— Clifford’s amendment striking out
							the authority to the President to accept, but authorising him to sell
							and put the proceeds into the Treasury was carried 82 to 76 and the
							honest decision of yesterday was reversed by a smaller number than it
							was passed—and the Resolution was adopted 82 to 70.— The Resolution for
							exchange of books was also passed and the recess came before the morning
							hour commenced— After the recess, which I passed in the chamber of the
							Committee of manufactures, there was a long struggle for a Quorum, then
							a few reports from Committees received and then Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef>
							in the Chair upon the army appropriation Bill— <persRef

						<p><date>12. V. </date>Sunday</p>
						<p>I entered yesterday upon the seventy-fourth year of my age; and I have
							now lived as long since the decease of <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef> as she had lived
							when I was born— I am deeply sensible of the duty of beginning in
							earnest to wean myself from the interests and affections of this world,
							and of preparing myself for my departure to that which is to come—and
							yet the day of yesterday was so absorbed in worldly business, and
							worldly pleasure that not a moment of it was left for self-admonition or
							for meditation— The truth is I adhere to the world, and to all its
							vanities from an impulse altogether involuntary, and cannot by any
							exercise of my will realize that I can have but very few days more to
							live, and that I have nothing better or more urgent to do than to pack
							up and make ready for my voyage.— I might have taken, another warning to
							the same effect by attendance this morning at the Presbyterian Church
							where it was Communion day, and where <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> preached from Luke
							22.19. [“]And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
							unto them saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in
							remembrance of me.” A strictly adapted communion discourse, but not very
							impressive— The communicants were very few—the members of other churches
							present were invited to partake, but as I knew this was not intended to
							include the members of Unitarian Churches, I did not avail myself of the
							invitation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood invited also the members
							of other Churches present who might abstain from joining in the
							Communion service to stay while it should be performed; but if any
							should find that inconvenient, they would have the opportunity of
							withdrawing while a hymn, which he gave out should be sung— I
							accordingly withdrew—and after dinner attended at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— There the Evening service
							for the fourth Sunday after Trinity was read by a Stranger, Who preached
							from Exodus 32.29—[“]For <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> had said,
								<hi rend="italic">Consecrate yourselves to-day to the Lord</hi>,
							even every man, upon his son, and upon his brother; <hi rend="italic"
								>that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</hi>” The preacher
							took only the under-scored parts of the verse for his text; and the self
							consecration to the Lord, which he urged upon his auditory, had no
							affinity with that which Moses enjoined upon the Israelites in his text—
							The self consecration of the Israelite was to be effected by putting to
							death his Son and his brother, and the historical part of the
							transaction when this self consecration was commanded and executed
							seemed little adapted to recommend the same process in a very different
							manner at this day. Where then is the practical application of the
							precept? how is a Christian to consecrate himself to the Lord to day, in
							order that he may obtain a blessing this day? surely not by slaying his
							son and his brother, but by forsaking his sins and turning to
							righteousness— The preachers exhortation was warm and earnest— Evening
							at home, in solitude.</p>

								>Eastman</persRef>. The Committee concluded the examination of the

							with amendments to the house— HR.U.S. <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John
								Campbell</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Elections, produced

							palmed upon the house, are entitled to their Seats; as members from New

							yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>not two thirds— He then claimed to present it, as
							a privileged case— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>
							decided that it was not a case of privilege. The house reversed his

								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> insisted that both reports

							the Committee of Manufactures— Campbell had moved the printing of the
							majority and minority reports on the New Jersey election, and the
							journal of the Committee, and had called the previous question—but on
							hearing the minority report read, which reflected with great justice and
							severity upon the profligate proceedings of the majority, he modified
							his motion to print, leaving out the minority report, and still
							insisting upon the previous question— This dirty trick produced a burst
							of indignation from the whigs upon whigs, and Campbell covered the
							cheat, by playing the bully to cover the cheat. The yeas and nays were
							taken 3 several times; on printing the majority report, the journal and
							the minority report— They were all carried—the last by a meagre

								>Jameson</persRef> of Missouri, a Savage in temper, in looks, and I

							evidence or parties by a vote of 102 to 22. only 2 more than a quorum
							about 70 members present withholding their votes. Never was a cause lost
							by more dastardly submission than that of the voting whigs in this

							villainy. Adjourned about 9 PM. I came home and found <persRef ref="u"

								Cookman</persRef> preached from Ecclesiastes 9.11. [“]I returned,
							and saw, under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the
							battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to
							men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and
							chance happeneth to them all—” A valedictory discourse, specially
							addressed to the members of Congress, not more than ten or twelve of
							whom were present. I was belated, and he was just beginning the Sermon
							when I entered the Hall. The text was well chosen, and the discourse
							well suited to soften animosities and assuage Mortifications. Indeed the
							race has not been during this Session to the swift, nor the battle to
							the strong. The most important and the worst measures of the
							Administration have been carried through the house by the most
							contemptible men in it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman
							illustrated his text by many references to historical scriptural events.
							The discomfiture and destruction of Pharaoh— The death of <persRef
								ref="abimelech">Abimelech</persRef> slain by a tile cast from the
							hand of a woman.— That of <persRef ref="goliath">Goliath</persRef>, by
							the pebble from the sling of the stripling <persRef ref="david"

							the blast of the ramshorns blown by the priests, and the hanging of
								<persRef ref="haman">Haman</persRef>, upon the gallows fifty cubits
							high which he had erected for <persRef ref="mordecai">Mordecai</persRef>
							the jew, were all adduced as examples, that the battle is not always to
							the strong.— But the chief exhortation of the preacher was to mutual
							forbearance and forgiveness of which there is great need and little
							hope— <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Close of the first Session of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congress.</p>
						<p>H.R.U.S. met at 10. A.M— Large Quorum. I moved that the Committee of
							Manufactures, should be discharged from the further consideration of all
							matters referred to them, and upon which they have not reported— Call
							from various quarters for the same motion in behalf of all the
							Committees— Changed for a call on the Committees to report.—
							Nevertheless the general order of discharge was entered upon the

							it should be printed— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>
							objects on the pretence that the House knew not the contents of the

							Committee of Indian Affairs, the Reporter— The motion to print was taken
							by yeas and nays, and not obtaining a vote of two thirds was lost, and
							the Report was laid on the table. Orders of the day. I called up, out of
							turn, the Resolution which passed the Senate yesterday for paying
							arrears to the workmen on the Treasury building, from March till May
							last, while their labour was suspended by the Commissioner of Public
							Buildings; because he had neither money nor credit to pay them. <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">John W. Davis</persRef> of Indiana objected—upon
							which I moved a suspension of the Rules, and stated the hardship of the
							case of the workmen, and the equity of their claim—deprived of their
							occupation not by their own will, but by the Commissioner of the public
							buildings himself. Davis withdrew his objection— I moved an amendment to
							include the workmen on the Patent building, carelessly omitted in the
							Resolution from the Senate—carried without opposition— Resolution passed
							and the Senate immediately concurred in the Amendment— <persRef
								ref="fisher-charles">Charles Fisher</persRef> of North-Carolina said
							as this was completed—that is a good work done; and one of the workman

							the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> on the last day
							of the Session— One hour, the last of the Session allowed for the
							consideration of Bills relating to the Territories.— The omnibus Bill
							was in the mean time passed. At 1. P.M. Committee of the whole on the
							Territorial Bills— Casey in the Chair— The first Bill taken up was that
							to raise 1600 men additional to the army, to suppress Indian hostilities
							in Florida Objection made that it was not a territorial bill— <persRef
								ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> so decided; and upon appeal his

							has been for some time following his vocation in Florida. He told me
							that the appropriation of 300000 dollars in the army Bill for the

							public money, and that no imagination could conceive the corruptions in
							the management of the Florida War which he had witnessed, and of which

							he himself had brought in <persRef ref="osceola">Oseola</persRef>, under
							the faith of a white flag, which <persRef ref="jesup-thomas"
								>Jesup</persRef> violated by detaining him as a prisoner— That

							body—sold for 3000 dollars and sent to New-York for public exhibition
							there— That then an offer was made of 1000 dollars a week for seven
							weeks of such exhibition; but by the interposition of some one who
							threatened a popular movement of indignation against it if it should be
							attempted, it was prevented and the head sent back to S<hi

							possession of Doctor (name not remembered)— He said Oseolas body was
							also boiled down, and the bones were taken out of it and dried, and
							carried to Charleston South-Carolina— Sherburne is so notorious a liar,
							that no one believes a word that he says, unless otherwise vouched— He
							further told me that he had found among <persRef ref="u">his

								ref="adams-john">John Adams</persRef>, by <persRef ref="wood-john"
								>John Wood</persRef>, which he had been advised to republish; he

							who thought it immensely interesting, and he had been assured that if
							republished at New-York, ten thousand copies of it would be sold in that

							him I should neither give my consent or dissent to its publication— I
							cared nothing about it— I had known the book nearly forty years for a
							worthless budget of lies compiled by a renegade English literary
							poacher, once bought up and suppressed not by the Hamilton’s but by
								<persRef ref="burr-aaron">Aaron Burr</persRef>, and afterwards
							published by treachery to him— I called at the Bank of the Metropolis; a

							Notes— Also 1200 dollars, all at 5 per cent interest, 40 dollars in half
							eagles, and 1. dollar 60 cents in silver, making my pay and mileage for
							the last Session of Congress 2241 dollars 60 cents— Mileage reduced by

								Frye</persRef> was here this morning and spoke to me of my private
							concerns in this City which have been for several years under his
							management and care— They are very troublesome, and during the Session
							of Congress it is utterly impossible for me to give any attention to
							them. The Columbian Mills, instead of being as I had flattered myself
							they would be, when I bought them a profitable property, are a perpetual
							drain upon my income; and the course of business has so changed by the
							multiplication of flour mills all over the Country, the decay of
							Georgetown, and the Baltimore and Ohio Rail road that the value of the
							Estate has almost dwindled down to nothing. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frye spoke about the insurance of my property here which I
							have neglected for several years. I gave him the policy upon <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Adams’s</persRef> house; which expired in Nov<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> 1838 when we left it— I gave him also <persRef

							Letter of 9. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1837.— He has a judgment

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua Dodge</persRef> came to take
							leave— He goes to-morrow Northward to embark again for Europe, as an
							Agent to negotiate with the Governments in the North of Europe for the
							reduction of duties upon Tobacco— The Cultivators of that weed have been
							these three or four years agitating the Country with their claims and
							Dodge has been once upon a Tobacco mission which proved partially
							successful. On the last day of the last Session <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> gave notice that unless the
							European duties on Tobacco shall be reduced before the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of next January he will ask leave to
							introduce a Bill for levying countervailing duties— There seems to be an
							opinion creeping in that the tobacco interest which embraces six or
							seven central States, may be brought over to the protective system—
							Dodge earnestly requested me to peruse his report on the taxation of
							tobacco in England, France, Germany and Russia; and to give particular
							attention to a large tobacco-trade Document of which 5000 extra copies
							were recently ordered to be printed by the House of Representatives—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dodge is going to <persRef

							>Mary-Louisa</persRef>, to the Capitol, where I found only one of the

							Morning. We heard the Music of the Marine band. I exchanged a passing
							greeting with <persRef ref="mareschal-wenzel">Baron Maréchal</persRef>
							the Austrian Minister, and <persRef ref="martini-adrien">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Martini</persRef> the Chargé
							d’Affaires from Holland—and with <persRef ref="vattemare-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexandre Vattemare</persRef> from
							whom I cannot escape— He was after me two or three times yesterday, and
							will call again, Monday Morning.— After a ride round by the Navy-Yard we
							returned home, and I finished the day in drudgery to assort and file my
							papers. I have hundreds of Letters unanswered, and not even duly filed—
							Loose public documents and pamphlets and newspapers innumerable.— I am
							packing up four large boxes of them, and of books to send by water round
							to Boston, which is another grievous trouble— At least 49 50<hi
								rend="superscript">ths.</hi> of my unanswered Letters, are from
							total strangers, and utterly worthless.— Multitudes of Applications to
							attend public meetings; and to deliver Orations—Addresses, Lectures, to
							Lyceums, Literary Societies and political gatherings of the People.—
							Household cares are superadded more and more burdensome with the advance
							of years— Anxieties for the journey for the return home, and for those I
							am to leave behind.— An hourly reminded and daily deepening
							consciousness of decay in body and mind; an unquenchable thirst for
							repose, yet a motive for clinging to public life; till the last of my
							political friends shall cast me off, all this constitutes my present
							condition— These are my cares and sorrows—but with them I have
							numberless blessings for which I cease not to be grateful to the author
							of all good, and I have the cheering hope of a better world beyond the
							grave. The late Session of Congress has been painful to me beyond all
							former experience by the demonstration which it has given of
							degenerating institutions. Parties are falling into profligate factions—
							I have seen this before; but the worst symptom now is the change in the
							manners of the People— The continuance of the present Administration,
							will if accomplished open wide, all the flood-gates of Corruption— Will
							a change produce reform? Pause and ponder! Slavery—the Indians— The
							public Lands— The collection and disbursement of public monies— The
							Tariff, and foreign Affairs— What is to become of them?</p>

						<p>I rose with a dull headache, and was unwell all the morning. I went
							however to the Presbyterian Church where after waiting some time for the
							preacher <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Lellan</persRef> informed the congregation that <persRef
								ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> was
							absent from the City, but had told him he would engage a person,
								<persRef ref="chapin-stephen">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chapin</persRef>, President of the Columbia College to supply the
							pulpit— It was past 11. and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chapin did
							not appear—after waiting 5 minutes longer I left the Church, and went to
							the Methodist foundery chapel where the pews were all as crowded as they
							could hold, with decent respectable well dressed people men, women and
							children, not one of whom I personally knew— They politely gave me a
							chair at the corner of the aisle at the left hand of the pews fronting
							the pulpit. There was not a spare seat in the pews. There were two
							Ministers in the pulpit—one of them <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef>, preached from
							Isaiah 55.6. “Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him
							while he is near”— He said he had been greatly perplexed this morning to
							fix upon a text from which he should discourse this day. That he had at
							home at least five hundred sketches for Sermons which he had prepared,
							and one hundred and fifty of which he had never preached any where, he
							could not find among them one which suited him for this day. But he had
							often of late thought of giving notice a week before hand, that he would
							on the next Sabbath address a discourse especially to the young. Instead
							of which he would perform that duty now— And he particularly asked the
							attention of the younger portion of his hearers to what he was about to
							say.— But it did not appear afterwards, why he had asked the special
							attention of the young.— He subsequently addressed separately and in
							succession the old and the middle aged as well as the young and his
							exhortations to them to seek the Lord while he may be found, and to call
							upon him while he is near, were equally urgent, appropriate and
							pathetic— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton is not very eloquent,
							but he drew from me many tears— But his definition of seeking and
							calling upon the Lord was “Religion”—the Species defined by the Genus—
							Religion! what Religion— The inherent defect of all calvinistic
							preaching is practical application. Oliver Cromwell said, when they
							thought he was seeking the Lord he was only seeking a cork screw— The
							duties of Man to God, are worship, reverence, gratitude, submission and
							resignation— All in sentiment—prayer and praise in action; which the
							vilest, as well as the worthiest can and do perform.— I believe the only
							acceptable obedience to God conists in Justice, charity and mercy to
							man— After dinner at 5. I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church, where <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening
							service for the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity
							and preached from Jeremiah 31.34. [“]And they shall teach no more every
							man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying Know the Lord: for
							they shall all know me, from the least of them, unto the greatest of
							them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
							remember their sin no more:” We all spent the Evening at <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye’s</persRef>. I walked down there, and <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Smith</persRef> returned with us.</p>

								Vattemare</persRef> was here this morning, and proposes now to go to
							Baltimore, Philadelphia, New-York and Boston, before proceeding upon his

							here to take with him to France for various public institutions there
							and for which equivalents will be given in exchange— His design embraces
							medals, coins, natural curiosities, and Newspapers, of which he has
							already collected upwards of a thousand. He urged me again to write a
							dedication to the people of the United States for his American Album;
							but I told him this was a species of composition which every man could
							write better for himself than for another; and if he would write his
							dedication in French, I would with pleasure translate it for him into

							conversation with him respecting the wretchedly<hi rend="superscript"
							> </hi>dilapidated Navy Pension fund— He had seen the Resolutions which
							I offered to the House on this subject, and which they refused to
							receive. He complained that they had equally disregarded his own reports
							and even a special message of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> recommending an appropriation of 50000 dollars
							to pay the Pensions due on the first of this Month. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Paulding that I doubted the authority of
							the Department, to sell at a discount State bonds, purchased at or over
							par.— He said he had been forced to do it, or to stop the payment of the
							Pensions which would have excited a great clamour— I said that would
							have compelled Congress to provide for the payments— I told him further
							that it was my purpose to resume the subject at the ensuing Session of
							Congress— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hagner gave me an Order, from
							the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef> upon the
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							for 1075 dollars 39 cents as Attorney of Ebenezer Lobdell— I called on
							the Secretary of War, and condoled with him on the loss of the
							appropriation for magnetic and meteorological observations— He said
							there was a good Article on the subject in the English Quarterly Review
							for June— I took his order to the Secretary of the Treasury, who said he
							would send me to-morrow morning a draft on the Receiver general at
							Boston. I condoled with him on the loss of the Revenue Bill.— These

								Frye</persRef> brought me this morning a statement of his account as

							exact and minute leaving a balance of 622.47. in his hands to provide

							charge—constant vigilance and discretion— Everything that constitute an
							intelligent agent; and a result by which the income from the Columbian
							Mills—the dwelling house next my own abode; the dwelling house in the
							Pennsylvania avenue and the dwelling house next to <persRef

								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>—
							He promised to send for the back file of my Intelligencer and have them

							of the ominous rumours against <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">Nicholas
								Biddle</persRef>, now he said, known to be fals but leaving
							suspicions of the darkest character afloat, and a fall of the stock from
							70 to 63 per cent in one day. At the Bank of Washington, where I could
							not draw my deposit but by a sacrifice of 2 1/2 per cent. At the Clerk
							Office of the House of Representatives where I left directions to have
							forwarded to me the remaining sheets of the House Journal yet to be
							printed, and the returns of Commerce and Navigation to Sept<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1839. <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi

							what to do with the papers of the case of <persRef ref="hooe-george">Lieut<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Hooe’s</persRef> Court Martial.— Their proceedings were referred to
							the Committee on the Judiciary to report the existing Law, and what
							shall be done— On the last day of the Session <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> chairman of the judiciary
							Committee sent to the clerk’s table under a general order a Resolution
							that the Committee be discharged from the further consideration of the
							subject, and a minority report signed by <persRef ref="samuels-green"
								>Green B. Samuel</persRef> of Virginia, <persRef ref="crary-isaac"
								>Isaac E. Crary</persRef> of Michigan, and <persRef
								ref="turney-hopkins">Hopkins L. Turney</persRef> of Tennessee,
							expressly stating their full conviction after examination that by the
							existing Law, the testimony of coloured persons must be received—and
							with the report a Resolution that the papers be recommitted with
							instructions to report an amendatory Law either prohibiting the
							employment of coloured persons in the navy, or rendering them
							incompetent to bear testimony— Burch was doubtful how those papers
							should be entered on the Journal, and wrote to Sergeant for advice— He
							received Sergeant’s answer this morning and read it to me. He says he
							was told by a member of the Committee, he believes correctly that there
							was a motion to reconsider.— He therefore declines advising; and <hi
								rend="strikethrough">Garland</hi> Burch said he must write to
								<persRef ref="garland-hugh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
