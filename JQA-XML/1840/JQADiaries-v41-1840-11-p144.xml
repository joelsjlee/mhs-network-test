							preached from Proverbs 13.21. [“]Evil pursueth sinners.”— A plain
							Discourse easily divided into illustrations of the manner in which evil
							pursues the different classes of Sinners.— The dishonest man—the
							intemperate man—the profane swearer—he did not touch upon the gambler,
							the fornicator, the infidel; nor specially upon the hypocrite— He had
							difficulty in reading his Discourse—his eyes, his teeth, his voice, his
							Memory are all in decay; his articulation is so indistinct, and his
							utterance so feeble that I heard not more than half his Sermon— <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>
							came out from Boston and brought budgets of newspapers and news from
							Philadelphia and New-York.— <persRef ref="haughton-richard">Richard
								Haughton</persRef> Editor of the Boston Atlas came from Philadelphia
							yesterday morning at 9. O’Clock and brought reports of the election of
							Presidential Electors, the day before in Philadelphia, and the adjoining
							Counties of Bucks, Chester and Delaware— The result in the four Counties
							is favourable to the whigs, but the authenticity of the returns is not
							sure, and the gain is so small that there is little hope of
							Pennsylvania— The New-York papers are filled with electioneering plots
							and counterplots from which I cannot escape the conclusion that fraud
							and violence, are creeping and breaking fearfully into our elections—
							These practices were first introduced by the mob government party, who
							call themselves democrats, and one of their most impudent devices, is to
							charge their adversaries with their own crimes.— This they did but too
							successfully in the case of the New-Jersey election, and they are
							playing the same game over again in New-York. <persRef

							[“]And the boys grew: and <persRef ref="esau">Esau</persRef> was a
							cunning hunter, a man of the field; and <persRef ref="jacob"
								>Jacob</persRef> was a plain man, dwelling in tents.” a beautifully
							contrasted character of the two brothers and of their fortunes and
							descendants— He attributed this to the difference of their religious
							principles: and while tracing the sublime and melancholy series of
							vicissitudes which have distinguished the children of Israel from the
							days of their progenitor down to their present dispersion all over the
							earth he marked its transcendent superiority over the brief prosperity
							and awful extinction of the race of the Edomites and the recently
							discovered ruins of their city upon the rock, now called, Petra. He
							referred to the 49<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> chapter of <persRef

								Smith</persRef> came from Boston this morning with <persRef ref="u"

							New-York so early as the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and promising

							of my own— <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> also came out
							for an hour or two but returned before dinner.— He is nominated as a
							candidate, one of 35. from Boston, to the House of Representatives in
							the Legislature of this Commonwealth— It was urged upon him last year,
							but he declined. We had an early dinner; and at two O’Clock P.M.

								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John

								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> who had passed
							the Night here, went home to <persRef ref="adams-ann">her

								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef> to go to the City to-morrow— I was under
							peine forte et dure with occupations—but <persRef ref="ellis-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Ellis</persRef> of
							Dedham came and spent two hours of the afternoon, with me about the
							Pension claims of <persRef ref="dunbar-relief">Relief Dunbar</persRef>
							and others, the Pension of <persRef ref="bussey-benjamin">Benjamin
								Buzzey</persRef>, <persRef ref="ogle-charles">Ogle’s</persRef>
							speech, the furniture of the President’s house and other gossip. About
							Sunset <persRef ref="moore-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Horatio Moore</persRef>, and <persRef ref="burton-warren">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burton</persRef> came in from Waltham.
							I had written to <persRef ref="moore-nelson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Nelson Moore</persRef>, that I would deliver a Lecture
							to the Adams Association there next Saturday evening. They came to say,
							that by a previous engagement of the whig Association at Waltham the
							town hall would be occupied by <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert C. Winthrop</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="dexter-franklin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin Dexter</persRef>, in addressing the whigs on Saturday
							Evening, and it would be necessary to change the Evening for my Lecture
							to the Adams association, and I accordingly agreed to go, next Tuesday
							Evening, instead of Saturday— They wished me also to go to be there at
							an early hour of the Evening; and I agreed to be ready at my Son’s
							house, from half past 3 to 4 of the afternoon for the Carriage which
							they are to engage to take me to Waltham and back.— Being in some
							perplexity with regard to the second of my political Lectures, which is
							dry, dull, and too political, I took an old unfinished Essay upon
							Society written about twenty years ago, and wrote two pages, merely to
							bring it to a close, and I shall endeavour to pass that off for a
							Lecture.— It was written at leisure and is therefore much better
							composition than any thing that I can write now— Of course my labour
							upon the Chinese lecture is suspended, and I am ready to give it up in
							despair— I wrote unremittingly from the dusk of Evening till half past
							11. when I retired to my solitary bed. </p>

								ref="parkman-francis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis
								Parkman</persRef>, to dine with him and the Trustees of the humane
							Society next Friday.— At 6 O’Clock, <persRef ref="warrenn-george2">M<hi

							and took me over, to his house at Charlestown. I walked thence with him
							just before 7. to the town-hall, which was already filled with a crowded
							auditory.— As the Clock struck 7. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren
							announced to the Lyceum, that the Lecture next Tuesday Evening would be
							delivered by <persRef ref="ware-henry2">Professor Henry Ware jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> of Cambridge, and would be
							entitled the biography of the Globe— He then introduced me with a
							complimentary phrase; and I said that as a Lecture was announced to them
							for next Tuesday on the biography of the globe I might call that which I
							was about to deliver to them, the biography of <hi rend="italic"
								>man</hi>— And I delivered the Dissertation on Society, which was
							listened to, with deep and silent attention, and a hearty clap of
							approbation at the close— I then returned with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Warren, who is a lawyer at Charlestown, to his house where I
							met a numerous party of Gentlemen; and after an hour of conversation,
							and a plentiful supper I returned to my Son’s house at Boston. <persRef

								<persRef ref="bates-joshua2">late Chaplain of the House of

							substituted this Lecture, for that which I had prepared on Democracy.

						<p><persRef ref="lawrence-jane">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary Jane
								Lawrence</persRef> came, this morning, and represented to me with
							many tears her distressed condition, for want of the pension to which
							she thinks herself entitled as the widow of <persRef
								ref="lawrence-jonathan">a man</persRef>, who served as a Soldier in
							the last War with Great-Britain, and died in the service— Her case is
							one of those, upon which the existing Law grants a pension for five
							years which she has received. She cannot perceive the humanity of a Law
							which grants a pension for five Years and then stops it.— Nor do I— But
							Congress have hitherto inflexibly adhered to it, and I could not give
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lawrence any cheering hope of a more
							liberal temper at the approaching Session— <persRef ref="parkman-george"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman</persRef> was
							here, and proposed to me to go with him to morrow Morning and visit the
							pauper establishments of the town at South-Boston, of which he says
							there are three, and I agreed to go— He told me that the man of the
							ticket office at the Masonic Temple, told him that there were 5000
							persons turned off last evening, because there was no room to admit them
							into the Hall— Perhaps 5000 meant 200— <persRef ref="welsh-harriet"
								>Harriet Welsh</persRef> came and I went with her and visited
								<persRef ref="lee-hannah2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> George T.
								Lee</persRef>, to thank her for a copy of a Memoir of the Life of
								<persRef ref="adams-hannah2">Miss Hannah Adams</persRef> written by
							herself, and which M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lee had printed a few
							years since, with a preface by herself— It was not printed for
							publication; but M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lee had sent me a copy
							of it at the time when it was printed— I wanted last Summer another copy
							to send to <persRef ref="smith-mharrison">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> M. Harrison Smith</persRef>, and Harriet Welsh obtained
							it for me from <persRef ref="miller-hannah2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> George T. Bigelow</persRef>— I sent it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Harrison Smith, and received a few days
							since from her a Letter of thanks; saying that she valued so highly the
							volume that she could not think of parting with it, and would have it
							transcribed to send to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vail</persRef> the information which he wanted.— While we were at
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lee’s, <persRef ref="simmons-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Simmons</persRef> the
							ex-abolition preacher at Mobile came in— They spoke of my last Evening’s
							Lecture, and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lee expressed a wish to
							read it— Her hearing is impaired, so that she attends no public
							Lectures.— I consented to her reading it, and Harriet Welsh asked my
							leave to take a copy of the two Stanza’s on wedded love, which I
							introduced into it, last Evening, which I also yielded— She took the
							Lecture to M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Lee with a promise to return
							it, in a day or two— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							returned from Quincy, where he delivered last Evening an Address to the

								Brooks</persRef> was here this morning and invited me to dine next

							of my dining out here.— <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman</persRef> came and took
							me over to South-Boston where we visited two of the City
							Establishments—the hospital for the insane, and the house of correction—
								<persRef ref="butler-john2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Butler</persRef> being the superintendant of the first,—and <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Rogers</persRef> of the second— There are of the
							insane 97 men and 92 women—each sex in apartments separate from the
							other—distributed in three stories, one above the other each floor
							having an entry from side to side of the house with small chambers each
							side of the entry in each of which was an iron bedstead fastened to the
							side of the Wall a mattress and comfortable bedding and a chair, each
							Patient having a separate bed chamber, and all the range of the
							central-entry to walk about in— All neat and clean, and white-washed to
							a gloss— Of the inmates all appeared thoroughly and mournfully insane;
							but not one frantic or violent— All, violently wild, and some menacing
							in their looks; and three or four, annoyingly talkative— Of the whole
							number only one woman was confined to her chamber. The hospital for the
							sick, the bake-house and the kitchen were in different parts of the
							building and all appeared to be kept in perfect order— The arrangement
							of the workhouse was similar to that of the hospital, excepting that
							there was a separate call for each convict, and no common entry where
							they could communicate with each other. It was just as the men had dined
							each in his cell, and they were marched out in Indian file, in total
							silence, and each man, with his arms folded as he marched— The women
							were all in one large upper chamber seated in rows of chairs one before
							the other all sewing or knitting in silence without speaking to one
							another— The are two other establishments in that neighbourhood which we
							did not see.— The house of correction for vicious boys, and the asylum
							for the blind— Returning homewards D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Parkman left me at <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrences</persRef> door, and I
							paid him a visit— At home, <persRef ref="ripley-samuel">M<hi

								>Charles’s</persRef> Study, and wrote two hours—then returned to
							bed, and without sleep rose again at half past six for the day. Attended
							the morning service at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef> Church and
							heard him from Genesis 31.49. “And Mizpah; for he said, the Lord watch

							parting of <persRef ref="laban">Laban</persRef> and <persRef ref="jacob"
								>Jacob</persRef>—and by generalization, upon the final parting of
							Friends, one from another. The historical exposition of the transactions
							between Laban and Jacob, naturally fell into the subject of the
							discourse; but he did not dwell much upon that—but he commented well on
							the pathetic incidents of the separation— The heap of Stones, the
							Pillar—the Covenant—the appeal to God—the Heap of Witness (Galeed) and
							the Heap Witness (Mizpah) and the charge upon Jacob to take no other
							wives than Jacob’s daughters, were congenial to my views of the progress
							of civilization— The conclusion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham’s discourse was exquisitely beautiful— There were two copies
							in Charles’s pew, one of which he gave to me of the Sermon preached last
							Sunday Morning, on All Saints day, and which has been printed— Returning
							from Meeting <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Bancroft </persRef>passed by me in the crowd
							going out of the door. We barely recognized each other as we passed— I
							received a Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, written at Washington, last Thursday. They arrived
							there, all safe, Wednesday Evening, after a pleasant journey [symbols] I
							wrote half a page of answer, and left it with <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">Charles’s wife</persRef> to finish, and send by
							the mail— We dined at one, and Charles then took me out to Quincy. He
							returned immediately to Boston, but I am to remain here till Tuesday
							Morning. <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George W Beale</persRef> called this evening with a subscription
							paper signed by <persRef ref="savil-samuel">Deacon Savil</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="bass-josiah">Captain Josiah Bass</persRef> and one
							other to call a parish meeting, to consider the expediency of raising
							the parish rates by taxing the pews. My parish taxes are about five
							times what they possibly could be if levied on the pews; but the tax
							would bear upon the poor by relieving the Landholders— I declined
							subscribing the paper, and said I was willing to bear a very
							disproportionate burden, to ease those who think themselves unable to
							bear any, and to keep peace and harmony in the church, which would
							certainly be disturbed by any attempt to change the mode of levying the
							tax— I wrote three short Letters this morning, and one this Evening: and
							gave the rest of the time to the reading of <persRef
								ref="staunton-george">Sir George Staunton’s</persRef> account of
								<persRef ref="macartney-george">Lord Macartney’s</persRef> abortive
							negotiation with the Chinese about the Ko Tow.— The Election excitement
							is at its highest pitch. <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van

							probably though not certainly lost New-York All is uncertainty here.

						<p>Rain all night, and almost without intermission the whole of this day and
							evening— <persRef ref="thayer-elihu">Elihu Thayer</persRef> a native of
							Braintree, now residing in Quincy near Neponset Bridge, came to speak of
							a revolutionary pension claim of his mother <persRef ref="thayer-phebe"
								>Phebe</persRef>, widow of <persRef ref="thayer-timothy">Timothy

							year and a half ago to the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of
								Pensions</persRef> from whom no answer has been received— I promised

							of this day in searching for the lease to <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"
								>Alpheus Spear</persRef> of the Mount Wollaston farm, and for the
							manuscript of my version of the Psalms— I did not find the lease; but
							did find the manuscript, which is incomplete—the first 30 and five or
							six others not being included in the copy— I was so absorbed in this
							search, that the hour of Noon stole upon me before I was aware, and I
							had concluded to wait till after dinner before going to the town Hall to
							vote; but just before 1. <persRef ref="carr-john2">J. J. Carr</persRef>
							came, and urged me to go and vote immediately, for he feared that they
							would close the polls, before dinner— I went with him and took a printed
							ticket on which were the names of Governor; Lieutenant Governor,
							Senators for the County—Electors of President and Vice-President U.S.
							Representative for the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Congressional
							District and Representative of the town in the State Legislature— My own
							name was on the list for Representative in Congress— I tore it off, and
							then tore from it the name of <persRef ref="brown-charles2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown</persRef>, for Representative of
							the Town— I then offered the two fragments of the ticket, which the
							Select-man declined receiving— I then said I should not vote at all; and
							they consented to receive my two papers pinned together. After dinner I
							went first to the Bank, and took up a check for 100 dollars— Then to
								<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt’s</persRef>, but he was gone to Boston—next to <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Greenleaf</persRef>, both of

								ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eliot</persRef> the

							obliged again to leave my papers in extreme confusion, and had not time

							help of the Boston Customhouse in 1838. into a secret nomination against
							me, as Representative in Congress for the 12<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The life I lead is trying to my Constitution, and cannot be long
							continued with impunity— Repose and regularity of hours and occupations,
							are essential to my health and to what remains of my capacity for useful
							labour— I live in continual bustle; a succession of Chinese Shadows,
							successive banqueting, late and early hours and political excitement and
							conflict, which stretches my old machine upon the rack— My eyes are
							threatening to fail me—my hands tremble like an aspen-leaf— My Memory
							daily deserts me—my imagination is fallen into the sear and yellow leaf,
							and my judgment sinking into dotage— The day before yesterday, <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> was elected one of 35
							representatives of this City of Boston, in the Legislature of this
							Commonwealth— This is his first entrance into public Life, and may the
							blessing of God shield, and protect, and cheer and prosper him in this
							career— On the same day I was re-elected to represent the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts
							in the House of Representatives of the United States— Should my life and
							health be spared to perform this service, I shall have been the only
							representative of the District during the ten years of its existedce— I
							had represented in one Congress the preceding District of Plymouth—
							Before the next Election for Congress the Districts will be re-organized
							and new modelled; and then will be a proper time for me to withdraw, and
							take my last leave of the public service. This morning I went with
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">Charles’s wife</persRef>, and her
							daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa-Catherine</persRef>, and
							visited <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Dexter</persRef>, and <persRef ref="king-sarah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> King</persRef>, widow of <persRef
								ref="king-edward">Edward King</persRef> of Cincinnati, Ohio, and
							daughter of <persRef ref="worthington-thomas">Thomas
								Worthington</persRef>, with whom I sat five years in the Senate of
							the United States.— She has been residing several years at Cambridge,
							superintending the education of <persRef ref="king-rufus3;king-thomas"
								>her two Sons</persRef> and of three nephews, all of whom have now
							been graduated— Her Sons are now at Philadelphia, whither she proposes
							to remove, to finish their education, one for the Law and the other as a
							merchant. We next visited <persRef ref="amory-mehitable">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Amory</persRef>, whom I once knew as
							Mehitable Sullivan; then as M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cutler,
							afterwards wife of my classmate <persRef ref="amory-jonathan">Jonathan
								Amory</persRef>, and now his widow— She is now 70 years of age and I
							knew her at 16. She was then as she is now an example for her sex,

						<p>North-east and South-east rainstorm, the whole day and evening through—

								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>

								Gray</persRef> had lent me, and the leaf from the hymn book
							containing the lines on the death of an infant and the version of

							my psalms for his compilation at his pleasure— And that if he could find
							it for his own interest to publish the whole book of the Psalms, I asked
							his acceptance of the copy-right— He thanked me, without expressly
							accepting my offer; and said that in the manuscript that I had sent him
							there were passages which would require my revisal— In fact the copies
							never were collated with my first draughts. He enquired if my version
							was not all in one measure. Most of it is in the 8 lined Stanza, of 8
							syllabled alternate rhymes— But some are in the 8 and 6 line and some in

							Frothingham, from Philippians 2.4— “Look not every man on his own

						<p>The subject fell in remarkably with a part of my Lecture upon Faith, and
							contains many of the same thoughts— The duty of caring for others as

							Meeting I went with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi

								<persRef ref="cary-george2;cary-helen">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Paine was one of three daughters of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cushing, who formed part of the Society frequented by me in Boston from

							third son of <persRef ref="paine-robert">judge Robert Treat

							short residences at Boston from 1801. to 1809. I remember not to have
							met or seen her— Since then I have not resided in Boston, nor seen M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Paine— Her husband died young. M<hi

								ref="appleton-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathan

							At 7. the Cars started— There had been a sharp frost and it was bitter
							cold— But the Sun rose clear, and the day was fine— The first stop was
							Framingham.— The second at Westborough, and at each of them was a horse
							shoe table, with Coffee-grounds, cold tea, and stale gingerbread for

								<persRef ref="palfrey-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Palfrey</persRef> who was in the Worcester Car—going to see a child
							he has there— About 10. we stopped about ten minutes, and then proceeded
							through Brookfield and Warren to Springfield where we arrived at 1/2
							past one, and found the worst dinner that has fallen to my lot for many
							years— At Springfield, a letter was delivered to me from <persRef
								ref="spencer-george2">George G. Spencer</persRef> informing me that
							he would be ready to receive me at Hartford and recommending to me to
							lodge at the City Hotel— At Springfield 96 miles from Boston the
							Rail-way terminates— Thence we came in a Stage 28 Miles to Hartford
							where we arrived a quarter before 6— In the Stage I had two travelling
							companions, one from Maine and one from Kentucky—the latter with two
							ladies.— They tempted me to talk more than Prudence would warrant as
							often happens to me from the vanity of hearing myself talk— At the City
							Hotel, I found <persRef ref="trumbull-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer who had given me the

							with two or three other Gentlemen, and accompanied me to the
							presbyterian Church where I delivered the Lecture on Faith— The house
							was crowded— The pulpit whence I spoke indifferently lighted— My head
							swimming, after a chilly day, a ride of 120 miles, in Rail-way Cars and
							Stages, and since breakfast a very scanty meal— But this I believe
							carried me through— The audience were deeply attentive, and manifested

						<p>At 1/2 past 5. A.M. I took the Cars from Hartford to New-Haven. My tavern
							bill, at Hartford had been paid— The Night had been frosty; and the
							morning was bitter cold— But the Sun rose bright and the whole day was
							fair— In the cars two passengers introduced themselves to me—<persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkins</persRef> of Buffalo
							New-York, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis</persRef>, Sheriff of the County of New-Haven— I talked again
							too much. At 8 A.M. we arrived at New-Haven, and I took lodgings at the
							Tontine Hotel— Breakfast— Immediately after, <persRef
								ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Roger Sherman
								Baldwin</persRef> called on me, and invited me to his office in his
							house, whither I went with him— He read to me sundry papers, and gave me
							one containing an argument, drawn up, by him all, relating to the
							Negro-prisoners taken in the Amistad— We had two hours of conversation
							upon the whole subject, in which he exposed to me his views of the case;
							the points which had been taken before the District and Circuit Courts;
							and the motion to dismiss the appeal which he supposes the proper course
							to be taken before the Supreme Court— He read to me numerous authorities
							on the several points which he proposes to urge at the trial; and said
							he hoped the Supreme Court would take up the case in the first or second
							week of the Session.— I visited the prisoners, with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin— <persRef ref="wilcox-luis">M<hi

							two deep on both sides the length of the chamber— They are all but one
							young men, under 30. and of small stature—none over 5 feet 6.

						<p>I wrote 3 hours this morning before breakfast with practical experience
							of the due employment of time. The loss of these Morning hours is too
							often unavoidable in travel, and made so yet more frequently by
							indolence and sluggishness— As I came down to breakfast a young man
							named <persRef ref="robinson-william3">William E. Robinson</persRef>
							introduced himself to me, and asked me for my autograph signature, which
							I entered upon his book— He said he was a native of Ireland, now a
							Student in the Senior Class at New-Haven. He was over-officious in his
							attentions, which I attributed to good motives, and he accompanied me to
							the Steamer New-Haven which at 8. cast off from the wharf for New-York—
							On board the boat, was another Student of Yale-College, named <persRef
								ref="u">Hoffman</persRef>, a Nephew of <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah"
								>Ogden Hoffman</persRef>, of the junior Class.— He was a fellow
							passenger with me in the boat— Robinson introduced him to me; and
							specially recommended me to his attentions— Hoffman, a very well bred
							youth, without being intrusive, did shew me every kind attention that he
							could have shewn to his father— He told me that Robinson was a great
							politician, and an ardent whig; and that during the canvas for the
							recent election, he had gone round many of the towns in the
							neighbourhood, and addressed the People in favour of <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef>— Our passage to New-York,
							90 miles was easy, but the atmosphere was full of snow, and too chilly
							to keep the deck— About 11. O’Clock it began to snow, with a light
							breeze from the South-west, which soon changed to the North-east and
							freshened— Driven down into the cabin my yesterday’s fellow traveller
							from Kentucky drew me again into a political conversation more verbose
							than discreet.— There was among the passengers a whig member of Congress
							elect from Pennsylvania; in the place of <persRef ref="mcculloch-george"
								>M’Cullough</persRef>— We reached the wharf at New-York at 2.
							O’Clock P.M. and after half an hour of detention amid the shipping to
							get along-side the wharf, and a fisticuff battle between a hackman and a
							Steamer-man, young Hoffman procured me a Hack, with which I came to the
							Astor-house. Met there <persRef ref="smith-isaac4">Isaac T.

						<p>Besides the names in the margin sundry other visitors called on me this

								Griscom</persRef> President of the New York Lyceum came and urgently
							solicited me to stay here over to-morrow, and to delive at the

							Evening at Brooklyn— He said it would purchase at least 500 volumes of
							books for the Library— After some hesitation I consented to stay;
							doubtful of my own discretion, but hoping that my motive was good— I had
							parted yesterday from <persRef ref="marchant-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Marchant</persRef>, with the
							understanding that as I was to be here only this day, and could give him
							only one sitting he had given up the purpose of painting my portrait—
							After concluding to stay till Saturday, I went to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Marchant’s and told him I could sit this
							day and to-morrow, if it should suit him, and accordingly I sat nearly
							two hours before, and one after dinner— <persRef
								ref="frelinghuysen-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frelinghuysen</persRef> invited me to dine with him tomorrow—
								<persRef ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W.

							whose collection of pictures is still kept by <persRef ref="reed-mary"

							<persRef ref="stcecilia">Saint Cecilia</persRef>, and light, humorous

							representing the course of Empire by Cole, are more remarkable for the
							design than for the execution—much of both are borrowed from <persRef
								ref="lorrain-claude">Claude</persRef>— There is one picture of the
							hunter state—one of the pastoral and agricultural state, for each of
							which there should be one, and three for the splendour, the decline, and
							the ruin of a magnificent city— They are pleasing and striking pictures—
							The first seven Presidents of the United States are ranged in their
							order—myself and Jackson painted by Durand; and the rest good copies by
							him from <persRef ref="stuart-gilbert">Stuart</persRef>— Returned to the

							Catholics; but I thought it in this Country sufficiently controuled by

							in professions of gratitude for the service which they said I had

							me some portion of their profits— They neither said what those profits
							were; nor what portion of them they proposed to offer me— I said that I
							wished them to apply whatever they proposed to offer me as a donation
							from me to the purposes of the Society— The only fellow passenger to
							Philadelphia whom I knew was <persRef ref="mitchell-charles">Charles F.

						<p>I was able this morning to write for a couple of hours before breakfast.
							Met at the breakfast table <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Fenton Mercer</persRef> who
							after 22 years of service in the house of representatives of the United
							States, last Winter in a fit of despair accepted an Office as Cashier of
							a Bank at Tallahassee in Florida; and is now going to England I suppose
							to raise the wind for that institution. Mercer is one of the most
							respectable natives of Virginia, and has devoted his life to the
							internal improvement of the Country, and to the gradual extinction of
							Slavery in the State— In both of these benevolent and exalted purposes
							his exertions have been abortive— The Savage and barbarous genius of
							Slavery has not only baffled them all, but has kindled a flame of
							popular odium against him, from which he has shrunk into the cashier of
							a bank at Tallahassee— A noble Spirit doomed to drudge in the mines! I
							called at <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Sergeants</persRef> and walked with him and <persRef
								ref="sergeant-margaretta">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef> to the Episcopal Church where <persRef
								ref="odenheimer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Odenheimer</persRef> read the morning service for the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and preached from
							Ephesians 6.17. “And take the helmet of Salvation”—he observed that
							there was some obscurity in the text as to what the helmet of Salvation
							was: but that from another text 1. Thessalonians 5.8. it was ascertained
							to be Hope; and thus opened the general subject of all the
							encouragements of religion— The discourse was apparently one of a
							series, upon the several weapons of the whole armour of God— The
							preacher is a young man moderately eloquent, and his amplification of
							the virtue and efficacy of Hope as a Christian virtue was instructive
							and might have been specially useful to me— Particularly his quotation
							from <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>,
							who had <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, because he had fought the good
							fight; and had kept the <hi rend="italic">faith—</hi> As I was coming
							out of church <persRef ref="middleton-mary">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Middleton</persRef> spoke and named herself to me. I
							had not seen her for more than twenty years— She had then several young
							children, but was young and beautiful— Now she has the remains of beauty
							blended with the marks of deep affliction upon her face— I should not
							have recognized her She is English born, and bears an excellent
							character— I dined with <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> N. Biddle</persRef>, en famille, with
							no other addition save <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">judge
								Hopkinson</persRef>.— We sat after dinner, settling the Nation till
							near 8 in the Evening, little satisfied with the result— Hopkinson is
							snug in port. Content with his office of District judge— Undisturbed by
							Ambition or fear.— Biddle broods with smiling face and stifled groans
							over the wreck of splendid, blasted expectations, and ruined hopes. A
							fair mind—a brilliant genius, a generous temper an honest heart, waylaid
							and led astray by prosperity—suffering the penalty of scarcely voluntary
							error—tis piteous to behold.— The judge accompanied me to my lodgings.
								<persRef ref="mitchell-john6">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Mitchell</persRef> called; and <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef> successively came in, and I passed the remainder
							of the Evening till near midnight with them— Connell has again been
							unfortunate, and told me he should be under the necessity of applying to
								<persRef ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> for an
							Office— This worthy man’s ups and downs in life have been numerous and
							lamentable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton resides in Summer

								ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

								<persRef ref="taylor-janette">Janette Taylor</persRef> for herself
							and the other representatives of John Paul Jones, dated 12. December
							1836. and then referred to the Committee on Revolutionary Claims.— No

									>r</hi> Caleb Cushing</persRef> reported from the Committee of

								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of State John
								Forsyth</persRef> upon a Resolution of the Senate of 1. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1836. referring to him the Memorial of
							Janette Taylor, to that body. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowden
							shewed me now a Letter to the Secretary of State, enquiring if he had
							any further information of the condition of the claim— And he asked my
							advice whether it would be proper for him to address this Letter to the
							Secretary— I told him I saw no objection to it; nor to his calling
							personally on the Secretary of State, and conversing with him on the
							subject. This evening I received another Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowden stating the result of his
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth; and sending
							the printed copy of the house Document N. 19 and a Manuscript copy of

							terms that I would take charge of the <hi rend="italic">advocacy</hi> of
							the claim in the house; and closing with a notice that he should leave

							he would not he was turned off without being admitted to the presence of
							the Emperor— It is plain that the moment that pretension shall be broken

							whimsical, and flighty, but not of unsound mind— I called on the
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> at

						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church in the morning I heard a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef>, whose text was from John 11.38
							[“]Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself cometh to the grave— It
							was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.” The first clause of the verse—the
							argument of the preacher was humanitarian— That Jesus was a perfect man
							subject to all the sinless infirmities of human nature— The argument of
							his divinity was not encountered; but was taken for granted— A much
							knottier point— That he lived and suffered and died as a man can hardly
							be questioned by any one who believes that he ever existed— His
							superhuman nature so often asserted by himself—his express
							declaration—before <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> was <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">am</hi>—the very name by which God commanded <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> to
							call him— The affirmation of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef> that
							by him, God made the world, his continual assumption of the two
							characters, son of God and Son of Man compel me to believe that he was
							more than man— I cannot mythologize his miracles—and least of all that
							of his resurrection from the dead. His gospel is a standing miracle
							which I cannot controvert—his divinity is a mystery which I cannot
							believe, and which I see no necessity for believing; any more than the
							eternity of future punishments. I was not much pleased with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore’s discourse; which was full of dark
							and gloomy imagery, without urging any profitable doctrine or exciting
							any cheerful sentiment— The congregation is yet very thin— The seceders
							claim the church and I have an unanswered Letter from then demanding my
							concurrence with or acquiescence in their claim— But they hold their
							meetings as yet, at what is called the Medical College.— The secession
							as I understand was occasioned by the engagement of <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> a New-England Congregationalist, as
							preacher in this presbyterian Church— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for the first Sunday in
							Advent, and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berry</persRef> a native of the
							Island of Jamaica, educated at the University of Cambridge in England
							preached from Psalm 19.6. “His going forth is from the end of the
							heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid
							from the heat thereof.” The Sermon began with a superficial analysis of
							the two parts of this most beautiful Psalm, between which he did not
							appear to understand the admirable connection— There was no want of
							ingenuity or of handsome composition in the discourse; but what it was
							after I could not discover, unless it was to reprobate the practice of
							hanging up paintings on religious subjects in churches—a doctrine for
							which there might be some occasion in England but for which there can be
							none here.— The Evening service now begins here at half past 3— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Berry did not finish till after Sunset,
							and he had much difficulty in reading the last pages of his Sermon— He
							just made out to announce four Stanzas of a hymn; but the choir could
							see to sing only two of them— <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> took
							tea here. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> went home with her, and spent the Evening

							with an expectation of obtaining any thing at this short Session—but the
							claim may gain some advancement upon the business of the next Congress.—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson has been two years Consul of
							the United States at Altena, but found it would not give him bread— He
							needs some small office for subsistence, and has talents and learning
							which may be usefully employed. <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>

							Lecture upon Faith at the Tabernacle in New-York, and he thought there
							were four thousand persons present— I doubt if the building will hold
							three thousand— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was also here; and <persRef ref="henry-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"

							where at last I found him— The <persRef ref="whitcomb-james">Commissioner of the Land-Office Whitcomb</persRef>
							was with him. I spoke to him of the case of the Negroes of the Amistad,
							to come before the Supreme Court of the United States at their Session
							next January, on appeal, by the U.S. District Attorney from the decision
							of the District and Circuit U.S. Courts in Connecticut— M<hi

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> requesting that the case may be
							taken up, the first week of the Courts sitting, but thought there would

							the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> the expedient of having the case dismissed by consent,
							without argument; for which I urged obvious reasons, and which he said
