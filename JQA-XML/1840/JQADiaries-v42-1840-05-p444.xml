						<p>The <persRef ref="friedrichsthal-emanuel">Chevalier
								Friederichsthal</persRef>, attached to the Austrian legation, is
							going on an excursion in the course of which he intends to visit Boston—
							I had yesterday written Letters of introduction for him to <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> and to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> which I had promised
							him, and also one to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
							which I gave him this morning. In an hour’s conversation with me he told
							me that he had last Summer visited and traversed the Islands of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Domingo, Jamaica and Cuba, with the
							purpose of observing attentively the relative condition of the
							population in the three different states of long continued freedom, of
							Slavery and of recent emancipation. It was apparent that the result of
							these observations was very unfavourable to African, for his great
							admiration was concentrated on the flourishing condition of Cuba, his
							anticipations quite unpromising to Jamaica—and his severest
							animadversions reserved for Saint Domingo. He promised to send me his
							comparative statistical tables for the three islands which he did this
							Evening— They fully confirmed my expectations.— His visit detained me so
							that I found the clerk reading the Journal of yesterday, when I entered
							the House— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> moved to go
							instanter into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the
							appropriation Bill; which was done after postponing at the motion of
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>, the report of
							the select Committee upon the brawl between <persRef ref="bynum-jesse"
								>Bynum</persRef> and <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
								Garland</persRef> till next Monday— <persRef ref="casey-zadok"
								>Casey</persRef> took the Chair of the Committee— <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> had the floor upon an amendment
							which he proposed to offer to the appropriations for the public
							buildings after the rejection of the amendments proposed by <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef>, which he considered as
							certain— I could stand this no longer— I rose and asked if Jones,
							Chairman of the ways and means seriously intended to persist in opposing
							Petrikin’s amendment—to stop the work upon the public buildings, and to
							leave the workmen partly unpaid for the wages they had already earned?
							Jones with some faltering at first avowed that he did; but afterwards
							worked round to a consent that the appropriation should be increased to
							60000 dollars on the Treasury building, to pay the workmen their wages
							already earned. I gave him a volley for resisting any part of Petrikin’s
							amendment— He attempted to divert the attention of the Committee to my
							overheated manner—talked of the shin-plasters of my favourite
							institutions, and said he supposed I wanted an entering wedge to
							increase the appropriation for the custom house at Boston— I replied to
							him with an abated vehemence of manner— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"
									>Gov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hunt-hiram">Hunt</persRef> aided me with argument— Stanly
							consented to withdraw his amendment if Jones would accept the two
							amendments of Petrikin, which Jones however refused—but upon taking the
							question by tellers there was a large majority for Petrikin’s
							amendments— In the course of the Evening <persRef ref="ogle-charles"
								>Ogle</persRef> made his second Speech on the furnishing of the
							President’s House; and replied with extreme severity to some
							animadversions of Governor Lincoln upon his former Speech— Lincoln now
							made an instantaneous highly spirited and triumphant defence of himself,
							and turned the tables and the laugh upon Ogle to universal admiration.
							But it was a very unprofitable controversy to the whigs. The debate
							continued again till near Midnight— I walked home.</p>

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi> Clay</persRef>; and also from <persRef ref="dunbar-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Dunbar</persRef> of Abington, who brought me a Letter of introduction,
							from <persRef ref="bartlett-ibrahim">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ibrahim Bartlett</persRef> of Quincy, and was accompanied by
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunnewell</persRef>
							of Charlestown, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wade</persRef> also from the County of Middlesex— They are all

								<persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef>, as Candidates for
							the Offices of President and Vice-President of the United States at the
							Presidential Election next December; which was made at Harrisburg last
							December— This Convention is expected to consist of delegates by
							thousands— It proves how wide spread and how deeply rooted is the
							disaffection to the Administration of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Martin Van Buren</persRef>.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hunnewell told me that when I sailed from Charlestown in August 1809. in
							the ship Horace for S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, he had
							been engaged as a Cabin boy in the same ship—that he lost the voyage by
							the change of the Captain; to his great disappointment. That he has
							followed the sea for many years since that time; but has now settled
							down in permanent residence at Charlestown— I was about half an hour
							belated at the house which I found in Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> in the
							chair hard at work on the civil and diplomatic appropriation-Bill. The
							Committee of investigation upon the <persRef ref="swartwout-samuel"
								>Swartwout</persRef> and <persRef ref="price-william2"
								>Price</persRef> defalcations, had made two reports Majority and
							minority, both inculpating <persRef ref="throop-enos">Enos T.
								Throop</persRef>, Naval Officer at New-York but now Charge
							d’affaires at Naples <persRef ref="maxcy-virgil">Virgil Maxcy</persRef>
							Solicitor of the Treasury, now Charge d’Affaires to Belgium, and
								<persRef ref="gilpin-henry">Henry D. Gilpin</persRef> Solicitor of
							the Treasury, now Attorney General all for neglect of duty in their
							several Offices, from which cause Swartwout’s delinquency was going on
							and increasing for a succession of years undetected <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> had moved to strike out the
							appropriations for the salaries of these persons, and a long debate
							ensued upon the merits of the reports and of these Officers— As a set
							off for delinquencies <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert
								Smith</persRef> charged that General Harrison had remained six
							Months at home after being appointed by me, Minister to the Republic of
							Columbia; and started off as soon as he had ascertained that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> was elected in my place— I
							noticed this mode of defending present, existing remediable
							delinquencies by adducing old false charges of delinquency as
							justification. <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> attempted to
							discredit the reports by insisting that the House had not acted upon
							them— I made a short reply to him— The reports were presented on the
							last day of the Session, and were not even printed till weeks after the
							Congress was extinct— The items were all retained; and after much
							further debate the Bill and amendments were reported to the house,
							passed to a 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> reading 145 to 15. and
							passed. About 7. O’Clock the house suspended the rules and adjourned to
							8. Monday Morning then to adjourn over till Thursday, to have the
							Carpets taken up and Hall put in its summer dress— Also for attendance
							at the Baltimore Convention and the races.</p>

						<p>When I came home last Evening, I found <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss
								Cutts</persRef> here, but she soon went away— I know not how to
							describe the effect upon my body and mind of such a week as I have just
							past—labouring day and night in legislative deliberation, upon a measure
							the final consummation of which was scarcely susceptible of divided
							opinion— War against an administration upon the petty details of an
							appropriation bill suits neither my taste nor my principles— I was ready
							to pass it as it went into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union— Its worst feature was a pitiful attempt to filch about 100000
							dollars from the sums indispensable for the completion of the public
							buildings, by defrauding the poor workmen upon them at daily wages, of
							their dues— This attempt I contributed to defeat, and the appropriations
							in the bill are sufficient to pay up all the arrearages, and to continue
							the works— They had actually suspended them, and left the workmen
							without employment— Several of them yesterday morning accosted me as I
							was walking to the Capitol, intreating me to use my influence with
								<persRef ref="noland-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Noland</persRef> to set them to work again— I spoke to <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef>, who told me both he and
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> had advised
							Noland to set the men to work. I sent for Noland himself and intreated
							him to do so— He said he was willing, but <persRef ref="keim-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Keim</persRef>, an
							administration member of the Committee on the public buildings had told
							him it was doubtful whether the appropriation would pass— I asked him to
							set the men to work on my responsibility, and he said he would— I had
							this morning another visit from the <persRef
								ref="friedrichsthal-emanuel">Chevalier Friedrichsthal</persRef>, and
							an hour of conversation with him— He said he had been mistaken in
							telling me that the black and coloured population of the Island of St
							Domingo had diminished within the last forty years, but that it had not
							much increased, and that all its other sources of prosperity were
							constantly declining— He thinks that the natural abode of the African
							race is within 8 degrees North and South of the equator, and that the
							Negro is physically morally, and mentally inferior to the European and
							the Caucasian man. He departs upon his tour next Wednesday.— I attended
							the morning public worship at the Presbyterian Church, and heard
								<persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef> preach from Psalm 119.126. [“]It is time for thee,
							Lord, to work; for they have made void thy Law”— No signs of the
							Church’s filling up— But he gave notice of the distribution at the
							church doors of a tract in four pages which head recently fallen in his
							way, entitled more than fifty reasons for attendance at church on the
							Sabbath— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns Church
							the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Price</persRef> read the Evening
							service for the second Sunday after Easter and preached from Luke 9.23.
							[“]And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny
							himself,—and take up his cross daily, and follow me.” The duty of
							submission to the afflictive dispensations of Providence enjoined in
							handsome composition and good delivery with some superfluous quotation
							of verses— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef> was there
							and walked home with me. Going to Baltimore to-morrow—and thence to
							Philadelphia.</p>

						<p>One of our horses has been very sick ever since last Friday, and I must
							do all my travelling again on foot— I walked this morning to the Capitol
							and at precisely 8 O’Clock found the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> already in the chair and the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> reading the Journal of Saturday.
							There were about twenty members present— They immediately adjourned. I
							went into the Law Library chamber, and there consulted several books to
							trace the doctrine of the English lawyers, that Nations are not bound to
							respect or protect each others revenue laws— I made extracts from
								<persRef ref="blackstone-william">Blackstone</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="emerigon-balthazard">Emerigon</persRef> and the Term Reports,
							without being able to complete my enquiries— The first development of
							the doctrine is in the Statute of 19 George 2. c. 37. against wager
							policies—excepting vessels engaged in trade with Spain and Portugals
							dominions. Blackstone says that the reasons for this exception are
							sufficiently obvious, and betrays a consciousness of their dishonesty by
							suppressing what they were— Emerigon explains Blackstone’s meaning to
							be—smuggling— And <persRef ref="buller-francis">Buller</persRef> in the
							Term Reports says he had heard <persRef ref="murray-william">Lord
								Mansfield</persRef> say it was to encourage the smuggling trade with
							the Spanish and Portuguese Colonies— <persRef ref="pothier-robert"
								>Pothier</persRef> insists with great force that the principle
							itself is wrong—which Emerigon admits, but justifies the French practice
							as a sort of reprizal upon that of the English and Spaniards— In the
							case of <persRef ref="amory-thomas">Amory</persRef> vs <persRef
								ref="gilman-nicholas">Gilman</persRef>— 2. Massachusetts Reports p.
							1. the judges of the Supreme Court of that State incline to the opinion
							that at common Law, wager policies was not valid; and that the Statute
							of 19 George 2. c. 37. was never adopted in this Country. The result of
							all for which I collect these facts is to explain the principles upon
							which the Yorkshire clothiers, encouraged by Act of Parliament and
							King’s Bench judges, practice smuggling in foreign Countries— And this I
							wish to connect, would that I could with the trial of <persRef ref="u"
								>Wood’s</persRef> case, at New-York, and the systematic smuggling of
							the importers of woollens, requiring, further Legislative provisions as
							well for the collection of the revenue as for the protection of our own
							manufactures— After spending four hours in this Law Library, I went to
								<persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hassler’s</persRef> establishment, where he is carrying on at once
							the mapping for the Coast Survey, and the fabrication of weights and
							measures for distribution to all the States and Custom houses of the
							Union— The weights and measures are all of brass, and a foundery is a
							part of the establishment— There are a number of astronomical
							instruments old and new for the survey of the coast and he has more than
							twenty men at work under him, engineers for the mapping and all Germans
							for the weights and measures. Hassler himself and his whole
							establishment would be admirable subjects for <persRef
								ref="hogarth-william">Hogarth</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="cruikshank-george">Cruikshank</persRef>, and still better for a
							Daguerrotype fac-simile.—If I had a month of leisure I would look deeper
							into them—100000 dollars have been this year appropriated for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler’s labours without a murmur. I
							walked home in the face of a hurricane which almost blinded me with
							showers of gravel dust— Too much wearied and exhausted for evening
							toil.</p>

						<p>The continual labour night and day last week, in the house of
							Representatives has so close an affinity to the dissipation of worldly
							life, that I have not recovered from it yet; for steady application to
							business— I called this morning on the <persRef ref="edwards-james"
								>Commissioner of Pensions</persRef>, and left with him a Letter from
								<persRef ref="lewis-charles">Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Pierce</persRef> of Brooklyn L.I. enclosing two certificates in
							support of the claim of <persRef ref="reeve-phebe">Phebe Reeve</persRef>
							to a Pension— And thence I went to the Capitol, and there spent two
							hours in making extracts and reading cases on the question of the
							lawfulness of wager policies, and the encouragement of smuggling in
							foreign countries— A subject to which I cannot do justice— I made the
							extract from <persRef ref="pothier-robert">Pothier</persRef>; whose
							censure upon the English doctrine of encouraging the trade of smugglers
							in foreign countries appears to be just— There is one principle indeed
							which may justify the illicit trade countenanced by <persRef
								ref="murray-william">Lord Mansfield</persRef> and encouraged by the
							Act of Parliament of 19. George 2. ch. 37— The Spanish and Portuguese
							exclusive monopolies of their colony trade; by forbidding all
							intercourse of foreigners with them was a violation of natural right;
							and nature will vindicate her rights The Sovereign power of Spain and
							Portugal did not warrant their sanguinary laws of exclusion— Foreigners
							might be justified in evading them; nor could the Governments of those
							foreigners be blamed for countenancing and encouraging them in their
							evasion— This plea could not be urged by the Britis Government which
							excluded all foreign trade with their own Colonies; though not so
							ferociously as the Spaniards and Portuguese— <persRef
								ref="emerigon-balthazard">Emerigon</persRef> gives an extract from
							the <persRef ref="raynal-guillaume">Abbe Raynal</persRef>, denouncing
							all these exclusive monopolies, and if Governments violate the Laws of
							natural justice, their subjects seem scarcely
							<unclear>sensu</unclear>rable for evading them by fraud. I was obliged
							to hasten home to dinner, without closing my researches; and I had
							evening visits from <persRef ref="pratt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Joseph Pratt</persRef> of Carver, who brought me a

						<p>The members of the Baltimore whig convention of young men, are flocking
							to this city by hundreds— The convention itself consisted of thousands;
							an immense unwieldy mass of political machinery to accomplish nothing—to
							form a procession polluted by a foul and unpunished murder of one of
							their own marshals, and by the loss of several other lives— I am assured
							that the number of delegates in attendance from the single State of

								<persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="preston-william2">William C. Preston</persRef> Senators of the

							glorification of <persRef ref="harrison-william">William Henry
								Harrison</persRef> and the vituperation of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>— I found in the
							Globe of last Evening a notice—of a trial before <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">judge Hopkinson</persRef> at
							Philadelphia—upon a seizure of under invoiced woollens, upon which after
							56. days of conflict in court, the jury were out not more than 11.
							minutes, and returned a verdict for the prosecution— As the report of
							this trial, might be of use in the discussion upon my revenue Bill— I
							called at the Office of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of
								the Treasury</persRef> and enquired if he had received any report of
							the case from the <persRef ref="read-john">District Attorney</persRef>
							or Collector at Philadelphia— The only information that he had of the
							case was a paragraph in a Philadelphia Newspaper which he gave me— But
							he asked the comptroller <persRef ref="barker-james">Barker</persRef> to
							write to Philadelphia for a copy of Judge Hopkinson’s charge to the jury
							and a report of the trial. <persRef ref="buchanan-james2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Buchanan</persRef> the Senator from
							Pennsylvania came in while I was there, no enquire concerning the
							renomination of some drunkard whom he patronizes and whose commission is
							to expire next July. I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury
							concerning the payment of Treasury Notes, and upon what terms they are
							now issued. He referred me to the first <persRef ref="miller-jesse"
								>Auditor</persRef> for payment, and said that he had now proposals
							to take Treasury Notes at 5 2/5 and also at 5 percent— I enquired if
							there was any thing new respecting the boundary by the Great Western
							recently arrived— He believed not— He mentioned that the Surveyor at
							Cincinnati had been sued and damages laid at 20,000 dollars for a
							seizure of imported goods owned in England I spoke of the Letter
							received from him respecting crude and refined Saltpetre; upon which I
							thought the Committee of Manufactures would not act— I went to the
							Capitol, and made extracts from <persRef ref="phillips-sm"
								>Phillips</persRef> on Evidence; and examined authorities on the
							disqualification of witnesses interested in the question of the suit— At
								<persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> door I met great
							numbers of the delegates from the Baltimore Convention many of whom were
							introduced to me, by members of Congress— Others in the Library chamber.
							This afternoon I had a visit from <persRef ref="crooks-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crooks</persRef> the Canadian
							claimant, and in the Evening from <persRef ref="osborne-thomas">M<hi

							House of Representatives—with six of the Delegates from that State—
							There was also a numerous assemblage of the delegates this Evening, in
							front of the City hall, where they were addressed by sundry members of
							Congress and others.</p>

						<p>I attended this morning at the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures
							but no other member of the Committee was there— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> brought there, and introduced to me several
							members from New-Jersey of the Baltimore whig Convention of young men—
							The City is flooded with them—and I was told that not less than six
							hundred of them came on in the cars yesterday morning— This was the day
							fixed for the consideration by the house of the revenue collection Bill
							N. 100 reported by the Committee of manufactures. <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>, chairman of the Committee
							of Ways and Means is gone home to Virginia. The acting chairman,
								<persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> came and asked me
							to allow the amendments of the Senate to the general appropriation Bill
							to be taken up—to which I consented— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Military Affairs
							asked to be, and was excused on account of ill health— The House then
							went into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, upon the
							Bill N. 100 <persRef ref="bell-john">John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee in
							the Chair; the Bill was read through, and the Chairman directed that it
							should then be read by Sections— I sent to the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef> table one of the fifty
							memorials from the manufacturers upon which the bill was founded, and
							after it was read the Clerk was proceeding to read the first Section of
							the Bill, when <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> of
							South-Carolina started up, and moved to recommit the Bill— The Chairman
							asked him if he proposed any amendment to the first Section—he said his
							objection was to the whole bill—he was told that his motion to recommit
							was not in order, and he moved to strike out the enacting clause—and
							then made a speech of half or three quarters of an hour against various
							provisions of the Bill— The amendments of the Senate to the
							appropriation Bill having then come in, Atherton with my consent moved
							that the Committee should rise, which they did— The House then took up
							the amendments of the Senate to the general appropriation Bill, one of
							which was to strike out the item of 45000 dollars for the second and
							third Volumes of <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clarke</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="force-peter">Force’s</persRef> Documentary History of
							the United States; in which amendment the house after some debate
							concurred by yeas and nays 73 to 48 a close party vote— The house then
							at my motion made the Bill N. 100 the special order of the day for
							to-morrow and adjourned about 5 O’Clock— I had visits after dinner from
								<persRef ref="crane-adoniram">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crane</persRef> of Richmond Virginia, a young man recently married
							to my niece <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. D. Bache</persRef> President

								Trist</persRef>, Consul of the United States at the Havana was here
							this morning, and I had a long conversation with him, upon the charges
							against his official conduct which are now under consideration by the
							Committee of Commerce of the House of Representatives— The charges are
							of two kinds—first by several masters of vessels complain of abusive
							official ill treatment of them—and secondly of his gross and culpable
							connivance at the African Slave trade carried on from the United States,
							chiefly from Baltimore through the Havana— I had received two Letters
							from him urging me to bring the matter forward in the House of
							Representatives; and I assigned now to him my reasons for declining to
							do this— The chief of which was that under his solemn protestations of
							innocence, and his undoubting confidence of proving it— I was not
							willing to place myself before the House and the Country in the attitude
							of his accuser— He said it was his perfect confidence in the success of
							his defence that had made him desire that the investigation should be
							undertaken by me.— He has just now returned from Baltimore where he has
							been as a witness upon two trials for Slave-trade cases: in both of
							which the defendants were acquitted—both, he says undoubtedly guilty. I
							suppose it as impossible to convict a Slave trader at Baltimore as in
							the Island of Cuba, and I fear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Trist’s
							defence rests on the same basis as that of the late defendants at
							Baltimore; the inexecutability of the Law. He told me that no man’s life
							would be safe who should attempt to execute the Law at the Havana—
							Immediately on the meeting of the House, they went at my motion into
							Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee in the Chair, upon my
							revenue Bill N. 100— The day was spent in debating it.— <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> followed up his assault of
							yesterday with more pertinacity than success— After some discussion, he
							withdrew his motion to strike out the enacting clause, and moved that
							the Committee to rise and report the Bill, with the view to move the
							recommitment of the Bill to the Committee of Manufactures— Upon this
							motion he made a second Speech of half an hour—opposed by <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef>, and myself and the motion
							was rejected by a majority of more than three to one— The bill was then
							taken up by Sections as it should have been at first— Rhett moved to
							strike out the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section, but after full
							discussion this motion was also rejected.— The debate was continued to
							the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section, sundry amendments proposed
							by Tillinghast and <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> being
							adopted as they proceeded— <persRef ref="curtis-edward">Curtis</persRef>
							moved to strike out part of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section
							whereupon the debate was protracted till past five when at <persRef
								ref="habersham-richard">Habersham’s</persRef> motion the Committee
							rose without a quorum— I moved that the Bill should be made the special
							order of the day again for to-morrow, but there was no quorum to vote—
							The races had taken off upwards of one hundred members, and I had been
							obliged to move a call of the house to get a quorum vote upon one of the
							incidental questions raised by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhett—
							Adjourned at half past 5. Rain almost all day. I rode home, and wasted
							great part of the Evening in slumber and in writing verses on the wants
							of man—</p>

						<p><date>9. V:30. </date>Saturday</p>
						<p>The weather is so cold and raw, with much rain that we have been obliged
							to rekindle the fires in the dining room and in my own chamber— I
							finished last Night almost sleepless and this morning my verses upon the
							wants of man.— I suppose it is my intense anxiety for the Bill now under
							my charge which bereaves me of sleep, and the composition of verses,
							trifling upon another is the only mode of relieving myself from the
							continual pressure upon the brain of thought upon one subject, through a
							sleepless Night— I partly rode this morning to the Capitol with my
							Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> who was
							going to School, and in the house immediately after the reading of the
							Journal they went at my motion into Committee of the whole on the State
							of the Union, upon the Revenue Bill N. 100. <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Bell</persRef> of Tennessee in the Chair— The question pending at
							the adjournment yesterday, was upon <persRef ref="curtis-edward"
								>Curtis’s</persRef> motion to strike out a clause in the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section relieving the United States from
							the payment of costs on the appointment of a Commissioner on their part
							to attend at the taking of a deposition abroad at the instance of the
							defendant in a suit instituted by the United States for a forfeiture or
							a fraudulent entry— The motion to strike out was rejected in the
							Committee— But the Section the most hotly contested as yet, and perhaps
							of the whole bill, was the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which I had
							already proposed to amend, very considerably restricting it compared
							with the Section proposed by the <persRef ref="hoyt-jesse"
								>Collector</persRef> and district <persRef ref="price-william2"
								>Attorney at New-York</persRef>— The Section disables the testimony
							of persons having the same interest with the party to the suit, though
							not interested in the event of the suit itself— <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> was ferocious for striking out
							first the amended and then the original Section—but the question to
							strike out the original, and insert the amended Section was carried by a
							considerable majority, and then the motion to strike out the amended
							Section was debated for the remainder of the day— The three members from
							the City of New-York, <persRef ref="monroe-james2">James
								Monroe</persRef>, Curtis and <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah"
								>Hoffman</persRef>, <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D.
								Barnard</persRef>, <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef>, <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, came out in
							legion strength against it, and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"
								>Tillinghast</persRef>, a member of the Committee of Manufactures
							gave it up and turned against it— <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> and <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef> sustained me with good service— <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> of North-Carolina promised me that
							he would but did not—the question upon striking out was taken by tellers
							48 to 66.—no quorum. I had already been obliged to move a call of the
							house to obtain a quorum on a preceding question It was now near six
							O’Clock— The Committee rose and the House adjourned.— There was a
							meeting of the Convention upon Education in the Hall this evening which
							I could not attend—but I met <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickinson</persRef>
							at a party at <persRef ref="tayloe-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Stansbury</persRef> gave me last evening seventy pages of his
							report, of the debate of the preceding day with a request that I would
							revise my part of it to have it in readiness for the printer this
							morning. 45 pages. This was impossible— <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> came this morning to
							enquire if the manuscript was ready. It would have been, but for the
							extracts from books and vouchers which I read and, my comment upon which
							constituted nine tenths of my speech. There can be no adequate
							conception without them and some of the very books from which I read the
							extracts are locked up in the Law Library at the Capitol. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales said it would of course be
							impossible to print that part of the debate in the Intelligencer
							to-morrow. I told him I had not yet received for revisal <persRef
								ref="wheeler-henry">Wheeler’s</persRef> part of my speech on the
							resolution for abolishing the Committee on the public expenditures— He
							said that must be preceded by <persRef ref="ogle-charles"
								>Ogle’s</persRef> speech on the general appropriation Bill— I
							observed that he had not yet published my report on the Smithsonian
							bequest— He said the difficulty was that it would occupy from twelve to
							fourteen columns of the paper; but it should be published as soon as
							possible— I walked to the Capitol, and heard the <persRef
								ref="newton-robert">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Robert
								Newton</persRef> a celebrated and eloquent preacher of the British
							Wesleyan Methodists, very recently arrived from England, and
							representing that denomination, as their delegate from the British
							Conference— He preached from Philippians 3.8. [“]Yea doubtless, and I
							count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
							Jesus, my Lord:”— The excellency of the knowledge of Christianity, and
							the sacrifices of all other things to obtain it, formed a copious theme
							for the discourse— It was eloquent, argumentative, logical, persuasive,
							but in a thoroughly beaten and somewhat hacknied path; dealing largely
							in generalities, and more ethical than pathetic.— In comparison with
								<persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cookman</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton’s range of
							power is perhaps more comprehensive but less energetic.— I spoke after
							the Sermon with <persRef ref="sewall-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sewall</persRef>, who introduced M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Newton to me; and with <persRef ref="storrs-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William L. Storrs</persRef> a member
							of the house from Connecticut, who had yesterday given me a Letter, to
							read from R. S. Baldwin, the leading Counsel of the Africans of the
							Amistad— I cannot suppress, and yet must controul. There is a scandalous
							mistranslation of one of the Spanish papers, in the Document N. 185.
							noticed by <persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef>, and concerning which I received this day a Letter
							from <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef> of New-York—
								<persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary E. E. Cutts</persRef> was here this
							afternoon and went with me to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church, where <persRef ref="boyd-fw">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boyd</persRef> read the Evening service for the third Sunday after
							Easter, and preached from Acts 18.17. “And <persRef ref="gallio"
								>Gallio</persRef> cared for none of those things.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyd’s Discourse was upon the sin of
							indifference to religion. It is not advantageous to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyd to be heard on the same day, after

							with resolutions and petitions which they wished to present, but my
							motion prevailed, and the Speaker gave the Chair to <persRef

								>Rhett’s</persRef> motion to strike out the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Section of the Bill as amended, and the motion was rejected
							62 to 83.— In the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section, Rhett moved
							to strike out the disqualification for holding an Office annexed as a
							penalty for any custom-house Officer, aiding and abetting any fraud on
							the revenue. He denied the right of Congress to add to the
							disqualifications declared by the Constitution. Others concurred with

								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> moved an additional
							section making it penal for any subordinate Custom-house Officer to
							receive presents for the performance of his duty, which after some

							report the Bill and amendments.— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac"
								>Holmes</persRef> of Charleston, South-Carolina then rose and said

							not be started to deprive him of the opportunity of shewing that this
							was the most pernicious Bill, and the most subversive of the rights of
							the People that was ever presented to the consideration of the American

							till the gentleman should have had full range to his heart’s content to
							expose before the house and the world, all the horrors of the Bill—upon
							which there was a shout of laughter and the Bill was reported to the

							Chairman of the Committee said he was ready. It was postponed till
							to-morrow— The Bill to ensure the more faithful execution of the laws

								>Evans</persRef> from the Committee of Ways and Means offered an

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac"
								>Holmes</persRef> made a speech of nearly two hours against the
							whole Bill, immediately after which the previous question was moved and
							seconded. The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> said the

							separate vote was taken by yeas and nays upon the motion to strike out
							the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Section, which motion failed 72 to
							85— The vote for the engrossment of the Bill was 122 to 30. and it was
							immediately read the third time by its title and passed without a
							decision— The house immediately, about half past 2 adjourned, for the
							members to go and examine and invention to prevent the explosion of
							Steamboat boilers: I went into the Senate chamber mentioned the passage
							of my bill to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> and requested his particular attention
							to it, which he promised— No gratitude can equal my obligation for the
							reward of all the preparatory labour and study that I have given for the
							discussion of this Bill; nor could there be a more impressive admonition
							to me, faithfully to persist in the same practice.— Evening visit from

								Saltonstall</persRef>, who lodges only two doors from our house, was
							robbed last in his bed chamber while asleep— <persRef ref="reed-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed</persRef> was robbed two or
							three weeks since at his lodgings in the same way. I called this morning
							at the Office of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, and informed him of the passage of the revenue
							Bill, and of the vehement and pertinacious opposition which it
							encountered in the house— I said it was now before the Senate, and would
							need there the support of the friends of the administration— And I would
							suggest to him the expediency of conferring with the <persRef
								ref="wright-silas">Chairman of the Senate’s</persRef> Committee of
							finance upon it. I told him I had not yet had the opportunity of laying
							before the Committee of Manufactures his communications respecting crude
							and refined Saltpetre, and I warned him of the discontents roused by the
							recent new constructions of the Tariff Laws, on this and other subjects—
							I have received several Letters upon this subject of crude and refined
							Saltpetre, and one from <persRef ref="degrand-peter">P. P. F.
								Degrand</persRef> at Boston— At the House <persRef
								ref="henry-thomas">Henry</persRef> presented a Memorial from Beaver
							County Pennsylvania, for a revision of the Tariff and the protection of
							the manufactures referred to our Committee— The special order of the day
							was upon the two reports from the Committee on the public printing; a
							mere party conflict which was debated the whole day between <persRef
								ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> a pepper hot Georgian, mover and
							Chairman of the Committee and <persRef ref="evans-george2"
								>Evans</persRef> and <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
								Garland</persRef> the members of the minority— Between 3 and 5
							O’Clock nearly two hours were consumed in alternate motions to adjourn
							and for a call of the house, both rejected by yeas and nays, till a call
							was at last ordered and a Quorum appeared— The question is between a
							reduction of 15 or of 25 per cent upon the present prices of the public
							printing— After 7. O’Clock, the previous question was moved—a Call of
							the house was ordered and 173 members answered. Motion to suspend
							further proceedings in the call, pending which a motion to adjourn
							succeeded and after 8 I reached home— <persRef ref="cruft-william"
								>William Smith Cruft</persRef> of New-York, called me out at the
							house; being here as he said on a visit of curiosity— I went into the
							Senate chamber and found them idly debating a Bankrupt Law— While I was
							there, the Revenue collection Bill from the House was referred to the
							Committee of Finance. I gave a copy of the Bill to <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Davis</persRef>, and promised to send the papers to <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— A remonstrance against the Bill signed by 73
							commercial houses in New-York was this day received too late to be
							presented to the House, but which will come before the Senate— I made
							some arrangement of the papers to send them to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster; but was not able to revise <persRef
								ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury’s</persRef> Notes of my speech last

								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							crude and refined Saltpetre, the consideration of which must of course
							be postponed till next Thursday. In the house <persRef
								ref="crabb-george2">Crabb</persRef> of Alabama asked to be excused

							alledging feeble health and too hard work— Crabb is an Alabama whig
							Slaveholder; and his real motive is to slink from the responsibility of
							reporting upon the contested elections. Flinch at a pinch is his motto—
							The adjournment last Night was upon a call of the house at a motion for
							the previous question upon an amendment moved by <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> to the Resolutions offered
							by the minority of the Committee on the printing, as a substitute for
							the Resolutions reported by <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef>,

							was considered as still pending this morning, but the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> said if now pursued, no others
							than those absent last Evening would now be called— So proceedings on
							the call of last evening were superseded and <persRef
								ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> moved a new call— But the
							special order of this day was the report of the select committee on the
							fray between <persRef ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef>, and it consumed the day—
							The Committee had reported only the facts and testimony— But <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> the chairman a worthy

							self-conceit or as the french say abounding in his own sense, and a weak

							the privileges of the house and its members, and a code for the
							punishment of contempts— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> of
							Charleston S.C. with a superfluity of energy more than enough to make up
							for Underwood’s want of it moved that Rice Garland and Jesse A. Bynum
							should both be expelled for fighting on the floor of the House— <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> moved a Resolution declaring
							that Bynum and Garland had violated the privileges of the house, and on
							this motion the previous question was ordered— I had purposely remained
							silent till then—but I could stand it no longer. I said I could not vote
							them guilty of a breach of privilege, without first hearing them—
							Whereupon the previous question was reconsidered a new debate was
							started, and finally the report of the select Committee was recommitted
							with instructions to the Committee to report to the House what to do,
							both in the present case and to avoid such disorders in future. Three or
							four motions were made to lay the whole subject on the table for all
							which I voted, and to that complexion it must come at last— The duelling
							bill is the best preservative from fatal disorders that has yet been
							devised; and as to petty fisti-cuffs they will occasionally occur, and
							only disgrace one or both parties to them— Adjourned about 6.

							Perou on his card, I know nothing more of him, paid me a morning visit—
							He is a handsome, Grenadier looking man, lately from Peru, by the way of

							South American Republics, but said nothing of his own purpose in coming
							to this Country— Of all the Southern Republics, he thinks that Chili has
							the best Government and has made the greatest progress in the
							advancement of political Science—but Chili has just issued victorious
							from a War with Peru, and now gives the Law to that Republic: General
							Miller’s visit belated me at the house, where I found them taking the
							yeas and nays on a motion to suspend the rules for a Resolution to fix
							the first and second days of June to consider the business relating to
							the District of Columbia— Lost. 73 to 81. not even a majority. Then came
							the counter report on the public printing—on this the previous question
							had last evening been called by not ordered— <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> now withdrew his ten per
							cent amendment— The question was then taken by yeas and nays, on
								<persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans’s</persRef> minority report
							amendment—a reduction of 25 per cent on the present prices: lost by a
							vote of 98 to 107. a party vote shewing 205 members present; of whom
							four fifths of the time there are not 122 members in the house— At last
							the question came upon <persRef ref="black-edward">Black’s</persRef>
							blundering Resolution to reduce the printing for <hi rend="italic"
								>Congress</hi> 15 per Cent—which passed 175 to 13. already 17 votes
							less than on the preceding question— The two reports on the separation
							of the public printing from the political press, were after some

								>Jones</persRef>, Chairman of the Ways and Means, moved then a

							would be.— The house took up private business. I went to the chamber of
							the Committee of Manufactures to arrange the papers concerning the
							revenue collection-bill, to be sent to <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Webster</persRef>, for the

						<p>Walk to the Capitol, and heard <persRef ref="gurney-joseph">Joseph John
								Gurney’s</persRef> display of Quaker eloquence He took for his text
							without naming the book Matthew 22.42— [“]What think ye of Christ? whose
							Son is he? They say unto him, The son of <persRef ref="david"
								>David</persRef>. 43. He saith unto them, How then doth David in
							spirit call him Lord, saying, 44. The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou
							on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot-stool? 45. If David
							then call him Lord, how is he his son? 46. And no man was able to answer
							him a word; neither durst any man, from that day forth, ask him any more
							questions.” The discourse somewhat desultory, was on the perfect union
							of the divine and human nature in the person of Christ—a hacknied and
							incomprehensible theme— Friend Gurney has the faculty of commanding
							attention; the first of all qualifications for an Orator; and with which
							he may dispense with all others— His face is immovable as a marble
							Statue— He speaks with one unvaried tone of voice, and slow, clear,
							distinct articulation.— He has an unpleasant quaker drawl, and very
							inelegant pronunciation of many words—turning the vowel o into a broad
							u—such as glurrious for glorious— He is grave—earnest—evidently
							sincere—good hearted kind, and thinks himself not a whit behind the
							chiefest of the Apostles.— His argument was not strong but he evidently
							believed what he said— The members seats were full, chiefly of women—but
							very few in the galleries— He twice requested the audience to hold the
							meeting after the manner of the Society of Friends for a few minutes in
							solemn silence, which was done— When he resumed speaking he said he
							hoped the interval had been employed by every individual present in
							fervent prayer. <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> was
							there and gave me the list of flowers composing the bouquet which he
							says he has received from a young lady 200 miles distant, explained by
							Flora’s dictionary, and which he yesterday challenged me to answer.
							Jenifer is a sprightly, horse racing man of gallantry and
							fashion—politically a high-spirited duelist whig, and zealous champion
							of the tobacco-planting interest; and morally a gay Lothario, affecting
							conquests of fair Ladies hearts, and vain of this posy from a child. I
							wrote the verses, which may perhaps do for his Lady’s Album, not fit to
							be seen any where else— After dinner I attended at S<hi

								Higbee</persRef> preached from 1. John 4.8. “God is love”— This
							Gentleman once minister of the Episcopal Trinity Church in this City,
							and chaplain to the Senate, now settled at the Trinity Church in
							New-York is renowned among the preachers of the land, but his style is
							too merely declamatory for my taste— I never relished him much, and was
							not more reconciled to his manner, by his commonplace appeals to the
							pathetics of the crucifixion— The day was intensely warm— <persRef

						<p>I had rather an uneasy night and my right arm all this day in a sling— I
							write, against the kindest remonstrances of my family, and attended the
							morning sitting of the House against those of both my doctors— Several
							morning visitors called in— Weather at Summer heat. I rode to the
							Capitol, and stopped on my way at the office of the National
							Intelligencer and enquired of <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> who came out to the
							Carriage for <persRef ref="wheeler-henry">Wheeler’s</persRef> Notes of
							my Speech of Saturday the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> on the revenue Bill. He said he would
							procure them as soon as possible; and that he should begin the
							publication of the Smithsonian report to morrow. I found <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>
							speaking in the House upon the Bill for carrying into execution the
							Convention with Mexico; which he had brought up by obtaining a
							suspension of the rules— The Bill was discussed in Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union; <persRef ref="garland-james">James
								Garland</persRef> in the chair— The only amendment of the Bill in
							Committee was the reduction of a Commissioners Salary from 3500 to 3000
							dollars a year— The Bill was thus reported to the house passed for
							engrossment, and passed. I intended to have spoken upon this Bill; but
							my accident of yesterday disabled me, and it is better for me that it is
							so— <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> moved a
							suspension of the Rules for a verbose resolution with a preamble to take
							up the general appropriation Bills successively, excluding the
							sub-treasury— <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> said he
							should move an amendment to include another Bill— <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">Cost Johnson</persRef> moved to lay
							Tillinghast’s motion on the table, and he withdrew it— <persRef
								ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> moved to suspend the rules
							to go into Committee of the whole on the Union, to go through the first
							bill they should take up—yeas and nays 116 to 85. not two-thirds—and the
							strength of the sub-treasury Bill— At last came the proper order of the
							day— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell’s</persRef> bill for securing the
							freedom of elections. <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> of
							Tennessee began a speech which he has had in keeping about six weeks— I
							went to the door of the Senate chamber where I met <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef> their Secretary— At my
							request he called out <persRef ref="wright-silas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silas Wright</persRef> with whom I had
							a further Conversation in his Committee room. I gave him two additional
							Letters from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the

							revenue Bill—and I borrowed the unsigned paper from <persRef
								ref="strobel-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Strobel</persRef> the Consul at Bordeaux, which had been furnished
							me by <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Pothier</persRef> which completes the preparation for the
							publication of my Speech of Friday the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
								inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> on the revenue Bill— The House at
							half past two took a recess and I rode home I did not return after
							dinner to the house, but repaired the lost of sleep last night by
							resorting to my bed for about two hours before Sunset— My appearance in
							the house this morning had occasioned some surprize—</p>

						<p>I had a night of quiet repose, but the soreness and pain in my shoulder
							was more troublesome this day than yesterday— This was a day of constant
							rain, and although convinced that I should have suffered less by
							attending at the House upon my duty than by staying at home, I yielded
							to the intreaties of my wife, and confined myself at home. <persRef
								ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef>
							called this morning. I had time to ruminate upon my accident, and could
							scarcely refrain from repining at the peculiar untowardness of the
							disability just at this moment of my right arm— One of the first
							questions asked me by <persRef ref="may-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> May</persRef> was whether the shoulder had ever been
							dislocated before. I had no recollection of any such event; but
							remembered having been told by my mother, that when a child two or three
							years old, I was straying out into the street, when the Nursery maid ran
							out after me, and seizing me by the right hand, gave it an involuntary
							sudden jerk, and dislocated the shoulder— My right hand has,
							consequently I suppose upon this early disability, been weaker than the
							left all my days— Always unable to write fast, and for the last
							twenty-five years unable to write at all as other men do with the
							forefinger and the thumb— My right hand has been many times further
							disabled by casualties of various and different kinds; against all which
							I have struggled to the utmost of my ability, considering it as the
							business and duty of my life to write; and receiving as admonitions and
							chastisements of Providence these occasional disabilities— With
							yesterday’s mail I received two copies of a Sermon on the present crisis
							in the Missionary operations of the American board of Commissioners of
							Foreign Missions, by <persRef ref="anderson-rufus">Rufus
								Anderson</persRef> D.D. one of the Secretaries of the board— It does
							not appear where or when the Sermon was delivered; but the publication
							is dated Boston 25. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1840. and in the
							same packet with the Sermons was a certificate that John Quincy Adams by
							a donation from Hon <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Samuel T.
								Armstrong</persRef> is constituted an honorary member of the
							American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions—dated Boston
								Mass<hi rend="superscript">tts.</hi> May 13. 1840. and signed
								<persRef ref="hill-henry">Henry Hill</persRef> Treasurer— But
							without any Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong, or any
							intimation from him of his motive for constituting me, without
							consulting me, by a donation, an honorary member of this board— I read
							the Sermon, which is a most earnest call for more liberal contributions;
							stating a great falling off recently of liberality and zeal, and stating
							the average annual receipts of the last 3 years from 900 out of 1200
							Massachusetts Congregational Churches to be 244000 dollars— I have
							always entertained doubts whether the usefulness of this well intended
							institution is at all adequate to its cost— <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> spent this Evening with
							us; and <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef> called on me this Evening.— He told me that in the
								House—<persRef ref="bell-john">Bell’s</persRef> Bill, to secure the
							freedom of Election had been rejected by a Call for the Previous
							Question— Then a Question if a pre-emption Bill from the Senate must go
							to a Committee of the whole—undecided— And the Sub-treasury, or
							Independent Treasury Bill taken up, on which <persRef

						<p>The day of meeting for the Committee of Manufactures, but I was disabled

							Returning to my house I met there <persRef ref="hunter-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dodge</persRef> and took him with me
							to the Capitol— At the House the Speaker had decided last Evening that
							the pre-emption Bill from the Senate must go into Committee of the

							Evening examined the Journals of the house and had found one case in the
							year 1834. of a pre-emption Bill which had passed through the house
							without going into Committee of the whole—conforming therefore to the
							precedent, although his own opinion had not changed he reversed his
							decision of last Evening, and now decided that the Bill might pass to be
							engrossed without needing to go into Committee of the whole—from this
							decision <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>
							appealed, but the Speaker was sustained by a vote of 100 to 91. The
							morning hour was gone— The orders of the day were called; a short bill
							from the Senate was passed— The house went into Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef>
							in the Chair— Cushing commenced his formidable speech against the

							to a close.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall rode home with
							me, and I took up <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> on

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>. He promised its

							John C. paid him in his own coin— He has a collection of curiosities on

							precious— He has devoted his time and Fortune to this great undertaking
							of effecting mutual exchanges of duplicate books, and other rarities
							throughout the civilized world, and is very anxious to obtain a speedy

								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> who has established himself

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Petrikin proceeded without further
							interruption— He made and withdrew objections to sundry Bills; but a

							amendments, and others were laid over under the 26<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> rule, confining the first and fourth Friday of each month
							to the consideration of private Bills against which there is no

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> came out and
							informed me that they were setting the types of my Speech of the 8<hi

							send me the proof slips—at four this afternoon which he did— It takes
							upwards of 4 columns— And although the Press had been carefully
							corrected, the revisal was indispensably necessary especially for the
							references to the extracts from books and papers— My reply to <persRef

								<unclear>. . .</unclear> against Great-Britain had not been reported by
								<persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury</persRef> at all.— Yet the

								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> to write out my remarks as I
							repeated them to her from Memory; and I sent them to the Intelligencer

							half a dozen copies of this day’s paper, containing my speech on the

							and of the Country paper of last Tuesday containing my last Report on

							they who despise the Minister of Christ despise Christ himself had too
							much of allusion to his own condition; and disclosed in too much

								Leverett</persRef> of South-Carolina He delivered his text in a tone

							babbling and bursting along leaving upon the memory absolutely nothing—
							He reminded me of a panegyric I once heard passed upon a young
							Clergyman, of the highest reputation in South-Carolina— It was said of
							him that he rode the most spirited horse—was the best shot at a plover
							flying—played the best hand at whist, and wrote the best Sermon of any

						<p>The recovery of the use of my arm is slow, and I write with great
							difficulty— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> rode with me
							to the Capitol— The house was taking the yeas and nays for a Call, to
							make a quorum, which was effected; and then the call was superseded.—
							The previous question had been called last week on the motion to refer a
							Resolution of the Legislature of Indiana to the Committee of Ways and
							Means, with instructions to report a Bill for the continuation of the
							Cumberland road through the States of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois— The
							main question was ordered by yeas and nays <unclear>91</unclear> to 82—
							And the motion for the Instructions was lost 87 to 90— The <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> then called for Petitions,
							beginning with the Territory of Iowa, and proceeding South and then East
							through all the Territories, and States— There were very few—the field
							having been swept clean last Monday— I presented a set of six abolition
							petitions; the last I had on hand; four of which were excluded from
							reception by the rule of 28 January, and the other two were laid on the
							table— I presented also the Memorial of <persRef ref="spooner-lysander"
								>Lysander Spooner</persRef>, of Athol, Massachusetts complaining of
							the official conduct of <persRef ref="mclean-john2">John
								M’Lean</persRef> a judge of the supreme Court of the United States,
							in depriving himself of his right of appeal from his decision as a
							Circuit judge in the District of Ohio, to the Supreme Court of the
							United States. I assigned my reasons for presenting this Memorial—said I
							should neither ask that it be read or printed, but merely that it be
							referred to the Judiciary Committee with an earnest intreaty to them to
							give to it their serious and undivided attention— It was so referred, at
							first without opposition—but afterwards <persRef ref="crabb-george2"
								>Crabb</persRef> of Alabama did object and the Speaker took the
							question a second time— Half a dozen voices answered no, but the Speaker
							declared the motion for reference carried— I asked leave to present the
							two sets of Resolutions, which I have had so long prepared— One
							denouncing the detention and imprisonment of the Africans of the
							Amistad; and the other relating to the investment of public trust funds
							of the United States, in Stocks of the States—objection was made even to
							the reading of both of them; but they were read.— Neither of them was
							received— I gave them both to <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur"
								>Stansbury</persRef>, with the request that they might both be
							published in the National Intelligencer to-morrow morning— At half past
							2 came the recess— I rode home, and returned to the house after dinner—
							The Speaker after the call for petitions was gone through, called the
							Committees for Reports— Adjourned about 6 p.m. I called at <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> and saw <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> after an interval of more than 3 months—during

							convalescent but I found him yet lying on a Sopha, unable to sit up. But
							he conversed freely with me about half an hour, till <persRef

								<persRef ref="mease-isabella">Miss Mease</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>At the House <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> of Ohio
							moved a suspension of the rules for a call upon the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> to inform the house
							whether <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos Kendall</persRef> held the
							Office of Postmaster General on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							this month—the date of an Address to the people of the United States,
							which he has published in a pamphlet, signed by him, and grossly
							insulting to the members of Congress.— The suspension was refused by
							yeas and nays 60 to 102— Kendall has resigned his Office of Postmaster
							General upon a pretence of ill health, to become Editor of the
							extra-globe an electioneering periodical to be published during the
							pendency of the Presidential Election— And his party have been called
							upon to tax themselves roundly by subscriptions for this paper to
							support him— This abusive treatment of members of Congress, by Executive
							Jackalls, was begun by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson</persRef>, who set the example of it himself— The Successor
							dares not follow that part of the system, but stimulates his menials to
							the dirty work, and the Spirit of party so entirely swallows up the
							Esprit du corps in Congress, that the Majority will suffer no check or
							rebuke upon this slanderous practice— <persRef ref="hillen-solomon"
								>Hillen</persRef> of the Committee of Commerce, and <persRef
								ref="curtis-edward">Edward Curtis</persRef>, chairman of that
							Committee presented Counter-reports upon memorials praying for the
							repeal of a law of 1838. relating to the New-York Pilots— Hillen
							reported a Bill to repeal the law, to which a majority of the Committee—
							Upon a subsequent reconsideration a majority of the Committee agreed to
							report against the repeal— Hillen insisted, that a Committee have no
							right to reconsider, for which he quoted <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson’s</persRef> Manual, but Curtis contended that the rule
							applied only to Committees of the whole— This discussion continued until
							the expiration of the morning hour, when the orders of the day were
							called and the new preemption bill was taken up— The Western Spoilers
							with their Kinderhoek Allies have managed to keep the Bill in the House,
							subject to the previous question, without going into Committee of the
							whole upon it at-all— They had even started the previous question; but
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, a member of
							the Committee of Public Lands, had the luck to interpose a motion for a
							small amendment upon which he spoke very eloquently against the Bill,
							until the recess— I rode home to dine—and at 4. O’Clock returned to the
							House, where Governor Lincoln for another hour was declaiming against
							the Bill, and proposing a petty amendment, with which he said he would
							vote for the Bill, and which surrendered the whole cause— When he took
							his seat about twenty members started up at once— The <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> gave the floor to <persRef
								ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> of Kentucky a member of the
							Committee, who spoke till 7. O’Clock against the Bill, but with such
							rapidity and indistinct articulation that I could hear very little of
							what he said.— The Speaker then gave the floor to <persRef
								ref="hubbard-david">Hubbard</persRef> of Alabama, the
								<unclear>foggy</unclear>, who said he should make a short speech to
							disabuse the house of the misconceptions put forth by Governor Lincoln,
							and then bring the discussion to a close; two speeches both against the
							Bill, having been made, and only his short speech in reply— A motion to
							adjourn failed— So I left the house and walked home, meeting young
								<persRef ref="may-george">Doctor May</persRef>—and <persRef
								ref="niles-john">John M Niles</persRef> the new Postmaster General
							on my way.</p>

						<p>After I left the House last Evening, <persRef ref="hubbard-david"

								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> moved in vain to

								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln’s</persRef> amendment
							was rejected by yeas and nays 86. to 97. and the Bill was passed 120 to
							64.— And thus were the public lands of the Nation delivered up to the

								ref="williams-henry4">Henry Williams</persRef> voting throughout for
							the Bill.— The public lands are gone; and <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> after the previous question was ordered told the
							secret by saying, that poor settlers on the lands meant members of
							Congress.— This morning the first hour was occupied in pertinaciously
							debating whether a Committee of the House after agreeing to a report can
							reconsider their vote—and agree upon another—on which, <persRef
								ref="russell-david">Russell</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> maintained the affirmative
							and <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> the negative
							until the expiration of the hour— Sergeant then made a statement as
							Chairman of the judiciary Committee, against the memorial of <persRef
								ref="spooner-lysander">Lysander Spooner</persRef> which he said the
							Committee unanimously considered as totally groundless and unfounded.—
							There were some expressions in the Statement which seemed to imply a
							censure upon me for presenting the memorial— I rose to remark upon them;
							but <persRef ref="alford-julius">Alford</persRef> of Georgia got the
							floor, and moved a reconsideration of the Bill which had passed last
							Night, and for the passage of which he had voted— The Bill, which had
							already passed the Senate was now gone there to be signed by the
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Vice-President</persRef>; and it was
							made a question whether a reconsideration could in such case be moved—
							While this was in debate <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef>
							from the Committee of enrolled bills reported it for the signature of
							the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>, who decided that the
							motion to reconsider was in order; and this decision was upon appeal
							sustained by the house— Alford proceeded in his vehement and humorous
							manner to prove over again, what <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> and <persRef ref="white-john6">White</persRef> of
							Kentucky had consumed all yesterday in demonstrating; that the Bill was
							an effectual surrender of all the public lands to the land-jobbing
							gamblers—but it was in vain—he was answered with the previous question
							and yeas and nays 96 to 103. against reconsideration— It was past 2
							O’Clock, when the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union, on the Independent Treasury-Bill, <persRef ref="banks-linn"
								>Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair— Cushing resumed his argument
							against it till the recess— I then rode home, taking with me my books
							for reference on the revenue bill debate.— I returned between 4 and 5.
							and found Cushing, drawing to the close of his Speech, in which he
							mentioned with approbation my <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Son’s</persRef> Articles in the Boston Courier on the Government
							and the Country— He was followed by <persRef ref="lowell-joshua"

							debating the question whether a standing Committee of the House, after

							present to the house another— Tillinghast produced the authority from
							the Journal of the English house of Commons of 5. June 1607. against the
							right to reconsider—he thought it antiquated; but Dromgoole insisted
							that its antiquity was the best proof of its propriety and wisdom—
								<persRef ref="ryall-daniel">Ryall</persRef> one of the spurious

								<persRef ref="triplett-philip">Triplet</persRef> of Kentucky, moved

							to offer this Bill— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Lincoln</persRef> asked
							who gave the Chairman to confer such favours? Triplet answered it was no
							favour but a right— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>
							advised Triplet to wait till to-morrow; and he accordingly withdrew his

							that on Tuesday Morning <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">M<hi

								Smith</persRef>, and <persRef ref="thaxter-catherine">Miss Catherine

							while he was adjutant General— The old grudge of <persRef

							political manoeuvering and intrigues.— <persRef ref="preston-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. C. Preston</persRef>
							afterwards came to me, and referring to my offer in March 1825 to
							<persRef ref="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawford</persRef>, that he
							should remain Secretary of the Treasury, asked me if I knew that the

							and he could procure the original or a copy of it for me— I infer that

						<p>On reaching the house this morning I was informed that the Bill for
							allowing double rations to <persRef ref="parker-daniel">General Daniel
								Parker</persRef> had been passed last Evening, and that excepting
							that, and a call of the house which had occupied two hours nothing else
							had been done— The debate on the question whether a Committee of the
							House after agreeing to make a report can reconsider this decision, and
							present a report of an opposite character was brought to a close, by the
							previous question— The report presented by <persRef ref="hillen-solomon"
								>Hillen</persRef>, accompanied by a Bill repealing the Pilot-Law,
							was accepted by yeas and nays 86 to 83. and the true report of the
							majority of the Committee, offered by <persRef ref="curtis-edward"

								>Carr</persRef>, <persRef ref="galbraith-john">Galbraith</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="williams-henry4">Henry Williams</persRef> who when
							their names were called answered no, and after the roll was called
							through, changed their recounted votes, ranged themselves with the rest
							of their party, and reversed the decision of the house which they had
							just contributed to form.— What an illustration of the principle thus
							settled that a Committee of the House cannot reconsider its own vote—
								<persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> after the failure
							of a motion to suspend the rules to take up the subtreasury bill, gave
							notice that he would next Monday move to rescind the rule itself which
							requires a majority of two thirds to suspend the rules.— Some question
							arose about the Bill reported by Hillen to repeal the Pilot Act of March
							1837—but the hour had expired—the orders of the day were called; and
							Galbraith moved a reconsideration of the vote of last evening by which
							the bill for allowing double rations to General Daniel Parker had
							passed. Then followed a debate of an hour and a half upon the question
							of reconsideration then a vote by yeas and nays of<space/>to<space/>to
							reconsider; and then a vote of<space/>to<space/>laid the bill on the

								<persRef ref="espy-james">Professor the Storm-maker Espy</persRef>
							had called on me this morning; told me he was going to England, and

								ref="montgomery-william">William Montgomery</persRef> both members

						<p><persRef ref="mease-isabella">Miss Mease</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Miss Guillon</persRef> having returned from their visit in
							Virginia, were here last Evening and dined and spent this day here—
								<persRef ref="james-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								James</persRef>, the member of the House from Pennsylvania with
								<persRef ref="james-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								James</persRef>, and <persRef ref="cooper-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cooper</persRef> wife of <persRef
								ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef> another member from the
							same State were also here last Evening, and I had a long visit from
								<persRef ref="vattemare-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alexander Vattemare</persRef>, who left with me a budget of
							complimentary Letters, and puffing newspaper paragraphs about his great
							invention of duplicate exchanges, and to which he wishes an additional
							one from me. This morning I attended public worship at the Capitol where
								<persRef ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bates</persRef> delivered a Discourse upon Education from Ephesians
							6.4. [“]And ye, fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
							them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” Notice was given
							yesterday in the National Intelligencer that this Sermon would be
							specially addressed to Parents— It was a plain, sensible, judicious
							discourse, containing some of the most obvious ideas upon education, and
							the most memorable passage of which was a quotation from <persRef
								ref="butler-joseph">Bishop Butler</persRef>— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bates declares personal chastisement to be in no case
							whatever necessary. He disapproves alike too much rigour and too much
							laxity of discipline— He recommends especially the use of reason with
							children, and earnestly insists upon the practice of using the Bible as
							a School book—in the vernacular language at the primary schools—in the
							original tongues at the Colleges— He promised another Sermon upon
							intellectual education. After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church, two clergymen officiated for <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef>—<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis</persRef>, settled somewhere in Maryland, and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marcus</persRef>, an Englishman,
							and converted Jew. They divided between them the reading of the Evening
							service for the Sunday after Ascension day—and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Davis preached from Acts 17.11. “These were more noble than
							those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness
							of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were
							so. 12. Therefore many of them believed: also of honourable women which
							were Greeks, and of men, not a few.” Miss Guillon, with <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> and my Grand daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, were with me in the pew.
							While I was out <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tillinghast</persRef> paid visits at

								Robert Greenhow</persRef>, Translator at the Department of State had
							also paid me a visit before dinner. He is one of the members of the new
							Scientific Society, and sent me the day after the second Meeting at
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett’s</persRef>, a work of his upon Tripoli— <persRef
