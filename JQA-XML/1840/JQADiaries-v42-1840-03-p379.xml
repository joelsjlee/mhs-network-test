						<p>I walked to the Capitol, and heard <persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman</persRef>, the chaplain of the
							Senate. An English Methodist; settled here within the last two years,
							and celebrated for his eloquence. His text was from 1. Timothy 4.16.—
							First clause of the verse “<hi rend="italic">Take</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">Heed</hi> unto <hi rend="italic">Thyself</hi>” which
							words he pronounced with a loud voice—a deep emphasis upon each of the
							underscored-words and a semicolon pause between each of them and the
							next. He then began by some general remarks upon the characteristic of
							the present age—which he said was <hi rend="italic">excitement</hi>—<hi
								rend="italic">association</hi>—movement in <hi rend="italic"
								>masses</hi>—the power of numbers—which he exemplified by alluding
							to the multitudes of Meetings, of Conventions of Societies for
							Political, Religious or benevolent purposes— But he was now about to
							address his auditory individually, in a solitary capacity; and in the
							words of the <persRef ref="paul">Apostle Paul</persRef>, to say to each
							man, woman and child who heard him <hi rend="italic">Take</hi>—<hi
								rend="italic">Heed</hi>—unto <hi rend="italic">Thyself</hi>.— What
							an easy, natural, beautiful introduction! He made no formal division of
							his subject; but it divided itself; and he had the skeleton always in
							his head— First guarding against any imagination that his object was to
							inculcate selfishness, but only the spirit of that self-love, which is
							implied in the precept to love thy neighbour <hi rend="italic">as</hi>
							thyself—he successively repeated Take heed what thou thinkest—what thou
							sayest—what thou doest with obvious considerations of the relative
							importance of thoughts, words and actions—upon each of which he
							descanted at considerable extent— Then still repeating the Instruction
							take heed to thyself, applied it to the several relations with others,
							he finished with words of exhortation, particularly addressed the
							younger part of his hearers— Hast thou ever done a good action? I hope
							thou hast—many—what thinkest thou of them now? do they not afford thee
							an inexhaustible source of pleasure? Hast thou never sinned? I know thou
							hast—what thinkest thou of that sin now?— I will tell thee what thou
							thinkest—with regret—with regret! if not with remorse—thy habitual
							thought is—I wish I had not committed that sin— Oh think then that on
							thyself depends whether thy destiny after this life shall be an eternity
							of blessedness or of woe.— Then after a somewhat over-charged and
							hyperbolical declamation upon eternal punishment; he closed with saying
							Oh! think of that dying admonition of a pious father—think of that angel
							voice of a beloved sister, urging thee to virtue—and <hi rend="italic"
								>Take</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Heed</hi> unto <hi rend="italic"
								>Thyself</hi>!— He closed, and the tears were streaming down my
							cheeks— I left a card at the lodgings of the Speaker <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hunter</persRef>—and one next door for <persRef ref="sumter-thomas2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. H. Sumpter</persRef>. I saw
								<persRef ref="campbell-john7">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Campbell</persRef>, and at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Corcoran’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Jos. L. Tillinghast</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>— Met
								<persRef ref="peters-richard2">R. Peters</persRef>, in the street;
							who promised to send me <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van

								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— After dinner at
							the Presbyterian Church I heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi

							“And <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> stretched forth his hand,
							and took the knife, to slay his son.” The sacrifice of Abraham— The
							principle of obedience to the Will of God— I read the Article in the

						<p><persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Miss Elizabeth Pierce</persRef> was here
							this morning with a Letter informing her that the Committee of
							Revolutionary claims of the House had determined to report favourably in
							part upon their petition— But with this she was not satisfied, and was
							exceedingly anxious to obtain the whole of their claim, and yet unable
							to make it intelligible to me— My time straitened me to attend a Meeting
							of the Committee of Manufactures, and I was there at ten O’Clock— No
							Quorum— <persRef ref="mitchell-charles">Mitchell</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="davis-john11">Davis</persRef> and <persRef ref="eastman-ira"
								>Eastman</persRef> attended, and at a quarter past 11. adjourned
							till Thursday— 5 minutes after, <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> attended, and would have made a Quorum— The
							irksomeness of attending Committees is almost universal, and throws upon
							the Chairman all the burden of the Committee’s labours— In the house it
							was the regular day, for the reception of Petitions; but the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> decided, that the Resolution
							offered by <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> to refer to the
							Committee of Ways and Means a Memorial praying an appropriation for the
							continuance of the Cumberland Road through the States of Ohio, Indiana
							and Illinois, with Instructions to the Committee to report a Bill, had
							preference over the presentation of Petitions— From this decision
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> appealed;
							but it was sustained by the House. It was unquestionably wrong; and
							annuls a proviso incorporated into the rules upon an amendment offered
							by me—that No debate should be held on any petition upon the day when
							presented, nor upon any other day assigned by the house for the
							presentation of petitions—my amendment had hitherto been of some avail—
							It is now annulled— And the vote of the House was carried not upon the
							merits of the rule; but for the effect that it would have had to
							displace the Cumberland Road, on the order of business so that it could
							not have been resumed perhaps for Months. And thus another shackle is
							fixed upon the right of Petition— Not one was presented this day—
								<persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef> of Tennessee had the floor since the suspension of
							the debate on this subject last week— He spoke upwards of three hours in
							answer to <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="crary-isaac">Crary</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="howard-tilghman">Howard</persRef> of Indiana; and his object
							was to prove the duplicity of the administration party with regard to
							the policy of appropriating money for internal improvements. Little
							interest was taken in his argument and the house thinned off as he spoke
							till there was little more than a Quorum left—when he finished Casey
							proposed to modify his Instructions to the Committee of Ways and Means
							to leave discretionary with them the amount of the appropriation to be
							made for the continuance of the road— Other members, and among them
							Rhett of South-Carolina manifested a wish to be heard and at 4. O’Clock,
							the House voted by Tellers to adjourn— I am yet reading the Article on
							the Instructions of the Royal Society to <persRef ref="ross-james4"
								>Captain Ross’s</persRef> Antarctic expedition, upon the manner of
							making magnetical observations.</p>

								Patton</persRef>, a Mathematical Instrument maker, came this morning
							to enquire about the renting of <persRef ref="hellen-mary"
								>Mary’s</persRef> dwelling house North of the President’s Square,
							where we dwelt from December 1829 till November 1838, or rather till the
							preceding<space/>of July when I last left it.— <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson</persRef> resided in it last Winter and until May—since
							which it has been untenanted.— I referred M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Patton to <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, who is the agent of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							John Adams and manager of all her affairs— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Patton makes mathematical instruments for the Government and
							professes to make them equal in perfection to any that can be procured
							from any other part of the world— He was born and brought up in
							Baltimore—but resided for the last 25 years at New-York— He has lately
							come by advice of <persRef ref="abert-alexander">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Abert</persRef> and of the chief
							engineer to live at Washington, and intends permanently to settle here—
							As he went out a Stone-cutter named <persRef ref="donovan-richard"
								>Richard Donovan</persRef> came in with a Petition signed by himself
							and<space/>others praying for payment of wages during the time that the
							works on the public buildings from April to June 1838. There are several
							Documents annexed to the Petition to sustain the claim— The Petitioners
							are all Irishmen, and complain that the allowance for the suspended time
							was made to others and denied to them. Donovan took his Petition with
							him to shew it to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef>, chairman of the Committee on the public
							buildings—but he brought it back afterwards, and left it with me to be
							presented to the House— I went to the Pension Office, and left with the
							commissioner two Letters from <persRef ref="lewis-charles"
								>Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Pierce</persRef> of Brooklyn
							L. I with documents to support claims for Pensions of <persRef
								ref="troup-jennet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Troup</persRef>
							and of <persRef ref="lennington-sarah">Sarah Lennington</persRef>— I met
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye, who told me that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Patton had been with him to Mary’s house
							on the Square, and had offered for it 500 dollars a year rent; and he
							thought of accepting it—the house now lying empty because he had
							demanded 600 dollars, and he could find no tenant who would give so
							much— At the House, the Resolution from the Committee of Commerce, for
							having engraved a chart of some part of the Southern coast was debated
							nearly an hour— <persRef ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef> of
							Georgia made a Speech to prove that it was more important to the
							Mariners of Maine than to the Planters of Georgia—</p>
						<p>After much foolish wrangling the previous question was carried, and the
							Resolution, for printing the map was rejected upon a plea of economy; by
							yeas and nays 84 to 95.— Two or three more reports only were received
							when <persRef ref="jones-john9">J. W. Jones</persRef> called for the
							orders of the day, and the Bill to continue the Office of Commissioner
							of Pensions, and for transferring to him the Navy Pension fund, from the
								<persRef ref="paulding-james">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>. The
							motion to reduce the Salary of the Commissioner from 3000 to 2500
							dollars was carried, and the Bill passed— Then the red river raft Bill,
							and speeches of <persRef ref="biddle-richard">R. Biddle</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="pope-john">J. Pope</persRef>— Adjourned after 4.
							O’Clock— In the Evening a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="doty-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Doty</persRef> and
							another member of the house, who enquired if I was going to see the
							Commissioner of Pensions and upon my answering yes they said I should

							and that by which it is continued, and the Navy-Pension fund is
							transferred to the Commissioner only passed the House of Representatives
							yesterday, and did not get through the Senate till this day. So they
							closed the Office— On my way thence to the Capitol I stop’d at <persRef
								ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pettrich’s</persRef> Studio, and saw his statues and busts— His
							fishing girl in marble and his young hunter companion in clay— He said
								<persRef ref="keim-george">General Keim</persRef> had purchased them
							for 2000 dollars each; and a bust of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> for 500 dollars.—
							He had also busts of <persRef ref="clay-henry">H. Clay</persRef>,

								<persRef ref="joseph5">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

							and seven children— He shewed me a small piece of the marble from the
							newly opened Quarry near Frederick much finer than a piece of Carrara
							marble compared with it— At the House— <persRef ref="campbell-john7"
								>Campbell</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of Elections was ready
							to report, but the turn of that Committee was past— <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> offered a Resolution,
							instructing the Committee on Accounts to investigate the contracts for
							stationary made by <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Hugh A.
							Garland</persRef>, the Clerk of the House with <persRef
								ref="langtree-samuel">Langtree</persRef>. Objection was made by
								<persRef ref="ogle-charles">Charles Ogle</persRef> in retaliation
							for Petrikin’s perpetual objections to resolutions offered by others—but
							the objection was withdrawn—his Resolution was received, and <persRef
								ref="johnston-charles">Charles Johnston</persRef> offered as an
							amendment the Resolution which he had repeatedly before, in vain
							attempted to get before the house. It could not now be parried and
							Johnston sustained it by a strong Speech— Then Petrikin modified his
							Resolution to Johnston’s acceptance, and by the call of the previous
							question it was carried.— Campbell made a second effort to produce his
							Report, but the vote on his motion to suspend the rules was 104 to 79.
							not two thirds.— <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef>,
							offered a string of Resolutions parceling out the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> Message,
							among the standing Committees— In answer to an enquiry from me he said
							it was his express purpose to keep it out of the Committee of the whole
							on the Union— The vote on his motion to suspend was 104 to 85. and then
							at the motion of <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript"

							is 10. A.M— It was a quarter past 11 before a Quorum was formed and two
							of the members came in just before Noon when the Committee must adjourn
							to attend the House— I asked the instructions of the Committee what
							report to make to the house upon the memorial praying for a repeal of
							the exemption from duty of pins, and was answered with talk— The Letter
							from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> recommending a reduction of the drawback upon
							refined sugar; and pickled fish, with the accompanying documents was
							discussed, and a motion was made that the Chairman be instructed to
							report a Bill to reduce the drawback— But the whole subject was
							postponed.— At the House, after an ineffectual attempt by <persRef
								ref="chinn-thomas">Chinn</persRef> to get the rules suspended for a
							motion respecting the transportation of the Mail, and another by
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">J. W. Jones</persRef>, to make the
							Treasury Note Bill the order of the day for to-morrow, both of which
							failed for lack of a majority of two thirds, the call of the Committees
							for Reports was continued and at last concluded— I reported from the
							Committee of Manufactures, the bill to ensure more effectively the
							collection of the Revenue, which was read twice by its title—referred to
							the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and ordered to be
							printed— I moved that it should be made the special order of the day for
							the third Wednesday in March; but the house refused.— I presented also
							from the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest Bill an amended Bill, with
							the Report which I had prepared, and sundry documents, including the
							Messages of<space/>December 1835 and of 6. and 7. December 1838. and my
							Report of<space/>January 1836— Also an Estimate of the expense of
							erecting and establishing an astronomical observatory— I stated also
							that a member of the Committee <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H.
								Lewis</persRef> would prepare a minority report, which the Committee
							proposed should also be printed, together with the Memorial of <persRef
								ref="fleischmann-charles">Charles Lewis Fleischman</persRef>
							presented at the last Session of Congress and then printed— <persRef
								ref="monroe-james2">James Monroe</persRef> proposed that 5000
							extra-copies of my report should be printed, but the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> said it was not now in
							order—and <hi rend="italic">No</hi>, was heard from several voices— I am
							convinced that nothing good can be done upon this subject by this
							Congress— As Night came on the Call of all the Committees, standing and
							select having gone through, the Speaker called again upon the Committee
							of Elections, and <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>
							presented his Report on the New-Jersey contest, which was read— <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> immediately moved that the
							five spurious members from New-Jersey should be sworn in and the
							previous question. A Scene of disorder and confusion ensued—a decision
							of the Speaker that <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>
							was entitled to the floor, reversed by a vote of 82 to 88. and a strange
							jumble of votes upon successive motions to adjourn, till one shortly
							before 9 in the Evening succeeded— I took no part in the snarl— Debate
							it could not be called.— I rode home.</p>

						<p>I went this morning to the Capitol with a heavy heart, expecting that
								<persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin’s</persRef> Resolution to
							swear in the five false claimants to their Seats, would be forced
							through by the Previous Question with out waiting for the evidence to
							come, reading that which has been received, or hearing the commissioned
							members on their claim— I had resolved, if thus called, not to answer to
							my name— Many of the members had determined to do the same, and if all
							the minority would do so, the majority could not form a quorum of the
							House and therefore could not perpetrate this outrage upon all Justice,
							and all Law— I found there were so many Southern members afraid to
							hazard this experiment that it cannot be carried effectively into
							execution— I resolved however at all events to practice it myself, and
							await the consequences— I found soon after the reading of the Journal,
							that there was some flinching also on the administation side— The whole
							party could not be brought to the point of taking the question now
							without a word of discussion upon the report of the Committee— <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> offered a Resolution to
							postpone the consideration of the report, until the time fixed by the
							Committee for the return of the parties with their evidence.— But this
							Resolution was only read for information; Petrikin not having withdrawn
							his motion for the Previous question— <persRef ref="rives-francis"
								>Rives</persRef> offered a Resolution to make the subject the
							special order of the day for next Tuesday at 12 O’Clock, and every
							successive day till finally disposed of— Upon some remonstrance he
							modified the resolution to commence at one O’Clock instead of 12.— The
							morning hour expired, and the orders of the day were called—being for
							private business.— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>
							then said that before proceeding to the orders of the day, he would
							present to the house a packet addressed to him, received last Night, and
							containing testimony concerning the New Jersey election— And now
							commenced a new debate, which immediately ran into points of <hi
								rend="italic">order</hi>, and consumed the time of the house till 5.
							O’Clock, when the house adjourned in the midst of the debate, without
							reaching the orders of the day; without touching a particle of private
							business, and without even disposing of the packet presented by the
							Speaker.— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> was
							speaking on a motion of reconsideration— Petrikin called him to order—
							The Speaker decided that he was in order. Petrikin appealed, and
								<persRef ref="holleman-joel">Holleman</persRef> moved to lay the
							appeal on the table— The Speaker decided that this laid the whole
							subject, and of course Fillmore’s motion upon the table, and took the
							floor from Fillmore— From this decision he appealed and remonstrated
							with great vehemence against it as abridging his freedom of Speech— The
							Speaker found two precedents against his decision; one in 1834, and one
							of his own.— And at this point came the adjournment— I called at

						<p><date>7 IV:15 </date>Saturday—</p>
						<p>I called this morning at the Office of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, and left with him the Letter
							from <persRef ref="lunt-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Lunt</persRef> to his son, the <persRef ref="lunt-william">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d</hi> William P. Lunt</persRef>, the
							Declaration of <persRef ref="lunt-henry2">Henry Lunt</persRef>, and the
							certificate of <persRef ref="davenport-moses">Moses Davenport</persRef>,
							to sustain a claim to a portion of the prize money deposited in the
							Treasury for the captures of the squadron of <persRef
								ref="jones-john-paul">Paul Jones</persRef> in 1779. upon which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury promised to have enquiry and
							report made.— I spoke to him also of the Letter from <persRef
								ref="hoyt-jesse">Jesse A. Hoyt</persRef> Collector of New-York,
							which he had sent me remonstrating against one of the amendments adopted
							by the Committee of Manufactures to his Bill— I said that the Committee
							had not intended what M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hoyt supposed would
							be a necessary consequence of the amendment; and I should myself be
							willing to strike it out.— My next call was at the Pension Office where
							I found the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner James L.
								Edwards</persRef> re-installed, and with whom I left a Letter from
								<persRef ref="lewis-charles">Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Pierce</persRef> to him and an enclosed Letter from <persRef
								ref="trumbull-jonathan">Jonathan Trumbull</persRef> Governor of
							Connecticut to <persRef ref="leffingwell-christopher">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Christopher Leffingwell</persRef> of
							15 September 1776. to sustain the Pension claim of <persRef
								ref="reeve-phebe">Phebe Reeve</persRef>— Also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="phelps-james">James Phelps</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="phelps-rachel">Sarah</persRef> his wife, concerning his
							Pension-claim. On my way to the Capitol I stop’d at <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> and enquired how <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and Miss
								Lawrence</persRef> were— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence no
							better. Miss Lawrence a little better— At the House the whole day was
							consumed in disentangling the snarl in which the New-Jersey election
							case was left last Evening.— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker’s</persRef> last revised decision was that the laying of
								<persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin’s</persRef> appeal on the
							table, did not take the floor from <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef> on his motion to reconsider the vote referring
							the packet of testimony from New-Jersey to the Committee of Elections—
							From this decision an appeal was taken, and the decision was sustained
							85 to 83. whereupon <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef>
							took a second Appeal from the same decision, upon the ground that
							Petrikin having moved the Previous Question upon this motion to swear in
							the spurious New Jersey claimants, Fillmore’s motion to reconsider was
							not in order and ought not to have been entertained by the Speaker— But
							this decision was again sustained by 99 to 89.— And the floor was thus
							at last restored to Fillmore— He then called for the reading of the
							packet received by the Speaker— To which the most vehement resistance
							was made—but the Speaker decided that they should be read, and they
							dared not appeal from the decision— They were depositions proving that
							the South Amboy election was not lawfully held, and named about twenty
							unnaturalized Irish workmen, whose votes for the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> Candidates were challenged
							yet received— Fillmore made some remarks upon the strange and self
							contradictory report of the Committee and of the manner in which it was
							palmed upon the House—which exasperated <persRef ref="medill-william"
								>Medill</persRef>, so that he too told a story of what had passed in
							Committee, and trumped up a base charge against <persRef
								ref="smith-truman">Truman Smith</persRef> of his holding secret
							intercourse with the commissioned members, which he discovered by secret
							intercourse with the other party— <persRef ref="campbell-john7"
								>Campbell</persRef> endeavoured to make Peace by declaring that the
							conduct of every member of the Committee had been fair and honourable—
								<persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> called the previous
							question on Fillmore’s motion for reconsideration, which was rejected.
							Then alternate motions to call the house and to adjourn, till near 8
							O’Clock when the adjournment was carried.</p>

						<p>There was a notice in the newspapers, that the discourse in the Hall of
							the House of Representatives this day would be on Christian courtesy—
							That it was specially intended for members of Congress, and that young
							men who chose to attend were therefore requested to take seats in the
							circular gallery.— The singularity of this notice was not unobserved;
							and there were those who thought it not inoffensive— I thought it quite
							unnecessary for its ostensible purpose; but I accepted it as an
							invitation of attendance to members of Congress— <persRef
								ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates</persRef>
							was the preacher and his text was 1. Corinthians 13.4. [“]Charity
							suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not: Charity vaunteth not
							itself, is not puffed up— 5. Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh
							not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.” D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates had read the whole of that
							incomparable chapter the amplified exposition of the Sermon upon the
							mount and the quintessence of the Christian system as regards this
							world— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates began with a preliminary
							Dissertation upon Self love and disinterested benevolence—and he pointed
							out the obvious distinction between self-love, and selfishness.— Then he
							analysed the several properties positive and negative attributed in the
							text to Charity—spoke something about the practice of duelling, and the
							code of honour, and without making any direct application to members of
							Congress, indirectly exhorted them under the name of Christian courtesy
							to long-suffering and kindness, and cautioned them against vain boasting
							and self conceit, unseemly behaviour, captiousness and evil thinking—all
							which was proper, just, and seasonable; but there were not twenty
							members of Congress to hear it— Not more than two thirds of the Seats
							were filled, and, of those that were filled were occupied chiefly by
							women— My attention was perhaps too much diverted by a tall elderly
							gentleman, very neatly dressed with a florid complexion somewhat bald
							and wool white hair, who came in with two young ladies; one of them very
							beautiful and took seats almost facing mine— <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grainger</persRef> with whom I walked home after the service with
								<persRef ref="granger-cornelia">his daughter</persRef>, told me that

							other, the beauty, <persRef ref="u">Miss Stanton</persRef> daughter of
								<persRef ref="stanton-daniel">Daniel Stanton</persRef>, a merchant
							of that city.— I called at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>
							and was informed at the Bar that <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Lawrence</persRef> was better, but <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott"
								>her father</persRef> not so— I visited <persRef ref="reed-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Read</persRef> whom I found
							again at his chamber confined with a relapse of fever and ague— His

									>r</hi> John Taliaferro</persRef> was with him— My next call was
							on <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, who was sore afflicted with a Catarrh, something
							like my own— While I was there M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Griffin

						<p>Last evening <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><space/>Mellen</persRef> of Boston came and passed two hours
							with me in conversation, boiling over with abolitionism— He wrote to me
							some weeks since; and enquired if he could obtain the use of the Hall of
							the House of Representatives to deliver a Lecture disclosing the
							physical causes of the differences in the colour of the human race— I
							answered him that the use of the Hall would certainly not be granted for
							any such purpose; and that in this climate the very proposal if known
							would stamp him as an abolitionist— From his talk this Evening there
							would be no mistake in the conclusion— This morning I was at the Capitol
							at 10 O’Clock to attend the meeting of the Committee of Manufactures,
							but only three other members of the Committee appeared, <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> and <persRef ref="eastman-ira"

							<persRef ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="mitchell-charles">Mitchell</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="davis-john11">Davis</persRef>— The use of the Hall from 10 till
							Noon had been granted, for an exhibition of the blind; and was so
							occupied, but I could not attend it— <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> had offered a
							Resolution to <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> the <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef> to suspend the
							execution of an Article in a Treaty with the Winebago Indians— It had
							passed without opposition or notice— Bell had come to me, and asked if I
							thought it improper to use the word directed as applied to the Secretary
							of War, and whether requested would be better— I had till then not
							noticed the resolution; but when he read it to me I said that neither
							directed nor requested was a suitable word; the House could neither
							direct nor request the head of an executive department to suspend the
							execution of a Treaty; and I would move a reconsideration of the
							Resolution— He said he would ask leave to modify it— He did so—and I
							moved the reconsideration. This was on Saturday, but my motion was not
							entered upon the Journal. I therefore again moved the reconsideration
							this morning— Bell asked leave to modify it to a mere declaration of
							expediency which was done by general consent.— The day was consumed in
							receiving Resolutions; the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> beginning with Kentucky, where he had left off
							this day fortnight, going Northward to Maine, and then backward to Ohio,
							and the States which had then been called.— My call on the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for a report
							of State Stocks purchased was passed; but at the sound of the call on
							the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> for the Amistad
							correspondence, up started the mobocracy and objected— I then offered a
							Resolution of call upon the Secretary of War, concerning the employment
							of the blood hounds— <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Linn Boyd</persRef>
							instantly called for the yeas and nays on the question of consideration—
								<persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> told him it must be
							on the passage of the Resolution, and he moved accordingly— The
							Resolution was thus received, which I had not expected— I said if the
							yeas and nays were to be taken, I should wish to assign in a few words
							my reasons for offering the Resolution, and it was laid over of course—
							They will never take it up— I offered a resolution also referring the
							claim of <persRef ref="larrabee-charles">Charles Larrabee</persRef> to
							the Committee of Invalid Pensions—adjourned at 5. O’Clock— <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here; and in the Evening

							I learnt that <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript"

							resisted by <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> of Indiana a
							motion was at last made to suspend the rules and supersede the further

								<persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> moved a suspension of the

								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise</persRef> was in his seat again
							this day, after an absence of nearly a Month sick; and for the last

								<persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> moved that the

							to report <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin’s</persRef> Bill to
							repeal the act of 14 July 1832. exempting rail-road iron from duty,
							without amendment; the members of the Committee being free to support
							the Bill or oppose it as each one may think proper. The Letter from the
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							recommending a reduction of the drawback on exported sugar, and pickled
							fish, was thoroughly discussed without coming to a conclusion— The
							Letters remonstrating, against the amendment of the Committee to
								<persRef ref="hoyt-jesse">Hoyt’s</persRef> Bill, requiring the
							Appraisers to examine every package of imported goods were considered,
							and it was agreed unanimously with the exception of Dromgoole that the
							Chairman should move to strike out the words— Dromgoole whose only
							object is to defeat all action of the Committee favourable to the
							manufactures, the trickery of points of order, which he and his party so
							shamelessly practice in the house, has made repeated attempts to
							introduce into the Committee— He pretended that because the Bill had
							been reported to the House the Committee had nothing more to do with it;
							and could not instruct their Chairman to propose an amendment to it— He
							said it was the Lex Parliamentaria, but no other member of the Committee
							supported him— The Resolution offered by Worthington, to report a Bill
							reducing the drawback on exported fine sugar to 3 cents a pound from 5
							was taken up— Tillinghast moved an amendment to repeal the exemption of
							pins from duty; but this was rejected by the Committee— The drawback on
							pickled fish was found to be in the form of a bounty— Question arose
							whether its reduction could be included in the same Bill, with the
							reduction of the drawback on sugar, and the whole subject was postponed—
							In the House, <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> had the
							floor on the second Report from the Committee of Elections, but he made
							little progress; the morning hour being consumed in bitter altercation

						<p>Rather an uneasy Night with admonitions to beware of the house of
							feasting.— I was awake between 3 and 4 this morning, and a dispersion of
							Spirits disabled me for writing beyond the journal of yesterday— At the
							House <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> occupied again the
							floor upon the New-Jersey election case, and exposed the falsehood of
							the Report of the Committee and the prevarication of the majority of the
							Committee who made it— The subterfuges and evasions to suppress the
							testimony which falsifies the conclusion of the report are
							heart-sickening. A Supplement to the National Intelligencer of this
							Morning contains an Address to the People of the United States signed by
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Millard Fillmore</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="smith-truman">Trueman Smith</persRef>; <persRef
								ref="crabb-george2">George W. Crabb</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="botts-john">John M. Botts</persRef> the Minority of the
							Committee; and their Report which the majority of the House have
							suppressed, by refusing the order that it should be printed— At the
							close of the hour <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>
							called for the orders of the day; and feebly asked that the
							consideration of the Treasury Note Bill should be taken up: but did not
							call for the yeas and nays, and his motion to suspend the rules was
							rejected. <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> said to
							me yesterday that as no appropriations had yet been made, he saw no
							reason for hurrying the Treasury Note Bill— The true reason of their
							delay is to wait for the reinforcement of their five recruits from
							New-Jersey. The House went into Committee of the whole<space/><persRef
								ref="davee-thomas">Davee</persRef> in the Chair, and took up the
							private Bills reported by the Committee of Claims—among them was the
							Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer
								Lobdell</persRef>, which was laid aside to be reported to the House
							without opposition or remark— As I had no charge of any other of the
							Bills which could come up this day I availed myself of the opportunity
							to go into the Library to look up some information respecting the use of
							blood hounds— <persRef ref="wise-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Jamaica in two 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> Volumes, which he
							yesterday put into my hands, I to be responsible for returning them to
							the Library.— I found there the 32<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> volume
							of <persRef ref="hansard-thomas">Hansard’s</persRef> Parliamentary
							debates p. 922, the debate upon <persRef ref="mcleod-norman">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> M’Leod’s</persRef> motion in the House
							of Common’s on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of March 1796.— The

								ref="sheridan-richard">Sheridan</persRef>. Dundas apologetical, and
							promising to prohibit the use of the dogs—on the faith of which Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l</hi> M’Leod withdrew his motion.— I found also
							a History of the Maroon War; at the close of the first volume of
								<persRef ref="edwards-bryan">Bryan Edwards’s</persRef> History of
							the West Indies— Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> M’Leod in his Speech
							read an extract from <persRef ref="robertson-william3"
								>Robertson’s</persRef> history of America referring to the works of
								<persRef ref="lascasas-bartolome">Las Casas</persRef> concerning the
							use of blood hounds against the indians by the Spaniards in that age.— I
							have still to consult Robertson, and Las Casas— On returning to the
							house just after the Clock struck 4. I found the members coming out, the
							house having just adjourned. The Committee had been obliged to rise upon
							finding itself without a Quorum— Returning home I stop’d at <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> to enquire of the state of
								<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">his daughter</persRef>— She
							is convalescent, but he has a very threatening bilious fever, and the
							bar-keeper told me that <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lawrence</persRef> was taken ill this
							morning.— Evening too drowsy for work.</p>

							declined. At the House the first hour was occupied again by <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> in examining reviewing and
							dissecting the report of the Committee of Elections, and the gross
							inconsistency of the majority of the House and of the Committee in their
							proceedings— Neither the report of the Committee, nor their journal, nor
							one particle of the testimony has yet been printed. Not a word of the
							testimony against the illegal returns rejected by the <persRef
								ref="pennington-william">Governor</persRef> and Council of
							New-Jersey was even considered by the Committee.— They gave the parties
							time to take their testimony till the second<space/>in April— Six weeks
							before that time the house pass a resolution instructing them to report
							forthwith, which set of the candidates had a majority of the lawful
							votes of the People of New-Jersey, and they report forthwith that the
							noncommissioned claimants have a majority of lawful votes, with an
							argument proving that whether the majority was of lawful votes or not
							depends entirely upon evidence yet to come, and for the procurement of
							which the Committee had given the parties time till the second week in
							April.— In this state of things, evidence is received by the house,
							proving the illegality of the Southampton election, in the face of
							which, under the screw of the previous question, the house pass a
							Resolution directing the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef>
							to swear in the non-commissioned members as having the majority of the
							lawful votes, without waiting for further evidence, and without ever
							having heard the parties.— Jenifer has probed this state of the

							when the orders of the day were called. <persRef ref="rives-francis"
								>Rives</persRef> intreated that the house would suffer the debate to

						<p>When I commence this morning with reading, I lose the precious hours for
							writing and they are never retrieved. This morning I finished the

							Merchants Magazine for March 1840. upon the principles of credit, by my
							Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— It was first
							intended for a Lecture before the Mercantile Library Association at
							New-York; but thinking it on reflection too long and too abstract, he
							took another subject for the Lecture, and published this in the
							Magazine— I read also the Introduction to the Second Edition of judge
								<persRef ref="jay-william">William Jay’s</persRef> View of the
							Action of the federal Government in behalf of Slavery— I borrowed at the
							Congress Library yesterday a Volume containing a tract in French,

							by <persRef ref="lascasas-bartolome">Las Casas</persRef>, Bishop of
							Chiapa upon the Tyranny and cruelties perpetrated by the Spaniards in
							the West Indies, among which page 15 was the employment of blood hounds
							trained to tear to pieces and devour the Indians of Hispaniola— I walked

						<p>I found this morning in the collection of the works of <persRef
								ref="lascasas-bartolome">Las Casas</persRef> the original treatise
							in Spanish upon the cruelties of the Spaniards in the New world of which
							the French book which I had previously consulted was a translation, and

								ref="robertson-william3">Robertson’s</persRef> History of America,

							of the New World— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Force had just sent me

								ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbet</persRef>, <persRef ref="davis-john11"
								>Davis</persRef> and <persRef ref="worthington-john"

							read and consider ten petitions for levying a duty upon silks; upon
							which I said I was desirous of making a report to the House, and of
							receiving the instructions of the Committee upon what principles to make
							it— After some discussion the subject was postponed.—Two Petitions from
							Chester C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> praying for the revision of the
							Tariff, and a Temperance Petition from Walworth N.Y were read. I was
							directed to report a motion that the Committee be discharged from the
							further consideration of them and that the latter should be referred to
							the military and naval Committees and to the Ways and means— In the
							House, the pretenders from New-Jersey <persRef ref="dickerson-philemon">Dickinson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="vroom-peter">Vroom</persRef>, <persRef ref="cooper-william4"
								>Cooper</persRef>, <persRef ref="ryall-daniel">Ryall</persRef> and

								<persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> moved to postpone

							There was a call for the credentials of the counterfeits— The Speaker
							said there was a Resolution of the House that they should be sworn,
							which superseded the necessity of their producing credentials, and they
							were sworn— It was petition day— The several questions of instructions
							to the Committee of the Ways and Means of the petition from Illinois for
							appropriations to the continuance of the Cumberland road, were under a
							motion for the previous question— There was a call of the house 192
							members answered, and further proceedings superseded— <persRef

								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> withdrew his, and
								<persRef ref="casey-zadok">Casey’s</persRef> Instructions were

							during the call of which a Petition presented by <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef>, which the Speaker
							decided to be within the rule, and from which decision I took an appeal,
							brought an adjournment at 5. O’Clock; much to the annoyance of the

						<p>I received a message from the Globe Office, requesting me to call there
							this morning which I did, after first visiting the pension office, and
							leaving there a pension certificate, in favour of <persRef
								ref="clark-mehitabel">Mehitabel Clark</persRef> of Masonville,
							Delaware County, New-York, with a claim from her for its increase, and
							two depositions in support of the claim— At the Globe Office, the

							Smithsonian bequest Bill, which I gave him— He said he would send me the
							first proof sheet of the Report to-morrow morning— I bespoke 100 copies
							of the report, without the appendix, for which they would charge me,
								<persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef> said 2 dollars— At the
							House, a motion was made to suspend the rules to enable the members from
							the States which were not called yesterday, to present petitions, but it
							was lost 8 to 7. <persRef ref="reed-john">John Reed</persRef> was
							allowed to report two Bills from the naval Committee having been absent

								>Jenifer</persRef> convicted the majority and Chairman of the
							Committee of the grossest and most glaring inconsistency, in which the
							majority of the house is equally involved— I never knew a contested
							election decided upon any principle of justice, nor did I ever know a

							this. Jenifer was succeeded by <persRef ref="brown-aaron">A. J.
								Brown</persRef> of Tennessee a member of the majority of the
							Committee, who had spoken only a few minutes when the hour expired, and
							the orders of the day were called— The house went into Committee of the

								>Cushing</persRef>, in an hour and a half concluded the Speech which

							no real opposition— <persRef ref="king-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> King</persRef> of Georgia took the floor, when Cushing

							was folded up like a Letter, sealed with black wax, with a Seal which

							and of the three witnesses, all which were in pale ink, and other hand

							thousand eight hundred and thirty <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rogers said that was a mistake—that the

								>rs</hi> Hay embarked for France; that he Rogers had written the
							will copied verbatim from a draught in her own hand writing—that the

							with the Will, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hay gave him a beautiful

						<p><persRef ref="browne-william">William Browne</persRef> was here this
							morning to make an arrangement for the note which he gave me on the
								16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May 1829.— Which arrangement
							consists in a promise to give me a new note with the same endorser.— I
							received from the Globe Office the first sheet proof of my report on the
							Smithsonian bequest Bill—and found on revising it, no less a blunder
							than <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson’s</persRef> Message
							of 17. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1835 printed twice— I took it
							to the Office and shewed it to the foreman who said it must be printed
							over again— Afterwards he sent a messenger up to the house for a copy of
							my Resolutions presented to the joint Committee on the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>
							1839. and adopted by the House Committee on the 13<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of the same Month— I was obliged to have a copy of them
							made from the manuscript journal of the last year’s Committees, by
								<persRef ref="berry-brooke">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Berry</persRef> of the Clerk’s Office, which I sent to the Globe
							Office; and in the Evening, I received a second proof sheet of my report
							which I revised. At the House <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron V.
								Brown</persRef> of Tennessee a member of the Committee of Elections
							occupied the morning hour, in a laborious, abortive effort to defend the
							majority of the Committee against the charges of <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef>— Neither the Majority of the
							Committee nor the House can be defended for their conduct in this case—
							To this day there has been neither authentic evidence nor hearing of the
							parties before the house, and the Committee after they had given time to
							the parties to take testimony till the second Monday in April, by order
							of the house reported that the spurious claimants had a majority of the
							lawful votes, when the very purpose for which they had given time to the
							parties to take testimony was to ascertain that fact— The conduct of the
							majority of the House in this case from beginning to end has been
							governed by Will, and not by judgment; and so I fear it will always be
							in every case of contested election— I never knew it otherwise.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown’s argument was moderate and decorous
							in manner, but at once over confident and feeble in substance— He told
							me that he was not much accustomed to public speaking, and that he had
							spoken under much agitation— But he preserved perfect self command, and
							a clear and consistent course of argument, in answering the successive
							charges of Jenifer— It is a remarkable illustration of the composition
							of Congress, that in this Committee of nine members selected at random,
							every one has a good talent for public speaking— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brown did not finish, but will take two, if not three more

							and a boy 13. with a Salary of 1500 dollars a year, and 275 dollars to
							pay for house-rent, he finds it very difficult to get along, and is
							sometimes ready to be disheartened— He wished to know whether he could
							not get from some of the public departments occasionally some writing
							for his daughters to do—and whether some thing could not be brought out
							of the Smithsonian fund which might benefit him— He has had his eye
							steadily upon this ever since the first notice of the existence of the
							Smithsonian bequest— <persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Elizabeth
								Pierce</persRef> was here this morning; and brought with her, a
							doctor’s certificate that her Sister <persRef ref="telfair-mary">M<hi

							of them was lawfully elected, and then before the given day, without
							waiting for the evidence, and without hearing the parties, admitting one
							set of the claimants to the contested seats, under a forced report that

						<p>At the meeting of the Committee of Manufactures yesterday it was agreed
							that the Chairman should report a bill, to increase the duties on silks,
							from ten to twenty per cent upon importations from beyond the Cape of
							Good Hope or Cape Horn, and from five to ten per Cent upon importations
							from within the Capes, and I was directed to prepare and submit to the
							Committee a report to accompany the Bill— The Memorial asking for the
							patronage of Congress to the silk Journal, finds no countenance in the
							Committee—the Article of silk covered buttons was added to <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillinghasts</persRef> Bill— This morning I was occupied in
							searching the documents relating to the Navy Pension fund, instead of
							those relating to the culture of silk which I ought perhaps to have
							preferred— At the House, <persRef ref="brown-aaron">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Aaron V. Brown</persRef> consumed
							within a few minutes the morning hour; in concluding his speech on the
							New-Jersey election case, and when he sat down <persRef
								ref="watterson-harvey">Watterson</persRef> of Tennessee, right
							behind him, instantly started up, and moved the previous question— By
							what accident it happened I know not, but this motion failed to obtain a

								>Botts</persRef> then took the floor, but said he would yield it to

							was willing now to rest the case where it was, and take the question—but
							whether he might have occasion to say any thing further on the subject
							might depend upon what Botts should say— <persRef ref="fisher-charles"
								>Fisher</persRef> said much the same— Botts asked <persRef

							the issue of his atchievement of last Saturday, consumed in supplication
							to the house to save him, <persRef ref="rives-elizabeth">his wife</persRef> and children from the necessity of
							his fighting a duel with Jenifer, now said nothing— Botts began, and
							spoke about 5 minutes, when <persRef ref="jones-john9">Jones</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Ways and Means, called for the orders of the day, and
							moved a suspension of the rules to take up the Treasury Note Bill—

								<persRef ref="elliot-william">William Elliot</persRef> of this City,
							of manners rather obtrusive, whom I have for that reason always treated
							with reserve and even with coldness— His father was an English Unitarian
							Dissenter; a man of Science and of great merit, who died here very
							suddenly, two or three years since— This young man was educated as a
							printer, and is now a clerk in the pension Office— He brought me last
							Evening a pension certificate of 80 dollars a year for <persRef
								ref="clark-mehitabel">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mehitable
								Clark</persRef> with a Letter from the <persRef ref="edwards-james"
								>Commissioner of Pensions</persRef>— He brought also a Manuscript
							folio Volume of his fathers diary, and of which he said he had several
							others He read from it two extracts one of 3 and 4. March 1829. and one
							of 2. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1833. in both of which he spoke
							favourably of me—and he said there were many others, expressive of
							stronger Sentiments— The minute under date of 2. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1833. was that he called upon me and found
							me very busy— I told his Son now, what it was upon which I had then been
							busy— It was on the Report of the Minority of the Committee of
							Manufactures reviewing <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson’s</persRef> Message of 4. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							1832.— This young man talked with much bitterness of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="paulding-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Paulding</persRef> the present
							Secretary <unclear>of</unclear> the Navy— But I did not encourage him in
							this conversation— At the Houses this day there was some waiting for
								<persRef ref="botts-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Botts</persRef> who was engaged with the Committee of elections
							until sent for— He then began his speech on the New Jersey election
							case; but in about half an hour by a call from <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> for the orders of the day,
							the subject was again postponed. Jones moved as usual to suspend the
							rules to take up the Treasury Note Bill and again failed for lack of a
							vote of two thirds the yeas and nays being 103 to 68. The private Bills
							reported yesterday from the Committee of the whole were taken up and
							passed to a third reading without opposition, excepting the bill for the
							relief of the sufferers by fire in New-York, which was pertinaciously
							debated, and resisted tooth and nail by <persRef ref="petrikin-david"
								>Petrikin</persRef> and his gang; but finally passed to a third
							reading of yeas and nays— The question when the third reading should be
							came next—the call was for now— <persRef ref="turney-hopkins"
								>Turney</persRef> moved this day week— The vote was for now; but by
							the chicanery of successive motions for adjournment the purpose was
							defeated, and by the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker’s</persRef>
							want of energy, or his lukewarmness to the efficient adjustment of
							private claims the House adjourned between 3 and 4 without passing a
							single Bill— They ought to have passed at least 40— I spoke to <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Cushing</persRef> about a meeting of the delegation from
							Massachusetts for consultation to which he assented. I called at
								<persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>, and was informed that

								ref="bates-joshua2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates</persRef>,
							who is a very good and sensible preacher—a relict of the last century—
							His text was from Acts 3.19. [“]Repent ye, therefore, and be converted,
							that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall
							come, from the presence of the Lord.”— Repentance and conversion,
							indispensable for salvation was the Doctors theme, and his discourse was
							Calvinism of the mildest character, for he divided professing Christian—
							1. Those who performed all the Christian duties, and who needed no
							conversion and 2. Those who lived in the indulgence of any known sin—
							And to the latter Class, if any of such were present to hear him he gave
							solemn and emphatic warning that unless they should repent and be
							converted they would perish eternally— The auditory was thin— I called
							at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> where the barkeeper
							informed me that <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript"

							levying the duty on silks not being present that subject was passed
							over— There were several Memorials praying for a revision of the Tariff—
							The committee voted, the Chairman only dissenting, to ask to be
							discharged from the consideration of them, upon the principle that it is
							not yet time to revise the Tariff— I said I thought it was full time for
							taking it up; and that I would shortly ask the Committee to authorize me
							to offer to the House a Resolution calling upon the <persRef

							the next Session of Congress an entire revisal of the Tariff M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis said he should be willing to vote
							for such a Resolution— The Committee acted upon several other
							references, and despatched more business than they have done any other
							day this Session. At the House a Motion was made to suspend the rules
							which devote this day to the presentation of Resolutions to take up that
							of Petitions— The first vote by rising was 77 to 36 more than two
							thirds, but no Quorum— I called for the yeas and nays and the vote then
							was 107 to 62 not quite two thirds, but so near it that while it was
							taking <persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> of Maine came
							to my seat and intreated me as my turn to be called for petitions would
							come before his, to offer only those of my petitions which would
							occasion no debate—postponing the others till next Monday which will be
							petition day again— I told him that it would give me the greatest
							pleasure to accommodate him; but that I had already once postponed the
							presentation of debatable petitions, at the instance of others, and
							could not in the consciencious discharge of my duties repeat the
							concession.— But the suspension failed, as did the motion of <persRef

							take up the Treasury Note Bill;—by a vote of 112 to 67. The call for
							Resolutions commenced with Maine— Massachusetts soon followed— I offered
							3. Resolutions— 1. a Call upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef>, for documents relating to the surrender of
							persons demanded by foreign Governments, or upon them by the United
							States in the case of the Schooner Plattsburg and others— Adopted
							without opposition, after <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef>
							had required a second reading of it before the vote was taken— 2. A Call
							upon the <persRef ref="paulding-james">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>
							for a statement of purchases and Sales of Navy Pension fund investments
							in State Stocks—adopted without a position 3. A declaratory resolution
							against the practice of pairing off— Objected to by <persRef
								ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef>, and laid over 4. I called up,
							and modified the Resolution respecting the Africans of L’Amistad,
							adopted— The Call reached the State of Indiana; when upon an attempt of

							the House adjourned.</p>

						<p>I called this morning, first, at the pension office, and left with the
								<persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner</persRef> a Letter from my

								<persRef ref="troup-jennet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jennet
								Troup</persRef>— Then at the War Office— The <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary Poinsett</persRef>, was absent, at his
							own house; I left with the chief Clerk, a minute to remind him of the
							application of <persRef ref="turner-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Samuel A. Turner</persRef> of Scituate to be appointed
							one of the Visitors of the West-Point Academy next June— Then at the
							Navy Department where I left with the <persRef ref="paulding-james"
								>Secretary Paulding</persRef> a Letter from <persRef
								ref="billings-oliver">Oliver Billings</persRef>, concerning a claim
							of wages due to his <persRef ref="cary-thomas4">grandson Cary</persRef>,
							discharged last Summer as a boy from the naval school at New-York— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Paulding said he would refer the claim to
								<persRef ref="downes-john">Commodore Downes</persRef> Commander of
							the Navy yard at Brooklyn— At the House, after an ineffectual motion of
								<persRef ref="rariden-james">Rariden</persRef> to suspend the rules
							to conclude the call of the States for Resolutions, the New-Jersey
							election report came up for the morning hour which was consumed without
							his concluding— <persRef ref="jones-john9">Jones</persRef> of the Ways
							and Means called for the orders of the day— Committee of the whole on
							the state of the Union, <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef>
							in the Chair— <persRef ref="trumbull-joseph">Trumbull</persRef> made a
							speech against the Bill— <persRef ref="black-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Black</persRef> then moved that the
							Committee should rise to enable him to make the report from the
							Committee on the public printing which was to be made this day—but this
							motion was lost—the floor was then occupied successively by <persRef
								ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef>, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"

								ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbet</persRef> and <persRef

							administration rather than to the Bill— Then about Sunset, <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef> rose and said that he wished to present his views
							at large upon the bill; but being somewhat indisposed, and much
							exhausted he asked the indulgence of the house to postpone hearing him
							till to-morrow, and moved the Committee should rise with a view to the
							adjournment of the house— The men of Kinderhoek had decided that they
							would force the bill through—without answering any of the opposition
							Speeches, this Night— They refused to rise by a vote of tellers 53 to
							90— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard after a few remarks
							reasserting his inability from physical weakness to do justice to
							himself or to his constituents indisposed and exhausted as he was at
							that time moved again the Committee to rise—the count was again taken by
							tellers and was 10 ayes 85 noes—all the opposition members forbearing to
							vote and thus leaving the majority without a quorum.— The Committee were
							thus compelled to rise and report this fact to the house, and this first
							disclosed to both parties of the house the secret of the defensive
							strength of the minority—a strength the more impregnable as it consists
							in silence and precludes all disorder. The rage of the majority at this
							discovery was unbounded but it was impotent— After various efforts</p>
						<pb n="404" type="ms"/>
						<p>Nuit blanche</p>
						<p>to prove a quorum present by counting the members all ineffectual, the
							Committee rose and reported no Quorum <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> lisping drunk moved a call of the house
								<persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> to adjourn—
								<persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef> called for the
							yeas and nays on the motion to adjourn. 31 to 95. a Quorum voting—31
							whigs afraid to abstain from voting, upon a call of yeas and nays— If
							only five of them had had the firmness to abstain from voting the
							majority would even then have been compelled to adjourn for want of a
							quorum— But a present quorum being ascertained the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> called the Chairman of the
							Committee of the whole again to the Chair— Barnard immediately renewed
							the motion that the Committee should rise, and the vote by tellers was
							10 to 92. no Quorum— The majority finding themselves impotent for
							business, resorted to expedients— The first was a call to <hi
								rend="italic">count</hi> the members present to prove a quorum
							present, which Dawson the Chairman at first decided he had no right to
							do, but for which he afterwards said he had found a precedent, and did;
							a number of the opposition members then left their Seats and went
							outside of the bar— Dawson counted and announced 107 members present— I
							never left my seat, but did not vote— Motions were made and Resolutions
							were offered by <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="beatty-william">Beatty</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="crary-isaac">Crary</persRef> to compel me to vote; but by
							previous contradictory decisions of the house, there was no time when
							any such motion could be entertained— The Committee were again compelled
							to rise and report no Quorum. <persRef ref="clifford-nathan"
								>Clifford</persRef> moved to discharge the Committee of the whole
							from the consideration of the Bill; but as there was an appropriation in
							the Bill not acted upon in Committee this motion could not be
							entertained— About one O’Clock in the Morning a Call of the house was
							ordered by Yeas and Nays 91 to 71—so that there were then at least 162
							members present, besides the Speaker and me, who did not vote— Yet at
							the first call of the names only 135 members answered— Noisy, confused
							and abortive negotiations for compromise commenced, to rise and report
							the Bill, with a pledge that there should be time allowed to debate the
							Bill in the house.— At the second call of the names 149 answered. 15
							were excused. 62 were not excused— The doors were closed and the
								<persRef ref="dorsey-roderick">Sergeant at arms</persRef> was
							despatched for the absentees— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander"
								>Duncan</persRef> moved that I should be compelled to vote— Not in
							order— Beatty moved a resolution of censure upon me for not voting—not
							in order motions to suspend the call and to adjourn were multiplied and
							failed—22 members at one time and 14 at another were brought in, by the
							Sergeant at arms, called to account and excused or fined— At 8 in the
							Morning, the call was superseded, dilatory motions succeeded and failed.
							A second call of the house was ordered, and I now answered to my name—
							The call was suspended <pb n="405" type="ms"/>and about 11. A.M M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard began his speech against the Bill,
							and kept the floor with some interruptions till near 2. P.M— He was
							followed a short explanatory speech by John W. Jones; then by <persRef
								ref="goggin-william">Goggin</persRef> of Virginia, in a speech of an
							hour against the Bill— Then after sundry motions for the Committee to
							rise, about 4. O’Clock P.M— Duncan of Ohio took the floor, and said he
							had, very few remarks to make upon the Bill, before the House, but he
							would make a long Speech on the Florida War— He spoke accordingly about
							half an hour during which the members were dropping and pairing off,
							till the quorum vanished again—the Committee rose to announce it— Three
							or four members of the two sides agreed, to finish the debate on the
							Bill to-morrow and at 5. O’Clock, a motion to adjourn was carried by
							yeas and nays 73 to 34— I walked home and found my family at dinner.
							From my breakfast yesterday morning till one this afternoon, 28 hours, I
							had fasted— My Carriage had been waiting for me four or five hours last
							evening till <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas</persRef> the Coachman
							could hold out no longer, and came home sick and faint— <persRef
								ref="leary-jeremy">Jerry Leary</persRef> remained at the Capitol
							nearly the whole night and brought me this morning a couple of small
							Sandwiches which I ate— But I felt during the whole process, neither
							hunger, thirst, not drowsiness— Fasting and quietude are the only way
							for me to pass through these ordeals— I retired to bed, about 9 O’Clock
							this Evening.</p>

						<p>I rose at six this morning after nine hours of sound sleep, fully

								ref="nisbet-eugenius">Nisbet</persRef>, <persRef ref="davis-john11"
								>Davis</persRef> and <persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>— I
							offered a Resolution, that the Chairman be directed to report to the

								of the Treasury</persRef> to report to the House, in the first <hi
								rend="strikethrough">Session of the next Congres</hi> week of the

							encouragement of the manufactures, and internal industry of this
							Country. This Resolution was discussed till the time for the meeting of
							the House. Worthington and Eastman did not directly oppose it. They were
							the minority of the meeting, and could not have prevented its adoption—
							But as Dromgoole and Nisbet were absent, I wished not to take the
							Committee by <pb n="406" type="ms"/>surprize, and readily consented to
							postpone the further consideration of it, till next Monday— At the
							House, after the receipt of some executive communications, and of some
							testimony concerning the New-Jersey-election case which was laid on the
							table, <persRef ref="botts-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Botts</persRef> concluded his morning hour Speech— <persRef
								ref="andrews-landaff">Andrews</persRef> of Kentucky moved the

								ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef> occupied the remainder of the
							hour in disgorging the venom of as foul a soul, as I have ever met in
							public life— <persRef ref="jones-john9">Jones</persRef> interrupted him
							by calling for the orders of the day— <persRef ref="black-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Black</persRef> interposed with a
							majority report of the select Committee on the public printing, closing
							with a Resolution, for the printing of a majority and minority report,
							and a bundle of testimony— And yet no report on the proposition for
							separating the printing of Congress from the Newspaper press— After some
							altercation between Black and <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
								Garland</persRef> a minority member of the Committee, the Resolution
							was agreed to by General consent that all the papers should be printed,
							and the Treasury Note Bill was taken up— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander"
								>Duncan</persRef> resumed the floor and discoursed three hours more
							on the Florida War— The whole speech was made for the sake of a furious
							onset upon my blood hound Resolution—now on the Calendar of business,
							and which the house will not suffer me to debate.— I assured the house
							that I should take no notice of any personality which the member should
							apply to me and that I would not now consume a moment of the time of the
							house, to be charged by the Globe with wasting the time of the House
							upon irrelevant matter, or to interfere with the arrangement between
							certain members of the two parties last Evening, to finish this debate
							this day, in which arrangement I took no part; but with which I would
							not interfere— I trusted the house would, at some future day allow me to
							give my reasons for offering the Resolution respecting the employment of
							the blood hounds.— And as to the justificatory Letter of the <persRef

							two lines of an English Poet applied by him to Spaniels but which seemed
							equally applicable to the Secretary of War’s blood hounds</p>
						<lg>
							<l>So, well bred Spaniels, civilly delight</l>
							<l>In mumbling of the game they dare not bite.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>A shout of laughter in the house at this quotation cast such a damper
							upon Duncan’s fire, that his gang clustered round him and persuaded him
							to bring his speech to a close— Then <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef>, <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A.
								Cooper</persRef>, <persRef ref="montgomery-william"
									>Montgomery</persRef> and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"

								type="ms"/><persRef ref="scott-winfield">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Scott</persRef>, against Duncan’s assertions of facts

								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> with his usual

								>Graves</persRef> then took the floor for a long speech, and a
							negotiation ensued till a new bargain was concluded that the Committee
							should rise and the house adjourn, with a pledge, that the Bill shall be

								>Pickens</persRef> and the South-Carolina nullifiers, six or eight

							said truly there was not the slightest present danger—but of which
								<persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> somewhat obscurely intimated
							that he was afraid, from the impetuosity of the People of Maine,

								ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cooper-james">Cooper</persRef> and <persRef

							speech from Alford, and a rough and tumble of debate, followed by the
							successive rejection of all the amendments proposed till ten O’Clock at
							Night, when a motion succeeded that the Committee should rise and report
							the Bill.— While this was doing Eastman stationed himself directly in
							front of the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker’s</persRef> chair, and
							amid a Chorus of “M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker” from at least
							30 voices, was the first whom the Speaker chose to hear, and he moved
							the previous Question which was seconded and carried— The bill was
							ordered to be engrossed for a third reading by yeas and nays 115 to 76
							and then was read a third time and passed, again by yeas and nays 110 to
							66. I voted for the Bill; <pb n="408" type="ms"/>but almost all the

								>Proffit</persRef> of Indiana had made in Committee of the whole a

							however rejected by the usual majority the average of 9 to 7— After the
							Bill was passed <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> moved to

							dissipation almost as incapacitation as if the hours were wasted in
							licentious orgies—dissipation of mind, in which the will loses its
							controul over the action of the body— At the house this day the scene
							was entirely changed—instead of the excitement of the last four
							days—instead of the full seats, the crowded galleries, the fiery
							opposition, and antagonizing bustle, half the chairs in the house were
							vacant, the galleries were empty, and the very sounds of the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speakers</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef> voices were drowsy— The first
							hour was consumed by <persRef ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef> of
							Ohio, a member of the Committee of Elections, and the most impudently
							unprinciple rogue of the Kinderhoek pack— He stationed himself so near
							to the seat of <persRef ref="hall-hiland">Hiland Hall</persRef> which I
							have occupied during his absence; that the atmosphere around him was
							like that of a spot visited by a skunk in a summer evening— I returned
							to my own seat; and wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="green-john3">J. A.
								Green</persRef> Editor of the Quincy Patriot— When the hour had
							elapsed the orders of the day were called, and a number of private bills
							at the third reading were passed; among which was the bill for the
							relief of <persRef ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer Lobdell</persRef>.—

							benefit of a trial by jury, and they found a balance of several hundred
							dollars due to him— Seven or eight years have since passed away, during
							which he has been petitioning Congress for this balance, and hitherto
							without success. The bitterness of party spite has prevented the passage
							of the bill, and <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire this day emitted a half an hour of his rotten breath
							against it— But <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef> of
								<pb n="409" type="ms"/>Maine supported it, and <persRef
								ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> of Illinois, and after
							narrowly escaping a motion to adjourn, and a fragment of a quorum, it
							was finally carried by yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>. After the bills
							at the third reading were gone through it was impossible to keep the
							house together and they adjourned soon after 3— A dull Evening succeeded
							to an overanxious, weak, and seeing as I do from day to day the downward
							tendency of all moral principle in our politics, I am almost ready to
							sink into despondency, and to believe that a judgment of Heaven is

						<p>Attended public worship this morning at the Capitol and heard <persRef
								ref="cookman-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cookman</persRef>, the chaplain of the Senate— He read the 6<hi

							chapters of Judges—containing the first part of the history of <persRef
								ref="gideon">Gideon</persRef>; and took for his text, the last
							clause of Chapter 7 v. 20—“The sword of the Lord and of Gideon.” The
							discourse was spirited, but far inferior at least in its impression upon
							me to that which I had heard him deliver this day four weeks, and
							confirmed me in the conviction that all preaching without notes has two
							great defects—uniformity and inequality— I have heard many
							extemporaneous preachers, the first time with high admiration—the second
							with pleasure—the third with the sentiment of the crambe repetita, the
							fourth without much wish to hear the same preacher again— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman’s sermons, are of the class that a
							hearer cannot forget— Those of ordinary preachers, as I at least cannot
							remember— I shall not forget this exposition of the character and
							history of Gideon; but it was very imperfect; confined to the first part
							of his life—the lowliness of his parentage—whereupon the preacher
							indulged himself in some remarks abundantly democratic— Then upon the
							wet and the dry fleece; and upon Gideon’s modesty—which he said was
							characteristic of all great men—a remark common enough but not
							universally nor even generally true— The character of Gideon, like all
							those of the old and new Testament, Jesus alone excepted, is like the
							characters of men in real life, of “mingled yarn.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman’s view of it was all panegyrical—
							His description of the blast of trumpets, and the broken pitchers,
							opening the lamps of the 300 chosen men, upon the Midianites in the
							valley by the hill Moreh was well wrought and delivered with a voice of
							thunder and he assigned a reason why in the reduction of Gideon’s army
							from 32000 to 300 men the last selection was of those that lapped the
							water like dogs, leaving those who stooped down to drink upon their
							knees— He thought the lappers exhibited the most energy and activity—
							But he said it was only last evening that he had determined to preach
							upon this text.— He had previously intended to discourse from the words
							“He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely—” (Proverbs 10.9.) and so he
							did patch up his Sermon upon Gideon, with sundry common places upon the
							wisdom of righteousness— There was no congruity between the two subjects
								<pb n="410" type="ms"/>and so the whole Sermon was a patched and
							piebald composition altogether destitute of that unity of subject and
							clearness of arrangement which I had admired in the Sermon upon the
							text, take heed unto thyself— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman
							gave notice that at half past 3 this afternoon <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrett</persRef> who had been much
							employed in visiting prisons, would preach at <persRef
								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie’s</persRef>
							church upon that subject— After the morning service I visited the
							members lodging at <persRef ref="fletcher-noah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fletcher’s</persRef>—<persRef ref="gates-seth"
								>Gates</persRef>, <persRef ref="kempshall-thomas"
								>Kempshall</persRef>, <persRef ref="peck-luther">Peck</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="brown-anson">A. Brown</persRef>— Peck has been some
							time confined to the house and is consumptive— Brown has just returned
							from New-York, and brought me the kind remembrance of <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef>— After dinner I attended
							at D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Laurie’s church, and heard M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrett from Matthew 25:36—“I was in
							prison and ye came unto me.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrett’s
							manner is a perfect contrast to that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cookman— Cold—dry—almost apathetic, but with an appearance of suppressed
							sensibility like that of a person struggling to refrain from bursting
							into tears. The discourse consisted almost entirely of incidents which
							have occurred in his personal intercourse with convicts of capital
							crimes—prisoners condemned to death for murder.— There was a collection
							taken up; but it did not appear for what object— The statements were all
							particular facts, to shew the causes which most frequently lead to the
							commission of capital crimes, and to the characters, age and disposition
							most common to those by whom they are committed— The auditory was small,
							and I saw only <persRef ref="calhoun-william">W. B. Calhoun</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="fine-john">John Fyne</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="eastman-ira">Eastman</persRef>, of the Members of Congress— I
							returned this day <persRef ref="binda-giuseppe">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Binda’s</persRef> visit, but he was not at home— He goes
							to-morrow for New-York</p>

						<p>Committee of Manufactures, at ten this Morning; present Adams, <persRef

								ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>

								ref="davis-john11">Davis</persRef>, <persRef ref="worthington-john"
								>Worthington</persRef>, <persRef ref="nisbet-eugenius"
								>Nisbet</persRef>— The Resolution offered by me last Thursday was
							again taken up and discussed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dromgoole
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eastman desired a further
							postponement— The four votes present favourable to the manufactures
							might have carried the Resolution through had I availed myself of the
							absence of the other three members; but one of my purposes is by this
							Resolution to ascertain and make known to the Country the real character
							of the Committee of manufactures— In full Committee my Resolution will
							not pass, but that fact will be made known to the Country—and the
							manufacturing interest will be advised seasonably of their condition,
							and warned to exert itself proportionally for its own salvation at the
							revision of the Tariff— At the motion of Dromgoole I was directed to
							give notice that the Resolution would be the special order for
							discussion at the next Meeting, to the absent members— When I passed
							from the Committee room to the House I found a member from New-York,
							presenting petitions: the house had not been ten minutes in Session; but
							they had already, without waiting a minute for me decided against my
							appeal from <pb n="411" type="ms"/>the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker’s </persRef>decision upon one of <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard’s</persRef> petitions that it was within the rule of
							interdiction— The call proceeded from the State of New-York Northward;
							and many of the members offered Petitions, which gave rise to questions
							whether they were within the rule of exclusion— <persRef
								ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> presented one praying for
							the prohibition of the Slave trade in the District of Columbia— It was
							not within the Letter of the Rule—but the Speaker decided that it was
							within the rule, and upon my appeal the house sustained his decision, by
							yeas and nays—119 to 29 <persRef ref="smith-john20">John Smith</persRef>
							of Vermont, an administration man, presented a Petition for measures
							against the foreign Slave trade, and for a modification of the Laws of
							the District of Columbia, so that coloured freemen may not be sold for
							jail fees— Smith left it for the Speaker to decide, whether this
							petition came within the rule— He decided that it did—an appeal was
							taken, by <persRef ref="james-francis">James</persRef> of Pennsylvania,
							and upon taking the yeas and nays they were 70 to 42 No Quorum—a motion
							to adjourn was immediately made but failed— A quorum was rallied, and
							fearing that I should be cut off from presenting any petitions by an
							adjournment I proposed that the question upon the appeal should now be
							taken by a count, without consuming time by taking the yeas and nays
							when it was ascertained that there was a decided majority of the house
							to sustain the Speaker’s decision— The Slavers insisted upon the yeas
							and nays; whereupon James withdrew his appeal— It was near Sunset when
							the call came to Massachusetts, and the Speaker gave the floor to almost
							every member from the State before me— <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef> had a great number
							of abolition Petitions, and persisted in presenting them one by one,
							announcing the name of the first signer, the number of signers and the
							prayer of the petition, till in a fit of impatience Dromgoole started up
							and said if Saltonstall continued, he would raise the question of
							disrespect to the house— Saltonstall however without heeding him went
							through— At last I got the floor, and proposed as a compromise to send
							to the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef> table five hundred
							and eleven petitions memorials and remonstrances, and to leave it
							entirely to the Speaker to dispose of them at his discretion.— To return
							to me those which he should decide to come within the rule—to lay on the
							table those which would go there by motion if separately presented; and
							to refer to the appropriate Committees all the rest. Several of the
							Georgia members resisted the motion, but I stated as my only alternative
							my determination to present separately each petition and demand the
							action of the House upon each, which would have carried the sitting
							through the night— I moved therefore a suspension of the rules, and it
							was carried— My 511 petitions were thus received, and the Speaker is to
							specify those that are not receivable— The call was then continued
							through the States to Maine inclusive and about half past 5 the house
							adjourned.</p>

						<p>As I left my house this morning to go to the Capitol I found <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef> going into his Carriage at the door of his
							lodgings. He offered me a seat in it which I accepted and went with
							him—but he was very unwell, and after a short stay at the house returned
							home— He has been much indisposed since the Night when he was brutally
							compelled to remain in the house, murdering sleep, and then after a
							night’s watching superadded to his exhaustion and infirmity to make his
							speech of three hours on the Treasury Note Bill— At the house, <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> moved an amendment of the
							Journal, to specify one of the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker’s</persRef> decisions against the reception of a petition
							as included within the rule; but after some discussion the motion was
							laid on the table, by a party vote—but my motion to suspend the rules
							and that I might send to the <persRef ref="garland-hugh"
								>Clerk’s</persRef> table 511 petitions memorials and remonstrances
							to be disposed of by the speaker; the suspension of the rules, and the
							fact of my sending the Petitions to the table, all appear upon the
							journal— I had received yesterday a Letter from the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, stating
							that he had received one from the <persRef ref="hoyt-jesse">Collector of
								New-York</persRef>, urging the great importance of passing as soon
							as possible the Bill for suppressing the frauds upon the revenue, and
							more effectually to secure its collection— I sent it to the Clerk’s
							table to be read, and moved that the bill now before the Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union should be made the special order of
							the day for this day fortnight to take precedence of all other business—
							There were calls for this day week and for this day; I modified the
							motion to this day week. <persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, moved an amendment to except the appropriation Bills,
							which was carried by a party vote, and then by a vote of 83 to 41.
							barely two thirds and barely a quorum voting my motion as amended was
							carried. Connor and 40 others the quintessence of party still voting
							against it— After an explanation between <persRef ref="thompson-waddy"
								>Waddy Thompson</persRef> and <persRef ref="duncan-alexander"
								>Duncan</persRef> about some brutality of the latter in his Florida
							War Speech, first reported in the Globe as he spoke it, but since
							qualified in the publication of his speech by himself, <persRef
								ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef> took the morning hour upon the
							New-Jersey election Committee case— He said he would finish in twenty
							minutes more; but <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef>
							called for the Orders of the Day, and <persRef ref="dawson-william"
								>Dawson</persRef> said he wished to offer a Resolution fixing an
							early day for the adjournment of Congress.— The order of the day was
								<persRef ref="bell-john">Bell’s</persRef> Bill to secure the Freedom
							of Elections, and the motion to reject it at the first reading— He spoke
							between two and three hours without concluding— There was an interlude
							Committee of the whole on the Union to pass a Bill from the Committee of
							Commerce to remit duties paid on certain whale ships— Adjourned about 5.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell touched upon <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jeffersons</persRef> professions and practice
							with regard to removals from Office— <persRef ref="morsell-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morsell</persRef> was at my house this
							Evening, and paid 100 dollars on account of his purchase of my
							house.</p>
