								>r</hi> Bayard, until the first of May— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard expects to be able to leave this City for Brest in
							ten days from this time— He is to join the Neptune at Brest; and they
							are to touch in England to take M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							and <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>. I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard just
							ready to remove this morning to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> house— He
							appeared to me very little, if any thing better than when I saw him
							last. He says that by reckoning the intervals from four to four days he
							finds he gains strength. But he is dissatisfied with his physician, the
							third he has already had, and has consulted a fourth, whom he likes
							better— He has for the last four or five days, rode out two or three
							hours every day— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell was just about
							dressing to go and be presented to <persRef ref="charles-xivjohn"
								>Bernadotte’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="clary-bernadine">wife</persRef>— The Crown-Princess of
							Sweden— The weather was too warm for walking; so that after these
							visits, and one to <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Todd</persRef> I returned home, and received a visit
							from <persRef ref="destutt-victor">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Victor
								de Tracy</persRef>— We went in the Evening to the Odeon and saw Il
							Matrimonio Secreto— One of the best performers, <persRef ref="u"
								>Porto</persRef>, as he was entering upon the Stage, stumbled and
							fell, and was so severely hurt by the fall, that it was with extreme
							difficulty he went through his part. He was almost constantly upon the
							Scene, and the great pain he was evidently suffering ruined all the
							pleasure of the performance— The Music was still more delightful at this
							second hearing than it had been at the first. We met <persRef
								ref="turreau-louis">General Turreau</persRef> at the Theatre— He
							complimented me upon the Ratification of the Ghent Treaty—and I
							complimented him, upon his being restored to active service— He smiled
							and said that he rejoyced at the late Revolution, first for the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor’s</persRef> Account, and next for
							his own— For if the Bourbons had continued, he and many others would
							have lost <pb n="241" type="ms"/>their heads— I said that I had no doubt
							but his situation would have been made uneasy; but I could scarcely
							believe that his life would have been endangered— He said I might depend
							upon it that there was a project against his life— That they had gone
							even so far as to reproach him for not having surrendered soon enough
							the fortress where he had commanded— I asked him if there was any news
							from the South, where it is reported that Bordeaux and Marseilles still
							hold out for the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">king</persRef>— He said
							no—every thing was tranquil— But there was much false news circulated at
							Paris, as well as in America— You have not said he laughing, an
							exclusive privilege for that sort of manufacture. It is however certain
							that affairs are not yet settled in the South.</p>

							We all went to see the Museum des Monumens Français, a Collection of the
							sepulchral Monuments taken from the Churches of the suppressed
							Monasteries— They are ranged in Chronological order from the fourth to
							the eighteenth Century inclusive— There are separate halls for the 13<hi

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> 16<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> 17<hi

							centuries. A part of the most recent monuments are in the garden, which
							we did not see; the workmen being employed there upon repairs. The
							monuments are all numbered, and there is a volume sold at the entrance,
							containing the description of them all— They form altogether a History
							of the Art of Sculpture in France— Many of them were mutilated, during
							the frenzy of the Revolution in 1793. and have been restored by the care
							of <persRef ref="lenoir-alexandre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Le
								Noir</persRef>, the keeper of this Cabinet— One of the singular
							mutilations is that of the inscription upon the Monument of <persRef
								ref="lebrun-charles2">Lebrun</persRef> the celebrated Painter under
								<persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>, every word of reference
							to royalty, in this inscription was struck out of the marble by a
							chissel and the rest of the Inscription was left entire— But the figures
							themselves of some of the finest monuments were broken; particularly
							those of <persRef ref="louis-xi">Louis 11</persRef>. and <persRef
								ref="richelieu-armand2">Cardinal Richelieu</persRef>— After passing
							two hours there we walked round the Garden of the Tuileries, and through
							the Palais Royal— Evening at the Theatre Feydeau, or Opera Comique— La
							jeune femme Colere, L’homme sans facon, and le Tableau Parlant— The two
							first of which are miserable pieces, and the third, with the exquisite
							harmony of <persRef ref="gretry-andre">Gretry</persRef> was wretchedly
							performed— Worse I think than I ever saw it at any theatre.</p>

						<p><date>5. VII:30. </date>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef

								Beasley</persRef>, London dated 31 March, with the account of news
							from America, and the information that <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"

								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Captains Rodgers</persRef>, <persRef ref="hull-isaac"

							Commissioners of a Navy-Board. I called upon <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> to enquire if he had received the English
							Newspapers, but he had not. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford told
							me that he had seen the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de
								Vicence</persRef>, and finding that there was nothing to be done
							upon the subject of indemnities, he had determined to return to America
							immediately— He said the Duke de Vicence told him that before the other
							foreign Ministers went away he had seen almost all of them, and he had
							sent to them all a declaration to take away all pretence of a doubt with
							regard to the pacific intentions of the emperor— He said also that the
							Correspondence and Records in the department of foreign affairs since
							the return of the Bourbons showed that there had been a long
							deliberation and hesitation in the Royal Council, whether France should
							not declare War against the United States, and make common Cause with
							Great-Britain— And when it was finally determined to declare a
							neutrality, the Instructions to the commanding Officers in all the Ports
							were to comply with every thing to gratify the English— While I was with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, <persRef
								ref="turreau-louis">General Turreau</persRef> came in— He was in
							full Uniform, and complained again of being totally ruined; but said he
							was better since the late Events, and should perhaps be again employed
							by the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor</persRef>— He said he
							had published a Book, or rather a pamphlet concerning the United States—
							That he censured, not the American Nation, but their Institutions; and
							as he expected soon to publish a second Edition, referring to the Events
							since he left America, and particularly to those of the late War with
							England, he should speak with eulogium upon the conduct of the Americans
							in the War, and particularly by sea— He wished to ask M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, for any authentic information he
							could furnish him with on the subject, especially of the last campaign,
							and the affair at <pb n="242" type="ms"/>New-Orleans— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford promised him <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> Reports— I left
							them and called upon <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bayard</persRef>, whom I found much better than when I
							saw him last Saturday— He considers himself and his physicians and
							Surgeons now consider him out of all danger; but he said he had had a
							very narrow escape with his life— I showed him Beasley’s Letter— He said
							he did not suppose the Government would consider him under an obligation
							to accept his appointment, and most assuredly he should not go to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg. His health would not admit of
							it— He should if possible undertake the Journey to Brest in ten or
							fifteen days; and return to the United States in the Neptune. On
							returning from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s, I went with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to the annual public Meeting of the second Class
							of the Institute, or French Academy— <persRef ref="destutt-antoine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Tracy</persRef> had furnished us
							with two tickets— The meeting was opened at three O’Clock, and was
							presided by the <persRef ref="sicard-roch">Abbé Sicard</persRef>— A
							Report was read by <persRef ref="francois-nicolas">Count Francois de
								Neufchateau</persRef> concerning the prizes which the academy had
							granted—to two poems on the last moments of the <persRef
								ref="bayard-pierre">Chevalier Bayardi</persRef> one was by <persRef
								ref="soumet-alexandre">Alexandre Soumet</persRef>, and the other by
								<persRef ref="dufresnoy-adelaide">Madame Dufresnoy</persRef>—to a
							poem on the discovery of vaccination; by the same Alexandre Soumet—and
							to a Memoir upon the question why the Rhythm of the Greek and Latin
							Languages could not be applied to the French. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Soumet and the <persRef ref="scoppa-antonio">Abbé
								Scoppa</persRef> received the accolade fraternelle from the
							President— Madame Dufresnoy was not present, <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>but</hi> so that the same compliment was not paid to her— Extracts
							were also read from two or three of the poems on the subjects proposed
							by the Class, which had failed of obtaining the prize— It was observed
							that the first prize ever bestowed by the Academy was obtained by a
							woman— It was <persRef ref="descudery-madeleine">Mademoiselle de
								Scuderi</persRef>—in 1671. and that since that time no other
							instance of the same kind had occurred until the present— The best poem
							was that Soumet upon vaccination— The Meeting was closed about four
							O’Clock— We then went and walked in the garden of the Tuileries; there
							was a great crowd assembled under the Emperor’s windows, and he came and
							threw open one of the windows, and shewed himself to them— We had a full
							view of him— Evening at the Theatre de la Gaieté— Le Chien de Montargis,
							and La fille mal gardée, a ballet.— Les Maitresses filles had been
							performed before we got there.</p>

						<p><date>23. VII. </date>At ten this morning, <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi

							went to the Mass at the Chapel of the Tuileries— The tickets were marked
							for half past ten, but we were obliged to walk in the Garden near half

							longer before the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor</persRef>
							came in— The Mass then began, and lasted less than half an hour— The
							music was excellent— The Opera-Singers <persRef ref="lays-francois"
								>Laÿs</persRef>, <persRef ref="nourrit-louis">Nourrit</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">Madame Albert</persRef> assisted in the performance
							of the Service— The lower part of the chapel, where we were, was full of
							company— The Ladies only were seated, on benches— I had a full and
							steady view of the Emperor’s countenance. We met there an American whom
							I had not seen before, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carter</persRef>, of Virginia— After the mass the Emperor reviewed
							his guards— We did not see him. We went to the <persRef
								ref="destutt-antoine">Count de Tracy’s</persRef> to pay visits to
								<persRef ref="destutt-emilie">his Lady</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">Madame de L’Aubépin</persRef> his daughter— Madame de Tracy
							was not at home. We saw Madame de l’Aubépin, <persRef ref="u">her
								husband</persRef> and the Count de Tracy.— He told me <persRef
								ref="destutt-victor">his son</persRef> was gone with a General upon
							a mission to the frontiers; but would return in the course of a week— I
							called also at <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> house, and saw
							him— He was packing up for his departure, and said he should leave Paris
							next Wednesday— <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bayard</persRef> was riding out— On returning home I

						<p><date>24. VI:30. </date>At home all the Morning, writing to <persRef

							at Paris to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

							the Consul presided, and under him <persRef ref="appleton-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Appleton</persRef>, the Consul at
							Leghorn— The guests invited were, besides M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="lafayette-george">his Son</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving</persRef>,

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s</persRef> son <persRef
								ref="russell-george">George</persRef> and myself— Two thirds of the
							company at least were unknown to me— The dinner was good; and we sat
							drinking Toasts, until between ten and eleven at Night. I came away
							leaving M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and most of the company
							there— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving had left the table
							immediately after dinner, and before the toasts began.— General La
							Fayette told me that he had come to Paris at the request of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-joseph">Joseph Bonaparte</persRef>; who had consulted
							him on the subject of the proposed supplementary Constitution, which was
							yesterday published in the Moniteur— He says it is very unpopular here;
							and he thinks the hereditary peerage particularly objectionable— He is
							also of opinion that they should have begun anew, without any reference
							to the former Constitutions; and that previously to presenting the
							present project to the acceptance of the People it should have been
							submitted to the discussion of an assembly of at least two members from
							each department of the Country. He <pb n="246" type="ms"/>renewed the
							invitation to me to come with my family and spend some days with him at
							his Country Seat, La grange— I promised him to go out next Tuesday. Our
							young calculator <persRef ref="colburn-zerah">Zerah Colburn</persRef>,
							was at this dinner with <persRef ref="colburn-abia">his
							father</persRef>— He spoke a short address to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford, and gave his toast with the assurance of a man
							full grown; but without offensive boldness— He endeavoured to prevail
							upon George Russell to do the same, but George though a lively and
							intelligent boy had not so much confidence in himself— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford was toasted in his presence, and
							the negotiators at Ghent in mine, according to an English custom, which
							I am sorry to see adopted by Americans. We did not however on our part
							adopt the custom by answering the toast with a speech.</p>

							Phantasmagorie of <persRef ref="robert-etienne">Robertson</persRef> on
							the Boulevards— It is a combination of experiments in natural
							philosophy, optical illusions, acoustic phenomena, and slight of hand—
							Many of them were new to me. The Shadows are not so terrific as might be
							expected— He has one machine in the figure of a man who blows the
							trumpet; and one in the form of a child who by mere mechanical operation
							utters articulate sounds—distinct words— The least amusing part of his

								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barsi</persRef>; superior to
							any thing I ever saw of the kind.— They kept us from half past seven,
							until eleven O’Clock— My cough still adheres to me.</p>
