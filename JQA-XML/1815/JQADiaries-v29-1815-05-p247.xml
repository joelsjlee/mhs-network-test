                            loaves— He says there is a tradition that it was built in in the time of

                            out by a painter in English taste and is beautifully picturesque. He has
                            surrounded the house with trees—Poplars—willows, pines, firs, locusts,
                            and the horse chesnut and oak at farther distance— One side of the wall
                            at the front entrance of the house is covered from the ground to the

                            essentially a pamphleteer— He writes with some ability, and it required
                            very little to refute the contemptible sophistry of the Abbe de
                            Montesquieu— But in his pamphlets as in his conduct, Benjamin Constant
                            shews continual indications of an unsettled head— He has the merit of
                            having been invariably a friend of liberty.</p>

                        <p><date>5. VI.</date> We breakfasted at Nine O’Clock— Two hours earlier
                            than the <persRef ref="lafayette">General’s</persRef> usual time— But it
                            was for the sake of enabling us to depart in seasonable time to arrive
                            before the Night at Paris— We took leave of the General and his family
                            just at ten; and returned by the same road that we had gone, excepting
                            that we joined the high-road without passing through the town of Rozoy.
                            We reached Brie at half-past two, and dined at La Grace de Dieu— When we
                            went down we had dined at the sign of L’Esperance— We changed the house
                            by the recommendations at the General’s, but the house which we first
                            went to was the best. At four we left Brie, and just at eight in the
                            Evening alighted at our lodgings. Hotel du Nord, Rue de Richelieu— The
                            weather was all day fair, with the exception of a light shower in the
                            afternoon— On my arrival home I found two Cards from <persRef

                            engaged my attention the remainder of the Evening. Our visit to La
                            Grange has been agreeable, although the weather was bad, and confined us
                            to the house almost the whole time we were there— The General himself is
                            always cheerful, and of pleasant conversation— And the family though
                            some of them in circumstances at present uneasy, are amiable and
                            attentive to their guests— The two Sons in Law, <persRef

                            state of affairs in France— War appears now to be certain, which the

                            thought and object of the inhabitants of Paris will be to save
                            themselves— They have no attachment either to the Bourbons or to
                            Napoleon; they will submit quietly to the victorious party, and will do
                            nothing in support of either— If the same Spirit should prevail
                            throughout France, Napoleon will be soon overthrown— As I walked to the
                            Tuileries and through the Palais-Royal before dinner I saw a multitude
                            of pamphlets against the projected supplement to the Constitution. The

                        <p><date>11. VI:30.</date> All the morning we were engaged in making
                            preparations for our departure— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Petry</persRef> called upon us with news, which proved
                            to be only a groundless rumour. The <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
                                >Duc de Vicence</persRef> called immediately afterwards, and told me
                            that the firing of the Cannon, had been for a visit which the <persRef
                                ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor</persRef> was making to the
                            hospital of Invalids.— He mentioned to me many circumstances relating to
                            the state of public affairs at this time, and said that they were
                            perfectly informed of all the proceedings of the Congress until after
                            the Emperor arrived in Paris.— That six dispatches from <persRef
                                ref="tallyrand-charles">Talleyrand</persRef> to the Ministry of
                                <persRef ref="louis-xviii">Louis 18</persRef> had been received by
                            him the Duke de Vicence since he came to the Department of foreign
                            affairs— They had the whole history, of the Declaration of 13. March,
                            and knew by whom it was written— That Talleyrand obtained the signatures
                            to it— That it was signed first by <persRef ref="metternick-klemons"
                                >Prince Metternich</persRef>, who was un homme très leger; and who
                            scarcely took the trouble of reading it, and never thought of reflecting
                            a moment upon its meaning— The <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
                                Wellington</persRef> signed it in the same manner— The rest signed
                            upon trust— The Duke said it was amusing to be told that Lord Wellington
                            had been highly indignant at learning that he was charged as an
                            instigator of assassination for having signed that declaration— The
                            truth was he had signed it, without knowing what it meant—impelled by a
                            moment of passion— It was a declaration signalizing one individual as a
                            wolf, not entitled to any of the privileges of a human being.— They
                            thought that by using high-sounding and bitter words they alone would
                            suffice to destroy him— At the same time they thought his undertaking so
                            weak and insignificant, that they actually wrote here that two brigades
                            of Gensdarmes would be more than enough to put him down— I told the Duke
                            that I had seen a remark in the Edinburg Review, that if the mere facts
                            of the Emperor’s landing and resumption of the Government of France were
                            put into a Romance, they would be rejected as too improbable for a
                            narrative of fiction— He said it was true, but he could assure me there
                            had been no previous concert between the Emperor and any person here—
                            Not a human being in France knew that he was coming— The Duke saw by a
                            smile on my countenance that I was not altogether credulous of this
                            fact, and said—eh bien!—remember what I now say to you— Depend upon it
                            the fact will ultimately be known and proved— I repeat that there was
                            not a human being in France, who knew of the Emperor’s design, before he
                            landed— I told him what was said in the Edinburg Review of a watch word
                            of La Violette and elle reviendra au printems— He said there was nothing
                            in it. That Le Pere la Violette was a name the Soldiers had given the
                            Emperor among themselves, as they had formerly called him le petit
                            Caporal.— But there was nothing of plot or conspiracy in it— As for
                            himself when he first heard that the Emperor had landed, he did not
                            believe it. He had been a whole day disbelieving it, until it was
                            ascertained to him by a general who had received it directly from
                                <persRef ref="maison-nicolas">General Maison</persRef>. The Emperor
                            knew, however, the universal discontent, and disgust at the Government
                            of the Bourbons in France— He received the newspapers; but during the
                            whole time that he had been at the Island of Elba, only two persons had
                            been from France to see him. But the Bourbons were so odious that if the
                            Emperor had not come, there would nevertheless have been within two
                            Months a Revolution against them— They knew it very well— All the
                            Correspondence from the interior, as well as that to and from Vienna,
                            which had fallen into the hands of the present government, shewed that
                            Louis 18. himself saw the impossibility of getting along.— The Duke told
                            me that if this change had not taken place he should himself have gone
                            to America— He had made all his arrangements for going this Spring. He
                            could not have lived in France— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
                                of Russia</persRef> had kindly given him an invitation to Russia,
                            but he had not chosen to accept it, and had formed the settled
                            determination to go to America— He said also that the Emperor of Russia
                            had spoken to him here at Paris, with great disapprobation of the
                            Bourbons and their proceedings—and said they risked every thing as <pb
                                n="251" type="ms"/>they were going on— He further said that since he
                            had been in the Department they had received three dispatches from the
                                <persRef ref="denoailles-antonin">Count de Noailles</persRef>, the

                            That the Count complained that he found himself embarrassed in Society
                            because he heard opinions expressed very freely against the war— When
                            the Duke left me he said he should send me a despatch to be forwarded to
                                <persRef ref="serurier-louis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            general satisfaction in America— We had also a visit from <persRef

                            the Evening we paid a visit at the <persRef ref="destutt-antoine">Count
                                de Tracy’s</persRef> to take leave— The Count himself was abroad— We
                            saw <persRef ref="destutt-emilie">Madame de Tracy</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and Madame de

                                >General La Fayette</persRef> was elected a member of the
                            Representative Assembly— And had been President of the electoral college
                            at Melun. That the General would be in Paris next Saturday to dine— I
                            had determined to leave Paris at 4 O’Clock afternoon, on Saturday.— But
                            having a strong wish to see the General, before I go, I now concluded to
                            postpone our departure until the next Morning. The Ladies and M<hi

                            the manner of living in America. This family too has had, and perhaps
                            may have again the project of removing to America— After our visit we
                            finished our Evening by a walk upon the Boulevards.</p>

                            <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">We</persRef> were engaged all the
                            morning again, in packing trunks to send away by the diligence to Havre—
                            It was almost four in the afternoon, before I could go out of the house—
                            We dispatched nine Trunks and boxes, by the Diligence which went this
                            afternoon— I called and took leave of the <persRef
                                ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de Vicence</persRef>, whom I found
                            dressed, ready to go with his Porte-feuille, à l’Elysée— My visit was
                            accordingly very short, in which however we had some further interesting
                            conversation.— He said that he had asked <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Petry</persRef> to call upon me with

                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Serrurier</persRef>— That Petry had
                            been long in America, and wished to return there again— He was a very
                            good man, and he, the Duke should do for him what he could— I asked him
                            if there was any foundation in the rumour that the <persRef
                                ref="joachim-i">king of Naples</persRef> (Murat) had beaten the
                            Austrians— He said there was no authentic account of it— But many
                            private letters mentioned it with confidence— The <persRef
                                ref="fouche-joseph">Minister of the Police</persRef> had received
                            one yesterday, and he himself had one this Morning— I observed that the
                            public funds had risen here considerably within these few days— That
                            there must be some foundation for it in circumstances not generally
                            known— He said there had been some symptoms of hesitation in Austria to
                            join in the latest projected measures of the allies— That there had been
                            since the Treaty of 25 March a further declaration, proposed and
                            actually signed by three persons— He had the declaration itself— Austria
                            had, it seemed, declined signing it— There was also understood to be
                            some discordance in the English Cabinet— <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert"
                                >Lord Liverpool</persRef> was understood to be inclined to continue

                            was ardent for War— I asked if he was certain of this— He said he had
                            reason to believe it. He knew at least that Lord Liverpool had been so
                            earnest for the Peace with America that he had tendered his resignation
                            to the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, if it was not
                            made— Lord Castlereagh was for continuing the War— I said that we knew
                            perfectly well what were Lord Castlereagh’s dispositions when he passed
                            through Ghent on his way to Vienna— But we had heard, that from Vienna,
                            he had written home, advising that they should conclude with us.— He
                            said that was true— It was in consequence of the discussions with
                            Russia, and with Prussia, respecting Poland, and Saxony. Lord
                            Castlereagh was then much at variance with the <persRef
                                ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, and did write to
                            advise the Peace with America— All this was fully disclosed in the

                            America, with him and wants to go to Ghent for that purpose— I hinted to

                            the vessel was sailing. It is therefore unnecessary for me to

                            with him at Berlin. <pb n="252" type="ms"/>He left London, the third of

                            the state of things here. He thinks that <persRef

                            for the allies, and that the war against him is unwise— I had an hour’s
                            conversation with him, and he appears to consider the situation of the
                            Emperor in its most favourable light. He mentioned the forged Letters

                            Garden of the Tuileries, through which we walked, and the Place du

                            of the Antique Statues and Marbles on the ground floor— We came home and
                            dined; after which we rode out to the heights of Montmartre where the
                            entrenchments for the defence of Paris are now carrying on— As we

                            gone out.— The General promised he would call at my lodgings, and see
                            me, to-morrow Evening at seven O’Clock. He said he was glad of having
                            been elected a member of the Assembly of Representatives; because it
                            gave him a reason for declining to be one of the Peers, as had been
                            proposed to him— I said that if the War should take place as appeared
                            inevitable, I intreated him to use his influence to prevent the
                            repetition of such outrageous acts as the decrees of Berlin, &amp; of
                            Milan—for if such measures should be resorted to I really believed they
                            would produce a War, between the United States &amp; France— He promised
                            me to use his best endeavours to promote a just and liberal policy
                            towards America and said he would correspond with me through the channel

                                >Charles</persRef> and saw the Mint, and the Monnoie des Médailles—
                            There was scarcely any thing doing there, and the whole establishment is
                            inferior to that of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg. There is
                            one steam engine, much out of order. The only place where they were at
                            work was one apartment, where they were striking five frank pieces— The
                            cabinet of minerals I had not time to see— The Medals are in another
                            house, and are the same that I had seen at Ghent. I called at the Hotel

                            at a shop in the Palais Royal.— On returning home I found that <persRef

                                Fayette</persRef> came in the Evening; and I renewed the request to
                            him to use his influence, if the war should break out, to maintain a
                            system of moderation towards the United States; even if a different
                            example should be shewn by Great-Britain.— He said that he had seen
                                <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">Joseph</persRef> this Morning, and
                            he had again urged upon him to consent to be one of the new House of
                            Peers— He had answered, that having been elected one of the members of
                            the Representative chamber, he was under an obligation at least to begin
                            by taking his seat there— Afterwards he might with more propriety see
                            what was to be done— <persRef ref="bonaparte-lucien">Lucian</persRef>
                            had also sent him a flattering message by <persRef
                                ref="humboldt-alexander">Humboldt</persRef>— Joseph had asked him
                            why he had not been to visit the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
                                >Emperor</persRef>; and had complained of the conduct of certain
                            Senators, in voting the décheance— He had answered that as a member of
                            the Assembly there would naturally be relations between the Emperor and
                            him, which would make a visit suitable— That as to the déchéance, he
                            should not disguise that if he had been a Senator, he should have voted
                            for it himself— The Emperor had made of the Senate Conservateur, a
                            Senate Destructeur; and after having to please him destroyed every thing
                            else, it was no wonder they should have finished by destroying him— It
                            was now said he came with an <pb n="253" type="ms"/>entirely different
                            system, and that he was to govern upon liberal and patriotic principles;
                            which was very well— The General added that he thought it best to keep
                            upon the reserve, because he thought he saw a wish to entangle him in
                            connection with them, before the meeting of the Assembly— He said that
                            as the most important object was to prevent the enemy from giving the
                            Law to France, he should be for furnishing the Government, perhaps
                            without acknowledging Napoleon as Emperor, with the means of carrying on
                            the War successfully, and then to form the Assembly into a constituent
                            Assembly, and make a new Constitution— He thought Napoleon’s great
                            object would be to obtain those means, and then to go immediately and
                            fight a Battle— He said Joseph had told him there were some pacific
                            overtures from Austria; which amounted only to this, that if he would
                            sanction not only the Treaty of Paris, but the measures of the Congress
                            at Vienna, concerning Poland, Saxony and Italy, <persRef
                                ref="marialouisa2">his wife</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="bonaparte-napoleon2">child</persRef> should be restored to him—
                            Joseph said this proposal would not be accepted, for it was itself
                            shameful to put such an act upon such a Condition, and even if it should
                            be accepted Austria would probably break the bargain, and still keep the
                            wife and child— On the whole I see that La Fayette is fluctuating in his
                            own mind— He asked me if I should see the <persRef ref="louis-philippe"
                                >Duke of Orleans</persRef> in England— I did not know— He asked me,
                            what I thought the allies would do, if any thing should happen to
                            Napoleon—for instance if he should be killed in Battle—whether they
                            would force the Bourbons upon France— I thought they would leave France
                            as free as they had last Spring— He wants Napoleon, as a military
                            Commander, to defend the Country, and yet fears the consequences of his
                            success— He thinks much of the Duke of Orleans— Much of a Republic— And
                            he would be glad to have a last resort even if <persRef
                                ref="louis-xviii">Louis 18</persRef> should come back. At bottom
                            there is an ardent love of his Country, and a sincere desire that it
                            should be governed by a free and liberal Constitution; but with regard
                            to the means he has nothing settled, and waits for Events— Especially
                            for the meeting of the Assembly. He asked me to tell them in England
                            that they were acting against their own views, by commencing this War—
                            Another person said to me, that if Napoleon should not throw himself
                            into the arms of the People; j’espere qu’au Mois prochain on le fera
                            sauter— La Fayette has no positive design of this kind— He is balancing,
                            and I fear that his scale will not preponderate at the lucky moment. He
                            renewed the promise of corresponding with me; and asked me to take some
                            Letters from him for America.</p>

                        <p><date>16. V.</date> Began the day by bringing up the arrears of my
                            Journal, at which it is generally inconvenient to write, in traveling.
                            The remainder of the morning was occupied with the last preparations for
                            departure. <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Erving</persRef> and <persRef ref="lafayette">General La
                                Fayette</persRef> came and took leave of us, and <persRef

                            saw us into the Carriage— I went to <persRef ref="hottinguer-jean">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Hottinguer’s</persRef> and settled my
                            accounts with him taking a small bill upon Havre and one upon London—
                                <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">We</persRef> received a
                            multitude of Letters and packages from several persons to be carried to
                            England. With our large quantity of baggage they encumber us not a
                            little. We had ordered the horses at 3. O’Clock in the afternoon— They
                            came at half past three, and at twenty minutes past four, we left the
                            Hotel du Nord, Rue de Richelieu N. 97. where I have passed upwards three
                            months, of leisure, too unprofitably for any useful purpose, but as
                            agreeably as any part of my life. We travelled three stages, and arrived
                            at Pontoise between 7 and 8. We stopped to lodge at the Hotel du Juste,
                            and ordered horses for three O’Clock to-morrow Morning.— My object in
                            coming thus far this day was to have an easy day’s ride to reach Rouen
                            to-morrow. But we find the roads so good, and the days are now so long,
                            that we might easily have gone two Stages farther this Evening, and have
                            reached Havre itself to-morrow Night— The Country is in its early
                            verdure, and the orchards are all in full blossom— We had green pease
                            this day for the first time at dinner, and within these two days have
                            seen small bunches of cherries for sale in the Streets.</p>

                        <p><date>17. III.</date> But it was half past four when our Post-horses
                            came— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">We</persRef> travelled with
                            excellent roads, and reached Rouen at half past One O’Clock in the
                            afternoon. The distance is 11 1/2 Posts— The face of the Country very
                            much like that between Paris and Pontoise. Covered with Orchards, all in
                            full blossom— There are some fields of grain, and some of pasturage;
                            here and there a flock of sheep; but the grounds are much inferior in
                            fertility to those of Flanders, and approaching towards Rouen, the
                            Country becomes mountainous. The City of Rouen is in a deep valley,
                            between two steep and lofty hills. The Seine is not wider than at Paris.
                            The Streets are all so narrow that it is scarcely possible for two
                            Carriages to pass each other in many of them— We stopped to dine at the
                            Hotel de Vatel, Rue des Carmes, and were detained there three hours;
                            waiting more than half the time for horses— We heard frequent cries of
                            Vive l’Empereur as we left Paris, and until Pontoise— But this day very
                            few, and confined entirely to small children.— We came from Rouen two
                            Stages to Yvetot, and stopped there to lodge— Thought it was between
                            seven and eight, and scarcely Sunset when we arrived there. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams was much overcome with fatigue— We
                            have been several times obliged to repair our wheels, and they are yet
                            in so crazy a state, that I do not incline to travel with them in the
                            Night.</p>

                                >we</persRef> proceeded immediately from Yvetot. We had 6 1/4 Posts
                            to Havre, where we arrived at 11 in the Morning. We might easily have
                            arrived here last Evening, by coming two Stages further the day we left
                            Paris, and not stopping at Rouen to dine— But the gates of Havre are
                            shut at ten, in the Evening; after which no person is admitted into the
                            City in the Night— We stopped at the Hotel des Armes de la Ville du <pb

                            got settled in our chambers, I went to find out the residence of Mess<hi

                            here bound to England— There was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            looking out for a passage— We all went to the English Hotel and Coffee
                            house, frequented by the Masters of the Packets, and were told that a
                            Packet was expected to-morrow unless the Communication should have been
                            stopped, as was generally expected in England. There was a Portsmouth
                            Newspaper of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> in which was an
                            Article from London stating that the Declaration of War against France
                            was to appear in the next Tuesday’s Gazette— The Packets which used to
                            pass regularly between Southampton and this place have ceased coming for
                            several weeks— I had thus the prospect of being obliged to go to Dieppe
                            for a passage, and the uncertainty whether we can obtain one even there—
                            I went to the house of <persRef ref="hottinguer-jean">M<hi

                            which was to sail again for London next Monday.— To-morrow Morning I
                            shall have further information concerning these opportunities— There was

                            went to see her at the wharf; but it was impossible to think of going in

                        <p>The general reckoning in traveling with Post Horses throughout France is
                            that you must allow one Post for an hour, At this Season of the year,
                            the roads being at the best, the days at the longest, and the weather at
                            the most moderate you may by extraordinary diligence travel 5 Post in 4
                            hours; or at the rate of one Post and a quarter by the hour— They are
                            from ten to fifteen minutes in changing horses at each Stage— If you go
                            however to an Inn, and order horses at a particular hour you have to
                            wait an hour longer before they come— We were detained three hours at
                            Rouen, merely by stopping to dine— The Stages are all very short— A Post
                            is two leagues; but the leagues are of 25 to a degree, and where the
                            roads are mountainous they make allowance for it upon the distance— I
                            think Paris and Havre as far from each other as New-York and
                            Philadelphia; and not more. They travel much more at present by the
                            Diligences and public Stages, than with Post-horses. On the whole road
                            we did not meet a single carriage traveling Post— We met at least twenty
                            Stages— <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Todd</persRef> came from Paris, himself in one Carriage, and sent
                            his baggage in another— He arrived before the Neptune sailed: but his
                            baggage did not. He was obliged therefore to wait, and went over in a
                            packet which sailed the same day, to Southampton.</p>

                            with damp sheets— The Captain of the French sloop recommended to me by

                            his vessel— The tide was out, and she lay aground so that I could not go
                            on board. The vessel is very small; carrying only 32 tons, and the
                            Captain offered to take us, with all our <pb n="255" type="ms"/>baggage,
                            and our Carriage, for 25 louis. I was to go again at 4 in the afternoon
                            when the tide would be high, and look at the Cabin— I went to the
                            Lieutenant Extraordinaire de Police, and received back from him my
                            Passport which had been taken at the gate— He told me there was no
                            esprit public here; and that if all the Departments of France were like
                            this, tout serait bientot fini. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            board the Danish vessel bound to London— It is a ship of between two and
                            three hundred tons, and is to sail next Monday— The Captain was not on
                            board; but the Mate took my name and address, to give to the Captain,
                            with the request that he would call upon me— Afterwards came the Captain
                            of the other vessel, the Sloop, Confiance, requesting me to decide
                            immediately whether I would go with him or not; as he had now an offer,
                            for taking freight to Rouen. I told him that I could not determine
                            immediately; and would not deprive him of the opportunity of taking his
                            freight to Rouen— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourlet also paid me a

                            Consignee of the vessel— The friend intimated to us, that he believed
                            the Captain could not spare either of his state-rooms; upon which with
                            some vivacity, I expressed the determination to look out elsewhere for a
                            passage. They at last promised that the Captain should call upon me at
                            eight to-morrow Morning.</p>

                            reluctance to resign his state-room. He asked me 200 francs for the
                            passage of each person of my family, and 25 louis for my baggage. He
                            finally consented to take two pounds Sterling per Ton, for my baggage,
                            and I offered him 600 franks for a passage for my family— We came to no

                            enquiries for an opportunity to go to England— The Captain of the French
                            Sloop whom I had seen yesterday sent again to propose taking us, and
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green brought another French Captain
                            who had a Sloop at Honfleur, and was also willing to go with us.— I went
                            again to the London Tavern and Coffee-House, and enquired if the Flying
                            Fish, <persRef ref="nugentgrenville-george">Lord Nugent’s</persRef>
                            Yacht which was to have arrived yesterday, was yet here— They told me
                            that the price for a passage in her was six guineas for each person; and
                            no discrimination made for Servants or children— In the regular packets
                            the price is two guineas for each person— After dinner I walked out with
                                <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            the City; from which we saw the City, the neighbouring Country, the
                            River and the Sea— The Prospect is beautiful— After returning I walked
                            again upon the Quay, and saw a vessel under the Danish flag come in,
                            from Charleston, South Carolina— I met on the Quay an Englishman named
                                <persRef ref="campbell-john4">Kemble</persRef>, who told me he had
                            just arrived with a galliot; under the Russian flag, from London. She
                            was in the Roads, and he had permission to unlade her to-morrow— She
                            would return as soon as possible; perhaps on Monday; and if I did not
                            conclude my bargain with the Danish Captain, he would readily give me
                            passage, and land me and my family any where upon the Coast, where I
                            should please. At the same time he said he wished not to interfere in
                            the bargain with the Danish Captain whom he knew, and who was a good
                            man— I am to see him again to-morrow Morning.</p>

                                Campbell</persRef> came this Morning, and renewed the proposal to me
                            to take passage in his vessel— After breakfast I went on board the
                            vessel, which is lying at the wharf— The Olga, <persRef ref="u">Captain
                                Köning</persRef> of Riga— I agreed to take passage in her for thirty

                            to make some arrangements for embarking our baggage— M<hi

                            by a fall in the Street by which he was severely bruised— Returning home
                            I found the Danish Captain on the wharf near his ship, and told him I
                            had procured a passage in another vessel. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Campbell came again afterwards, and said the Danish Captain was much
                            offended at having lost us as passengers. He had been to my lodgings
                            while I was out, and had told <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> that he would not
                            take less than 150 franks for each person as passenger. After dinner I
                            walked out on the quay with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams— The
                            weather has been the whole day very boisterous. In the Evening we went
                            to a Séance Académique or Concert given by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Moldetti</persRef> an Italian who
                            lodges at the same house with us— He was the only singer, accompanied by
                            the Amateurs and Artists of the City—twelve or fourteen persons— The
                            company was very small. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Moldetti sung
                            several Duos of two voices, and one quartetto, in four, the Tenor, Base,
                            Counter and Treble, from behind a screen, all so different from each
                            other that they might easily have been taken for the voices of four
                            different persons— He also imitated the guittar, in great perfection,
                            though in a ludicrous manner— The concert finished between ten and
                            eleven O’Clock. I sent this day to a wine merchant recommended to me by
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, for a sample of Champagne
                            wine, and determined to take a stock of that and other French wines,

                            the whole day—and we had until Evening the expectation of sailing this
                            Night. I made a purchase of a small assortment of wines— The vessel had
                            not unladen, till five in the afternoon, and was then two hours taking
                            in ballast. The Custom house Officers made some difficulty about
                            embarking the wines, after Sunset, until I produced my Passport from the
                                <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de Vicence</persRef>, with

                            under martial Law, and this afternoon about thirty soldiers marched into
                            it; which has highly exasperated the inhabitants— We are now notified to
                            be ready to go on board the vessel at ten O’Clock to-morrow Morning.</p>

                            allowed after the vessel was from the wharf to land any person from it,
                            without subjecting us to the necessity of a new clearance— After we were
                            clear of the harbour, we lay to nearly two hours to wait for the return
                            of the persons he had sent to recover his effects, but they had
                            disappeared, and were not to be found. We came out of the Port with fine
                            weather, but a scanty wind, and almost a calm— But early in the Evening
                            the wind became fair for directing our course to Dover, and freshened to
                            so strong a breeze, that the vessel though a dull Sailor went for some
                            time nine knots an hour. My family were all very sick, and I was myself
                            more nearly being so than I had been for upwards of twenty years— Our

                                Campbell</persRef> came into the Cabin just before four O’Clock this
                            morning, and told me that Dover Castle was in sight.— I had slept two or
                            three hours, and lost the symptoms of approaching Sea-sickness— The
                            Night was fine, and the swell, and wind had partly subsided— The motion
                            of the vessel had been the more considerable, because she had not been
                            sufficiently ballasted, and was too light— On going upon deck I saw very
                            distinctly both the shores of France and England, and through the glass
                            plainly discerned Dover Castle— The wind shortly after abated and a fog
                            arose, which for some time intercepted the view of the Land on both
                            sides— About six we were boarded by an officer from an English Gun-Brig,
                            and at seven, a Dover Pilot came on board— The <persRef ref="u"
                                >Captain</persRef> went with his papers on shore in this boat, and
                            we agreed with the Pilot that his men should come out with a larger
                            boat, when we should be opposite to Dover Pier, to take us on shore with
                            our baggage for half a guinea a person— The wind soon freshened again
                            and the tide turned and drifted us so rapidly down, that we were obliged
                            to lay to, the Pilot’s large boat still delaying to come out— The
                            Custom-House it appears is open only at ten, and nothing could be done
                            until the Officers were there.— The tide had already drifted us below
                            the pier when the boat came out.— I left <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
                                >Antoine</persRef> on board the vessel to take care of our effects
                            and go to London with them; the rest of us with the baggage
                            indispensible for immediate use landed in the boat. The wind was so
                            strong and the surf so high, that we suffered some washing before we
                            reached the canal within the pier— We landed at the Stairs just at 12
                            O’Clock having had a passage of 24 hours from Havre. Immediately on
                            landing we were all required to go to the Custom-house; which <persRef

                            submitted to the examination of my trunks— The Collector was not there.
                            The Clerks told me they had received no order for the admission of my
                            baggage— That the examination would be only a formality; but that there
                            had been only one instance of exemption from it, which was last year for
                            the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, and the

                            it was very probable they would find nothing in my trunks liable to be
                            taken— I told them it was very probable they would find such Articles
                            and must use them at their pleasure— They examined the trunks, and found
                            or chose to find nothing to take— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            accordingly went. They left Dover at 2 O’Clock P.M— M<hi

                        <p>The expence of traveling in this manner is about the same as in France—
                            There however I had the additional charge, and trouble of a Carriage. In
                            England the charge is the same, whether they furnish you Carriages or
                            only Horses—one shilling and six pence a mile for a Post Chaise and
                            pair, and the same for the horses alone. From three to four Shillings to
                            each driver, a shilling to the hostler, and between 2 and 4 Shillings
                            for Turnpikes are paid at each Stage. The expences of traveling by Post
                            have exactly doubled since I first knew them in 1778. and in England
                            they have also doubled since I first knew them in 1783. The expences at
                            Inns upon the road, and almost all others in England are nearly double
                            what they are in France— The face of the Country from Dover to London
                            was quite familiar to me— I had travelled the whole way twice, and the
                            greater part of it, many times. Although eighteen years have elapsed
                            since I was last in England, its outward appearance remains much the
                            same, and the ride from Dover to London is one of those which present
                            the Country in its most favourable light.— We met on the road a regiment
                            of soldiers marching to Dover, to embark for Flanders; many beggars, and
                            families of apparent paupers wandering about the Country without shed or
                            shelter— The Cities have all the show of prosperity, but with an
                            extraordinary proportion of Cards upon the houses advertising them for
                            sale. We did not stop on the road to dine, but took at Dartford, each a
                            Sandwich and a glass of ale.— When we alighted at the Inn, there for
                            that purpose, a man came in to the chamber where we were, stating
                            himself to be a revenue Officer, charged to detect the smuggling of
                            silks and laces, and observing that there was a Portmanteau Trunk in the
                            Chaise in which I had arrived— I told him I had come to this Country in
                            the character of a public Minister, and therefore not subject to the
                            operation of the revenue Laws— He said he could not know that— I replied
                            that I would shew it to him, and took from my pocket <persRef
                                ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef> Passport.— He
                            did not look at it, but made an awkward apology for having intruded upon
                            me, and withdrew in some confusion— We stopp’d at the Green-Man,
                            Blackheath at the six Mile Stone, and found there <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            our lodgings in London. We found our dear sons whom we had not seen for
                            nearly six years— George grown almost out of our knowledge—John yet

                            Morning and had a long Conversation with me— He had a proposal from a
                            Lieutenant in the British Navy, who was desirous of resigning that
                            situation and entering into the service of the United States— He said
                            there were seven Post Captains known to him, who had the same wish, and
                            such a multitude of Officers of all the ranks below that, as would alone
                            supply the Officers for a considerable navy. I told M<hi

                            any naval Officer in the service of the United States— As they and
                            Great-Britain were at Peace, I saw no insuperable objection to the
                            admission of a British Officer duly discharged from the English service,
                            into that of the United States; but it might not be agreeable to the
                            Government of this Country, and it was my duty to avoid every thing
                            which might tend to give dissatisfaction to the British Government, in
                            my relations with it. I also stated in a forcible manner the
                            difficulties which a foreign officer must overcome, to obtain admission
                            into our service— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown then intimated to
                            me his own desire to go and settle in America himself which I did not
                            encourage, and finally he expressed an intention to publish a periodical
                            paper, relating principally to American affairs, and calculated to
                            spread more correct American information than now prevails. He asked me
                            if I would in that case favour him by the Communication of American
                            Papers.— I promised <pb n="259" type="ms"/>him that I would, if the
                            character of the publication should be such as he described, and contain
                            nothing which could justly give umbrage to the British Government. He
                            said that his principles were those of moderation, but he had been
                            displaced as Editor of the Naval Chronicle for some of his publications,
                            and had given offence by his earnestness against the forging of American
                            ship papers— He sent me a Letter written to him by <persRef
                                ref="perceval-spencer">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Perceval’s</persRef> orders on this subject, and the minutes of a
                            conversation which he had with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval
                            relating to it— He also told me that in the year 1807. <persRef

                            publish a Newspaper in support of the British Government, and to promote
                            its influence. I have given this person no encouragement; but he says
                            that the business of forging Ships papers is reviving, and that <persRef
                                ref="u">Van Sander</persRef> has now orders for papers for upwards

                            <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> had
                            appointed eleven O’Clock this morning, for me to see him at his house,
                            in S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> James’s Square— After waiting nearly
                            an hour beyond that time for my Carriage, I took a Hackney Coach and
                            went there— The <persRef ref="louis-philippe">Duke of Orleans</persRef>
                            was with him, and I waited about another half hour before he received
                            me. I gave him a copy of my Letter of Credence to the <persRef
                                ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, upon which he said that he
                            would take the Orders of His Royal Highness as to the time when he would
                            receive it. There was some general Conversation upon the subject of the
                            concerns mutually interesting to the two Nations. I assured him of the
                            disposition on the part of the American Government to perform with the
                            utmost fidelity all their engagements contracted in the late Treaty of
                            Peace, and to adopt every other measure calculated to consolidate the
                            friendship, and to promote the Harmony between the two Countries— As a
                            token of which An Act of Congress had passed previous to the close of
                            their late Session tendering on the part of the United States a
                            reciprocal abolition of all discriminating duties of Tonnage and upon
                            merchandize imported in our own or in British Vessels— I presumed he was
                            in possession of a copy of that act— He said he believed they were; but
                            he would thank me for a sight of it—and I promised to furnish him with a
                            copy. I mentioned also the Message of the <persRef ref="madison-james"
                                >President</persRef>, recommending the exclusion of foreign Seamen,
                            not already naturalized, from the naval and merchant service of the
                            United States—a measure which Congress owing to the shortness of time
                            had not acted upon, but which would probably be hereafter adopted.— He
                            said that what had been done by the Government of the United States in
                            this respect had given the greater satisfaction here, as an opinion,
                            probably erroneous, had heretofore prevailed that the American
                            Government encouraged and invited foreign Seamen— That as to the
                            principle he was afraid there was little prospect of a possibility of
                            coming to an agreement, as we adhered to the right of naturalization for
                            which we contended, and as no Government here could possibly abandon the
                            right to the allegiance of British Subjects— I said that I saw no better
                            prospect than he did of an agreement upon the principle— But it was not
                            the disposition of the American Government or Nation to apply the force
                            of arms to the maintenance of any abstract principle— The number of
                            British Seamen, naturalized in America was so small that it could be no
                            object of concern to this Government. If British subjects were excluded
                            for the future, there could be no motive for taking men from American
                            Vessels— If the practice totally ceased, we should never call upon the
                            British Government for any sacrifice of their principle— When the evil
                            ceased to be felt we should readily deem it to have ceased to exist— He
                            said that there would be every disposition to guard against the
                            possibility of abuse, and the Admiralty was now occupied in prescribing
                            regulations for the naval Officers which he hoped would prevent all
                            cause of complaint on the part of the United States. He then mentioned
                            the late unfortunate occurrence at Dartmoor Prison, and the measures
                            which had been taken by agreement between him and Mess<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
                            <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef>, on that occasion— I said I
                            had received a copy of the Report made by <persRef ref="king-charles"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="larpent-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Larpent</persRef>, after their examination into the transaction; and
                            of the written depositions which had been taken, as well on that
                            examination as previously at the Coroner’s Inquest— That after what had
                            been done, I considered the procedure as so far terminated that I was
                            not aware of any further step to be taken by me, until I should receive
                            the Instructions of my Government on the case; the Evidence was so
                            voluminous, and I had so lately received it, that I had not yet entirely
                            read it through; but from the general impression upon my mind made by
                            what I had read, I regretted that a regular trial of <persRef
                                ref="shortland-t">Captain Shortland</persRef> had not been ordered,
                            and I thought it probable that such would be the opinion of my
                            Government. He said that undoubtedly there were cases in which a trial
                            was the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> remedy that could be resorted to;
                            but there were others in which it was the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi>—
                            That a trial the result of which should be an acquittal, would place the
                            whole affair in a more unpleasant situation than it would be without it—
                            That the evidence was extremely contradictory— That it had been found
                            impossible to trace to any individual the most unjustifiable part of the
                            firing, and that Captain Shortland denied having given the order to
                            fire— I admitted that the Evidence was contradictory; but said that from
                            the impression of the whole mass of it upon me, I could not doubt,
                            either that Captain Shortland gave the order to fire, or that under the
                            Circumstances of the case, it was unnecessary. It was true, the result
                            of a <pb n="260" type="ms"/>trial might be an acquittal, but as it was
                            the regular remedy for a case of this description, the substitution of
                            any other was susceptible of strong objections, and left the officer
                            apparently justified, when I could not but think them altogether
                            unjustifiable. I then mentioned the earnest desire of the American
                            Government for the full execution of the Stipulations in the Treaty of
                            Ghent and that my Instructions had expressed the hope of an appointment
                            as soon as possible of the Commissioners on the part of this Country,
                            for proceeding to the settlement of the boundary line— Lord Castlereagh
                            asked what would be the most convenient Season of the year for
                            transacting the business— I said I believed it might be done at any
                            Season— But as the line would be in a high Northern Latitude, the Summer
                            Season would probably be most for the personal convenience of the
                            Commissioners. He said the appointments would be made with reference to
                            that Consideration— I then observed that the British Admiral stationed
                            in the Chesapeak had declined resorting Slaves that he had taken, under
                            a Construction of the first Article of the Treaty which my Government
                            considered erroneous, and which I presumed this Government would
                            likewise so consider. That a reference to the original draft of the
                            British Projet, and to an alteration proposed by us and assented to by
                            the British Commissioners would immediately shew the incorrectness of
                            this Construction— He said it would be best to refer this matter to the
                            Gentlemen who were authorized to confer with us on the subject of a
                            Treaty of Commerce.— He asked if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
                            and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had communicated to me, what had
                            passed between them and this Government, on this head— I said they had—
                            He asked if I was joined to them in that business— I said I was, but
                            that it was altogether distinct from my Mission to this Court— He said
                            the same persons had been appointed to treat with us, who had concluded
                            with us the Treaty of Ghent, and <persRef ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson</persRef> the Vice-President
                            of the Board of <unclear>Trade</unclear> had been added to them— They had already had
                            some conferences with Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Clay and
                            Gallatin, and their Powers were now made out and ready for them to
                            proceed in the Negotiation— I asked Lord Castlereagh if he could mention
                            to me the time when the Prince Regent would receive my Credential
                            Letter— He said if I was desirous of presenting it, at an early day the
                            Prince would receive me at a private Audience— Otherwise it would be at
                            the first Levee day.— I said that would suit me perfectly well, and I
                            would not wish to give his Royal Highness that trouble of assigning a
                            particular day for a private audience. He then asked me if I had not
                            come last from France; and what there was there of New— I told him they
                            were assembling there, all the force that they could collect, and it
                            would be a very considerable force— He said that was to be expected— He
                            asked if I had seen any of the fortifications erecting at Paris— I said
                            I had seen what was doing at Montmartre; and thought very little of it—
                            The object I believed was rather to employ workmen, than to defend the
                            City— He said it was ridiculous to pretend defending the City— It could
                            not be defended. If Montmartre could be defended, there were other
                            avenues equally accessible. I did not incline to converse much with him
                            upon French Affairs, and therefore took leave— His Deportment is
                            sufficiently graceful, and his person is handsome— His manner was cold,
                            but not absolutely repulsive— After returning home I went and paid a
                            visit to <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef> the
                            Russian Ambassador, who resides in the neighbourhood of our lodgings— I
                            told him I had received a Letter of Recredence, from the President of
                            the United States, addressed to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
                                of Russia</persRef>— That <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi

                            my successor at his Court, and if his state of health had been such as
                            to permit him to proceed to Russia, or to the place of the Emperor’s
                            abode, I should have made him the bearer of it— But M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was very ill, and intended to
                            return to the United States— I came therefore to consult him the Count,
                            and ask him what would be my best method of transmitting the Letter to
                            the Emperor— Whether I should deliver it to him; or address it to the
                            place where the Emperor may be; or transmit it to the Department of
                            Foreign Affairs at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg.— The
                            Count said he would write and take the Emperors orders on the Subject—
                            He asked me whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was really so
                            ill, or whether it was only a reluctance at going to Russia— I assured
                            him that it was a real and so severe an illness that it was even
                            doubtful whether he could recover from it— I had then much Conversation
                            with the Count on the present state of France, and the prospects of the
                            new War. He thinks that <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
                                >Buonaparte</persRef> (for so he must be called here) has not, and
                            cannot assemble more than two hundred thousand Men of regular troops,
                            and I am of the same opinion— I gave him, such information of the state
                            of France as I think correct, and he said it agreed with all the best
                            information that had been collected from that Country.— He told me the
                            Emperor Alexander was to leave Vienna the 23<hi rend="superscript"
                                >d:</hi> of this Month and was probably now at Munich— On my return
                            home I had a visit from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— He said
                            that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and he had invitations to
                            dine next Thursday with <persRef ref="grey-charles">Earl Grey</persRef>—
                            That there had also been an invitation to <persRef

                                >r</hi> Clay had now a note from <persRef ref="mackintosh-james">Sir

                            my arrival wished me also to be of the company— I accepted the
                            invitation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay told me he had also an
                            invitation at <persRef ref="grey-mary">Countess Grey’s</persRef>, to an
                            Evening party to-morrow.— I dined with <persRef

                            conversation upon any other topic than France, and it is scarcely
                            possible to talk in any way upon it without immediately shocking
                            Passions and Prejudices— I found it strongly by experience yesterday and
                            this day.— The Ladies withdrew after dinner, and the Gentlemen sat at
                            table about half an hour longer— This practice still continues here; but
                            the dining hour is so late that the men cannot sit long, unless they
                            pass the Night at table— We came home about eleven, and I found a Card,
                            of Countess Grey, “at Home, Tuesday, 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            May.” The Card had my name on the top— This is the fashion of invitation

                            occasional conversation among their respective acquaintances— The Duke

                            spent at Paris, much like that which preceeded it— The next ten days we
                            were upon our Journey and Voyage— The last week, we have spent at
                            London, in a hurly burly of confusion. We are so straightened for Room
                            at our lodgings, that I have not a chamber to use as my Cabinet or
                            writing room— I have no Secretary— The Visits received and visits to be
                            paid engross great part of my time—the Domestic Arrangements, looking
                            out for a house, for Servants, a Carriage and horses, and for our
                            baggage and effects which are not yet landed from the vessel, absorb the
                            rest— The Commercial Treaty, the Affair of the Prisoners at Dartmoor,
                            applications for Passports, and starving American Sailors are all
                            assailing me at the same time, and I receive about ten letters every
                            day, scarcely one of which I am able to answer— I shall be able to bring
                            nothing into order, until we get settled in a house, where I can have a
                            writing chamber.</p>
