						<p><date>5. V:30. </date>I roused <persRef key="adams-george"

								ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley’s</persRef> Office, to enquire if the John, the vessel in

							called at the globe Coffee-House Fleet-Street, and found M<hi

							go into town again, on that day, and at an earlier hour.— I called at
								<persRef ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef> for my

							wants to return to America, and was turned away from <persRef

								Beasley</persRef>, who told him he could do nothing for him— I

							Packets, and he promised that he would have that for M<hi

							a receipt for it— But he said he had seen in an American Paper of April

							Ludlow at New-York, announced— The Christian name he did not recollect.—
							I thought it could not be this person, and left the Packet with M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot’s</persRef> private

							to inform them of it yesterday, and was very much disappointed; having

							which was to have taken out M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot from
							Portsmouth— When the general measure shall have been completed, it will
							be considered what other frigate shall be employed to take him out— We
							went down to Charles Street, where I found several <pb n="306" type="ms"

								>General Scott</persRef>— I called at Adam Street, in the Adelphi,

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray</persRef>, but he was not
							at home— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams alighted with Lucie, in
							Lincoln’s Inn Fields— I called at General Scott’s lodgings in Leicester
							Square— He was not at home, and I left his Letters.— Returned to Charles
							Street, where I found three American Sailors applying for relief— I was
							obliged to leave them, to attend <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Lord
								Liverpool</persRef> at Fife House at 2 O’Clock— I was immediately
							introduced into his Cabinet, and stated to him the Subjects upon which I
							had been desirous of having this interview with him; observing that
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> at the
							time of his departure had referred me to him, and to <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>, upon the Subjects
							belonging to the foreign Department— My first object was to ascertain
							what was the Understanding of this Government, with regard to the fifth
							Article of the Commercial Convention lately signed— I was informed by
							Merchants that an extra duty of 2 pence per pound, upon Cotton, imported
							in American vessels, which had not commenced, until a day or two after
							the signature of the Convention, was now levied, and as the Convention
							was not published, I was asked, when its operation was to commence— I
							had brought a copy of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Article with
							me, and my own opinion was that although the Convention would not be
							binding upon the parties, until the exchange of Ratifications, its
							operation upon that Event, would be retrospective, from the date of the
							Signature— Lord Liverpool said that was unusual, which I admitted,
							observing that the Article was drawn up in words deviating from the
							usual form, and that the deviation was the proposal of the British
							Plenipotentiaries, Our Projet having proposed that the Treaty should
							take effect as usual, from the Exchange of Ratifications. He asked me,
							if I had spoken upon the Subject to <persRef ref="robinson-frederick"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson</persRef>, the Vice
							President of the Board of Trade— I said I had; some weeks since; but he
							had not formed a decisive opinion upon it— I said that we had understood
							that an order of Council would have issued immediately to arrest the
							levying the extra duty upon Cotton imported in American vessels and that
							it would not have been levied at-all— This was our impression at the
							time when the Convention was negotiated; and from what was said by the
								<persRef ref="goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>— At all Events however it was material
							to know what the Construction of the Article by the British Government
							would be, as the operation in either case must be reciprocal— If it was
							understood here that the revocation of discriminating duties would
							commence only from the Exchange of Ratifications, the same principle
							must be observed in the United States; but there, when the Convention
							should be ratified, any individual affected by it, might claim the
							benefit of its construction by a judicial authority;— He said it was the
							same here. That the Construction must of course be the same on both
							sides. That they had taken an Act of Parliament to enable the king in
							Council to regulate the trade with America until the meeting of
							Parliament, as had been done for some years after the Peace of 1783. And
							an Order of Council was to have been made out conformably to the Treaty—
							It had been for some time accidentally delayed, but perhaps it might be
							ready to be signed at the Council to-morrow. As it was the disposition
							here to put all the amicable and conciliatory arrangements in operation
							as soon as possible, the discriminating duties might be immediately
							removed in the Confidence that the same measure would be adopted on the
							part of the United States— I said that Great-Britain had already a
							pledge, of that reciprocity, by the Act of Congress passed at the last
							Session, of which I had also brought with me a Copy. I left both the
							Copies with him. Before we passed to another Subject, he said he thought
							proper to mention to me that a note would be sent to <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>
							previous to the ratification of the Convention, respecting the Island of
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Helena— That by a general agreement
							of the allies, <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>
							was to be transferred to custody in that Island. And by a general
							regulation the ships of all Nations, excepting those of their own
							East-India Company would be excluded from it. The circumstance which led
							to the necessity of this measure had not been in contemplation, and the
							measure itself would not be extended beyond the necessity by which it
							was occasioned. That it was authorized by the Precedent of the Treaty
							which had been signed by himself and <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef>; and which the American
							Government had proposed to modify, because a subsequent Treaty
							containing the cession of Louisiana had altered the situation of the
							parties, though not contemplated by him or M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> King, when they signed the Convention. That as the Cape of
							Good-Hope would still be left for American vessels to touch at, he
							presumed the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Helena would not
							be necessary for them— I said I did not know that the stipulation with
							regard to the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Helena was in
							itself of very material importance; but the American Government might
							consider the principle as important— The stipulation was in express and
							positive terms, and the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Helena
							was identically named— The case referred to by him, did not appear to me
							to apply as a Precedent, for two reasons— One was that the Louisiana
							Convention had been signed before and not as he thought, after that
							signed by him and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King; though it was
							true that neither he nor M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King knew that
							it had been signed— The other was that Great-Britain had declined
							ratifying that Convention upon the very ground of the modification to it
							proposed by the American Government, in consequence of the change
							produced by the Louisiana Convention— He said that at all Events, as
							such a note would be presented by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker
							previous to the Ratification by the <pb n="307" type="ms"/>American
							Government, he had thought best to give me notice of it. I then referred
							to the Contents of the Letter which I had addressed last week to Lord
							Castlereagh, and asked him if he had seen it— He intimated that he had—
							I told him that having expected M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot was
							on the eve of his departure, I had been anxious that he might go
							provided with instructions which might give Satisfaction to the
							Government of the United States with regard to the execution of two very
							important stipulations in the Treaty of Ghent— He said that as to the
							surrender of Michillimakinac, there could be no sort of difficulty— The
							Orders for its evacuation had been long since given. It was merely the
							want of barracks for their troops, that had occasioned a momentary
							delay, and he had no doubt the fort was ere this delivered up. There
							never had been for a moment the intention on the part of the British
							Government, to retain any place which they had stipulated to restore—
							But with respect to the Slaves, they certainly construed very
							differently from the American Government the stipulation relating to
							them. They thought that it applied only to the Slaves in the Forts and
							Places, which having been taken during the War, were to be restored— I
							said that independent of the Construction of the Sentence which so
							strongly marked the distinction between the Artillery and Public
							Property and Slaves and private Property, the process by which the
							Article was drawn up, demonstrated beyond all question that a
							distinction between them was intended, and understood by both parties.
							The first Projet of the Treaty was presented by <hi rend="italic"
								>us</hi>— This had been required, and even insisted upon by the
							British Plenipotentiaries— The Article was therefore drawn up by us, and
							our intention certainly was to secure the restoration both of the Public
							and Private Property including Slaves, which had been in any manner
							captured on shore during the War— The Projet was returned to us, with a
							limitation upon the Restoration of property, whether Public or Private,
							to such as had been in the Places when captured, and should remain there
							at the time of the evacuation— We assented to this so far as related to
							Artillery and Public Property, which by the usages of War is liable to
							be taken and removed; but not with regard to private property and
							Slaves, which we thought should at all Events be restored, because they
							ought never to have been taken. We therefore proposed the transposition
							of the words as stated in my Letter to Lord Castlereagh— The British
							Plenipotentiaries certainly knew that in asking for that transposition
							the import of the Sentence would be changed—that the limitation
							applicable to one species of property would no longer be applicable as
							they had proposed to the other; but the construction upon which the
							British Commanders have carried away the Slaves, would annul the whole
							effect of the transposition of the words— He said that perhaps the
							British Plenipotentiaries had agreed to the transposition of the words,
							there, without referring to the Government here; and that although the
							intentions of the Parties might be developed by reference to the course
							of the Negotiations, yet the ultimate Construction must be upon the
							words of the Treaty as they stood. He would see M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Goulburn, and enquire of him, how they understood this
							transposition; but certainly for himself, and he could speak for the
							whole Government here, if they had understood it to imply that persons
							who from whatever motive had taken refuge under the Protection of the
							British forces, should be delivered up to those who to say the least
							must feel unkindly towards them, and might treat them harshly, they
							should have objected to it— Something else, he could not say what, would
							have been proposed— I said I had referred to the progress of the
							Negotiation, and the Protocol of Conferences only as confirming what I
							thought the evident purport of the words in the Treaty— To speak in
							perfect candour, I would not undertake to say that the British
							Plenipotentiaries had taken a view of the subject different from that of
							their Government. But certainly our intentions were to provide that no
							slaves should be carried away— We had no thought of concealing or
							disguising that intention. Had the British Plenipotentiaries asked of us
							an explanation of our proposal to transpose the words, we should
							instantly have given it— It was evident that we had an object in making
							the proposal, and we thought the words themselves fully disclosed it—
							Our object was the restoration of all property including Slaves, which
							by the usages of War among civilized Nations ought not to have been
							taken— All private property on shore, was of that description— It was
							entitled by the Laws of War, to exemption from capture— Slaves were
							private property— Lord Liverpool said that he thought they could not be
							considered precisely under the general denomination of private property—
							A table or chair for instance might be taken and restored without
							changing its condition; but a living, and a human being was entitled to
							other Considerations— I said that the Treaty had made no such
							distinction— The words implicitly recognized Slaves as private Property—
							They were in the Article alluded to “Slaves or <hi rend="italic"
								>other</hi> private Property[”]— I did however readily admit the
							distinction suggested by him— Most certainly a living, sentient being,
							and still more, a human being, was to be regarded in a different light,
							from the inanimate matter, of which other private property might
							consist— And if on the ground of that difference the British
							Plenipotentiaries had objected to restore the one, while they agreed to
							restore the other, we should <pb n="308" type="ms"/>have readily
							discussed the subject— We might have accepted or objected to the
							proposal they would have made— But what could that proposal have been?
							Upon what ground could Great-Britain have refused to restore them?— Was
							it because they had been seduced away from their Masters by the promises
							of British Officers?— It was true Proclamations from her Officers to
							that effect had issued— We considered them as deviations from the usages
							of War— We believed, that the British Government itself would when the
							hostile Passions of a State of War should subside, consider them in the
							same light— That she would then be willing to restore the property or to
							indemnify the sufferers by its loss— If she felt bound to make good the
							promises of her Officers to the Slaves, she might still be willing to do
							an act of Justice, by compensating the owners of the Slaves, for the
							property which had been irregularly taken from them— Without entering
							into a discussion, which might have been at once unprofitable and
							irritating, she might consider this engagement only as a promise to pay
							for those Slaves which should be carried away, by paying the worth of
							them to their owners— Lord Liverpool did not reply to these
							observations, nor did he appear to take them in ill part, and I added
							that there was a branch of the same Subject upon which I had not written
							to Lord Castlereagh, because as it involved considerations of a very
							delicate Nature, I had thought it might be treated more confidentially
							by verbal conference, than by written Communications which would be
							liable to publication— During the War it had been stated in a Letter of
							Instructions from the American <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef> to the Negotiators of the Ghent Treaty, that some of
							the Slaves enticed from their Masters, by promises of Freedom, from
							British Officers, had afterwards been sold in the West-Indies— This
							Letter of Instructions had afterwards been published— Yes, said he, and
							I believe some explanation of it has been asked— I said there had— First
							by the British Plenipotentiaries at Ghent, and afterwards by <persRef
								ref="cochrane-alexander">Admiral Cochrane</persRef> of the American
							Secretary of State— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had answered
							this last application by a Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baker, which his Lordship had doubtless seen— But I had been authorized
							to say that in making this charge in the midst of the War the American
							Government had not expected and was not desirous that it should lead to
							discussions to be protracted, to a time and in a state of Peace— They
							believed that Evidence to substantiate in some degree the charge was
							obtainable, but would prefer that if the British Government wished to
							obtain it, they should seek it from other sources, many of which were
							more accessible to them than to the Government of the United States— The
							sales if made, had been in British Possessions, and from British Ships—
							These were of course entirely open to the investigation of enquiries
							under British Authority— The Proclamations, had promised employment in
							the military service of Great-Britain (which could apply only to men) or
								<hi rend="italic">free</hi> settlement in the West-Indies— But in
							fact numbers of women and children had been received, and carried away
							as well as of men. The numbers of them and in a very great degree the
							identical individuals that had been taken, might be easily proved in the
							United States, and I expected to be enabled to furnish accurate lists of
							them. If not sold some provision must have been made for them at the
							charge of the British Government itself— It could not be at a loss to
							know those whom it had to maintain—and as the whole subject had a
							tendency rather to irritation that to the conciliatory Spirit, which it
							was the wish of the American Government to cultivate exclusively— Lord
							Liverpool is a man of remarkable mildness and amenity of manner— I
							perceived that he was under some embarrassment how to take what I was
							saying— That in referring him to the ample and obvious sources of
							Evidence through which they may ascertain the facts, without recurring
							to the medium of the American Government, he thought I was shrinking
							from the production of any Evidence on our part— I had anticipated that
							this would be his impression, and therefore added; that with this
							explanation I was directed to say that if the British Government still
							desired Evidence from that of the United States, they would furnish such
							as they could collect. He said that was certainly all that could be
							asked— The British Officers had universally, and very strenuously denied
							the charge; which if true, deserved the severest animadversion and
							punishment. The British Government certainly had believed, and still
							believed the charge to have been without foundation, and in the
							deficiency of evidence, could come to no other conclusion— A Servant had
							announced <persRef ref="dundas-robert">Lord Melville</persRef>, who was
							waiting, and I thought it unnecessary to push the subject further. I
							then spoke to him about the tax levied, upon my dispatches, and which
								<persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef>, had unwarily paid at Liverpool— After the full
							explanation he admitted, not however very explicitly that the tax ought
							not to have been levied, and said he would speak of it to <persRef
								ref="freeling-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Freeling</persRef>, the Secretary of the Post-Office, of whose
							fairness and obliging disposition he gave a high, and very unmerited
							character. I told him that the Law upon which the tax was levied having
							now expired, it remained important only as respected the Principle— As
							it was my only object to ascertain, whether I could send my Letters by
							private hands, or whether I must constitute a special messenger for
							every dispatch that I should have occasion to send— As I was coming
							away, I mentioned the Report I had heard, that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bagot was not to go out so soon as had been expected— He
							said that the general measure of reducing the fleet to a Peace
							establishment having been adopted, the frigate in which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot was to have embarked came within the
							regulation among the ships to be paid off.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Bagot expected shortly to be confined and her relations had
							been so much concerned for her, and so anxious to have her departure
							postponed, that he had requested it might be delayed <pb n="309"
								type="ms"/>for some weeks. Another Frigate would then be appointed
							to take them out— He said as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker was at
							Washington, he, Lord Liverpool thought there would be no inconvenience
							in the delay, provided M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot should go,
							so as to arrive in the United States before the opening of the Session
							of Congress— On taking leave and retiring, I saw in the Antichamber
								<persRef ref="fagel-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fagel</persRef>, the Dutch Ambassador, and <persRef
								ref="morier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier</persRef>— I
							called at <persRef ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef> and
							took my Legation Seal— Returned to Charles Street, where I found
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>— We returned home with a heavy shower
							of rain the greatest part of the way— It was near seven when we sat down

							the postponement of his departure for the United States— We all went to

								ref="edward">Duke of Kent</persRef>, for the benefit of the Charity

							catechised by the <persRef ref="u">junior Parson</persRef> of the
							Parish— <persRef ref="carr-colston">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carr</persRef> was not there.— The text was from Hebrews XIII.16—
							[“]But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
							sacrifices God is well pleased”— The Sermon was tolerably well written,
							and very indifferently read. Though a Charity Sermon it was not free
							from the tinge of an uncharitable Spirit— For among the excellences of
							the Institution for which the preacher was begging he did not fail to
							enumerate its tendency to preserve the boys, from the infection of
							methodism, or dissent from that most excellent, and perfect Church—the
							Church of England. There is something in the dress, in the gait, in the
							deportment, in the expression of countenance, and above all in the eye,
							of those Clergymen of the most excellent Church, that imports arrogance,
							intolerance and all that is the reverse of Christian humility— They will
							quote the words of the Publican with the tone of the Pharisee, and say
							God be merciful to me a Sinner, with an air as if they meant to take the
							kingdom of Heaven by violence— In this Church there is inscribed in
							gilded characters on the Pannels of the Gallery pews, all the donations
							for more than two Centuries, made to the Church or to the Parish, for
							charitable purposes— This is an excellent practice; well deserving of
							imitation— It is at once a testimony of gratitude for benefits received,
							and an excitement to others to like charitable deeds— After Church we
							took a ride over Castlebar Hill, where the Duke of Kent resides, and on
							returning, I alighted with George, and walked home. I spent the
							remainder of the morning, in finishing the Journal of last Wednesday,
							which has occupied me two or three days, and in bringing up the arrears

						<p><date>26. V:30. </date>At seven, the Coachman came with the Curricle, and
							I returned home to Ealing, to Breakfast. But as I have not acquired the
							faculty after a day of dissipation of settling my Spirits down to a
							steady occupation, this day was in a great measure wasted— I wrote
							scarcely any thing. I paid a visit to <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles"
								>General Dumouriez</persRef>, who is almost my next door neighbour,
							and returned to him the Letters which were left with me about a
							fortnight since, with several Letters from the Post-Office. The Letters
							had given me some insight into the views and present situation of the
							man, and I had now a long conversation with him which gave me more—
							Dumouriez was at one time an important personage in the world— It is now
							more than twenty years since he was obliged to fly from the army which
							he had led to victory, and seek refuge among the enemies whom he had
							vanquished— He is now seventy five years of age, burning with ambition
							to return to France, and recommence a Career, in which by a confession
							more true than sincere, in one of the letters he said he had done
							nothing but de brillantes sottises. The uneradicable vices of his
							character are Vanity, Levity and Insincerity.— They are conspicuous in
							his writings and were not less remarkable in his Conversation with me—
							Like all vain people his greatest delight is to talk of himself. He told
							me that he had been twelve years in the service of this Country— That he
							had first been sent for, to assist in a plan of defence for this Country
							against a French invasion— He had made his bargain with the British
							Government— They had offered him terms which he had accepted, and he
							lived upon them, comfortably, though not in opulence— That while
								<persRef ref="louis-xviii">Louis 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi></persRef> had been in this Country, he had often seen, and
							at one time had been much in favour with him— But Louis had a favourite,
							a <persRef ref="deblacas-pierre">Count de Blacas</persRef>, who had done
							him infinite mischief, and when he went over to France in 1814 there was
							some coldness of the king towards him— After the king was at Paris,
							settling his Government, <persRef ref="macdonald-jacques"
								>Macdonald</persRef>, who had been one of his Aid de Camp’s said to
							the king— What— Sir! Come without Dumouriez?—without the Vainqueur de
							Gemmappe? Some proposal had then been made, that he should be appointed
							a Marshal of France and a member of the house of Peers— But this was not
							obtained; and finally the only thing offered him, was the rank of
							Lieutenant General, with full pay, but without any command—which he
							refused—his situation here was better than that. He was here upon good
							terms with all parties; the Ministers and opposition were all his
							friends— He gave his opinions freely, as he thought might be useful, and
							wrote Memoirs when required. He had resided in his present habitation
							these two years and a half, with the <persRef ref="u">Count de S<hi
									rend="superscript">t</hi> Martin</persRef> his Aid de Camp and
								<persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>— They had lost <persRef ref="u"
								>their only Son</persRef>, in Portugal— He saw very little Society
							here; and very seldom went to London; except on occasion of some
							Solemnity like that of yesterday with he could not avoid. He spoke of
							the present State of Affairs in France; but so as to convince me that he
							knew nothing more of them than is contained in the Newspapers— He said
							that he was for the Mornarchie Constitutionelle— For it was impossible
							at this time to govern France either par l’absolutisme, or by a
							Republic— He had advised that the king should at once make a prime
							Minister, disband the army, form a new one attached to the royal cause;
							that the armies of the allies should all withdraw; and that they should
							take and keep the fortresses on the frontiers until the king’s
							Government should be settled. Instead of which there were now two Prime
							Ministers, <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">Talleyrand</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="fouche-joseph">Fouché</persRef>—and three armies— The
							army of the Loire— The remnant of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Buonaparte’s</persRef> troops; an army forming under the king’s
							authority, and an army collected by the <persRef ref="louisantoine2"
								>Duke d’Angouleme</persRef> in the South, violently royalist, and
							which had committed great excesses of reaction— The Duke d’Angouleme had
							imprudently said that it would never be well with France, until they
							were all of the same religion; and at Nismes six hundred Protestants had
							been massacred; they were hunted like wild beasts and great multitudes
							of them had been obliged to fly from their habitations and take refuge
							in the Cevennes. These enormous foreign armies were exhausting the
							Country— The rainy Season would soon be setting in; and if they did not
							take care, they would then have as destructive a War to carry on, as the
							French had found in Spain— As to these dangers to the foreign armies,
							they are so perfectly chimerical, that they indicate only the General’s
							Old Age— The foreign armies are perfectly safe but the measure of
							oppression upon the French People, will exceed all bounds— I asked
							Dumouriez whether he did not think they would finish by <pb n="312"
								type="ms"/>making a Poland of France— He said, if they did, he
							should only regret that he was not thirty years younger— He spoke also
							of the <persRef ref="louis-philippe">Duke of Orleans</persRef>— In one
							of the Letters which I returned to him he had written, esperons
							toujours—non pas du coté du faux Télémaque, que je vois ici quelquefois,
							mais sans confiance; mais d’un autre coté.— I had observed yesterday
							that he was very assiduous in paying his Court to the faux Télémaque;
							and this day he spoke of him as if with the highest attachment— Said he
							had brought him up— That he was like a child to him. That his Sister
							<persRef ref="adelaidedorleans">Mademoiselle d’Orleans</persRef>,
							looked upon him Dumouriez almost as a father— That he had advised the
							Duke to go to France as he lately did— That he had suffered there every
							species of mortification— That Court etiquettes had been raised to
							exclude his wife from the entrées, though she was a king’s daughter—
							That the <persRef ref="marietheresecharlotte">duchess
								d’Angouleme</persRef> had been mortified because the Duchess
							d’Orleans’s parties had been crowded, while those at the Thuileries had
							been in a manner deserted— And lately when they were fugitives here,—the
							Duchess d’Angoulême said to the Duke d’Orleans, that her husband was
							coming from Spain; but not to stay here— He would go immediately to join
							the king—“parceque c’est sa place”— When the Duke went lately to France—
							They were going to send Princes of the blood to preside at the electoral
							Colleges— Monsieur was at Paris—the Duke d’Angouleme at Bordeaux— The
								<persRef ref="berri-charles">Duke de Berri</persRef> at Lille— The
								<persRef ref="louisdukedebourbon">Duke de Bourbon</persRef> was to
							have gone to the Vendée, and the Duke d’Orleans to Lyons, but one
							obstacle after another had been raised, and the king had told the Duke
							of Orleans that the Duke of Bourbon could not go into the Vendée, and
							perhaps he might as well not go to Lyons— The Duke had then asked the
							king’s permission to come to England again, which the king had
							immediately granted. He told me he was going to dine with the Duke of
							Orleans to morrow— We had a great variety of Conversation upon the
							topics; upon the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>,
							who received him last Summer, at London, on the same day that he did
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>; and who he says, has
							taken such a distaste to Russia, that he will not return to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg at all; but talks of staying
							with his army in Germany— Of the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii"
								>king of Prussia</persRef> who he says is a good man, but entirely
							under the controul of his Generals— That ten or twelve of them, <persRef
								ref="vongneisenau-august">Gneisenau</persRef>, <persRef ref="kleist-friedrich">Kleist</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="vontauentzien-bogislav">Tauenzien</persRef>, and others have

							The spirit of conquest has taken possession of them; and they are for
							making Prussia now play the part which France played for ten or fifteen
							years—on returning home from the General’s after a walk with him in his

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> I rise with sufficient
							regularity between five, and half-past-six O’Clock— Rouse my son
								<persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>, and hear him read five
							Chapters in the French Bible; I hold the Latin Bible to compare them
							while he reads; and then read one Chapter of the French to him, while he
							holds the Latin— The object is to improve his knowledge and
							pronunciation of the language— I then write my Journal of the preceding
							day or any thing more urgent, until nine— I then receive the Newspapers
							and often Letters— About ten we breakfast; from which time until half
							past four, I write, or arrange my papers or receive visitors—we are not
							troubled with many of them— Two or three times a week I have hitherto
							been obliged to go into London, when I seldom can get from home before
							two O’Clock, and seldom return before seven— On those days we dine
							little before eight, and have scarcely any Evening— When I do not go to
							town, I walk an hour and a half before dinner with George, and dine at
							six— We take a second short walk of half an hour, after dinner—
							Sometimes on the neighbouring roads and sometimes in our own Gardens—
							These walks however will cease with the Summer— When in town, I
							sometimes pay a few visits but am usually chained down by business at
							the Office in Charles Street— George, alternately translates one day
							from English into Latin, and the next from Latin (<persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> second Philippic) into
							English. I correct his exercises every morning after breakfast. He also
							studies Greek, by himself and Italian with <persRef ref="pio-peter"
								>Pio</persRef>— <persRef ref="u">Barberi</persRef> gives him three
							times a week lessons of writing and of fencing.</p>
