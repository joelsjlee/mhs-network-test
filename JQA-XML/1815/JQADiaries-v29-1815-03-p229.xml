						<p><date>1. VII:45. </date>As I was to be abroad this Evening, I gave the
							morning also to the return of visits, after writing a Letter to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, which I addressed to
							her at Berlin— I called at <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> door, but he was
							just riding out on horseback with <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>. Of the other visits
							that I paid, I met at home only my old Classmate <persRef
								ref="beale-benjamin2">Beale</persRef>; whom I found living in an
							elegant, but somewhat singular style— <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> called upon me this Morning— He has a reluctance to
							go home in the Neptune, and still gives me much concern. At <persRef
								ref="boyd-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Boyds</persRef> and
							at <persRef ref="destutt-antoine">Count de Tracy’s</persRef> I left
							Cards— After a long walk, on returning home to dinner I found that
								<persRef ref="colburn-zerah">Zerah Colburn</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="colburn-abia">his father</persRef> had been to see me, and are
							to call upon me to-morrow Morning again— At half past 8 in the Evening
							the <persRef ref="brito-jose">Chevalier de Brito</persRef> called upon
							me, and I went with him to the Palais Royal— The crowd of company was
							very great, and after waiting nearly two hours it was not without
							difficulty that I finally obtained a presentation to the <persRef
								ref="marieamalie">Duchess</persRef> and to Mademoiselle d’Orleans,
							the former of whom spoke a few words of civility; the other only bowed—
							The <persRef ref="louis-philippe">duke</persRef> was also there, and in
							like manner spoke a few words. As the ladies and gentlemen were all
							presented successively and there were at least four hundred persons
							present little could be said to any one— There were great numbers of
							foreigners, and among them many English— The proportion of beautiful
							women was greater than I ever saw at a Court circle. It was about eleven
							O’Clock when I came home, and I had but little rest the whole Night,
							owing to a Ball given by the <persRef
								ref="platamone-francis;platamone-sophia">Count and Countess of Sant
								Antonio</persRef>, lodgers at the Hotel du Nord, and my next door
							Neighbours.</p>

						<p><date>2. V:45. </date>The noise at the close of the Ball gave me this
							morning two hours more of leisure than I have been accustomed to for the
							last fortnight, and I had time to write to <persRef ref="harris-levett"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>, and partly
							bring up the arrears of this Journal— <persRef ref="colburn-zerah">Zerah
								Colburn</persRef> came this morning, with <persRef
								ref="colburn-abia">his father</persRef> and another man, whose name
							was not mentioned to me— The boy was born 1 September 1804. and has it
							would seem a faculty for the composition and decomposition of numbers,
							by inspiration. His father says he discovered it in him in August 1810.
							when he was not quite six years old and had never learnt the first rules
							of Arithmetic— Even now he cannot do a common sum in the rule of three
							but he can by a mental operation of his own, extract the roots of any
							power and any number, and name the factors by which any given number is
							produced— I asked him what it was that had first turned his attention to
							the combinations of numbers; he said he could not tell. His father says
							that having arrived here in August last he already speaks French in
							perfection, and has acquired great knowledge of the German— His method
							of compounding numbers and extracting roots is a discovery, of which an
							account is to be published in a quarto volume with a biography of the
							boy which is to be written by a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow in
							England— The method however the father says he has not yet revealed to
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow</persRef>—
							The quarto is to be published by subscription, and I readily subscribed
							for a copy— By the assistance of <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving</persRef>, an opportunity has
							been given for Zerah to be educated at the Polytechnic school, and the
							father expressed himself much satisfied with it— I told him I thought he
							could not obtain a better chance for his education, and strongly
							recommended it to him to avail himself of it— The father is a plain
							New-England farmer, and to all appearance a very ordinary man— His
							language is that of our most <pb n="230" type="ms"/>uneducated people,
							and his principal anxiety seemed to be to get a picture of Zerah to send
							home to America, as a present to Congress— I advised him rather to send
							it to the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef>— Zerah is
							certainly an astonishing and promising boy— But if his promise is ever
							to realize any thing corresponding to it, the sooner his father commits
							him to the tuition of the polytechnic school the better. After writing
							until 2. O’Clock I took a long walk and then spent an hour at the
							National Museum— I barely reached the end of the Halls when four O’Clock
							came, and I was obliged to turn about and come home— After dinner I went
							to the Odeon theatre, and saw the first Night of a Comedy in 5 Acts, in
							verse, called La journée des dupes ou l’envie de parvenir. Its success
							was not so complete as that of Felicie at the Opera Comique, and there
							were some stormy moments in the course of the play— It finished however
							with much applause— The author’s name was demanded, and announced to be
								<persRef ref="charlemagne-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Armand Charlemagne</persRef>— There was a short concert afterwards
							by the Italian performers—indifferent— I met at the theatre a Frenchman
							whom in 1810 and 1811. I had often seen at <persRef
								ref="raimbert-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Reimbert’s</persRef>— He told me he had left Russia in 1812 when the
							war broke out. Had been taken prisoner at the passage of the Beresina,
							and sent with the <persRef ref="brancia-francesco">Chevalier
								Brancia</persRef> to Voronetz, where they were detained until last
							October— He has been here about two months and left Brancia sick at
							Wilna.</p>

						<p><date>3. VII:15. </date>I wrote two Letters this morning, and continued

							the river; over the Bridges round by the Garden of the Tuileries and the

								Fagel</persRef> near the Place Vendôme— After dining I went to the

							Installation— The Ceremony itself was precisely similar to that at the
							Court of Cassation. It was singular enough, and characteristic of the
							time and place, that the Mass a solemn religious service was ushered in
							and concluded by a band of Music performing the Air of Vive <persRef
								ref="henry-iv">Henry quatre</persRef>; a drinking song; the words of

							Evening— He was going out this Evening to a large Ball, given by a
							Countess, and to which he was to be introduced by one of his
							acquaintance— I walked on the Boulevards until dinner time, and in the
							Evening went to the Opera— The performances were Les Bayadères, and the
							Ballet of Nina, not quite so magnificent a Spectacle as Castor et
							Pollux, but much more amusing. The dancing in the Opera, and the
							Pantomime of the Ballet were exquisite— The house was quite full without
							being crowded— I sat about the centre of the Pit, by far the best place
							in the house, both for seeing and hearing— But the taste for frequenting
							the theatre grows upon me, and must be controuled.</p>

							whom I met on coming out from the theatre told me, that she was not in

							of the king inconsistent— The Queen insignificant, and cold— Only one
							female personage; and no love; though Marigny, talks amorously about a
							certain Adelaide— The best of the performers is <persRef

							It is the contempt shed upon old age, and particularly upon the paternal
							character; the irreverence of children to their parents; the complacency
							with which fraud and swindling is represented, and the extreme address
							and ingenuity of valets, which form the moral and literary defects of
							this play— I remarked to a Frenchman who sat near me, the contrast in
							the Sentiments of the Tragedy and of the farce, performed this Evening—
							He said c’est que l’un montre les hommes comme ils devroient être; et
							l’autre comme ils sont. But I think that is not correct— Mankind are in
							real life not more like Scapin and his dupes, than like the Grand Master
							of the Templars or Marigny.</p>

							which she laid on her table, and which rolled off and fell upon the
							floor— It fell with the sound of wood, and not of metal— I was myself in
							the Pit, which at Paris is the criticising part of the Audience, and it
							is amusing to observe how sensitive they are to every incident that
							occurs upon the stage— I was surrounded by persons who at almost every
							first line of the Misanthrope, would repeat in muttering the second— Who
							censured and approved the manner of the actors at every passage, and as
							I thought almost always correctly. They were generally dissatisfied with
							Lason’s performance, and said that he ought to confine himself to
							tragedy— They called for <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry quatre</persRef>
							and Gabrielle, both of which were twice performed, with many cries Vive

						<p><date>11. VI:30. </date>Morning visit from the <persRef ref="u">Baron de

								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef> was within 8

								ref="platamone-francis">Count de Sant Antonio</persRef>, whose
								<persRef ref="platamone-sophia">wife</persRef> is an English woman
							left the City this day; having intended to remain here two Months
							longer— At three O’Clock I walked out and went to several Booksellers to
							complete the collection which I yesterday purchased, of the Bibliothéque
							des Théatres— I saw in various parts of the City, a great number of
							Post-Horses apparently going to take travellers leaving Paris— After
							dinner just as I was going out I met <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving</persRef>, who told one he
							would call another day— He told me the British had been totally defeated

								<persRef ref="pakenham-edward">General Pakenham</persRef>. And he
							says the game is up with these People.— I went for the first time to the
							Theatre of the Porte S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Martin. Saw Le
							Boulevard S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Martin— Le Tanneur de
							Lesseville; and Le Berger de la Sierra Morena, a Pantomime, with the
							dancing before a transparent veil, with corresponding dancers on the
							other side in imitation of the reflection of a mirror— The illusion is
							so perfect that in the box where I was, there was a stubborn dispute
							between a husband and wife—the woman insisting that it was a real
							mirror, and only one set of dancers, and the man that it was only a
							veil, and that there were two sets of dancers— The husband was right,
							but the illusion is so great that when I saw the same sort of exhibition
							at Ghent, by the same performers I was completely deceived and had not
							even a suspicion that it was any other than the reflection of a Mirror.—
							The house was very thin— Le Tanneur de Lesseville was one of the tales
							about <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry Quatre</persRef> and there were
							several Couplets, with pointed allusions which were highly applauded,
							and repeated at the call of the auditory— In the box next to me there
							was a man, his wife and their son, a boy of nine or ten years of age—
							The man was in great agitation and anxiety— He left the box, at the end
							of the second play, and returned after the first act of the third was
							over— His anxiety was then much increased— And during the remainder of
							the performance he was telling his wife in short, interrupted sentences
							what he had heard— He spoke in a low voice, and I heard only fragments
							of what he said— He had been to see some friends, whom he had found très
							abattus— It was said that<space/>(the name I could not hear) was killed—
							Then some other names— Ils croyent aller à la Fortune— Then— <persRef
								ref="artois-charles2">Le Duc de Berry</persRef> a dit qu’il

							<pb n="233" type="ms"/>George Dandin— The house very thin— <persRef

							called out by the Parterre, and just appeared for a moment on the Stage—
							This was the first instance of the kind that I have seen at Paris—
								<persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry Quatre</persRef> and Gabrielle were
							called for and played, Before the Tragedy and between the two Plays— Ou
							peut on etre mieux, was called for, but not played. The Comedy was
							certainly not so well performed as I had seen it heretofore— On
							returning home I found numerous patroles of Soldiers, National Guards,
							and Sentinels at the corner of the Streets— News placarded upon the
							Pillars and clusters of people collecting, and attempting to read them
							by the light of the lamps— I stopp’d a moment at one of these clusters,
							when a patrole came up, and the soldier at their head said in a low
							voice, dispersez vous Messieurs, disperséz vous— An other patrole,
							meeting two Soldiers in a red uniform, made them stop and all cried Vive
							le Roi. a Hand-bill of news très satisfaisantes from Monsieur was
							circulating—promising the speedy deliverance of Lyons— The agitation in
							the City has much increased within these two days.</p>

							to march against <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>
							is greater than the government could accept— A corps of 500 men has been

							me; but as a stranger I avoid all conversation upon the topics of the
							times with persons unknown to me— He appeared to be in great anxiety— He
							said he was enrolled in this Corps of Students at Law. That they had
							been inspected this day—and were to be reviewed to-morrow— They were
							ordered to appear in uniform; but it was impossible to get a uniform in
							one day, and he did not think they ought to be required to clothe
							themselves at their own expence— He did not know what was to happen; he
							had just finished his studies at the Law, and was to have maintained his
							Thesis next week for admission to the Bar— Now God knew what would
							become of him— He had come to the Opera, pour s’etourdir.— That the
							disposition of the Nation was very good— An immense number of volunteers
							had offered their services— But. . . il n’y a que les Militaires. . .
							And not all them said the neighbour— Several officers dined with me on
							Sunday— They said they had faithfully served Buonaparte when he was
							Emperor, and would faithfully serve the <persRef ref="louis-xviii"
								>king</persRef> now— Many others have the same Sentiments, and you
							may be sure you will have very little to do— It will be all over, in a
							very few days— This same person speaking to me said before the play
							began . . . Perhaps they will announce to us some news from the theatre
							this Evening— The house was very thin— <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry

							choice of Apartments— I also called at a Trunk-makers, but could not

							L’Opera-Comique—Le Calife de Bagdad and Maison a vendre— The house
							almost empty— The contrast between the crowds at every Theatre when I
							arrived here, and the deserted walls since the middle of last week is
							remarkable— Some of my neighbours in the Parterre this evening took
							notice of it, and I heard a discussion between two of them, whether it
							was occasioned by the state of public affairs or not— The public spirit
							in Paris now is confident and sangwine— It does not appear that <persRef

							He is undoubtedly there very weak; and formidable forces are marching
							from all quarters against him. It is ascertained that a part of the
							troops as well as the highest Officers are faithful to the <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">king</persRef>; and Napoleon’s soldiers will
							probably desert him in the end— There is but one sentiment to be heard
							in Paris— After the performance of the Calife this Evening, one of the
							Actors came forward and sung some couplets of encouragement and praise
							to the volunteers— The words and Music were indifferent, but there was
							the Lys, and the Bourbons, and <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry
								Quatre</persRef>, and Ventre saint gris in every couplet, and they
							were received with rapturous applause, and loud cries of Vive le Roi— On
							returning home, I found a letter from my wife, dated at Berlin the 5<hi

							or fifteen days from that time— <persRef key="smith-william-steuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> called on me
							this morning with a Letter from the Captain of the Fingal— He asked my
							advice whether to go in that vessel or the Neptune— I inclined to think
							the passage by the Fingal would be less or at least not more expensive,
							and much more to the convenience of his family. He will be prepared to
							leave Paris by the middle of next week.</p>

								<persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> had sent him—
							I took up that of the 14<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> and the first

							upon <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, and found <persRef ref="turreau-louis">General
								Turreau</persRef> with him: I did not immediately recognize the

							reduced to less than one third of his pay that he had lost <persRef

							in full activity of service— That he was expecting his orders to march;

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lormery</persRef>, a
							Frenchman, who had been a fellow-passenger with him from America— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had the Moniteur of this day,
							containing the king’s proclamation upon leaving Paris— He says that
							divine Providence after restoring him to the throne of his ancestors,
							now permitted it to be shaken by the defection of a part of the army,
							who had sworn to defend it. That he had determined to avoid the
							calamities which might result from an ineffectual attempt to defend the
							Capital, and to retire to a part of the kingdom more favourably situated
							for defence— The Session of the two Legislative Chambers is declared to
							be closed, and they are convoked anew to meet at the time and place to
							be hereafter notified. The king is satisfied with the attachment and
							devotion to him, of the immense majority of the People of Paris, and
							promises to return very shortly to them again— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford told me that he had received an official notice
							that the Court was to be removed to Lille, whither any of the foreign
							Ministers who should think fit, might repair; but those to whom that
							would be inconvenient, would be at liberty to return to their own
							respective Governments— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford said he
							understood the foreign Ministers had for the last week had meetings
							together every day— That this morning they were to meet at the <pb
								n="236" type="ms"/>Turkish Minister’s and <persRef
								ref="walterstorff-ernst">General Waltersdorf</persRef>, the Danish
							Minister had promised to communicate to him the result of their meeting;
							but he said he had determined for himself what to do— He should answer
							the notice he had received by saying that he had already received
							permission to return to the United States, and had been for some time
							determined to embark this Spring. He should not go to Lille— I left M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawfords after 4 O’Clock. It was said
							that <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> was to enter
							Paris by the Porte S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Antoine at that hour—
							I walked on the Boulevards until half past five— The crowd waiting for
							him there was very great— Two or three troops of horse of his company
							came before him— The cries of Vive l’Empereur were repeated wherever
							they passed; but the general Conversation of almost all the persons whom
							I overheard consisted of remarks upon the inconstancy of the populace,
							and the facility with which they shouted in favour of whoever was the
							ruling power of the day— There was a printseller who had spread on the
							ground the prints of the king and Royal family, and was crying allons
							Messieurs— A dix sols la piece— The faces of Napoleon, <persRef
								ref="marialouisa2">Maria-Louise</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon2">king of Rome</persRef> had taken the place
							at all the Print shops of the family of Bourbon— I heard a man call out
							to one of the troopers to enquire how long it would be, before he
							(Napoleon) would come in; he said it would be three-quarters of an hour.
							I then came home and dined and immediately returned to the Boulevards—
							The People were all dispersing, and there was no expectation of his
							entering Paris by that way— I went to the Theatre François; first into
							the Parterre, but seeing M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin in the
							Balcon, I went and joined him there— They had announced Le Cid &amp; La
							fausse Agnés— They performed L’ecole des femmes and l’Esprit de
							Contradiction— The house was almost empty—the performances languid and
							spiritless— <persRef ref="firmin-jean">Firmin</persRef> one of the
							Actors appeared with the three coloured cockades in his hat, and was
							clapped by two or three persons— There was no other manifestation of
							public Sentiment— <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Todd</persRef> who came into the box for a few minutes
							told me that the Emperor was to make his entry at Noon to-morrow— As I
							came home I found the columns of the Palais-Royal covered with
							Napoleon’s Proclamations, one to the French People and the other to the
							army; issued on the first of this Month at the Gulph Juan, the day of
							his landing at Cannes. And in the Garden of the Palais Royal there was a
							great Bonfire burning, of all the addresses, proclamations, appeals to
							the People, and inflammatory hand-bills which have been loading every
							column for the last fortnight; many of which had been posted up this
							Morning— The crowd of People in the Arches and garden was considerable,
							and the cries of Vive l’Empereur frequent; and sometimes accompanied by
							cries of à Bas les Calottins— But although the Palais Royal is not a
							quarter of a mile distant from the Tuileries, I did not know that
							Napoleon had actually arrived while I was at the Theatre.</p>

							O’Clock I walked out on the Boulevards, and saw some of the troops,

								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor</persRef> had arrived between eight
							and nine O’Clock last Evening at the Palace of the Tuileries, at the
							head of the same troops, which had been sent out in the morning to
							oppose him— I went round by the Place Vendome, and through the Garden of
							the Tuileries, to the Place du Carousel, where there were several
							regiments of Cavalry passing successively in review before the Emperor—
							I mixed with the crowd of People, heard their cries of Vive l’Empereur,
							and heard their Conversations among themselves. The troops were the same
							garrison of Paris which had been sent out against Napoleon, and who
							entered the City with him last Evening— The front of their Helmets and
							the clasps of their belts were still glowing with the arms of the
							Bourbons, the three flower de luces— There appeared to be much
							satisfaction among the soldiers— But among the People I saw scarcely any
							manifestation of sentiment; excepting in the cries of Vive l’Empereur,
							in which a very small part of the people present joined their voices—
							There was a man passing among the throng, with a basket of three
							coloured cockades, and crying Voici Messieurs le Cocardes de la bonne
							couleur— La couleur qui ne se salit pas— The crowd were laughing and
							joking, and talking of the Rhine, the natural boundary of France, and
							swearing vengeance against the Prussians— Between four and five O’Clock
							I returned home without having obtained a sight of the Emperor— He did
							not leave the Palace— Evening at the Opera— La Caravane du Caire, with
							the Ballet of Venus et Adonis. The house was very thin; and the Parterre
							chiefly consisted of persons who came for the purpose of making a cry of
							Vive l’Empereur— There were several passages in the Opera, which this
							audience chose to understand as applicable to the present juncture and
							which were boisterously applauded— One song particularly, sung by
								<persRef ref="u">Madame Albert</persRef>, and then in Chorus,
							beginning La victoire est a nous was most absurdly applied, and
							occasioned great shouting. She was required to repeat it, and
							immediately complied— The royal arms were removed from the Curtain and
							the royal box, and the Imperial Eagle had taken their place. Even the
							title page of the Opera, had an Eagle over the flower de luces which the
							boys who sell them had not had time to paste over— All the theatres have
							taken the title of Imperial instead of Royal. The Emperor Napoleon has
							already appointed most of his Ministers, and all the Gazettes of Paris
							which were yesterday showering upon him every execration, this day
							announce that his Majesty has arrived at <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
							Palace of the Tuileries.</p>

						<p><date>29. VI:30. </date>The day was remarkably fine— The trees are
							putting fully forth their leaves— At Noon I went to the Hotel des
							Relations Exterieures, and had an interview of half an hour with
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								de Caulaincourt</persRef>, Duc de Vicence— He apologized to me for
							my having been delayed, and said he should have called upon me, if he
							had known I was in Paris. I told him that although sensible he could at
							the present juncture have no time to spare, I could not resist the
							temptation of requesting to see him; to offer him my congratulations on
							the change which had just taken place, with which I had been gratified
							in general, and more especially as it related personally to him. He said
							that a Revolution had been rendered unavoidable by the misconduct of the
							Bourbons— That with the exception of a handful of emigrants who had been
							twenty years carrying on a War against their Country, the
							dissatisfaction had been universal. If the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor</persRef> had not returned there
							would have been in less than six Months an insurrection of the People,
							the operation of which would have been dreadful— That by the Emperor’s
							return it had been effected without a drop of blood shed. His Government
							was now established throughout France more completely and effectually
							than it was eighteen Months ago— He, the Duke had last Evening enquired
							of <persRef ref="fouche-joseph">Fouché</persRef> (the new Minister of
							the Police) who received Reports from every part of the Country— He had
							assured him that there was not one Report made to him from any quarter,
							of any act of violence or resistance— The return to the present order of
							things accomplished itself every where; without an effort— It was
							inconceivable— Nothing like it was to be found in history— But so it
							was— The Government had not adopted the bad habit which the late
							Government had fallen into, of disguising or concealing to true state of
							things, but there was nothing to conceal— France would have a strong
							Government, and Institutions upon liberal <pb n="239" type="ms"
							/>principles.— The Emperor had renounced all ideas of an extended
							Empire— His earnest wish was Peace with all the world. He would execute
							with the utmost fidelity the Treaty of Paris— The late Government had
							contracted engagements by which France was bound, and which the Emperor
							considered as sacred for him— I said that I was very happy to hear this
							assurance from him— That the speculative opinions of the public on this
							subject were various— I myself had expected, first that he, the Duke
							would fill the place where I was now happy to see him, and secondly,
							that the Emperor’s policy would be precisely such as he now announced it
							to me— I had believed this would be his course, because it appeared to
							me the course obviously the best suited to his interest—the wisest
							course, and that in which he would be the strongest— It remained only to
							hope that he would meet with the return of the same pacific Spirit, in
							the other European Powers— I asked him if he had any thing new from
							abroad— He said he had just received the English Newspapers of the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> which were now in the process of being
							translated. He did not know what they contained— As to Vienna, he did
							not think it would be possible within eight or ten days to ascertain
							what would definitively be done by the sovereigns there— As to any thing
							done before the information could reach there of the Emperor’s entry at
							Paris, he considered all that as the result of Passion— They would not
							act upon these vague and unsettled impressions; the time for reflection
							would come; and he still hoped the Peace would not be violated— If
							however it should, the War on the part of France would be <hi
								rend="italic">national</hi>, and the Emperor would be stronger than
							he had ever been. Stronger in the attachment of his troops, and stronger
							in the Spirit of the People— The Emperor’s wish was Peace; and he the
							Duke could assure me that if it had been otherwise, he would not have
							been his Minister— He had no doubt that <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles"
								>Talleyrand</persRef> would do every thing in his power, pour tout
							embrouiller, et pour pousser à la guerre, but he hoped it would be
							without success— I mentioned to him that while I had been at Ghent,
								<persRef ref="u">De Cabre</persRef> had passed through that place;
							and had spoken to me of him in terms of the highest respect— That in
							coming to Paris I had long balanced in my own mind, whether I would not
							take the road by Compiegne; for the sake of calling to see him at his
							Estate, and had concluded at last to go through Peronne, from an
							uncertainty whether circumstances might not exist, which would have made
							my visit inconvenient to him— He said that it would have been only two
							or three leagues from my road, and he should have seen me with great
							pleasure— That the Emperor had appointed him at a most distressing and
							disastrous period his Minister of foreign relations.— The allied
							Sovereigns had been pleased to speak of him to his brother in Law at
							Francfort in terms of Confidence and he thought it impossible at that
							time, and under such Circumstances to refuse the appointment— He had of
							course been engaged in the Negotiations which issued so unfortunately,
							and the Bourbons had thought proper to send him into exile— He had heard
							there of the Peace we had made; and that it was a bonne paix— Was his
							information correct?— I said it was on the basis of the Statu quo ante
							Bellum. Every thing was left as it had been; and it might be called a
							good Peace, taking into consideration the situation in which the
							Revolution in Europe had left us— We had to contend against the whole
							power of Great-Britain—without a friend in Europe— With almost all
							Europe inclining even against us; and with the Government of France in
							the leading strings of our Enemy— Shewing us every possible ill-will;
							and as we had reason to believe, restrained only by the general and
							strongly pronounced Sentiment of the Nation in our favour, from
							declaring against us— He said they would undoubtedly have declared
							against us, if they had dared, and nothing but the national Sentiment
							had restrained them—the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
								Wellington</persRef> had been substantially the Sovereign of France—
							The Bourbons had been mere puppets in his hands; and he had dated his
							despatches here at Paris, at the head-quarters of his army.— The
							subserviency of the Bourbon Government to him had been unbounded— France
							had been degraded in her own eyes and in those of the world, below the
							rank of an Independent Nation— But henceforth said he we shall neither
							be English, nor Austrians, nor Russians—nous serons <hi rend="italic"
								>nous</hi>. We shall not attempt to give the law to any other
							Nation, but we shall be our own Masters at home— But, said he, the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, did manifest
							here at Paris, some interest in your favour— I said that the Emperor of
							Russia had uniformly manifested an interest in our favour. His
							disposition had been always friendly to us— He had in the first instance
							offered his mediation, and had constantly testified his good will— But
							he had done nothing for us. He had left us to fight our own battles, and
							we had never asked any thing of him— The Duke said that the attention of
							the Emperor of Russia had been so entirely absorbed by the great object
							of the affairs of Europe, that he had probably found it impossible to do
							any thing for those of America— I then observed that I hoped the
							relations between France and my own Country would soon be restored to a
							friendly and mutually advantageous footing. That I was here waiting for
							the orders of my Government, and expected to receive in the course of a
							few days my recall from the mission to Russia, either with permission to
							return to the United States, or perhaps an order to go to England. that
							in either case I should probably want a Passport from him, and should
							then apply to him for it— He said he was entirely at my disposal; and he
							begged me when I should see <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> to say the same
							thing for him to that Gentleman— All the other foreign Ministers, he
							said, were gone— They had all asked for Passports, which had accordingly
							been furnished to them.— I observed that I believed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had been for some time determined
							to return to the United States, and had already received permission to
							that effect from our Government. He had mentioned to me that he should
							probably go in a few weeks. The Duke said that under the peculiar
							circumstances of the times <pb n="240" type="ms"/>perhaps it would be
							better for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford to wait for further
							orders from his Government, founded on their knowledge of the present
							Events— I said I should mention to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford the substance of this conversation; and then took leave— I
							walked home after taking several turns in the garden of the Tuileries—
							There was a crowd of people under the windows of the Emperor’s
							Apartment; where he was walking with one of his officers, and
							occasionally appeared at the window which was open.— I saw him, but not
							distinctly enough to recognize his features— In the Evening we went all
							to the Theatre de la Porte S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Martin— Saw
							Vernon de Kergalek, a very wretched farce; Les six Ingénus a tolerable
							Ballet, and Le Vieux de la Montagne a tiresome Melodrame at which
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> was much
							frightened.</p>
