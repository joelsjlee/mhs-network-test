							He took also my answer to the Letter from <persRef ref="glennieandson"
									>Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Glennie, Son and C<hi

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb called accordingly, and left
							the Message— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier himself had not yet
							returned to the Office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb sent me
							out, by the Coachman, a new Note in 24 folio pages, from Lord Bathurst,
							on the subject of fisheries— I cannot for the present reply to it—but it
							must not be kept without reply— It is dated on the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of October. At dusk this afternoon I
							removed from the dressing chamber to the drawing Room, and was part of
							the Evening there. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams began to use it
							for her dining room— She also wrote for me a few short notes for my
							journal, from the time when I was obliged to suspend writing it, and of
							course, beginning with Saturday the 14<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of
							October— From those Minutes the arrears of this Book, are if possible to

							attributes more to his own agency in this favourable turn of my disease,

							certain; and I strongly believe that a more powerful application of
							physic at the first would have saved me from all its violence; and from
							the necessity of the leaches or of the blister— These did perhaps become
							necessary, and have been very useful; but it is not to the physician,
							that I can give the glory of my recovery. He has strongly recommended it
							to me, to consult a professed and eminent oculist, as soon as I shall be
							well enough to go out— He recommends a <persRef ref="travers-benjamin"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Travers</persRef> whom he
							considers as one of the most skilful men in that branch of the medical

						<p><date>4. </date><persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> was very ill the
							whole Night, but much better this morning— The inflammation of my left
							eye has rather increased again, yesterday and last Night, and that of
							the right eye has continued and assumed a threatening appearance.— I had
							an uneasy and sleepless Night; but the day being fine, I sent early this
							Morning to <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cook</persRef>, requesting him to call here at ten O’Clock, and if
							he thought I could safely venture out, to go with me into London, to see
							and consult <persRef ref="travers-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript"

								type="ms"/>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Travers lives at N 8. New
							Broad Street in the City; upwards of ten miles distant from my house— As
							I had been eleven days confined to a warm chamber; and as the day was
							cold, I took my Russian furr’d surtout and Boots, which I found however
							too warm— We reached D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Travers’s house
							about one O’Clock— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook, and myself
							described to him the condition in which my eyes had been; and he saw the
							State in which they now are— He approved of the course of the treatment
							of them hitherto, but he told D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook that
							my complaint was not the Egyptian Opthalmia; though in some of the
							symptoms resembling it. He assured me that the disorder was altogether
							superficial, and the Vision in no sort of danger— He advised me to
							return for some days to a low diet, recommended the immediate
							application of leaches to the right eye, and also the use of a light
							poultice upon the eye-lid if <unclear>it</unclear> could bear it. He mentioned the
							composition of a wash for the left eye, of rose-water and a solution of
							alum, and asked me to call upon him again, when the inflammation should
							be dispersed, intimating that he might then supply me some permanent
							remedy, for the habitual disorder of the eyes with which I am afflicted.
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook left me there having some other
							visits to pay, before returning home— After he was gone, I expressed
							some reluctance to the application of leaches to my right eye; and upon
							what I said, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Travers, advised me to
							postpone the use of them for two or three days— He said he did not know
							how the inflammation could be dispersed without them, but possibly it
							might; and it could do no harm to wait a day or two and see if it would—
							The attack on that side, he said was not very vigorous, and that on the
							other had spent its force.— He told me that he was acquainted with
								<persRef ref="post-wright">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Post</persRef> of New-York, and with <persRef ref="post-jotham">his
								brother</persRef>— I left him about two O’Clock, and reached home by
							four— Not much fatigued, but rather refreshed by the exercise of the
							ride. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook came late in the Evening with
							the rose-water and alum wash; and with the leaches— He left them here,
							but upon my telling him what D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Travers had
							last said, consented to postpone the use of them for a day or two— He
							had walked the whole way home from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Travers’s house.— I found M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams much
							recovered from her yesterday’s and last Night’s illness— <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>
							sent me out last Evening, and I received this Morning a Card from the
							City Remembrancer, with an invitation from the Lord Mayor Elect
								(<persRef ref="wood-matthew">Wood</persRef>) to the great annual
							Entertainment, on the Lord Mayor’s day—next Thursday the 9<hi

								ref="decatur-stephen">Commodore Decatur</persRef>, had permitted

							charged to say to me that if it should be signified by me to be the wish
							of the Government of the United States, that a similar convenience
							should be afforded to the American Naval force, in the Mediterranean,
							Instructions to that effect should be given to the commanding Officers,
							both at Gibraltar and Malta. But <pb n="339" type="ms"/>if it should be

							Lieutenant Governor provisionally, and if I had no objection he might
							continue to act, until I could present his Commission here for
							approbation, as was required for all foreign Consuls at the British
							dependencies abroad, in the same manner as for those residing within the
							kingdom— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier that I would
							transmit as soon as possible to the Government of the United States,
							information of all these Circumstances— I had received no other
							knowledge than that which he now gave me of any of the incidents to
							which he had reference. I should no doubt receive Instructions with

							could have no objection to his being recognized in the manner proposed;
							though I had no official knowledge of his appointment.— I enquired for
								<persRef ref="fox-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>14. IX. </date>I returned this day for the first time since the
							attack upon my eyes into my library chamber, and attempted to read and
							write again— I first took up this Volume, and wrote the three lines at
							the bottom of page 328. I could write no more, for I found my eyes too
								<pb n="340" type="ms"/>weak to bear the exertion, and I must for
							some time longer forbear the use of the pen. Nor is the complaint in my
							eyes my only, or even my greatest difficulty— My hand has been also much

								<persRef ref="pio-peter">Pio</persRef> into town again for the

								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> with me.— The Coachman changed his
							horses— I was in town upwards of three hours, and so much engaged the
							whole time with visitors at the Office, that I had not leisure to read
							the Letters that I found there— The visitors were—A <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Thompson</persRef>, a sort of
							crazy woman, pretending to be an American, and to wish to go to America—
							She acknowledged that she had not been in America for thirty years, and
							that she was married to an Italian. She complained of having been
							excessively ill-treated by the <persRef ref="maury-james">American
								Consul</persRef> at Liverpool, by a Captain of some vessel who had
							engaged to take her to New-York, and then sailed without her, and by
							multitudes of other persons— Indeed of almost every body, English and
							American— She came to me, to demand that I should procure a passage for
							her to New-York— On being informed that this was not in my power, she
							railed at me, as much as she had at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Maury, and after talking perhaps half an hour, she went away— Sometime
							after she came again and asked for a Passport to go to America— She had
							and could produce no document whatever to shew herself to be an
							American— I therefore declined giving the Passport. She railed and raved
							again till she was tired, and went away—a few minutes after she returned
							a third time with a message from <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Capper</persRef> of the Alien-Office,
							recommending her to me for a Passport as a document upon which they
							might give her one, there— I still declined— At length M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Capper himself came, and again recommended
							to me to give her a Passport— I told him that the rule I had adopted to
							grant no Passport, but upon satisfactory evidence that the person asking
							it as an American was really such, had been for the sake of being sure
							not to trespass upon the prohibitory English Laws, and that if I
							departed from the principle in one instance, I should not know where to
							stop; and might unwarily give Passports to persons who were not
							permitted to go out of the kingdom. He then asked me, if he should send
							the woman to me again, but I told him it would be to no purpose.— She
							did not again return. The next visitor was <persRef
								ref="bennett-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bennett</persRef>, from Alexandria— His business here is to
							endeavour to obtain from the British Government, compensation for the
							property plundered from him, and from other inhabitants of that place,
							by the British Officers, on their expedition against it, in August
							1814.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bennett wished for the aid of my
							official interposition, but I was convinced, and told him that if I
							should at all interfere in the case it would operate against his
							application rather than for it. I recommended him to <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray</persRef>, the Solicitor,
							to draw up a Memorial for him to the Lords of the Treasury, who perhaps
							if applied to upon grounds clear of all diplomatic claims, might
							possibly be disposed to do justice to the sufferers. I promised him
							however to give him every assistance in my power, if any opportunity
							should occur, in which I could promote the object of his claim. He was
							scarcely gone, when <persRef ref="hughes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef>, the young Gentleman
							who is to go out as private Secretary to <persRef ref="bagot-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> came in— He told
							me that they should certainly not sail before Christmas, and probably
							not before the month of January.— The reason now assigned for the delay
							is that they cannot man the frigate, the Niger; which is appointed to
							take them to America— He says that one of the Lieutenants was here last
							week, and said that they had not obtained thirty men in six weeks— But
							he said there were other Captains who had declared that their whole
							crews had offered voluntarily to enter, and there were many who could
							answer for two thirds. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes said that
							both M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef ref="bagot-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot</persRef> were very anxious and
							impatient to be gone, and spoke of the delay as a great disappointment
							to him— The other visits were from <persRef ref="shaw-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw</persRef>, of South Carolina, and
								<persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Joy</persRef>, who came with <persRef ref="allston-washington">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alston</persRef> the Painter— The last
							time that I had seen this Gentleman, was at his painting room in Boston,
							seven or eight years since. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy gave me
							some late American Newspapers. The Letters that I received were from
								<persRef ref="fox-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s Letter as usual is full of

								>r</hi> Bourne’s is, to consult me, concerning the education of
								<persRef ref="bourne-george">his eldest Son</persRef>, whom he

							walked from the Kensington gate to the Office 2 1/2 miles, and returning
							home, from the fourth milestone to my house 3 3/4 miles. I brought out a

							found the Books all very damp, and in danger of moulding, but as few of
							them actually injured as could have been expected. They employed
								<persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef> and myself during the
							remainder of the day-light— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> came home from school to dinner and returned in
							the Evening. <persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grubb</persRef> sent me out a Packet, containing a Letter from
								<persRef ref="decatur-stephen">Commodore Decatur</persRef>, dated,
							Bay of Tunis 31. July and containing an account of his Transactions
							there, and at Tripoli; with copies of his Letters to the Prime Minister
							of the <persRef ref="chakarbey-mohammed">Bey</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="qaramanli-yusuf">Bashaw</persRef>— There was enclosed a similar
							despatch addressed to <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>, as the Minister of
							the United States at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg. They
							were both cut through and through in two places, as are almost all the
							Letters coming from Barbary, I suppose by some quarantine regulation—
							George made up the loss of his yesterdays reading by a double portion
							this day. This Evening <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> finished reading to
							me the novel, or romance of <persRef ref="guymannering">Guy
								Mannering</persRef>, or the Astrologer—professedly a picture of
							Scottish manners, Society and characters, about thirty years ago—the
							time is during the war of the American Revolution. The Story is in a
							very high degree interesting— The characters, universally coloured
							beyond Nature, but drawn with a masterly hand, deeply shaded, and well
							preserved, throughout— The gypsey and the smuggler are sublime
							absurdities— The proportion of tragic incidents is too great. There is
							no useful moral that I can discern to be gathered either from the
							general tenor of the Story, and the purest models of virtue in the work,
							are the gypsey hag, covered with infamy, and a sort of literary Caliban,
							covered with ridicule— The best secondary characters are a
							noble-spirited Scotch farmer given to drink; and a waggish Scotch lawyer
							given to wine— The worst feature of the book is its tendency to
							countenance superstition— Mannering is a Gentleman educated in the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> century at an English University, who
							yet studies astrology— He casts a nativity at the birth of a child; it
							portends the strangest events, all of which come to pass— The old gypsey
							too is a perpetual oracle, and always a true prophetess— The Castle of
							Otranto was all the original of all these mixtures of antient
							superstitions with modern manners, and none of them that I have seen is
							more amusing or less instructive than Guy Mannering— The author’s name
							is not given, but it is generally attributed to <persRef
								ref="scott-walter">Walter Scott</persRef>.</p>

								Alexander Baring’s</persRef> house to enquire, whether he had

								Chester</persRef> the Master of the Ceremonies and left a Card—
							Called at the <persRef ref="freire-cipriano">Portuguese

							him by the Post, and proceeded down to Bishopsgate Street, within Number
							8. where I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander Baring. He
							returned only three or four days since from France, and shewed me
							Letters which he had received last Saturday from <persRef
								ref="dallas-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dallas</persRef>, the Secretary of the Treasury— They announced to
							him a remittance of £130,000 Sterling, and requested the house to make a
							remittance of 750,000 florins to the Bankers of the United States at
							Amsterdam. He said they had already written to Amsterdam, authorizing
							the <persRef ref="willinkfirm">Willink’s</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanstaphorstfirm">Van Staphorst’s</persRef> to draw upon them
							to the amount of the sum mentioned by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dallas. I was much rejoiced to find that this large remittance had been
							so seasonably made from America, and told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baring that my principal motive for calling upon him now, was to ask him
							if his house could with convenience supply funds to the amount of
							fifteen or twenty thousand pounds Sterling, for the discharge of Bills,
							drawn by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call navy Agent of the United
							States at Gibraltar, upon Glennie, Son &amp; C<hi rend="superscript"
								>o</hi> here, beyond the remittances which that house had received
							from the Navy Department— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring said
							they would very readily furnish the funds to take up these bills, at my
							request— All they wanted in such cases was authority— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call had written to them, requesting
							them to take up these Bills, if Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Glennie, should decline so to do, but there had some time ago, been an
							Instruction from the Treasury Department directing that no payments of
							this kind, relating to the expenditures on account of seamen should be
							made, unless authorized by a Minister of the United States. If therefore
							I would write a line to the house requesting them to provide for the <pb
								n="344" type="ms"/>payment of the Bills, it should immediately be
							done— I told him that I would see the Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Glennie, and consult with them, upon the most convenient manner of doing
							the business, and then write the letter, as he desired. I had some
							further conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring upon his
							late tour to the Continent which he extended farther than he had
							intended—he went not only to France, and Switzerland; but into part of
							Germany and Italy— He left <persRef ref="baring-william;baring-francis"
								>his two Sons</persRef> at Geneva—at School— I enquired of him how
							he liked the institutions for education there— He said they were very
							good for the Mathematics, Natural and experimental Philosophy, and the
							French language; but for classical learning, the Latin and Greek, not
							equal to the Schools of this Country.— He had seen <persRef
								ref="stael-anne">Madame de Stael</persRef>, at Copet— She is now
							gone, he says, or going to Rome, and perhaps to Jerusalem.— The project
							of marriage between <persRef ref="destaelholstein-albertine">her

								Broglie</persRef>, is resumed— As for <persRef
								ref="destaelholstein-ludwig">her Son</persRef> she says he is “Bête,
							comme son Pere”— I went from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring to
							the Counting house of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Glennie.
							Neither of those Gentlemen, <persRef ref="glennie-alexander"
								>father</persRef> or <persRef ref="glennie-james">Son</persRef> was
							there—but I saw <persRef ref="fry-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fry</persRef>, their partner— He gave me a statement of
							all the drafts upon them by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call,
							beyond the remittances received by them from the Navy Department— It
							amounted, not as they had written me, to £17000, but to £12800— I then
							told him that the Bills would be taken up, by the house of the Baring’s,
							who would either accept the Bills, or supply the funds upon which they,
							the Glennie’s would accept them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry
							appeared to think that the conduct of his house needed some apology, but
							he made it aukwardly. He said the Navy Department had remitted only
							£15000 for the wants of the Squadron in the Mediterranean— That a
							remittance of £15000 for such an object was ridiculous. That £10,000 of
							it had been expended in repairs upon one of the Ships, of damages
							sustained in the action with the Algerines—or perhaps upon the Algerine
							prize carried into Carthagena. That they had been many years agents of
							the Navy Department; that during the War between the United States and
							Tripoli, or when there was about that time a large American Squadron in
							the Mediterranean, they had been for sometime in advance to the amount
							of at least £20,000 Sterling. That the money had been afterwards paid
							them it was true; but that the American Government had never so much as
							said to them “thank you,” for it— That <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving</persRef> was at that time the
							American Consul, and agent for various purposes— He had a large sum of
							public money at his disposal; and had proposed to them to pay that
							balance, with this money, and then draw Bills upon the <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, at 3
							shillings for the Dollar, the exchange to be for his own benefit— They
							had told him that as the money with which he would pay them belonged to
							the United States, the benefit of the exchange ought to be for the
							public and not for his private interest— And he had drawn accordingly;
							so that by their means the United States had lost nothing upon the
							Exchange.— They had always been careful for the interests of the United
							States; but they had never received any thanks for it, and had no
							encouragement to make advances for them. I did not chuse to enter into a
							discussion with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry, but took the minute
							which he made out of the balance due to discharge M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call’s Bills, and told him that Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Baring would arrange with them the
							manner of taking them up.— As <persRef ref="travers-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Travers</persRef> the oculist, lives
							in the same Street, with the Glennie’s, I called at his house, with the
							intention of consulting him again about my eyes; but he was not at home—
							I then went to the Office in Charles Street, but it was near four
							O’Clock when I reached there— <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l:</hi> Aspinwall</persRef> and <persRef

								ref="shaw-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw</persRef>
							came to take leave. He is to embark for Charleston to-morrow. The vessel
							in which he has taken passage was seized; but by the interest of
								<persRef ref="lowther-william">Lord Lowther</persRef> he obtained
							her release— I went to the foreign Office to inform <persRef
								ref="morier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier</persRef> or
								<persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>, that I should come with Col<hi

							at <persRef ref="u">Walker’s</persRef> Hotel in Bridge Street, and saw
							him, <persRef ref="aspinwall-louisa">his Lady</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="stewart-josephus">Captain Stuart</persRef>, whom he introduced
							to me as his Secretary. The Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> gave me
							two Letters from <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and
							Captain Stuart a Letter of introduction from <persRef
								ref="dexter-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sam<hi
									rend="superscript">l:</hi> Dexter</persRef> of Boston. Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi> Aspinwall has only the Commission as
							Consul for the Port of London, without that of Agent for Seamen, which
							had a Salary annexed to it— Upon the single Commission of Consul he must
							very soon starve. I told him I heard he had contemplated a commercial
							establishment, as subsidiary to his Office; he said he should perhaps be
							forced to resort to it as a resource, but that he had neither education
							nor experience as a merchant, nor relish for the business— He said he
							had been much deceived in his anticipations respecting the profits of
							the Consulate, until a very few days before he had embarked at Boston,
							when he had heard that they were inconsiderable— I mentioned M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb to the Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l:</hi> as having been formerly under <persRef ref="lyman-william2"
								>General Lyman</persRef> a Clerk in the Consular Office, and a
							person whom I could strongly recommend to him for a similar situation.
							He said that his friend Captain Stuart had come out with him as his
							Secretary, and it was doubtful whether he could afford the expence of
							employing another person; but if he could, he would certainly employ
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb. I had received at the Office a

									>r</hi> Ingraham</persRef>, soliciting my good-offices to

							informed that <persRef ref="hawker-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawker</persRef> was seeking recommendations to the Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi>— I mentioned to him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingraham’s situation, and the
							circumstances relating to it; but the Commission of Consul at the Port
							of London, does not include Plymouth within the extent of its authority;
							and the Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> could of course not interfere
							in the affair— He said he had received also a Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingraham, and one from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawker, who had sent him several
							certificates of recommendation, from persons, only one of whom was known
							to him—and that was <persRef ref="perkins-thomas">M<hi

							who however respectable his character might be, would probably not have
							much influence with the Government of the United States, having taken so
							de<unclear>cid</unclear>ed a part in the affair of the Hartford Convention.— He had also
							been informed that at the time of the captures of American Vessels,
							under the orders in Council, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawker had
							sometimes been the agent both of the captors and of the captured; which
							shewed his unfitness for the Office of American Consul— But the Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi> said he had determined not to interfere
							at all, in regard to the Consulate at Plymouth— He went with me to the
							foreign Office, where I presented him to the two Under-Secretaries of
							State, Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Morier and Hamilton. He gave
							his Commission to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier, to obtain the

							and dine with him, but I was expected at home, and immediately returned—
							I walked from the Hammersmith Turnpike into town, and from the fourth
							mile-stone home— While I was at the Office, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Grubb had written a Letter, which I dictated, to <persRef

								Jackson</persRef>, our Chargé d’Affaires at Paris, enclosing a copy
							of an Official Note from him to the <persRef ref="richelieu-armand">Duke

								<persRef ref="fenwick-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							The minutes for my Journal, and the Letter to <persRef

							at table, between Lord Melville and Baron Jacobi, with both of whom I
							had various conversation. Lord Melville, asked me several questions,
							respecting the American Squadron which has been at Gibraltar— He is the
							first Lord of the Admiralty, and has doubtless received particular
							information concerning it— There was much more general Conversation than
							is usual at such parties, and it very much enlivened the company— The
							topics were indeed not very important— Pedestrianism, Boxing,
							Cock-fighting, and a sort of historical commentary upon the house in
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vansittart resides and all the
							houses in the neighbourhood, from <persRef ref="charles-ii">Charles the

							Gwynn</persRef>, down to <persRef ref="walpole-robert">Sir Robert
								Walpole</persRef>— It was on the whole amusing, and there was much
							social good humour and conviviality. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Vansittart mentioned after dinner, that there was now here an American,
							named Edwards, but Lord Tyrconnel said it was <persRef
								ref="adams-robert">Adams</persRef>, who had been at Tombuctoo, and
							remained there several Months. He said it was a City about as large as
							Lisbon— He had brought nothing certain respecting <persRef

							tending <pb n="347" type="ms"/>to confirm the account of his Death. It
							was near eleven when the Company left M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Vansittart’s, and I returned to pass the Night at Charles Street. The
							Condition of my eyes still requires caution and a degree of
							abstemiousness, not easy to observe at such entertainments as these. I
							had also the further admonition, of a Cold which has been coming upon me
							these three days. I was as careful, and suffered as little inconvenience
							from the party as I could have expected.</p>

							pawn some fine table linen to me, for a sum of money, under the

							for the payment, as any <hi rend="italic">liberal</hi> government in her

							payment of the public balance due to them; and manifests great concern
							at their having then received no remittances from the Treasury of the
							United States.— This Letter I am happily enabled to answer without
							difficulty. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams finished reading
							Waverly, or ’tis sixty years since, to me, this Evening— This is a novel
							by the same author as <persRef ref="guymannering">Guy
								Mannering</persRef>, and was published before it— In the same style,
							but not of equal merit— The Scenery is again in Scotland, but the time
							is thirty years sooner, and at the period of the rebellion of 1745.
							<persRef ref="charlesedwardstuart">Prince Charles Edward</persRef> is one of the principal characters in it, and most
							of the characters excepting <persRef ref="siredwardwaverley"
								>Waverly</persRef> himself are Scotch. The hero, is a weak and
							wavering personage, who is drawn into rebellion by untoward
							circumstances, and a want of steady principles. The moral to be
							collected from it is therefore more dear and important than that of the
							Astrologer— And the fable is well constructed for the deduction of the
							moral from the action. It is doubtful whether firmness can be given to
							weak minds by any instructions, yet it must be useful to expose the
							fatal consequences that may flow from instability— It is however
							difficult to take any interest in the adventures of so feeble and
							irresolute a hero as Waverly, and the interest of this Story is
							accordingly heavy and languishing through the first and second Volumes—
							The third is better— Charles Edward is a paragon of perfection— <persRef
								ref="fergusmacivor">Fergus M’Ivor</persRef> and his Sister <persRef
								ref="floramacivor">Flora</persRef>, are Jacobite fanatics, with all
							the sublimity of Treason upon principle— Fergus finishes upon a gibbet,
							and Flora in a french Nunnery. There is one burlesque character a
							military, classical and genealogical Pedant, a Traitor from fidelity,
							but who like Waverly is pardoned for his insignificancy.— There is some
							food for Superstition—Second Sight, and an Apparition—introduced however
							only in narration. On the whole, both the books are far above the
							ordinary Class of Novels.</p>

						<p><date>27. VI. </date>As I find myself gradually, though very slowly
							recovering from the disease with which I have been afflicted, I am
							endeavouring to resume as soon as possible the industrious habits of my
							life, which it has interrupted— I rose this Morning at six O’Clock, and
							heard <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef> read by candle-light—
							When he had finished it was not yet clear day-light, and as I could then
							neither read nor write, I walked with him <pb n="348" type="ms"/>as far
							as his school, and then continued my walk, round through Ealing, Hanwell
							and Brentford, about six Miles when I returned home to Breakfast.— When
							I got back, I found at the house a printed Notification from a Constable
							requiring me, with in two days, to prepare and produce a list in writing
							of the names of every man residing in my house between the ages of 18
							and 45, to sign the list with my own name, and deliver the same to the
							Constable, upon a penalty of ten Pounds— The Boy who brought this
							Notification had left it, saying that he would call for the answer
							to-morrow— After Breakfast <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> finished writing the
							Letter to <persRef ref="bourne-sylvanus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Secretary of State</persRef>. We all dined at <persRef

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Von Harten’s <persRef ref="u">two
								daughters</persRef> from New-York, and is to return shortly to the
							United States.— We had musick and singing after dinner— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Morison and her party of Ladies went away
							at 9 O’Clock, to attend a rout at Richmond: we came home between 11 and
							12. I was too unwell with a cold, as well as with the remaining
							inflammation and weakness of my left eye to enjoy fully the
							entertainment.— George’s cough was also very bad. D<hi

								ref="nicholas-francis">Frank</persRef>, and his two eldest daughters
								<persRef ref="nicholas-caroline">Caroline</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="nicholas-ellen">Ellen</persRef>, dined with us—the two younger
							daughters, <persRef ref="nicholas-charlotte">Charlotte</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="nicholas-laura">Laura</persRef> came in after dinner—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray gave me an invitation to join a
							small monthly club which these gentlemen are forming to dine together at
							an Inn, opposite to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas’s school;
							where they are building an Assembly or Ball-Room. This club formerly
							subsisted, but was broken up, and they are now proposing to revive it—
							Last Saturday they had their first meeting and were only four— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray said the object of this Club at every
							meeting was to agree upon the day when they should meet again— They had
							agreed last Saturday that the next meeting should be on Friday the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of next Month and Major Morison, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Von Harten and myself were now invited to
							join them, which we all promised to do.— I received under a cover from
								<persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>, the Gazette
							Extraordinary of the 23<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> instant,
							announcing the Conclusion of the Peace with France— The Treaties and
							Conventions were signed on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							instant, by <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>
							and the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef>
							for this Country, and by the <persRef ref="richelieu-armand">Duke de
								Richelieu</persRef> for the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">king of
								France</persRef>. This Evening, the Public Offices in London, were
							illuminated for it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Copland told us that
							he had been to town; and found they were preparing to illuminate his
							house in Great George Street, Westminster.</p>

						<p><date>28. VIII— </date>The lateness of the hour at which we returned from

								Hammett</persRef>, the Consul at Dublin wrote me, I wished to see
							one of the Under Secretaries of State in the foreign Office, and

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton</persRef> was there—

							nevertheless entertains hopes of recovering indemnity for it, because
								<persRef ref="cockburn-george">Admiral Cockburn</persRef>, had
							promised that their private property should not be taken, if they made

						<p><date>29. VI— </date>Rose again and heard <persRef key="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> read by candle light— The morning was fine, and
							from the windows of my library we saw the moon, at the last day of her

							11 O’Clock to-morrow Evening. We also saw Venus and Jupiter, both

						<p><date>30. VII. </date>It was so late that I could not hear <persRef
								key="adams-george">George</persRef> read until after he returned
							from School— I made the second attempt to resume the writing of my
							Journal in this book, from the minutes kept from day to day by <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>. My left eye is yet
							slightly inflamed, and both my eyes are very weak—particularly towards
							the Evening, and by candle-light— I now wash them every morning with
							Brandy and Water—substituted since last Monday instead of the Collyrium
							of Rose-water and alum— My right hand is also yet so unsteady that I
							write with extreme difficulty. I got through only half a page this
							morning. I made up and enclosed to <persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef> the Letters yesterday
							written, and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams this day wrote for me

							and to <persRef ref="spafford-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							sent me out a Letter from <persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley</persRef>, in answer to the
							application which I had directed to be made to him in behalf of <persRef
								ref="cromwell-oliver2">Oliver Cromwell</persRef>, the Sailor— Soon
							after returning from my walk round through Hanwell and Ealing, I had a
							visit from a <persRef ref="derode-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Frederick de Rode</persRef>, who had already been here
							while I was out— He announced himself to the Servants as a Count, and
							had two crosses of military orders of knighthood at his button-hole. He
							had been at the Office in Charles Street, and expressed such a vehement
							urgency to see me, this very day, to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Grubb, that he gave him the direction to my house— I received him in the
							drawing room, and as he intimated a wish to have a few words of
							conversation with me alone, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
							immediately withdrew. He was young—not more than twenty—handsome in
							person and with quite a gentleman’s deportment— He wanted to go to
							America—to enter the military service of the United States— He said he
							was in the last Stage of desperation— A Saxon by Birth; the Son of a
							Conseiller intime of the king of Saxony. That two years since, ambitious
							to contribute his aid to what he considered a good cause, he had entered
							the Russian Service. He had made the two last Campaigns with
							distinction, and obtained rank and honours certainly beyond what he
							could have expected. He was now a Captain of Hussars, and had been among
							the allied troops who entered France last Summer— But he had suffered
							himself heedlessly to be drawn into play— He had lost every thing he had
							in the world; not only every thing he possessed, but he had given
							assignations upon all his Estates at home. He was totally ruined— And
							the consequence of his gaming had been a duel— He wished to fly from
							Europe forever—he could not live there without honour—North-America,
							South America—India—any where, to be at the greatest possible distance
							from Europe. He would have preferred South-America, because there was
							War there, and he should hope to be rendering some Service to a good
							cause— But he knew not to whom to apply, to enable him to get there— I
							asked him which side he considered the good cause in that Country to be—
							He said that of the Independents. I told him that as the Government of
							the United States had just been reducing their army from sixty to ten
							thousand men, they had been obliged to discharge great numbers of native
							meritorious Officers, and there could be no chance for a foreigner to
							obtain a Commission. That even if it were possible, as the Country was
							at peace, there was neither profit nor glory to be anticipated in the
							military service for the present. That if he was irrevocably determined
							to leave Europe, I should think the British Service in India, was the
							best of his three projects, and asked him if he had any source of
							influence through which he could obtain a Commission there— He said that
							the <persRef ref="ernest-augustus;frederica-sophia">Duke and Duchess of
								Cumberland</persRef> were acquainted with his family, and as for his
							military he could have the most unexceptionable testimonials; but he
							felt an invincible repugnance to make application to the Prince— He saw
							clearly from what I had said, that there would be no chance for him in
							North-America; and how to get to South America he did not know.— I gave
							him the name and residence of <persRef ref="delreal-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Del Real</persRef>, who I told him
							might have it in his power to put him in the way— But I advised him
							above all to reconsider his projects— To remember that a Soldier, above
							all men, ought never to despair— That he should endeavour to calm the
							agitation of his mind, and rather resort to his father and his natural
							friends than fly to other worlds— He appeared inflexibly determined
							against all this, and intimated that he would sooner take to the road
							(but no, he would <pb n="350" type="ms"/>never do that) or put a period
							to his own existence than return to his own Country. I asked him if he
							had <hi rend="italic">left</hi> the Russian Service— He said not
							absolutely— He had come away from France about three weeks since— He was
							unwilling to mention particulars, as consciousness of wrong always is—
							He had evidently fled and escaped from France, and deserted from the
							duty of his Regiment. He at length took M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Del Real’s name and address, and left me, with a request that I would
							keep his secret, so as not to expose him— I heard from our Servants that
							he did not immediately return to London, but went to the Plough Inn, and
							there dismissed his Carriage— M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams and
