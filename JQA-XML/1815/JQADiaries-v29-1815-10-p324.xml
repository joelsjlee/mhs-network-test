						<p><date>10. V. </date>As the Clock struck I left my bed— I am half an hour

								>George</persRef>— At six he began his French reading, which takes
							from half to three quarters of an hour— He has a mile to walk to School,
							and must be there at seven O’Clock. After writing a Letter to <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> at Stockholm, I called and paid a visit to
								<persRef ref="dumouriez-charles">General Dumouriez</persRef>. He
							began by asking me, if we were quarreling again with England, and asked
							what they meant by their proceedings with the Creek Indians— I said that
							one of their officers had been endeavouring to make mischief, by a
							pretended Treaty offensive and defensive with the Creek Indians; but
							that the Government here had disavowed his conduct to me— He asked if it
							was not such a disavoval, as that of 1755— I said that was what I could
							not tell— He thought we should not be long without another War with
							England; and that there would soon be a separation of the United States.
							As our population increased he said, with such an immense territory, it
							would be too large for one Government— I said that as our Government is
							federative, I did not see any necessity for a separation, which would be
							so contrary to the interests of us all. He said that mankind seldom
							pursued the system of their interest, and he thought our Union could not
							hold together long. He also thought we should soon be encroaching upon
							the Mines of New Mexico; and asked something about our establishment on
							the Columbia River. He spoke also of Canada, and the danger of the
							British possessions in North America, by their vicinity to the United
							States— Of the fur trade, and the diminution of the Indian hunting
							grounds. On all these Subjects he had some information; but it was all
							partial, and such as he had apparently imbibed from those with whom he
							converses concerning them here. In combating his prejudices, I did not
							expect to alter his opinions; nor would it that I know, have been of any
							use if it had— He passed to the subject of France, where he said every
							thing was dark and gloomy— He read me an extract of a Letter which he
							said he had just received, and which was from the Government here. It
							spoke of the Treaty of Peace just concluded between the allies and
							France— Mentioned the Conditions much as they are stated in the
							Newspapers. But it appeared that he had advised the taking of Calais and
							Dunkirk, by the English— The answer said that they had avoided asking
							for those places, for fear of exciting too much jealousy, but they were
							to have Ostend, and would fortify it so as to make it very strong— The
							General read to me also a Letter from the <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef> which he
							received a few days since—dated the 26<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of
							Sept: and he gave me the copy of his answer to it, dated 4. October, and
							written on the blank pages of the second sheet of the Duke’s letter—
							That was itself an answer to a previous Letter from Dumouriez, in which
							as he said he had reproached the Duke for the appointment of <persRef
								ref="fouche-joseph">Fouché</persRef>, as Minister to the <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">king of France</persRef>— The Duke says, that in
							prevailing upon the king to take Fouché, he had followed the opinions of
							all the allies who considered it as indispensably necessary. That when
							the allied armies advanced into France, the French Army, which still
							existed and a great part of the Nation were absolutely against the king—
							That four provinces were in open rebellion, and most of the rest,
							including the City of Paris, extremely cold.— That the allies themselves
							were more than indifferent about the Bourbons, and Prussia in particular
							absolutely adverse to their restoration— That the employment of Fouché
							neutralized a very great party against the king, and gained over great
							numbers to the royal Cause— That if he had not been employed, a great
							and terrible convulsion would have ensued. (Dumouriez said, il se trompe
							beaucoup là.) That Fouché might perhaps have done many <pb n="327"
								type="ms"/>bad things, but not one half so many as his slanders laid
							to his charge— That he believed the king was satisfied with Fouché, but
							the Courtiers that <hi rend="italic">vile</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
								>useless</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">pernicious</hi> tribe, (Oh!
							pour cela said Dumouriez, il a bien raison) after the crisis was over,
							had besieged the king, and finally prevailed upon his too yielding
							temper.— That it was the party of the Princes which had consummated the
							mischief, and particularly the <persRef ref="marietheresecharlotte"
								>Duchess of Angouleme</persRef>, who having arrived after the danger
							was over, could not be perswaded that it had existed.— (That Duchess of
							Angouleme said Dumouriez, nothing can beat it out of her head, that
							France is to be governed, comme au tems de S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Louis.) She, continued Wellington’s Letter, persuaded the
							king to the injudicious step of changing his Ministry, and I am sorry to
							add, says the Letter, in that transaction, the king treated with
							“mauvaise foi,” not only his own Ministry, but the allies by whom he had
							been restored to his throne— Eh bien, said Dumouriez after reading the
							Letter; you see that does not look like quiet times— Vous voyez que les
							termes ne sont pas menagéz là— Now read my answer—and he put it into my
							hands. The answer was full of flattering Compliments to the Duke, upon
							the wisdom of the course he had pursued; with great applause upon his
							invective against the Courtiers, and regrets that they had prevailed
							upon the bon Roi, to change the Ministry which the Duke in his wisdom
							had given him— (This is characteristic—for the Sentiments were
							diametrically opposite to those that the writer had just expressed to me
							in Conversation.) It proceeded to say, that what they were doing would
							certainly not finish the affairs of France— That there was a great and
							very unfounded expectation in public from the approaching assembly of
							the Legislative chambers— That they would begin with an apparent
							unanimity, and that very unanimity would be the greatest of deceptions.
							That upon some occasion, debates would very soon arise in which the
							metals would separate and they would be then found to be of the most
							discordant materials— That a reaction would sooner or later take place,
							which would oblige him the Duke to put on the harness again, as well as
							his venerable companion in arms (<persRef ref="vonblucher-gebhard"
								>Blucher</persRef>) and which would throw Europe again into a flame.
							That he wished the Duke, before Winter, would take care to get into his
							hands eight or ten fortresses, which he names—and among them, and most
							especially Calais and Dunkirk— So that in case of a new convulsion,
							forty or fifty thousand English families now in France might have places
							of refuge into which they could retire.— I told Dumouriez I did not
							think there was any danger like that— He said that the French Nation
							would need the greatest and most persevering patience— They were now
							suffering other nations to cut their nails, and draw their teeth, and
							were obliged to see it in quiet— It was necessary to wait until these

							Russia— He had been governor of Odessa, with perhaps sixty thousand
							Souls under him, and two thirds of them slaves— That it was said he had
							been a good Governor of a Province in a despotism; but to make him prime
							Minister of France, seemed to him like saying to a man, Sir, I have seen
							a very good Song, of your writing, have the goodness to write me a
							Tragedy— He said that he had many other Letters from France, and all
							painted the state of things in the most gloomy colours— As his dining
							hour was come I took leave of him, and he shewed me his library, where
							he has a good collection of Books— From his house I took a walk round
							through Acton, the Uxbridge road, and Ealing, home.— In the Evening I

								ref="dickasonandnevitt">Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Dickason

							thought that the Ambassador could do nothing without Orders from his
							Court— I then asked if upon an application from me, he would write to
							his Court, and ask for orders—he said without doubt— I therefore left
							the Spanish Papers with him, and am to write a Note to the Ambassador—
							He told me that <persRef ref="brown-margaret">Miss Margaret

							her— She was now with her Sister <persRef ref="brown-fanny">M<hi

							with him; and we might have been there before half-past two— But he
							thought it would be too late, the Lord Mayor having told him that he
							should be engaged elsewhere immediately after two. M<hi

							appointment of another day, and this day came out to inform me that the

							to request the Lord Mayor to receive us entirely without ceremony, as I

							the Painter— He is absent from town, at the isle of Wight, and not

							to sign, assuring his Lordship in the most positive terms that the two

							I hoped both he and Lord Lowther had understood me as expressly stating
							that the legality of the Conveyance could be established only by a
							decision in the judicial Courts— That none such had to my knowledge
							taken place; and I could not presume to say what it would be— That it
							would only lead Lord Lowther into an error, if I should express an
							opinion that the conveyance was complete and legal, and he should rely
							upon it— I returned home about half past six in the Evening.— <persRef

							has been consequently still more obstructed— Yesterday the eye was often
							washed with warm milk and water, and a small syringe was used to wash
							the Ball— This was found too powerful for the eye in its present state
							to bear— This day it has been frequently bathed with a small spunge, and
							the eye-lashes frequently anointed with lard, by a camels hair brush
							passed over them— This enabled me to keep the eye open as much as the

							under my left ear— The Doctor, who has found that the <hi rend="italic"
								>Cornea</hi>, of the eye has not been affected, and that the Ball is
							less blood shod, since the application of the leaches, has better hopes
							than before; while my own concern is this day greater than it had yet
							been. The chamber was kept all day as dark as could be; to see to move
							in it. My eye could not endure the feeblest gleam of light— The blister
							took but slight effect; and was almost imperceptible to me, owing to the
							extremity of pain in the eye— The <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2;adams-george">children</persRef> came home from
							School— <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> very unwell with a
							slow fever. In the Evening before I went to bed the watery discharge
							from my eye seemed to be more free than it had been before— I went to
							bed about eight in the Evening, and the pain soon after became so
							violent, that I was nearly delirious— It seemed to me as if four hooks,
							were tearing that side of my face into four quarters— After being about
							an hour in that state, the pain abated considerably; the watery humour,
							dropped freely and continually from the eye; the extreme swelling
							apparently subsided; and I could perceptibly open the eye wider than I
							had been able for two days— One abscess had found an opening at the
							corner of the eye-lid next the nose, and a thick purulent matter oozed
							out slowly from it— Nothing this day from <persRef ref="grubb-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>— I received two
							Letters— One from <persRef ref="shaw-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Shaw</persRef> of South-Carolina dated N. 3. S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Albans Street, informing me that he has
							concluded not to go to Liverpool; but to sail for Charleston, from
							London. The other from a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll</persRef>, for
							whom I forwarded last Sumer a Letter to <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph"
								>J. Ingersoll</persRef> of Philadelphia. He writes to enquire if I
							have received an answer.</p>

							I rose about ten O’Clock this morning; and as the swelling and

							Chamber, into my wife’s dressing Room, where a fire was made and which
							was completely darkened.— My greatest evil here, now was the tediousness
							of the time, as I could not bear even light enough to hear reading to

							and my eye frequently sponged and penciled, and took from four hours to
							four hours, the <persRef ref="u">Doctor’s</persRef> draughts, and thus
							waded through the day— It was now that I knew how to estimate the
							blessing of eye-sight, and the wretchedness of being bereft of it— Now
							too I had occasion for the tribute of gratitude to the gracious being,
							who in this trial has mercifully preserved my Vision— We sent the

								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>,
							whom I wanted to answer some of the Letters lately received, which admit

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The first half of the Month I
							rose generally about five— It was then still daylight by the time when I
							had roused up <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>— He read to
							me five chapters of the Bible; and I one chapter to him— The French
							Bible of <persRef ref="desacy-louis">Saci</persRef>; comparing it, with
							the Greek New Testament, and afterwards with the Latin Vulgate Old
							Testament. George then went to school, and I wrote in this Journal, and
							read the newspapers until about ten when we breakfasted— From eleven
							till four or half past four, I wrote Letters, or read except when I went
							into town—which was about twice a week. From four to six was my time for
							walking— At six we dined— I passed an hour or two in my chamber after
							dinner, again reading or writing. Then an hour with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and George, who
							returns every Evening from school— And about ten in the Evening was the
							hour of my retiring to bed— The greatest part of my time was thus
							devoted to writing, which a great and increasing Correspondence rendered
							necessary, but which by the will of Heaven had become very painful and
							difficult to me— My Life however was industrious, and was almost
							incessantly occupied with the discharge of my duties. All this system
							however was disconcerted, and for the time destroyed, by the accident
							which befell me on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month.
							My right hand was wounded, and for ten days I could not write— I
							dedicated all my time to reading and brought on the inflammation in my
							eyes which has nearly made me blind—for the last week reading and
							writing have both been out of the question— A Sick chamber, and great
							part of the time a sick bed have been my lot. My only occupation has
							been to suffer—to seek for remedies, and to pray for recovery or for
							resignation— I humbly hope at the end of the next Month, to have a more
							cheering account to give.</p>
