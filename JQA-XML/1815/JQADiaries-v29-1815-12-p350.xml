						<p><date>1. VI: </date>After hearing <persRef key="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> read this morning, I took up this book again, and
							finished writing page 329. It was all that I could accomplish before
							Breakfast, and I find the difficulty of writing yet very great— After
							Breakfast <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> wrote as I dictated, a Letter to the
								<persRef ref="dallas-alexander">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							concerning the affair of <persRef ref="mccall-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call’s</persRef> Bills on account of
							the Navy Department, and a Letter to <persRef ref="smith-isaac">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac Smith</persRef> of Boston, in
							answer to that which he had written me by the late <persRef
								ref="cary-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary</persRef>. I
							had a second visit from the inventing geniuses <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Service</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Studley</persRef>— They now
							brought out three printed Projects 1. Prospectus of a Bill, intended to
							be submitted to Parliament, for a National Institution, to ameliorate
							the Condition of the Poor; abolish the Poor Rates, &amp;c. &amp;c. 2.
							Prospectus for the Establishment of a Coal light Company. 3. The Dry Rot
							in Buildings, effectually cured, and its return prevented— And eight
							written proposals for other improvements moral, political and physical.
							1. A new and improved system for preparing Flax and Hemp. 2. A new
							method for bleaching Cotton Canvas and all vegetable substance 3. Method
							for preparing and using Gas, and all its products. 4. Improved wind
							power for driving <hi rend="italic">Machenery</hi>. 5. New and improved
							Paper Mill. 6. New and improved Ordnance for Sea and Land Service. 7.
							Proposals for introducing a new System of <hi rend="italic"
								>Education</hi>. 8. Proposals for working Mines in America— I
							observed to them that the Iron pavement was omitted. They said that they
							had not put that down, and there were many others which if they once got
							settled in America, and found encouragement, they should be able to
							introduce, to the great benefit of the Country. I asked them if they
							proposed to take out a patent for their system of Education?— No— They
							had put down, improvements of various kinds, which it would be in their
							power to introduce, but they did not expect patents for them all.— They
							kept me nearly two hours, explaining what they did not themselves
							understand, repeating the question whether I thought the gas-lights, and
							the flax-bleaching, and the iron-pavement would be useful in America. I
							had answered all these questions when they were here before, and
							repeated the promise that when they were ready to go, I would give them
							Letters to some of my friends who might afford them assistance in
							obtaining their Patents, or even an alteration of the Patent-Law, so
							that Patents might be taken out by them for inventions already known
							here— At length they let out the secret of all their applications to me,
							by hinting in answer to my enquiries when they intended to go, that they
							should go very shortly, though they supposed the Government of this
							Country would hinder them if they could. I now saw what they were
							seeking, and that they were mechanics of the Class who are not allowed
							by Law to leave this Country.— That they had been baiting for some aid
							or protection from me to smuggle them out, and that their inventions
							were all mere pretences— I determined to have nothing to do with them,
							and waited with what Patience I could until they went away— In the
							Evening we finished reading <persRef ref="edgeworth-maria">Miss

						<p><date>2. VI:15. </date>Heard <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>
							read, and wrote again about half a page before Breakfast— Went into
							London; called at <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh’s</persRef> house, at the corner of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Square, and left a Card. He
							returned from Paris, and arrived in London last Wednesday. When I got to
							the Office I found there an official Note from him, dated 29. November
							stating that the <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor of
								London</persRef> had made a Representation to the home department
							that a number of American Seamen were wandering about the Streets in a
							most wretched and distressed Condition, and that several of them were
							supported at the Police Establishments and Hospitals of the City at a
							considerable expence. He therefore requires me to take measures for
							sending these persons to their native Country. I directed <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>
							to make a Copy of this Note, and send it to <persRef
								ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef>. It requires a very deliberate answer— There was a
							Note also from <persRef ref="lullin-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lullin</persRef> of the Alien Office, stating by way of
							explanation, that foreigners are still obliged to take out Passports
							from that Office, and that the circular from the foreign Office, of the
								23<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> of September, only meant that
							Passports would be granted at the alien-office to foreigners, upon
							documents, other than the Passports of their own Ministers— I called at
							the foreign Office and enquired for <persRef ref="morier-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier</persRef>— They informed me
							that he no longer belonged to the Office; <persRef ref="cooke-edward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef> who had been the
							Under Secretary of State before him, having resumed the place. I then
							asked for <persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef> and saw him. I shewed him the Note I had just
							received from Lord Castlereagh, and told him that as it related to
							business within the Consular Department, the arrangements must of course
							be made by the Consul lately arrived, and that he was waiting for his
							exequatur— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton enquired of a Clerk
							if it was ready. It was gone for the <persRef ref="george-iv"
								>Prince’s</persRef> Signature, but had not been returned— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton said the Note itself was a
							circular; the Lord Mayor having sent a Representation of the same kind
							respecting the Seamen of several foreign Nations, although the name only
							of one individual belonging to each of them had been reported— I
							mentioned the Note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lullin of the
							Alien-Office, and what <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef> had lately written me
							from Liverpool. I shewed him the Circular from <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef> which referred to one
							from Lord Castlereagh of 15 May last— This I had never seen, as it had
							been sent to the foreign Ministers, ten days before my arrival in
							London. I asked him if he could let me have a copy of it. He sent for
							the Book, and read me the Note— It was a notification that the
							Government had determined to grant Passports at the Alien-Office, only
							to foreigners who should produce Passports from the Ministers of their
							own Country at this Court. Hamilton said it was a regulation founded
							upon the Act of Parliament, and had been made chiefly to prevent
							Frenchmen from going and coming between this Country and France, unless
							they were recognized by the <persRef ref="delachastre-claude">French
								Ambassador</persRef>— This regulation was now revoked, but the Act
							of Parliament itself, required that Aliens should take Passports at the
							Alien Office, and that could be repealed only by the Authority of
							Parliament. I told him it was very inconvenient to
							Americans—particularly to those who were engaged in commercial affairs
							and went from Liverpool, and that was the place where perhaps nine
							tenths of all Americans in England arrived at, and sailed from— He said
							it was probable the restriction would not be continued beyond the next
							Session of Parliament— I spoke of the subjects concerning which <persRef
								ref="english-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								English</persRef> had written to me, from Dublin— The Irish
							Post-Office-Bill, and the regulation by which American Vessels are
							allowed to take out from Ireland only one Passenger, for every five
							tons, while British vessels are permitted to take a passenger for every
							two tons. The Post-Office Bill compels all Persons writing Letters, and
							sending them by any other conveyance than the British Packets, between
							America and Ireland, to pay Postage for them— I told him this was
							levying a tax upon people in America for having correspondents in
							Ireland. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> English also had complained that
							it was both a tax and a restriction upon his official correspondence
							with the Government of the United States— But the Post-master at Dublin
							had removed that difficulty for the present, by suspending the
							application of the Law to his official Correspondence— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton said that as to private
							Correspondence, the Law was no more than what was generally practiced by
							other Governments— That in France and Germany private travellers were
							not allowed to carry Letters—that he himself had had Letters taken from
							him at the gates of Vienna, and put into the Post-Office— I said I had
							never known of any such regulation upon the Continent of Europe; but if
							there was, the principle might be different, where Letters travelled by
							land, and passed through the Territory— Here, there was no carriage by
							land within the Country— It was an impediment to the freedom of
							intercourse between the Countries, and tended to produce a counter-tax
							of the same kind, in America, upon British Letters. He said, that might
							indeed happen, but it was no more a restriction upon intercourse than
							duties upon the importation upon merchandize— I finally told him I was
							aware it was a thing upon which I could make no formal and official
							remonstrance; but that it was a great inconvenience to the merchants,
							and could be of very little profit to the revenue— A Law of the same
							kind with respect to Great Britain had <pb n="352" type="ms"/>been
							repealed or suffered to expire since I arrived in this Country, and I
							hoped they would let the Irish Ship-Letter-Act have the same fate.— He
							said that as to the Packet, he did not think there was any necessity for
							keeping it up at-all in time of Peace, as the intercourse by merchant
							vessels was so easy and so frequent. I agreed in this opinion, and said
							I supposed the Packets were kept up, chiefly for their intercourse with
							their own Colonies.— With regard to the distinction made between
							American, and British vessels, in the number of Passengers which they
							are permitted to carry, he said he thought with me, that it was not
							consistent with the Commercial Convention, concluded last July— He did
							not know upon what principle the distinction was made; but he took a
							minute of it, and promised to enquire into it, and have it remedied if
							he could— On returning to my own Office, I found a Letter directed to
							me, which upon reading I perceived was not to me— But as it was from
								<persRef ref="u">Studley</persRef> the inventor, I concluded he had
							been writing two Letters, one of which was for me, and that he had
							superscribed to me the wrong one. There was nothing in the one that I
							received, indicating for whom it was intended; but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb thought he knew— It contained
							however one piece of information, which they had not given me yesterday,
							and differing from what they had told me before—namely, that young
								<persRef ref="u">Service</persRef> would probably not go to America,
							having been offered the place of Steward to a Nobleman.— I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb to send back this Letter, and inform
							Studley of his mistake— I added that I thought <persRef ref="west-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West</persRef> had acted
							improperly in recommending these persons to me to assist them in the
							project of going to America, when he knew they were not allowed by law
							to quit the Country— It was about six O’Clock when I reached home—
							Walked from the Kensington Turnpike to the Corner of Boston-Lane,
							Brentford; about five miles— I found my Sons <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							at home, but they returned after dinner to School.</p>

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grubb’s</persRef> Sister, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Poole</persRef>, of
							Mortlake— There was at the Office a <persRef ref="denniston-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Denniston</persRef>, late a
							Lieutenant Colonel in the army of the United States. He came for a
							Passport which was given him, as he produced his Commission and a
							Passport from the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>. He is an Irishman born, and in the Irish
							insurrection of 1798 was in arms against the British Government. He at
							that time escaped, and went to America, where he settled and has been
							naturalized. In the late War he bore the Commission of a Lieutenant
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>— He has an Estate in Ireland, and
							is very desirous of going there. He asked my advice, whether I thought
							it safe for him, to go, and whether I could assist him to obtain from
							this Government an assurance that he would not be molested. I told him
							that as to the safety of the measure, he must be a better judge of that
							than I could be. I certainly could not advise him to it— I could and
							would if he desired it, mention his name and case to <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, and ask the
							permission for him to go to Ireland with the pledge that he should not
							be prosecuted; but he must be aware, that if the disposition to
							prosecute him existed, this would necessarily disclose the fact of his
							being here, and expose him to the very danger he wished to avoid. He
							said he had in fact lately been in Ireland, and had left it under the
							apprehension of a prosecution; but all the magistrates of the County
							where he had belonged, and where he had taken part in the Insurrection,
							were now willing to recommend him to the Government for an exemption
							from the Proscription. Even the Officer who had commanded the kings
							troops in an action which took place in 1798. and who had then reported
							him Denniston, as having commanded the Insurgents, was now satisfied
							that he had then been misinformed, and willing to join in the
							recommendation— I told him that an application through those channels,
							would have a much better prospect of success than through me;
							particularly as his Commission in the late American Army, if known,
							would have no tendency to encourage in Lord Castlereagh an oblivious
							disposition of what had occurred in 1798. Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l:</hi> Denniston finally concurred in this opinion, and said he
							would prefer not to incur the risk, of what might be the consequence of
							an application from me— I had also a visit from <persRef

								Austen</persRef> of Ramsgate; the Son of the <persRef

								>George</persRef> is to have a party of his school-fellows to dinner

								ref="pursh-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frederick
								Pursh</persRef> came to visit me— He is a Native of Siberia; was
							educated in Saxony, and has been many years settled in the United-Sates,
							of which he is a naturalized citizen. He is a man of Science, and about
							two years since came to England where he published a work entitled Flora
							Americae Septentrionalis, in two Volumes. He now wishes to return to
							New-York, where he has in partnership with another person some
							agricultural Establishment; and as he says, considerable property— But
							he is embarrassed in his finances, and wants a loan of twenty pounds
							Sterling to enable him to take passage. I told him I should be glad to
							give him any assistance in my power, but he was a total Stranger to me—
							I had nothing <pb n="355" type="ms"/>to trust to but his own Story, and
							I had more than once suffered loss by lending money to persons in
							similar Circumstances, who upon their arrival in America forgot their
							debts to me— He shewed me the record of his naturalization, and a Letter
							from the keeper of the Museum of Natural History at Paris, thanking him
							for the present of a Copy of his Flora of North America. I asked him,
							whether, as he had property at New-York, he could not procure his
							passage upon credit, with a Captain who would agree to receive his pay
							there. He said his passage would be partly upon credit— But he was with
								<persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef> and must raise fifty pounds to
							lay in their Stores and for the passage— He asked me only for twenty— I
							asked him if he could not name to me any person who would be responsible
							to me for the repayment of the money— He said he thought <persRef
								ref="banks-joseph">Sir Joseph Banks</persRef> would. Sir Joseph
							himself had been already so kind to him in the same way, that he was
							ashamed to ask him for any further loan— He had however ordered seeds
							and plants to be sent to him from America to the amount of the debt and
							which would make the repayment of it very easy— I told him that was
							sufficient— If he would bring me a line from Sir Joseph Banks, pledging
							himself for the reimbursement of the money, I would lend him the twenty
							pounds, and take his promissory Note for it— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams sent <persRef ref="pio-peter">Pio</persRef> this
							morning into London; <persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef> sent out by him a Book
							entitled “the Philosophy of Sense; or Book of Nature”; &amp;c a long
							title—by <persRef ref="stewart-john">John Stewart</persRef>, the
							Traveller. From the Era of its own Publication, in the 7000<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> Year of Astronomical History, taken from
							the Chinese Tables—London printed for the author. 4. Cockspur Street. It
							is dedicated to the United States of America, and appears to be the
							production of a Crazy Person— It was sent to the Office by the two-penny
							Post, accompanied by a Note, with the Authors respectful Compliments to
							me, and information that he has as many Vol<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>
							at my Service, as I may require to send to my friends in America— As
							upon opening the Book I found it contained a compound of nonsense,
							galimatias, and vulgar abuse upon the people of America, I shall think
							it unnecessary to take any Notice of the Authors Present or of his
							offer— I walked before dinner to Hanwell and Ealing; and in the Evening
							we finished reading <persRef ref="edgeworth-maria">Miss
								Edgeworth’s</persRef> Manoeuvering— This is the third and last
							Volume of her first set of Tales of fashionable life.— There is another
							set of three Volumes, more recently published, and said to be yet
							better. There is no modern English Novel writer, whom I think comparable
							to Miss Edgeworth— These Tales are all interesting, although the moral
							of no one of them is for my use— So long as I am blest with eyes and
							hands, and health I shall never know the evil, nor need a remedy for
							ennui. The Passion for fashionable Society, the aversion to paying just
							debts, and manoeuvering are all so foreign to every feeling and every
							habit of mine, that I have scarcely an admonition to take from these
							Volumes— I could gather more profitable instruction from Waverley— But
							there is more of Nature in Miss Edgeworth’s characters and incidents—
							More of real life, and less of Romance. The most indifferent of these
							Tales, is <persRef ref="defleury-madame">Madame de Fleury</persRef>, the
							chief object of which seems to be to represent in the most exalted
							light, the character of french emigrants— As worthless a Class of People
							in reality as any equal number of their fellow creatures who have
							crawled through life since their emigration began— And a class of
							People, now as mischievous as they have always been contemptible. There
							are doubtless exceptions— But the moral of a novel should not be founded
							upon exceptions— The <hi rend="italic">general</hi> moral deducible from
							Madame de Fleury is good; but commonplace— Charity and kindness to the
							poor— The return of Gratitude from the Poor, is also a common-place of
							all movels; though not so in real life— Charity to the Poor is a duty
							which ought not to rest upon interested motives, or the expectation of
							returns.</p>

							with a Despatch from the American Department of State—a Letter from

							long Letter from him on the subject of the Sailors, in reference to the

							of which I sent him some days ago a copy— The facts stated and the

							some Conversation with him, and to postpone the answer to Lord
							Castlereagh’s Note— The answer itself must also be a different one, from
							that which I had prepared— The other enclosed a Letter to M<hi

							published in this day’s Register. But he says that he and <persRef

							send out some works, of which they wish to have Copy-rights in America;
							and he asks two questions with regard to the Law of the United States,

								>r</hi> Grubb said a Gentleman had called about half an hour before

							Morning— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb wrote by my direction to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley, mentioning that I would call
							upon him at his house in Harley-Street, at Noon on Tuesday; or if that
							should not suit his convenience requesting him to call at my Office in

							when and where he could see me. <persRef ref="gray-john">M<hi

							proposes to go shortly to France, and asked me for advice, concerning
							his travels, which I accordingly gave him.— The weather being fine, I
							ordered the Carriage to come to the Office at four O’Clock— I left it
							myself at three with directions, that the Coachman should follow and
							overtake me on the Brentford Road— He did overtake me at the Corner of
							the Street from Brentford; but having walked thus far, I chose to
							complete the walk home, and came from the Office to my house, nine miles
							and a few rods, in precisely two hours and a half— The weather, and

							the Piano, with singing— Gini is the music Master of the Young Ladies—
							An Italian, and an excellent singer.— We returned home and shortly
							afterwards I took a walk with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to
							Gunnersbury, returning by the way of Brentford— At seven in the Evening
							we went again to the School, and heard a Lecture upon Astronomy, Light,
							and Optics, by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Garrett</persRef>— It was not very amusing, and the Professor
							however skilled in Natural History, was not very well grounded in the
							Language— His pronunciation was so bad, that one could scarcely hear it
							and refrain from laughing— The boys especially shewed some
							manifestations of being disorderly— It finished between nine and ten,
							and we immediately came home. Received a packet from <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>,
							enclosing Letters from <persRef ref="willinkfirm">Mess<hi

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley promises to call at my Office
							at half past two O’Clock to-morrow; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Collier, a person wholly unknown to me sends me a law question, and will
							send to my Office for the Answer to it to-morrow— The question is
							whether in America, the husband of a married woman, can receive a legacy
							devised to her, by a written authority, without a personal examination
							of the wife before a Court of equity, where she should declare her
							consent, or without the husband’s making a settlement upon her. One of
							these alternatives it states to be indispensable in England— M<hi

							New-York, where the husband and wife in this case resided.</p>

						<p><date>12. VI:30. </date>Only half a page of Journal again this morning— I
							went into London this morning with <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith</persRef>— Since his
							arrival, it has become necessary for me to part with <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>,
							whom I engaged only by the week, until the Secretary of Legation should
							come. It is hard upon Grubb, and comes with double severity at this
							Season of the year— I have determined to keep him until the close of the
							year, to finish the business now on hand, and to give time to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to get settled in the Office and
							acquainted with the course of business. There was a person called,
							coming from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Collier</persRef> for an answer to his question— I told him that our
							Laws in America, were different in the different States of the Union;
							but that in Massachusetts, of which I was a Citizen, and as I was
							informed in New-York, where he said the parties interested in his
							question resided, the husband might receive a Legacy bequeathed to his
							wife, upon a written Letter of Attorney duly authenticated before a
							magistrate, without personal examination of the wife by a Court of
							equity— The magistrate taking the acknowledgment of the Power being
							supposed competent to make such examination, and to have made it— I
							offered to give this answer in writing, if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Collier desired it— The person who came said he believed it
							would not be necessary; but if it should M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Collier would send again to request it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Grubb wrote for me an answer to the Letter of <persRef
								ref="glennieandson">Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Glennie</persRef> received last Saturday, and I propose to see
								<persRef ref="karthaus-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Karthaus</persRef> upon his business, whenever it may suit his
							convenience— <persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Beasley</persRef> came at half past two. He had made
							some Statements in his last Letter to me concerning the Sailors, upon
							which I was desirous of ascertaining the State of the Evidence. He had
							mentioned that many of the destitute American Seamen now applying for
							support and to be sent home, were men lately discharged from the British
							Naval service, and who had been impressed into it. And that there were
							others, entitled to small Pensions, which they were compelled to sell
							for two or three years purchase when <pb n="358" type="ms"/>they
							returned to the United States. He had suggested the idea of an
							application to the British Government, to suit the cases of these men;
							and I myself think it perfectly proper— He said he could furnish me
							lists of the destitute Seamen discharged from the British Navy, that he
							had sent to America, and of those to whom he had delivered certificates
							to enable them to sell their Pensions. He is to write to me again upon
							the Subject— I gave him verbal answers to the two questions in <persRef
								ref="cobbett-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cobbett’s</persRef> Letter, respecting Copy-Rights, by the Laws of
							the United States. Cobbett himself is not a Citizen of the United
							States; but <persRef ref="cobbett-william2">his Son</persRef> is— His
							questions are whether he or his Son could have copy-rights taken out, in
							their names, by an Agent in America, for works, written by them in this
							Country. Cobbett wrote that he had only the Act of Congress respecting
							Copy-Rights, that is in the first Volume of the Laws of the United
							States— He was informed there was a subsequent Law, but he knew not what
							it was— I took the Volume of the Laws, containing the Supplementary Act,
							with me to Town, and directed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb to
							make a Copy of the Act, and send it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Beasley.— It has no reference however to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cobbett’s questions. I answered them—that the Son as a Citizen of the
							United States, might have a copy-right taken out in his name, as author
							of works written by him in England, and the agent, duly authorized,
							would be competent to take out the copy-right— That the father could not
							have one taken out in his name, as author of works written by him here;
							but his agent might take one out in his own name, as proprietor of the
							works—and to make him the proprietor would be merely a matter of
							arrangement between Cobbett and him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Beasley asked me to send him back Cobbett’s Letter, which I promised— I
							ordered the Carriage, when it came to the Office at three, to take M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith to his lodgings in
							Bridge-Street, at <persRef ref="u">Walker’s</persRef> Hotel, and then
							without coming back for me to go homeward’s through Hyde Park, and the
							Brentford road until it should overtake me— Just as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith had left the Office, <persRef
								ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Joy</persRef>
							came in, and engaged me in Conversation, until M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Grubb gave me two or three hints that my Carriage would get
							to Hyde-Park before me, and that I should have to walk the whole way
							home— I left the Office however about four, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Joy walked with me as far as Hyde Park corner— He was very
							urgent in persuading me, to consult <persRef ref="adams-wiliam4">Sir
								William Adams</persRef>, the most fashionable oculist of the present
							time, about my eyes. But as I know that oculists can do me no good, I am
							not very eager to consult them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy, who
							has had these seven years a Commission of Consul of the United States at
							Rotterdam without ever going there, feels a strong anxiety respecting
							the compensation of American Consuls for which he thinks it
							indispensable that provision should be made. I gave him no hopes that a
							majority of both houses of Congress, would be of his opinion— He told me
							that <persRef ref="lyman-william2">General Lyman</persRef> had lived
							here as an American Consul, ought to live; but that he had made out
							accounts of five or six pounds for cases when his legal fees did not
							amount to fifteen shillings; and he had been informed as of a matter of
							notoriety that <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef>,
							sold Protections for Sailors as Americans, at a guinea a piece to any
							body that would pay so much for them— We parted at Hyde Park Corner, and
							the Carriage overtook me just at Kensington Gate. I rode the rest of the
							way home, and after dinner went to <persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas’s</persRef> School, and heard
							the conclusion of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Garrett’s</persRef> Lecture. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> did not go— It
							was upon the structure of the eye—Light—Vision—Catoptrics and
							Dioptrics—finishing with a Phantasmagoria. It was much more amusing than
							the Lecture of last Evening, and the boys were better pleased, and not
							quite so disorderly. The Professor’s language was as ludicrous as ever—
							“Ladies and Gentlemen—vy is my Coat black; and a sheet of paper vite?—it
							all shews the visdom of our adorable creator &amp;c”— His phantasmagoria
							was good; but not equal to that we saw last Spring at <persRef
								ref="robert-etienne">Robertson’s</persRef> at Paris. He exhibited
							shades of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>,
							the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king of Prussia</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="george-iii">King George the 3<hi rend="superscript"
									>d:</hi></persRef>
							<persRef ref="vonblucher-gebhard">Blucher</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="nelson-horatio">Nelson</persRef>— The boys shouted and clapped
							their hands at the sight of all these figures. There was also a female
							figure, said to be of the late <persRef ref="amelia">Princess
								Amelia</persRef>— At this and some other female shades the boys
							clapped, and smacked their lips: which D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Nicholas disapproved; and said to me smiling— “Hear now those rascals!”
							The Lecture finished again between nine and ten; and I walked home with
								<persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>— The <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef> at Liverpool,

							the <persRef ref="despinville-charles">French Consul</persRef> in the
							purpose of stopping payment of certain bills, drawn, as he states, by
							the house of <persRef ref="jhcazenovenephewandcompany"
								>Cazanova</persRef> in London, upon that of <persRef ref="leroybayardandmcevers">Le Roy,
								Bayard and M’Evers</persRef> at New-York. These Bills it alledges
							are drawn for account of a man named <persRef ref="marchal-auguste"
								>Auguste Marchal</persRef>, a fraudulent cashier who absconded and
							escaped from France, with the money entrusted to him— The Count states
							that he demanded of the British Government that this man should be
							arrested, and was answered that he had probably followed his Bills to
							America— There is a document in English, enclosed with the Letter, as
							confirmative of the facts alledged in it; but instead of Bills of
							Exchange, it is a description of several Certificates of United States
							six per Cent Stock, transferred to <persRef ref="marchal-francis"
								>Francis Marchal</persRef> of Philadelphia, with the necessary
							Letters of Attorney to make the transfer— I do not exactly understand
							the case; for the Ambassador’s Letter refers to one set of papers, and
							the document enclosed shews another— The Bills he says amount to £10,000
							Sterling, and the Certificates of Stock, are to the amount of 50,000
							dollars.— Some further explanation seems to be necessary.— <persRef

							speaks English not quite so well as professor <persRef ref="u"

							with us at the proposed Club, this day, but had afterwards recollected
							an engagement at home— I shortened my walk, the roads being very bad,
							and after returning home, went out again, just before six to the dinner—
							It was at the<space/>Inn; kept by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray</persRef> was
							engaged in London, so that he was unable to attend. There were some

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Laws, which D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Nicholas is endeavouring to smooth down with some prospect, of success.
							The dinner had been ordered for eight at seven shillings a head, and the
							wine to be paid apart— We had a very good dinner, and <hi rend="italic"
								>fair</hi> wines, particularly the Port. We parted between ten and
							eleven O’Clock, and the Bill amounted to 17/6 a head— We agreed to meet
							and dine at the same house again, on Friday, the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of January, and ordered a dinner again
							for eight— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas is going in the mean
							time to Wales, to visit <persRef ref="nicholas-david">his
								father</persRef>, 86 years of age, and now very ill, but he expect
							to return before that day. The party was social and agreeable; and I can
							join in conversation with these gentlemen, on any topics other than
							politics, upon which when introduced I am of course silent— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Copland came from London to attend the
							dinner, and returned to town this Night. When I came home, I found the
							two eldest Miss Nicholas’s spending the Evening with M<hi

						<p><date>17. VI:15. </date>I have hitherto not ventured to write by

							Candle-light, and on returning from my walk before dinner, wrote again
							from five until six O’Clock— As the record of each day becomes more

								<persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas</persRef> had procured three tickets for us. I went into

							out <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Aspinwall’s</persRef> Commission, with the Exequatur— <persRef
								ref="bidwell-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bidwell</persRef>, the chief Clerk was not there, but there was an
							under Clerk, who received the fees—£9:19. and delivered to me the

								<persRef ref="brant-richard">Richard</persRef>, to <persRef
								ref="casamajor-louis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Louis
								Casamajor</persRef>, with the parcel made up by <persRef

								Adams</persRef>, for <persRef ref="porter-mary">Lady
								Porter</persRef>, and a Note to him, requesting him if the packet
							should be too large, to send it back— At the Office I found Letters from
								<persRef ref="parry-william">William Parry</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cook-thomas">Thomas Cook</persRef> of George town , <persRef
								ref="cogdell-john">J. S. Cogdell</persRef> of South Carolina, and
								<persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef>— Parry is a manufacturer of fire-arms or Ordinance,
							who has been to me several times and who wants to go to America. He is,
							or fancies himself a great inventor or improver, and has written several
							volumes about gunnery, and the composition of Gunpowder, which he wishes
							the American Government to buy— He is moreover like all the other
							disappointed projectors, who have come to me in this Country a
							malcontent and a republican. I have been much upon the reserve with them
							all— This man how ever found out <persRef ref="barney-joshua">Commodore
								Barney</persRef> when he was here, who as he says promised to
							recommend him to the Government. He now sends me a Letter for the
							Commodore, with a box containing the four important volumes of
							manuscript, to be forwarded to him, and by him to the City of
							Washington— The Letter to me is merely to request me to transmit them,
							which I some time ago promised Parry that I would.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook’s letter, enclosed one for my wife,
							and one for <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Murdoch</persRef>, which I sent him by the two-Penny Post. The
							purport of them all was to inform us of the Death of our friend and
							brother in Law, <persRef ref="hellen-walter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Walter Hellen</persRef>, of the City of Washington— He
							had been many years in a very infirm state of health, most of them time
							confined to his house, and scarcely expected to live from week to week.
								<pb n="362" type="ms"/>He had successively married <persRef
								ref="hellen-ann;hellen-adelaide">Nancy and Adelaide
								Johnson</persRef>, the eldest and the youngest sister of my wife;
							the latter of whom survives him; with one daughter of her own, and
								<persRef ref="hellen-johnson;hellen-mary;hellen-thomas">three
								children</persRef> of the first wife. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cook, the Executor of his will, sends me an Extract from it— His son
							Johnson, is substituted as the Executor, if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cook should die after he comes of age; and in case of his
							Death, the trust is to devolve upon me. The widow and Children are left
							in comfortable circumstances— He died on the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of October, and we had already received information of the
							Event, by letters from <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef> at New-York to my
							wife, which were brought by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cogdell is one of the persons who
							wrote to me, expressing the wish to receive the appointment of Secretary
							of Legation to this Court, and whose Letter, I answered in August last—
							This Letter is in reply— He professes to be satisfied with what I wrote
							him on the subject; and informs me of his intention to visit England,
							the ensuing Spring.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury mentions that
							instead of one hundred destitute Seamen, he shall be able to send home
							not more than fifty by the vessel mentioned in his last preceding
							Letter. I had written to enquire of him the cause of the extraordinary
							numbers of these applications to him for relief— He answers the
							question, in this Letter, but not entirely to my satisfaction— After
							perusing these Letters, I left the Office with George to go to N. 68
							Lombard Street, to receive of <persRef ref="martinstoneandmartin"
								>Martin, Stone and Martin</persRef>, Bankers, payment of the Bill of
							Exchange drawn by <persRef ref="meyer-jc">Meyer</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="bruxner-george">Brüxner</persRef> of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg, upon <persRef ref="mitchell-john2">John
								Mitchell</persRef>, which was payable this day, and assigned at the
							Bank of Martin and C<hi rend="superscript">o:</hi> I had not reached the
							Corner of Charles Street, when I met <persRef ref="glennie-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Glennie</persRef> the son, with
								<persRef ref="karthaus-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Karthaus</persRef>, and turned back with them— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Karthaus, that I should make the
							application to this Government, for restitution to the owner of the
							Baltimore, and her Cargo; but that to have any prospect of success
							additional evidence of the facts, would be indispensably necessary; most
							especially of the fact of the capture within the Spanish Jurisdiction—
							The only evidence of that, included in the papers, was the <persRef ref="baker-wrothbond">Captain’s</persRef>
							Protest, signed also by the <persRef ref="dutton-george">Mate</persRef>; but that is scarcely ever received as
							evidence at-all.— It stated that there was a Spanish Pilot on board, at
							the time of the capture; the testimony of that Pilot, and of his boat’s
							crew, would be worth more as evidence than a hundred Protests, and if
							some such testimony should not be produced, the Government here as soon
							as they received my Note, would refer it to the Captain of the Ship who
							made the capture, and take his report whatever it might be, as a
							decisive answer to the complaint. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Karthaus, who appeared to have no idea, of any difficulty from the want
							of Evidence, asked me to let him have the papers for a few days, to
							ascertain what facts it might be necessary to authenticate by
							substantial proof, and accordingly took them with him— He and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Glennie, took leave, and I made a second
							attempt to go down into the City— I was again met before we reached the
							corner of Charles Street by Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Aspinwall,
							who was going to my Office, and with whom I again turned back. I gave
							him his Commission and the exequatur, and had some conversation with him
							concerning the destitute Seamen, who are now turned over to him by
								<persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef>— I wished to shew him the Note that I propose to
							send in answer to that of <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, and invited him to come with his family and
							dine with us next Monday. He said he would consult <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-louisa">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef> and send me an Answer— After he went away, I
							made the third attempt, with George to go down into the City, and this
							time, we succeeded— It was half past three when we left the City, and
							precisely five when we returned to it— The distance is about 2 1/2
							miles, but the crowds of people thronging the Streets, which were
							greater than usual made it impossible to walk fast— I received payment
							of the Bill, and immediately returned, with out having time to stop a
							moment to purchase a pair of skaits for <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> as I had promised him— We had taken into town a cold
							dinner, which we found ready at the Office; we had scarcely dispatched
							it, when D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas called for us. He had
							appointed half past five O’Clock, and rather preceded his time. I found
							on the table a Letter from <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Count Fernan
								Nuñez</persRef>, the Spanish Ambassador, which I had not then time
							to read, and put in my pocket— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas
							immediately took us to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knox</persRef>, one of the Masters of the school; whose first
							salutation upon seeing us was, that we could not all have places— There
							were only four of us, including the Doctor, and we all had tickets—
							After some coaxing however, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox finally
							consented to take us all in, and when we were introduced, I was a little
							surprized to find there was nobody there— It was about half an hour
							before the company began to come, and past seven, when the Play began—
							The <persRef ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of York</persRef> was
							expected, but he went this morning to Brighton. I saw there <persRef
								ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count Beroldingen</persRef> the Minister
							of Wurtemberg, <persRef ref="jenison-franz">Count
								Jenison-Walworth</persRef>, Secretary of the Bavarian Legation, and
								<persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef> the Under Secretary of State— The place fitted up
							for a theatre was the dormitory of the king’s scholars. And the names of
							great numbers of the former pupils are painted in capitals round the
							walls. It seems to be intended as a distinction, but is done without
							taste or order, and in most instances like the Critics in the temple of
							Fame, the new names are painted over the old ones and efface them— The
							room was finally crowded with Company. The Play performed was <persRef
								ref="terence">Terence’s</persRef> Andria— The Prologue was very
							badly spoken, and was a panegyric upon the Discipline of the British
							schools; with a dire proportion of abuse upon France and Germany— All
							which was very highly applauded. The Orator had an impediment in his
							speech <pb n="363" type="ms"/>and could scarcely articulate. His gesture
							was as ungracious as his pronunciation, and he made his bows like a
							Magot de la Chine, all from the Neck. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Nicholas told me that by an established Custom the Prologue must always
							be spoken by the Captain of the School— It was therefore almost always
							badly spoken; and was never expected to be otherwise. The Speaker of the
							Prologue had no part in the Play; which was well performed— Not better
							however than the Adelphi had been at Ealing. The Epilogue was a dialogue
							between two of the Personages of the Play, in which <persRef ref="davus"
								>Davus</persRef> and <persRef ref="crito">Crito</persRef>, make
							sport with some of the ridiculous things of the present or recent times—
							The invisible Lady, the Indian Jugglers swallowing swords, <persRef
								ref="southcott-joanna">Joanna Southcott</persRef> the pregnant old
							woman, and most of all <persRef ref="gall-franz">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gall</persRef> and <persRef ref="spurzheim-johann"
								>Spurzheim’s</persRef> Craniology.— It was not altogether without
							wit and humour. The Prologue and Epilogue were both spoken twice; a
							strange practice, for the convenience of the semi-latinists who can
							understand better with two hearings than with one— He told me that he
							had attempted when he began exhibiting these Plays to have these head
							and tail pieces spoken only once; but the repetition was called for by
							the spectators, and he had been obliged to conform to the Westminster
							usage— The D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> introduced me to <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</persRef> of Ealing,
							who was there, with <persRef ref="fletcher-edward">his Son</persRef>,
							the late Captain of Ealing School and principal performer, at the Play
							there in September last— The exhibition was over about ten O’Clock, and
							I took D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas home to his house— He had
							gone to town in a Post-Chaise— <persRef ref="brant-richard"
								>Richard</persRef>, my footman, gave me a packet which had been left
							for me at the Office, since I was there this Evening— We set M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith down at Charing Cross, and
							after landing D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas at his house, came
							home, where we arrived before Midnight— George was quite unwell— He had
							a remnant of his old cough hanging about him; and this day wet his feet
							through in walking with me to the City— After reaching home I opened the
							Letter from the Spanish Ambassador, and that given me by Richard as we
							left Westminster School. Count Fernan Nuñez informs me that he has
							received orders from his Court to demand restitution of the William and
							Mary; that he has accordingly addressed a Note to the British Ministry
							to make the demand, and will communicate to me their answer, when he
							shall have received it— The other Packet was from a <persRef
								ref="mckenrot-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anthony
								M’Kenrot</persRef>, enclosing a Letter addressed “A Son Altesse
							Impériale, <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">Le Prince Joseph
								Bonaparte</persRef>, à New-York, en Amerique,” with a request from
							M’Kenrot to me, that I would forward it to its destination— This man
							wrote me once before, an impertinent Letter, and is now under a process
							of examination for the forgery of Bills of Exchange to a large amount—
							He says the <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Austrian Ambassador</persRef>
							has forwarded such Letters for him— In our walk into the City his day, I
							was struck with the Gazlights which are introduced in the Streets, and
							most of the shops in the neighbourhood of the Mansion House— They are
							remarkably brilliant, and shed a light almost too dazzling for my eyes—
							They are also attended with an inconvenience of offensive smell, which I
							thought perceptible even in the Streets—and they are thought to be
							unhealthy. For lighting Streets however and open places, it is probable
							they will supersede the use of Oil— Our Sons <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>,
							this Evening came home from School, for the vacation of the Christmas
							Holidays— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams sent an apology to
								<persRef ref="morrison-jane">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							suited him at N. 13. Craven Street between the Strand and the river; and
							I went with him and looked at the Chambers— I found them such as might
							answer— The price asked for them was 2 1/2 guineas a week; and I agreed
							that he should take them, if they are to be had for two guineas— One
							guinea a week is to be allowed for the Office, the same which has been
							paid at Charles Street— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith has lodged
							since last Tuesday at the Office, but does not find the apartments there
							comfortable. I ordered the Coachman to put up his horses at the owners
							stable, and at four O’Clock to start with them for home, without
							returning to the Office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith copied and
							signed the short Note for <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, which was prepared last Saturday. I left the
							other papers with him. I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb,
							young <persRef ref="cleland-charles">Cleland’s</persRef> Letter,
							requesting him to call and see him at the prison, and enquire into the
							circumstances of his case; to ascertain whether I can give him any
							assistance— I was dictating to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb, a
							Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aspinwall, when he himself came
							in— I then told him that wishing to avoid all misunderstanding of what I
							had said to him respecting an allowance to be made by the Government for
							the necessary expences of Clerk hire, I was writing to him to say that I
							had no authority to pledge the Government to any thing in the case— I
							had thought it so obviously reasonable that the expences should be paid,
							that I had inferred they would not refuse the payment. But it was merely
							the expression of my opinion; and I could not promise that the
							Government would concur in it. The Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
							said he had not understood me otherwise; but he came to ask me, first
							for an Order upon <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Mess<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Baring Brothers &amp; C<hi
									rend="superscript">o:</hi></persRef> for money to pay for the
							support and the passages of destitute American Seamen—and Secondly an
							Order to him, to take charge of those Sailors as Agent for Seamen, an
							Office under which the Government would allow the expences, while they
							would not to the Consul— He had applied to the Baring’s for Money, but
							they had declined paying it without an order from me— I told him that I
							would give him the order on the Baring’s from the necessity of the case,
							though I had no authority from the Government so to do— I must take the
							responsibility upon myself, and I gave him an order for £300 Sterling.
							As to the order to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, to act as Agent for
							Seamen, I had no authority to give it, and I did not perceive <pb
								n="367" type="ms"/>the absolute necessity for it. He had been told
							it was the <persRef ref="madison-james">President’s</persRef> intention
							not to continue the Office of Agent for Seamen at London— He supposed
							that in time of Peace it would not be necessary. From the information
							which the Government would now receive, I trusted the necessity of
							continuing the Office, at least for some time longer, or of charging the
							Consul with its functions would be apparent— But as I now made myself
							responsible for the funds to defray the expences, I thought he must
							assume that of acting until the determination of the President can be
							known. Else it would be a mere transfer of the responsibility, from him
							to me— The Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> seemed to be not entirely
							satisfied with this reasoning, and when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Grubb asked him if he should call upon him to-morrow, he said he
							believed not—for he knew that the charge of Clerk-hire would not be
							allowed him by the Government.— It was just upon four O’Clock, when he
							left the Office, and I immediately began my walk— The Carriage over took
							me about half way down hyde-Park— I stopped at a Druggists shop in
							Kensington and took boxes of Soda powders, and of Lozenges of Tolu— The
							roads were bad, and it was near six, when I reached home.</p>

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Apthorp says there has been very little
							commerce direct from the United States to Holland, this year, and that
							he has been astonished at the general decay in the circumstances of the
							People, in that Country. My own remark, when I was there last year was
							quite different; but I merely passed through the Country, and could see
							nothing by the surface— <hi rend="italic">That</hi>, was in many
							respects improved. The appearance of comfort, cleanliness and plenty was
							the same— But different persons see with different eyes— I made some
							further enquiries of <persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi

								<persRef ref="cleland-charles">Cleland</persRef>, of whose conduct

								<persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef>, and said that perhaps <persRef
								ref="hughesandduncan">Hughes and Duncan</persRef> who have been for
							many years largely concerned in American business, and are wealthy men,
							might agree to release him from prison, upon an engagement by him
							ratified by <persRef ref="cleland-william">his father</persRef> to pay
							the money due, by instalments— I settled Accounts with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb, with whom I am now very reluctantly
							to part— I have found him trusty, industrious, and obliging.— He asked
							me to write him some time when I should have leisure, a certificate,
							that I was satisfied with his services; which I very readily promised.—
							I also give up from this time the Apartments which I have kept, for an
							Office, at N. 25. Charles Street, Westminster— <persRef ref="smith-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith</persRef> has taken

							which is to be allowed for Office-Rent; and he has already removed
							thither his own effects— Those of the Office are to be removed on
							Monday— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb keeps my private
							Letter-Book, to finish copying some Letters, of which I had only
							Press-copies, and which I wished to have entered in the Book— John’s
							Schoolmates the two <persRef ref="u">Baker’s</persRef> called at two, to meet him, and they went
							together to Westminster Abbey— I left with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith to be copied and delivered to <persRef

							Pursh</persRef>, the Letters written yesterday to send by him. I had
							ordered the Carriage at half past three. When John returned from the

							Carriage and walked on. They over took me at Kew Bridge, but I chose to
							finish my walk, and reached home in two hours and forty minutes from
							Charles Street. Ten minutes longer than the time before; but the walking
							is not so good as it was then— George was so ill that M<hi

								<persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef>, who
							came and prescribed both for him, and for <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>— George he says, has a slight inflammation of the

							Charles has only a Cold. I received a Letter this Evening from <persRef

							enclosing for my perusal, a late one from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
