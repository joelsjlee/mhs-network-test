							a native of Fairfield in Connecticut. He has resided in this vicinity

							between the Lisbonians and the Brazilians.— He spoke like a disapointed
							and discontented man, and told me that he intended to return here in
							about a month from Paris. I went to my Office, and found there the
							packet from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sumter— It enclosed a Letter

						<p><date>7. VI:15. </date>After writing this morning a Letter to <persRef

							at Paris, I went into London, and first called upon the <persRef
								ref="delachastre-claude">Comte de La Chátre</persRef>, the French

							particularly recommended to me, as it came from the <persRef ref="u"
								>Count de Gestas</persRef>, whose prior despatches I understood had
							failed of reaching the king’s Ministers— And I had been requested by the
							American Minister at Rio Janeiro, who had forwarded the packet to say
							that he had been a witness to the zeal and activity, with which the
							Count de Gestas had served the king’s interests there. The Count said
							that this testimonial gave him great pleasure— That it had happened that
							the Count de Gestas was the only one, of all the diplomatic agents whom
							the king had employed, before his restoration; who had not after that
							event, been confirmed, in the same office; but it was only a
							mal-entendu, which he hoped would be repaired— He said that he himself
							had been the king’s Minister here, ever since the Ministry of <persRef
								ref="fox-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef>— He
							was the most antient member of the Corps Diplomatique here. Though great
							part of the time without acknowledged public character— I asked him
							whether he expected <persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Rayneval</persRef> soon back. He
							said, perhaps next week— He had expected him sooner, but he would not
							come until the arrangements are terminated. He said the Elections for
							the Representative Chamber were generally very good; and he entertained
							great hopes from their meeting which was to be about the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> I said there had been some talk of
							changes in the Ministry— He said he did not think that probable— Perhaps
								<persRef ref="fouche-joseph">Fouché</persRef> might retire— It was
								<hi rend="italic">much</hi> (c’est beaucoup) that he was appointed
							to the place he now holds— After a little further conversation upon
							indifferent topics, I left the Count, and went to the <persRef
								ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de Freire’s</persRef>, the
							Portuguese Minister— He was not at home— I left with his Secretary, my
							Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sumter with a request that he
							would forward it— He told me that it would be too late for this Months
							packet; the despatches to go by it having been made up and sent off to
							Falmouth, last Night. But my letter would be sent by an occasional
							merchant vessel, or by the Packet of next Month.— After calling at
								<persRef ref="key-sarah">Key</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jameson-john">Jameson</persRef> the Coachmakers, I paid a visit

								Maclure</persRef> who was not at home, and to <persRef
								ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bollmann</persRef> whom I found. He is a man of very singular
							character and Genius— Full of intrigue, of Projects, and of information—
							Ardent, meditative, a mixture of calculation and Romance, which enters
							much into the composition of the Germans of the present age—flattering
							aukwardly. Vain to an incredible excess— A man who might be made in the
							highest degree useful, but that his flightiness of mind, and equivocal
							principle <hi rend="strikethrough">did not</hi> render him still more
							dangerous. I had Conversation with him upon various points which I can
							scarcely now commit to paper— But the gravity with which he exhorted me
							to study his writings upon finance in the American Review diverted me
							much— He appears to have a wish to be appointed American Agent at the
							Court of Vienna. I went from him to the Office in Charles Street, where
							I found <persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grubb</persRef>, very unwell— He had been all the morning in bed—
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Murtrie</persRef>
							had already been there and taken <pb n="316" type="ms"/>his Passports— I

							and took it with the Packet I had made up for the <persRef

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Murtrie was gone— He had left the

							shewed me the Coach, which I followed and overtook near Temple-Bar— I
							gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Murtrie the packet and the Letter—
							He told me he had the Certificate of Stock, and Letter of Attorney, and
							would make the transfer. I returned to Charles Street— M<hi

						<p><date>14. VI— </date>This morning was occupied in reading over the
							Letters which I have received from <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> and the enclosures in them. The Carpenters finished
							their work in my Cabinet, where they have been nearly a week employed in
							opening two side windows, and closing two at the end. <persRef
								ref="saunders-prince">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sanders</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bryden</persRef> came out before I left home— A young
							Frenchman named <persRef ref="u">Sabatier</persRef> also came to ask me
							for Letters of Recommendation to America— He is a carver and engraver,
							and wishes to go and settle in that Country. I went into London, and as
							I had anticipated found a Note from <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord
								Bathurst</persRef>, appointing two O’Clock this day to see me at
							Downing-Street— It was then just two, and I went immediately to his
							Office, and had an interview with him of about an hour— I said that
							having lately received despatches from the American <persRef
								key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef> respecting several
							objects of some importance to the relations between the two Countries,
							my first object in asking to see him had been to enquire whether he had
							received from <persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef> a Communication of the Correspondence
							between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and him, relative to the
							surrender of Michillimakinac, to the proceedings of <persRef
								ref="nicholls-edward">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Nicolls</persRef> in the Southern part of the United States; and to
							the warning given by the Captain of a British armed vessel, to certain
							American fishing vessels to withdraw from the fishing grounds to the
							distance of twenty leagues from the Coast— He said that he had received
							all these papers from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker about four
							days ago, that an answer with regard to the warning of the fishing
							vessels had immediately been sent; but on the other subjects there had
							not been time to examine the papers and prepare the answers— I asked him
							if he could without inconvenience state the substance of the answer that
							had been sent— He said, certainly— It had been that as on the one hand
							Great-Britain could not permit the vessels of the United States to fish
							within the Creeks, and close upon the shores of the British territories,
							so on the other hand it was by no means her intention to interrupt them
							in fishing any where in the open sea, or without the territorial
							jurisdiction—a marine league from the shore— And therefore that the
							warning given in the place stated in the case referred to was
							unauthorised. I said that the particular act being disavowed, I trusted
							the British Government before adopting any final determination upon the
							Subject, would estimate in candour and in the Spirit of amity which my
							own Government was anxious to have prevailing in our relations with this
							Country, the Considerations which I was instructed to present in support
							of the right of the People of the United States to fish on the whole
							Coast of North-America, which they have uniformly enjoyed from the first
							settlement of the Country. That I should in the course of a few days
							address a Letter to him on the Subject. He said that they would give due
							attention to the Letter that I should send him, but that Great-Britain
							had explicitly manifested her intention upon the Subject— That there was
							a great deal of feeling on it in this Country, as I doubtless knew, and
							their own fishermen considered it as an excessive hardship to be
							supplanted by American fishermen even upon the very shores of the
							British dominions— I said that those whose sensibilities had been thus
							excited, had probably not considered the question of right, in the point
							of view in which it had been regarded by us. That the question of right
							had not been discussed at the negotiation of Ghent— That the British
							Plenipotentiaries had given a notice that the British Government would
							not hereafter allow the People of the United States to fish and cure and
							dry fish within the exclusive British territorial Jurisdiction in
							America, without an equivalent. That the American Plenipotentiaries had
							given notice in return, that the American Government considered all the
							rights to the fisheries on the whole Coast of North America, as
							sufficiently secured by their enjoyment of them from the settlement of
							the Country by them, and by the recognition of it in the Treaty of Peace
							of 1783. That they did not think any new stipulation necessary for a
							further confirmation of the right— No part of which did they consider as
							having been forfeited by the War— It was perfectly obvious that the
							Treaty of Peace of 1783 was not one of those ordinary Treaties which by
							the usages of Nations were considered as annulled by a subsequent war
							between the same parties. It was a Treaty of partition between two parts
							of one Nation agreeing thenceforth to be separated into two distinct
							Sovereignties— The Conditions upon which this was done constituted
							essentially the Independence of the United States, and the preservation
							of all the fishing rights which they had always enjoyed, over the whole
							Coast of North America, was among the most important of them— This was
							no concession no grant on the part of Great-Britain which could be
							annulled by a War— There had been in the same Treaty of 1783. a right
							recognized in British subjects to navigate the Mississippi— This right
							the <persRef ref="goulburn-henry;adams-william;robinson-frederick"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef> at Ghent had considered a just
							claim of Great-Britain, notwithstanding the war that had intervened— The
								<persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;bayard-james;russell-jonathan"
								>American Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, to remove all future
							discussion upon both points had offered to agree to an article expressly
							confirming both the rights— In declining this an Offer had been made on
							the part of Great-Britain, stipulating to negotiate in future for the
							renewal of both rights, <hi rend="italic">for an equivalent</hi>. This
							was declined by the American Plenipotentiaries because its only effect
							would have been an implied admission, that both the rights were
							annulled— There was therefore no Article concerning them in the Treaty,
							and the question as to the right was not discussed. I now stated the
							ground upon which the Government of the United States considered the
							right as subsisting and unimpaired— It would be for the British
							Government ultimately to determine how far this reasoning was to be
							admitted as correct. <pb n="319" type="ms"/>There were also
							considerations of policy and expediency to which I hoped the British
							Government would give suitable attention before they came to a final
							decision upon this point— I thought it my duty to suggest them; that
							they might not be overlooked— The subject was viewed by my Countrymen as
							highly important, and I was profoundly anxious to omit nothing which
							might possibly have an influence to promote friendly sentiments between
							the two Nations, or to guard against the excitement of others.— These
							fisheries afforded the means of subsistence to multitudes of people, who
							were destitute of any other— They also afforded the means of remittance
							to G. Britain, in payment for articles of her manufacture exported to
							America— It was well understood to be the policy of Great-Britain that
							no unnecessary encouragement or stimulus should be given to manufactures
							in the United States, which would diminish the importations from those
							of Great-Britain— But by depriving the fishermen of the United States of
							this source of subsistence, the result must be to throw them back upon
							the Country, and drive them to the resort of manufacturing for
							themselves—while on the other hand, it would cut off the means of making
							remittances in payment for the manufactures of Great-Britain— I might
							add that the people in America whose interests would be immediately and
							severely affected by this exclusion, were in the part of the Country
							which had always manifested of late years most friendly dispositions
							towards Great-Britain— This might perhaps be less proper for me to
							suggest than for a British Cabinet to consider— To me the interests of
							all my Countrymen, in every part of the United States was the same. I
							could know no distinction between them. But upon a point where I was
							contending for what we conceived a strict right, I thought it best to
							urge every consideration which might influence the other party to avoid
							a collision upon it— I would even urge considerations of humanity— I
							would say that fisheries, the nature of which was to multiply the means
							of subsistence to mankind, were usually considered by civilized Nations
							as under a sort of special Sanction— It was a common practice to leave
							them uninterrupted even in time of war— He knew for instance that the
							Dutch had been for centuries in the practice of fishing upon the Coasts
							of this Island, and that they were not interrupted in this occupation
							even in ordinary times of war— It was to be inferred from this that to
							interrupt a fishery which had been enjoyed for ages was itself an
							indication of more than ordinary animosity— He said that no such
							disposition was entertained by the British Government— That to shew the
							liberality which they had determined to exercise in this case he would
							assure me that the Instructions which he had given to the Officers on
							that Station had been, not even to interrupt the American fishermen, who
							might have proceeded to those Coasts within the British Jurisdiction,
							for the present year—to allow them to complete their fares, but to give
							them notice, that this privilege could be no longer allowed by
							Great-Britain, and that they must not return the next year— It was not
							so much the fishing, as the drying and curing on the shores that had
							been followed with bad consequences— It happened that our fishermen by
							their proximity, could get to the fishing Stations sooner in the Season
							than the British, who were obliged to go from Europe, and who upon
							arriving there found all the fishing places, and drying and curing
							places preoccupied— This had often given rise to disputes and quarrels
							between them, which in some instances had proceeded even to blows— It
							had even disturbed the Peace among the inhabitants on the shores; and
							for several years before the war, the complaints to this Government had
							been so great and so frequent that it had been impossible not to pay
							regard to them— I said that I had not heard of any such complaints
							before—but that as to the disputes arising from the competition of the
							fishermen, they could surely be easily made a subject of regulation, by
							the Government, and as to the Peace of the Inhabitants there could be no
							difficulty in securing that; as the liberty enjoyed by the American
							fishermen, was in all settled and inhabited places, expressly subjected
							to the consent of the inhabitants, and by agreement with them— I then
							adverted to the other topics—Michillimakinac—Bois Blan—and Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Nicolls— I asked him if he had any
							account of the delivery of the Post— He said he had no doubt whatever;
							but that it had been long since delivered up— But he had no late
							despatches from the Canadian Government— Some delay had occurred by the
							change of the Governor General; but <persRef ref="prevost-george">Sir
								George Prevost’s</persRef> leaving Quebec to come to Europe, and
							consequently by <persRef ref="drummond-gordon">General
								Drummond’s</persRef> coming from upper Canada to Quebec— As to the
							indisposition manifested by the Indians to accept the Peace offered by
							the United States, he regretted it very much— It had been the sincere
							wish and intention of the British Government that the Peace with the
							Indians should immediately follow that agreed to by this Country, the
							British Officers there had been formally instructed to make known to
							them the Peace which had been concluded, and to advise them to take the
							benefit of it— As to Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Nicolls I said
							that the American Government had been peculiarly concerned at the
							proceedings of that Officer, because they appeared marked with
							unequivocal characters of hostility— Why, said Lord Bathurst to tell you
							the truth, Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Nicolls, is I believe a man
							of activity and Spirit, but a very wild fellow— He did make and send
							over to me a Treaty Offensive and defensive with the Indians, and he is
							now come over here and has brought over some of those Indians <pb
								n="320" type="ms"/>I sent for answer that he had no authority
							whatever to make a Treaty offensive and defensive with the Indians, and
							that this Government would make no such Treaty. I have sent him word
							that I could not see him upon any such project— The Indians are here in
							great distress indeed; but we shall only furnish them with the means of
							returning home, and advise them, to make their terms with the United
							States as well as they can— Perceiving that I had noticed his
							declaration that he had declined seeing Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Nicolls, he said that perhaps he should see him upon the
							general subject of his transactions but that he had declined seeing him
							in regard to his Treaty with the Indians— I then observed that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had also sent me his Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker concerning the Island of Bois Blanc.
							He said, it seemed merely a question of fact; whether the Island had
							been in the possession of the British at the Commencement of the late
							War, or not— He did not know how that was, but he thought it could not
							be difficult to ascertain; and it was altogether of very little
							importance. I then asked him if he could inform me, when <persRef
								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							would probably embark for the United States— He laughed and said he
							believed he must refer me to the man midwife— They had expected <persRef
								ref="bagot-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							would be confined about this time, and to be ready to go early in
							October— I said that I had asked the question now, because by a late
							Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker to the American
							Secretary of State, it appeared that his powers in relation to the
							execution of the Treaty of Peace were less extensive than the Government
							of the United States had understood they were; which circumstance had
							made me more solicitous for the departure of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bagot— He said there would be no delay that could possibly
							be avoided.— After this conference I went to the engraver <persRef
								ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef> in the Strand.— Left
							the Seal, for an alteration.— As I was returning to Charles Street, I
							met the Sardinian Minister, <persRef ref="u">Count S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Martin d’Aglie</persRef>, in the
							Street— He says that the Treaty of Peace with France is signed— That
							France will retain her boundaries of 1789. without dismemberment only
							restoring to <persRef ref="victoremmanuel">his king</persRef>, what had
							been taken from him by the Treaty of Paris of May 1814— He says that
							there is a political fanaticism prevailing in Germany of which an
							association calling themselves friends of virtue has been the

							drawing to a conclusion. There were so many parties, that some shades of
							difference in opinion had arisen among them, as to what was best to be
							done; but they would probably be all soon smoothed down— I asked him

						<p><date>27. V:45. </date>The approach of winter begins to interrupt my

							see <persRef ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bollmann</persRef>, again. I went in the Curricle, and returned in
							the Landau— I signed and sent in the Letter to <persRef

							applications for Passports to go to America, nothwithstanding the notice
							given in Lord Bathurst’s circular Letter of the 23<hi rend="superscript"

							Bollmann, and gave him the Letter, which I requested him to deliver,
							himself.— I intimated to him also, that he might perhaps find some
							prejudices against him at Washington; which would interfere with his
							present views.— He thought, they could only have arisen from his
							concerns with <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Burr</persRef>; but I gave him to understand that there
							might be others of more recent origin; and referred him to reports of

							promised to make up the packet of despatches, to give to D<hi

								ref="smith-william-steuben;smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi

							And a large packet from <persRef ref="dickasonandcompany">Mess<hi

									rend="superscript">o:</hi></persRef> enclosing the papers in the
							case, upon which they wished me to make application to the <persRef
								ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador</persRef>— I read them all
							as I was riding home; which I reached at 5. O’Clock— I intended not to
							have shewn <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> the
							Letter from my Mother, until to-morrow Morning; but there was a Letter
							to <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>, which also mentioned
							the Death of Catherine’s child, which was thus immediately disclosed to
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams— She was so much affected by
							it, that she could not go out as she had intended this Evening. At Seven
							O’Clock I went with George to <persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas’s</persRef> School, and saw
							the performance of <persRef ref="terence">Terence’s</persRef> Adelphi by
							some of the Scholars— The performances were very good. The Prologue and
							Epilogue were spoken twice, which made them rather tedious. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas allowed my Sons, <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to sit with me— The dresses of the boys were all

							Orchestra— There were many Ladies attended and a few Gentlemen— The
							exhibition finished soon after ten.</p>

						<p><date>28. VI:45. </date>The morning was cold, and I employed it in

						<p><date>29. VI— </date>Michaelmas day— Something of a Holiday in England,

								>George</persRef>— I employed the day chiefly in writing, but lost

								Carver</persRef>, who had been twice to ask my assistance to pay his
							debts and go to America. He was now come a third time and with a new
							Story. I told him I could not lend him money, and I thought the
							Gentlemen at whose instance he said he had declined the invitation of
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, and
							subsequent advantageous engagement to go to the East-Indies, ought to
							supply him, with what he needed— <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							leave; going to France; and <persRef ref="king-mitchel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef>, going to Liverpool to
							return to America— He asked my further advice for his application in
							behalf of the Literary and Philosophical Society of South-Carolina, to
							obtain Copies of old documents from the Office of the Colonial
							Department, and for the projected Publication of <persRef
								ref="ramsay-david">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ramsay’s</persRef>
							posthumous works. I declined soliciting <persRef ref="goulburn-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn</persRef> for the
							Papers, under the expectation that they would be refused, and even that
							some umbrage might be taken at my making the request. On public
							considerations I thought it best not to incur the hazard of exciting
							suspicion or giving offence at that office. With regard to the
							publication of D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ramsay’s works, he had
							prepared a History of America, to form two Volumes octavo— And an
							Abridgment of Universal History, to form ten or twelve— I thought the
							publication of the first might be successful, but that the other would
							be too voluminous, and expensive. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King
							was of the same opinion— He had found that to obtain a copy right here,
							it would be necessary to have the book printed, but not published in
							America, and to deposit fifteen copies of it at Stationers Hall. After
							which a bargain for the copy-right might be made with a Bookseller. He
							said that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ramsay’s Executor was a
								<persRef ref="hayne-robert">Grandson</persRef> of <persRef ref="u"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Haynes</persRef>, and that

								ref="ramsay-martha">widow</persRef>, a daughter of <persRef
								ref="laurens-henry">President Laurens</persRef>, with a large family
							of Children had been left in distressed and indigent Circumstances— The
							Doctor having been of a speculative turn, and unfortunate in his
							speculations, at the latter period of his life— I went with the two boys
							to <persRef ref="maclure-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maclure’s</persRef> lodgings, and left there, the letter for
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>— It was between 7
