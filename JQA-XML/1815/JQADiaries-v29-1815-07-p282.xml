						<p><date>1. VII. </date>At Noon I called according to his appointment at
								<persRef ref="addington-henry2">Lord Sidmouth’s</persRef> Office,
							and was informed that he had gone out of town— I then enquired for
								<persRef ref="beckett-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beckett</persRef>, and saw him— He apologized to me for Lord
							Sidmouth, and said that he had no doubt that he could easily arrange
							with me, the subject upon which I had spoken to his Lordship— I
							mentioned the difficulty which within these few days in obtaining from
							the alien Office, Passports to go to France— Until the Commencement of
							hostilities, they had always obtained those Passports at the
							Alien-Office, upon producing there passports given by me— Within the
							last week, those who have applied, were told that they must have
							something more from me than a Passport. A Letter, or request that they
							might be permitted to go to France. I said that whatever of this Nature
							was thought necessary by this Government I would readily give; it being
							understood that all I should pledge myself to by it is that the person
							applying is an American Citizen; and that he wishes to go to France. I
							should certainly not give it to any person of whom I should know that he
							was going with purposes hostile to this Country, but I must of course
							give it to many persons total strangers to me, and of whose purposes I
							shall have no knowledge— As American Citizens all have an equal right to
							ask all the facilities that I can give them for travelling; and as
							belonging to a neutral Country, all have an equal right to go to France,
							as their affairs or inclinations may lead them— It happened that the two
							persons who had recently found difficulties at the Alien-Office,
								<persRef ref="bayard-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bayard</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ogden</persRef>, were personally known to me, and I could answer for
							the respectability of their characters— But many others had applied, and
							would apply, with whom I had no acquaintance, but who would have a right
							to the same document from me which I might give to my most intimate
							friends— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beckett took the names of those
							two Gentlemen, and said that he would not put me to the trouble of
							giving any other paper than my Passport— He would see that no further
							difficulty on that account should be made at the Alien-Office— The other
							subject upon which I spoke to him was that of foreigners, applying to me
							for Passports to go to America— Also sent to me from the Alien-Office—
							He said that was because it was intended that no person should go to any
							Country without the consent of the Minister from that Country— I told
							him that every body; of every Country had a right to go to America
							without needing my Consent— I had no right to prevent any one from
							going— It would be certainly troublesome to me, if I should be required
							to furnish a document to every foreigner, of every Nation, going from
							this Country to the United States; but there might be an inconvenience
							in it, to this Government, for as I could not possibly know all such
							foreigners, and yet must give the same consent for all who should apply,
							it was possible applications for pretended foreigners might be made to
							me, when the person really intending to go might be forbidden by the
							Laws from leaving this Country— I told him I had put a visa, upon two or
							three Passports of foreign Ministers here, for persons of their Nation
							going to America, because they had stated they could not get a Passport
							from the Alien-Office without it; but I had refused giving Passports of
							my own to several foreigners, who had none, and one particularly this
							morning to a Jew, who from his appearance I suspected of having applied
							for it in reality for another person— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Beckett assured me that he would see that this matter should also be
							duly attended to at the Alien-Office— From thence I went over to
								<persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grubb</persRef>, and took with me several papers to be copied,
							relating to the Convention, which I requested him to bring me to-morrow
							Morning.— I returned home and sat down to writing— <persRef
								ref="gallatin-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Gallatin</persRef> came and took a Passport for <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">his father</persRef> and suite; and a separate
							one for <persRef ref="peter2">Peter</persRef> whom he intends to send in
							the Stage to Liverpool— I soon after received a Note from the <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry;adams-william;robinson-frederick">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, with their Draft Copy of the Treaty,
							from which our fair Copy is to be made out. I took it immediately to
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay’s</persRef> lodgings, and as he was not at home to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s— We collated it with the
							several previous drafts which had been agreed upon, and found it
							correct. But the Term Treaty, had been used in the preamble drawn up
							yesterday, and had escaped our attention— It was now in the draft Copy;
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin was desirous of substituting
							for it the term Convention— Because as the objects of it are limited,
							and many of the most important objects of a Treaty of Commerce are not
							included in it, the general denomination of a Treaty of Commerce seems
							improper for it. We concluded to leave the term in blank, in our copy,
							and to propose to the British Plenipotentiaries to insert the term
							Convention, on Monday— The Draft copy names the British Government and
							Plenipotentiaries first, in the Preamble and throughout the Treaty— I
							determined to have our Counterpart with the alternative, and shewed to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin the passage in the
							Instructions from the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef> to me of 13 March, on the subject of the precedence,
							and order of signatures in the Ghent Treaty— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin still thinks it a matter of no importance— He
							shewed me his draft of a despatch to the Secretary of State, to be sent
							with the Treaty— I suggested to him several considerable alterations, to
							which he readily agreed, and which will shorten the despatch by about
							one half— It was nearly seven O’Clock when I came home to dinner; and it
							was so late when we had dined that I had only time for a short walk in
							the Evening.</p>

						<p><date>2. VI:30. </date>I took a warm bath, in the house on rising this
							Morning, and then postponed the usual writing of my Journal, to prepare
							the draft, for our copy of the Treaty. The changes in the order of the
							parties were in the Preamble—in the first, second, and fifth Articles— I
							made the draft of them myself, and gave them to <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>,
							to be copied, with the draft received from the <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry;adams-william;robinson-frederick">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>— He called <pb n="283" type="ms"
							/>between ten and eleven, and I requested him to have the fair copy made
							out, and to bring it to me at the latest by eleven O’Clock to-morrow
							Morning. While he was with me, <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Joy</persRef> came in, and
							after Grubb went away, remained about two hours here in Conversation— As
							my opinions differ much from those of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Joy, and as I am by nature impatient of contradiction I permitted this
							Conversation to become too warm on my part— It was interrupted by the
							coming of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, soon after which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy
							withdrew. I shewed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay the note received
							with the Draft of the Treaty yesterday, from the British
							Plenipotentiaries— In this Draft I told him they had placed the marks
							for the Seals (L.S.) three and three in parallel lines by which it
							appeared that they meant to accede to our proposal as to the order of
							the signatures— They had also named the British Government and
							Plenipotentiaries first in the Preamble and throughout the Treaty, which
							was right for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> copy— But at the close they
							had put, done in <hi rend="italic">Duplicate</hi>, which was improper as
							the Counterparts of a Treaty are never called duplicates, and which
							might be, for the sake of insisting that there should be no variation
							between the two Copies— I had however directed that our Copy should be
							made out taking the alternative throughout the whole Treaty; always
							naming the American Government and Plenipotentiaries first, but without
							any change either of substance or in the words. I had ordered the place
							of the word Treaty to be left in blank, to be filled with Convention, if
							the British Plenipotentiaries would consent; and I had also directed the
							word duplicate to be left out, with a blank to insert it if they should
							insist upon it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay did not approve of
							the change I had ordered to be made; and said he thought I myself had
							agreed yesterday that it should be only in the preamble— I admitted
							having said that<hi rend="italic">it was not so material</hi>, in the
							body of the Treaty; but I had found on referring to the French Copies of
							the Treaty of Paris of 30. May 1814. that the alternative was also used
							in the body of the Treaty, and as this was to be a Precedent, I thought
							it best to make it complete— I then shewed M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay the Instructions from the Department of State to me of
							13. March— He said he thought it a matter of no consequence— That
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe’s</persRef> argument in the dispatch was a bad one—It was no
							good reason why we should make a point of such a formality because the
							European Powers thought it so important— For the most insignificant
							Powers, such as Spain, for instance, were those that insisted most upon
							these punctilios— I said this was a point to which all the European
							Powers always adhered— That I had always regretted that the United
							States had ever admitted a variation from it— That I had mentioned it to
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> at Ghent, and had then forborne to make a point
							of it, only because we had no Instruction to warrant us in so doing, and
							because I thought all the Precedents of our Treaties were the other way—
							This conversation on both sides was perfectly temperate, and
							good-humoured; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay left me— Within
							half an hour after, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin came in— He
							shewed me a Note that he had written this morning to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson, requesting, that the term
							Convention might be inserted instead of the term Treaty, so that the
							American Plenipotentiaries jointly, or I as one of them, might be at
							liberty to bring forward the other objects of discussion, which we had
							agreed for the present to postpone— He also shewed me the draft of the
							dispatch to the Secretary of State, to go with the Treaty; and in which
							he had made all the alterations that I had proposed— It was a sort of
							argument in favour of the Treaty which I had requested him to omit, for
							two reasons—one because if the Treaty was a good one, it needed no
							argument from us to prove its merits; and the other that in assigning
							our motives for admitting objectionable parts we referred to
							circumstances which it would be unnecessary to make known here; which
							they would be if the dispatch should be published. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had made the alterations
							accordingly, though he said they never published the dispatches, when
							the Negotiation succeeded— I then told him that I had given the Treaty
							to be copied, and had taken the alternative throughout the whole
							Instrument— Upon which he said in a peremptory and somewhat petulant
							manner— “Oh! that is entirely wrong—it will throw the whole business
							into confusion— Why, you yourself said yesterday it was not necessary in
							the body of the Treaty”— I said I had observed that <hi rend="italic">it
								was not so material</hi>, in the body of the Treaty—but if the
							British Plenipotentiaries gave up the point in the Preamble and
							ratifying clause it was impossible that they should object to the
							admission of the same principle in the body of the Treaty— I then shewed
							him the copy of the Treaty of Paris, which I have; printed in France,
							and in which the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">King of France</persRef> is
							first named in the first Article as well as in the Preamble— He was yet
							however not satisfied, and asked me if I had told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, of the directions I had given for
							making out our fair copy, and what M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							had said to it— I told him that I had— That M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay disapproved the directions that I had given, as he did,
							and thought the whole point of no importance— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin then said that I must give the transcriber orders
							to make out the copy, without any alteration in the body of the
							Treaty—which I peremptorily refused; and added in a heated and angry
							manner: “M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, you and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay may do as you please; but I will not
							sign the Treaty, without the alternative, observed throughout”— “Now
							don’t fly off in this manner,[”] said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin— Indeed Sir, said I; I will not sign the Treaty in any other
							form— I am so far from thinking with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							that it is of no importance that I think it by much the most important
							thing that we shall obtain by this Treaty— The Treaty itself I very much
							dislike, and it is <pb n="284" type="ms"/>only out of deference to you
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that I consent to sign it
							at-all— I should infinitely prefer to sign no Treaty at-all, being
							perfectly convinced that we obtain nothing by it, but what we should
							obtain by the regulations of this Government without it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that was entirely a
							different ground, which I admitted to be true; but said it was a
							sufficient motive for me to insist that the principle of the alternative
							as to precedence, should be settled completely throughout the Treaty.
							There would not be a particle of change in the substance, nor even in
							the words of the two copies— The transpositions were almost all in the
							second Article— They had all been made by the British Plenipotentiaries
							themselves, from our Projet, first delivered to them, and which he M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had drawn up— If the British
							Plenipotentiaries now objected to the transpositions in the second
							Article, I would propose to them to draw it up, without naming either of
							the parties, first, but using general expressions applicable to both, as
							had been done in the corresponding Article of the Treaty of 1806— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that the Article of which I
							spoke was indistinct, and obscure, owing to the use of that very
							phraseology; and he had for that reason purposely varied from it in
							drafting the present Article— I said that if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay chose to
							have the draft made without any variation in the body of the Treaty, I
							would immediately take it out of the hands of the transcriber and return
							it to them. They might then have the Copy made out as they pleased; but
							I should decline signing it, if it differed from the draft I had ordered
							to be made— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin left me with a
							request that I would wait (as I was going to dine out of town) until he
							could see and consult with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, which I
							promised to do— About half past four, I received a Note from Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Clay and Gallatin, requesting me to send
							them my copy of the proposed Convention, and also that sent to me by the
							British Plenipotentiaries, whenever my Copy shall have been completed—
							We were to dine at <persRef ref="clagett-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clagett’s</persRef> at Clapham
							rise— On the way I stopped at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb’s and
							found that he had not finished in his Copy the second Article of the
							Treaty— He had also made a mistake, which made it necessary to commence
							the copy over anew— I requested him to make out the entire copy anew, as
							I had before directed, and to let me have it by nine O’Clock to-morrow
							Morning— We then went and dined at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clagett’s at Clapham rise— Besides his own family, there were <persRef
								ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Dunlop</persRef>, Virginians— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Murdoch</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="rotch-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rotch</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clagett is a widower and has ten
							children—five sons, and five daughters two of whom are married— The
							eldest daughter, <persRef ref="kembel-virginia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Kemble</persRef> was there, with <persRef
								ref="kemble-thomas">her husband</persRef>— It was between eleven and
							twelve at Night, when we came home.</p>

						<p><date>3. VI:30. </date>It was near ten O’Clock this morning when <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>
							came with the Copies of the Convention; and that which he had made to be
							executed by us was precisely conformable to the directions which I had
							given him— I collated them together, with him, and marked with a pencil
							on the British draft copy, all the transpositions— I immediately sent
							over both the Copies to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, and gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb
							some other papers to be copied, ready for to-morrow Morning.— Just at
							eleven M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay came and introduced to me a
								<persRef ref="murray-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Murray</persRef>, a relation of one of the families of that name in
							New-York. They left me after a short visit and about half an hour
							afterwards, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin came with the copies
							of the Convention. He now spoke coolly on the subject of the
							transpositions, and I was of course usually cool and good-humoured— He
							said that I had sent the copies so late that it was impossible for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and him to have another copy made out
							in time for the Conference— They were obliged therefore to try the
							experiment of offering mine— But the <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry;adams-william;robinson-frederick">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> would have the best of the argument on
							two grounds— One was that he thought by the European usage, the
							alternative was adopted only when the <hi rend="italic">Governments</hi>
							were named, and was not extended to their Territories and Dominions, and
							the second was that in the present instance the alternation in the
							British Copy would not be complete— For there was one clause, which they
							had inserted in their copy, precisely as he had drawn it up— In that the
							United States were named first, and they had it so in their copy— My
							Copy had made no transposition in that clause, so that while our Copy
							would have the United States first named throughout the Instrument, the
							British Copy, would in one instance name the United States first also.
							Whereas if the two copies had been made alike that single clause would
							have shewn that there was no precedence assumed by Britain in the body
							of the Treaty. I answered him that I had called yesterday after
							receiving the Note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and him,
							upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb expressly to hasten him in
							making out the copy.— I had urged him and he had promised to let me have
							it by nine O’Clock this Morning— It was ten however before he came with
							it; and I had sent it over to them immediately after receiving it— That
							as to the two grounds of the argument, the transpositions in the second
							Article were all made by the British Plenipotentiaries themselves, from
							his draft— He had named the United States first—they had named
							Great-Britain first— The point therefore was made by them, and not by
							us— I consented to the transpositions for their copy— I adhered to the
							original reading for ours. If the use of the alternatives was confined
							to the naming of the Governments, why had the British Plenipotentiaries
							made the transitions from his draft? If therefore they urged the
							argument <pb n="285" type="ms"/>it would recoil upon themselves— It was
							true that they had inserted one clause subsequently drawn up by him,
							without making the transposition, and had inserted it in their copy,
							naming the United States first— If they should now desire that the
							transposition should also be made in that clause, upon their Copy I
							should readily agree to it— But there was one other passage in which
							British were named before American Vessels, and which I had left without
							transposition the same in our copy as in theirs— If they should object
							to transpositions in the body of the Treaty generally I should propose
							to make a new draft of the second Article, naming the two parties as
							such, so that neither should be named first— It was so in the
							corresponding Article of 1806. which I had examined since he was with me
							yesterday; and which far from thinking confused and obscure I thought
							was more clear and distinct than ours, and in much fewer words— He said
							it was much shorter, but certainly not so precise and intelligible— It
							was now twelve O’Clock, and we had agreed to meet the British
							Plenipotentiaries at half past eleven. I went down with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin in his Carriage— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay whom we overtook in Cavendish Square
							followed us— At the board of Trade we found only M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Robinson. He told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							that they agreed to substitute the term Convention instead of that of
							Treaty— I told him I had also omitted in our copy the terms, “in
							duplicate[”]— As the Counterparts of the same Treaty were not usually
							called Duplicates, and I thought the term improper— We had indeed done
							in triplicates the Treaty of Ghent— But that was because there were
							three Copies of the Treaty on each side— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin added that if we should now state this Convention to be done in
							duplicate it would be understood that there were on both sides two
							Copies.— While we were waiting for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goulburn and D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams, I recollected that I
							had left home without taking my Seal— I immediately went in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s Carriage, and returned with my
							Seal. I found on my return the British Plenipotentiaries assembled. We
							began by collating the copies— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson
							took our Copy as made out by my direction— I took and read the British
							Copy— Not a word of objection was made by the British Plenipotentiaries
							to any of the transpositions in our Copy— There were in the British Copy
							several errors in the Copy— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ellis</persRef> the Clerk who had made it out was called
							in, and made the corrections as the errors were noticed— Our copy was
							correct having been previously collated by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Grubb and me this morning— The two copies were then signed
							and sealed by the Plenipotentiaries on both sides. The three signatures
							on each side in succession—and those of the two Parties on a line. The
							American signatures and Seals being first in our Copy— And the British
							Signatures and Seals first in the British Copy— The alternative was
							complete, and assented to by the British Plenipotentiaries, without
							objection— I afterwards observed that it was best to agree upon the
							title, which we did— I wrote it on a separate piece of paper, to be
							inserted at the head of our Copy—naming the United States first— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn copied from mine, the title for
							their Copy, transposing the Order of the parties— The words “in
							duplicate” were omitted from the British copy as I had proposed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson said that they had readily agreed
							to use the term Convention instead of that of Treaty; and they should
							certainly be ready to receive any further proposals or Communications
							from us, as had been suggested to him in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin’s Note of yesterday, upon the subjects, the discussion of which
							had been by mutual consent postposned: but it was very possible that if
							those Subjects were to be discussed, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> would
							not be the persons whom the British Government would appoint for such a
							negotiation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said we had only
							desired it, that as we had reserved to ourselves the right of bringing
							forward those Subjects for subsequent discussion, either jointly, or by
							me, remaining the accredited Minister at this Court, it was to be
							understood that we did not mean by concluding this Convention upon
							subjects of minor comparative importance, to abandon that right— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay said that we should now the more
							readily leave the vastly more important objects relating to the
							belligerent and neutral condition, for future arrangement, as there was
							the prospect of an immediate termination to the war which has newly
							arisen, so that the questions most likely to occasion collision would
							again be dormant— But it was still to be understood that we considered
							all our claims as left entire. D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams
							said that our claims could in no manner be affected by this Convention,
							as on the other hand none of them were to be understood as admitted by
							Great-Britain— I observed that in consequence of what had been said by
							my Colleagues, it might be proper for me to say that it was not my
							intention to bring forward any further subject for discussions, without
							new Instructions to that effect form my Government— And that if I should
							receive such Instructions, I should of course address myself in
							executing them to the Department of foreign Affairs— With this assurance
							the British Plenipotentiaries expressed themselves satisfied.— On taking
							leave of them, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said to me, well,
							this is the second good job, we have done together— Yes, said I; and I
							only hope we may do a third; going on from better to better.— I returned
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to his lodgings, where M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay soon joined us— As we were coming,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said, well they got over the
							transpositions, very easily; but you would not have found it so, if D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams had had the reading of your copy,
							instead of Robinson— I said that might be. <pb n="286" type="ms"
							/>Immediately after we reached M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s
							lodgings, <persRef ref="delreal-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Del
								Real</persRef>, and another Gentleman two of the Carthagena deputies
							came in upon a visit to take leave— <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hasler</persRef> soon afterwards
							followed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin dismissed him quite
							abruptly, telling him that he was very much engaged—and as soon as he
							was gone, Gallatin said to me, laughing—[“]that is a man of very great
							merit, though I do treat him so roughly— He was sent by the Government
							to Europe to procure the Instruments for the general survey of our
							Coast— But he has outrun his time, and his funds, and his instruments
							cost £800 more than were appropriated for them, and he is embarassed now
							about betting back to America— I have engaged <persRef
								ref="baringbrothers">Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Baring</persRef> to advance the monies for the Instruments, and he
							is to go for his own expences upon his own credit— He has procured an
							excellent set of instruments— But he is a great politician, though his
							politics are of the right sort. And he is so great a talker that as we
							have no time to spare I was obliged to send him away.”— We now signed
							the joint dispatch to the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, to be sent with the Convention, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had ready prepared— He and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay signed their previous joint despatch
							which they gave to me with the accompanying documents, to have copied,
							and then transmitted to the United States. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay, intended to leave town at five O’Clock this afternoon,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin very early to-morrow
							Morning— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin told me that he should
							call upon me this Evening; though it would probably be late, and he
							requested me not to go to bed, but to have all the papers ready for him.
							We parted about four O’Clock, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							took leave— I returned home and was until dinner employed together with
							my Son <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef> in making a copy of
							the joint despatch, the original of which is to go by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, with the Convention— After
							dinner I went to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Grubb’s house, with the
							Convention to have the title inserted in his hand-writing, and to take
							the copies of all the papers, which he had been making, to go with it—
							He had nearly but not quite finished the copies— I took a half an hours
							ride, and on returning to his house found him ready— I left with him to
							be copied the despatch from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Clay and
							Gallatin, with the Documents, and took home with me all the other
							papers— It was past eleven, when I got home.— I made up the packet for
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, and waited for him until
							one in the morning. He did not come— I then went to bed— When I came
							home after signing the Convention I found several Letters; among which
							one from <persRef ref="fox-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fox</persRef> at Falmouth, enclosing a petition to <persRef
								ref="addington-henry2">Lord Sidmouth</persRef>, from a <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Hall</persRef>, master of an American vessel, going
							from Havre to New-York, from which four Passengers had landed, contrary
							to the Alien-Act, which had subjected the Captain to a penalty of forty
							pounds Sterling for each person— The petition was to be released from
							this penalty, on the ground of ignorance of the Law, which has but very
							recently been enacted. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox’s letter to
							me, was to request me to follow up the petition at the Alien-Office—
								<persRef ref="king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								King</persRef>, called upon me a few minutes afterwards— He had
							received a Letter from one of the Passengers requesting him to interest
							himself and to obtain my interference in their favour— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King that I would go personally to the
							Alien-Office upon the subject to-morrow. My engagements this day,
							preparing for the departure of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin,
							made it impossible— But I advised him to go to Lord Sidmouth’s Office
							and speak to him on the subject— I knew Lord Sidmouth would be glad to
							see him, as he had twice spoken to me of him— He said he knew three of
							the Passengers who had landed— They were persons of respectable
							character, and he was quite sure they had landed without knowing that it
							was contrary to Law— He would go to Lord Sidmouth, and asked my
							permission to use my name in speaking to him on this matter; which I
							readily gave him— I had also this day two applications for Passports,
							which I gave.</p>

								ref="beckett-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beckett</persRef>,
							and spoke to him of <persRef ref="u">Captain Hall’s</persRef> affair— He
							had not seen <persRef ref="king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							had certainly landed without knowing that it was contrary to the Law,

							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavenworth, from <persRef

								Wolcott</persRef>. Neither of them, nor M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rotch nor M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Appleton were at
							home. I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler at the Globe Coffee
							house in Fleet-Street, and went with him two doors from it and saw the
							Instruments— Theodolites, Transits, Sextants, and Barometers, at the
							Maker’s an Optician named <persRef ref="troughton-edward"
								>Troughton</persRef>. Hassler said the Instruments were the best
							that ever were made— I had not the skill to understand or judge of them—
							They were made of brass, copper, and Silver— I asked Hassler why he had
							not used Platina instead of Silver— He said it was because the
							contraction and expansion of silver by the changes of the Atmosphere,
							corresponded more with those of brass and copper, than did those of
							Platina. Troughton had however Sextants, with the middle arch of
							Platina—for which he said he charged two guineas more than for the same
							kind of Instrument with that arch in Silver—eighteen and twenty guineas.
							He had engraved the words platina and silver respectively on the
							instruments which had the arches of those metals— They are so much alike
							to external appearance, that before he adopted the expedient of thus
							marking them, some of the East-India Officers who had purchased of him
							the Sextants with Silver Arches, sold them for those with arches of
							Platina— So, said he, I have spoiled their trade. He shewed me the
							division lines in squares under the eye glasses of his telescopes, made
							of a thread of a Spiders web— The inventor of which, he told me, was an
								American—<persRef ref="rittenhouse-david">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Rittenhouse</persRef>. I asked him whether they were
							thinner than metallic wire could be drawn. He said three times thinner
							than the most attenuated wire— I enquired whether they were as durable—
							He said he had Instruments which had been thirty years in use, with the
							Spider’s thread yet entire. It was far more elastic than wire.— He also
							shewed me by an experiment, a very perceptible fall of the mercury in
							one of his Barometers by taking it up from the third to the fourth Story
							of his house; an elevation of only eleven feet. He said that an
							elevation even of the length of the Barometer caused a perceptible fall.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler goes with all these
							Instruments in a vessel to New-York— I found M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Delprat at home at the London Coffee-house, and much engaged
							upon his commercial affairs— On my return home, I called upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, who is yet unwell— I had taken
							with me the papers which at his request I had withdrawn from <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>,
							but he now told me I might keep them— He said if he should go to
							Liverpool and embark with <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, they would have time
							enough to make another copy of their despatch on their passage; but if
							he should not find himself better to-morrow, he would not go to
							Liverpool at-all— There was a vessel to sail from this Port, in nine
							days, and he would take passage in her— In that case I should have time
							before he sailed to get the copies made out, and could then return to
							him the despatch— I had some further Conversation with him respecting
							the wish of the <persRef ref="dallas-alexander">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, to sell the three Millions of Certificates of
							Stock which he sent us last September; and said that <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring</persRef> had told him that no funds had yet been sent for
							the payment due on the Louisiana Stock, here and in Holland on the first
							of this Month— That it was not publicly known, only <pb n="288"
								type="ms"/>because by the private arrangements of the Bankers in
							Holland with the Stock-holders there, the interest was paid annually
							there, on the first of January— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							made several calculations, from all which it resulted that the Stock
							could not be sold either here or in Holland at ninety-five per Cent.— I
							was just taking leave of him, when <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> came in, and said he
							had been calling at my lodgings to see me. He had received a note from
								<persRef ref="planta-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Planta</persRef>, <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh’s</persRef> Secretary, mentioning his Lordship’s wish
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot would be prepared to sail for
							America as soon as he should find it convenient.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Planta added that he had suggested to Lord
							Castlereagh Circumstances of a domestic nature, in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot’s family, which might render it
							inconvenient for him to go at present— Lord Castlereagh had said that
							his departure might be deferred, if the delay could be explained to me
							in a manner which would be satisfactory to the American Government— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot said that <persRef ref="bagot-mary"
								>his wife</persRef> was to be confined about the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of September— He had consulted his
							physician, who had told him she must not go, before her confinement—
							They would certainly be ready to sail by the first week in October— If
							on public considerations it should be necessary that he should go now,
							he would certainly go; but if it could be made agreeable to the American
							Government that his departure should be postponed for this occasion, it
							would be a great relief to him. I said that so far as related to the
							point of etiquette, I would answer for it that the delay should be
							explained entirely to the satisfaction of the American Government— As to
							public business, I had not the means of knowing how that might be
							affected by the delay.— Lord Castlereagh had told me there was a
							voluminous Correspondence received from <persRef ref="baker-anthony"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, upon Subjects
							which I understood related to the Execution of the Treaty.— I did not
							know how far that might continue to be managed by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker, or might require the presence of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot. That he could easily
							ascertain, and could shape his course accordingly— He said he would make
							the enquiries at the foreign Office, and see me about it again— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin concurred in the opinions I had
							given to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, and after he was gone, we
							agreed that there was no necessity for hurrying his departure— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that this Government never
							gave any powers to their Ministers in America— That all the business
							between the two Governments had always been transacted here— On
							returning home I found a note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Alexander Baring, with a packet for me, and a Letter to the <persRef
								ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring</persRef> from the Secretary of
							the Treasury— The packet contained Instructions to me of 23. May to make
							sale at the market price in London, of the Certificates of Stock sent
							last September by <persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Boyd</persRef>, in sufficiency to raise 246000 dollars
							for the payment of the interest on the Louisiana loan due here, and in
							Holland on the first of this month— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baring proposes to see me any morning at my convenience after twelve
							O’Clock.</p>

							supposed to the Lords of the Admiralty— There appeared to me no
							foundation after the Peace, upon which I could make an Official

							of the Government of the United States, <persRef ref="beasley-reuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley</persRef> had written to
							the <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador</persRef> here,
							demanding redress for the violation of the Spanish Territorial
							Jurisdiction— But it is evident that this claim is in the first instance
							to the Government of Spain— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray said,
							that <persRef ref="dixon-manley">Admiral Dixon</persRef> had offered to
							give up the Nanina, at Rio de Janeiro— So I had seen by the Papers; and
							that the offer had been accepted by the <persRef ref="u"

							present his memorial to the Lords of the Admiralty, and I told him it
							would give me pleasure if I could be of any assistance to him in
							promoting the object of his application— I received from <persRef
								ref="prince-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Prince jun<hi

								Gallatin</persRef>, and found him packing his trunks to take his
							departure for Liverpool— He said he should go in an hour from that time.
							He had found his complaint was only a severe cold, and as he knew how to
							manage that he would not wait here any longer— I went down to the
							Counting house of the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers

								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander
								Baring</persRef>, respecting the last Instructions from the <persRef
								ref="dallas-alexander">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>.— He
							proposed that I should send for the Certificates of the Stock, which are
							in the hands of <persRef ref="jackson-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jackson</persRef> at Paris, and that I should write to
								<persRef ref="willinkfirm">Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>

							undertake the sale of the whole— He said he should make an offer for the
							whole, of about ninety— Calculating then to dispose of the whole at 95.
							This was <pb n="289" type="ms"/>the <hi rend="italic">margin</hi>, upon
							which they always reckoned in their bargains with this Government— I
							told him that the American Stocks were rapidly rising in America— They
							must continue to rise— The embarrassment of the Government was
							momentary— The Revenue would now be flowing in abundantly— I believed
							the Stocks would soon be at par. He said the <hi rend="italic"
								>margin</hi> was not great—only from 90 to 100, but he thought the
							rise would not be within two or three years. There was a large amount of
							Treasury-Bills, to be withdrawn from circulation, and the payment of the
							principal of the Louisiana loan, would begin in the year 1818— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring agreed to call at my lodgings at

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander Baring</persRef> called upon
							me this morning at ten O’Clock, and we had some further Conversation
							together concerning the sale of the Certificates of Stock— We found upon
							examining the copy of the form of Certificate which I have, that the
							interest is expressly made payable semi-annually at Amsterdam— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring said that a Power to transfer, by
								<persRef ref="willinkfirm">Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Willink</persRef> &amp; <persRef ref="vanstaphorstfirm">Van
								Staphorst</persRef>, would therefore not be sufficient, because the
							Stock, with the Interest payable at Amsterdam, would not be saleable
							here— I asked him if the transfer could not be taken, with an engagement
							from me, or in the Confidence that the alteration would be made at the
							Treasury Department, so as to make the Interest payable here; of which
							there could be no possible doubt, as it would be much more for the
							convenience of the Treasury; and it had been made in the Certificates
							payable at Amsterdam only for the sake of making it more saleable there.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Baring said it would perhaps still
							be best to endeavour to make the sale of it there— At all Events, the
							Bills which the <persRef ref="dallas-alexander">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> had authorised the Bankers at Amsterdam to draw
							upon his house, should be paid. He would consult with his partners, and
							perhaps he would make an offer for the whole Stock; upon the Condition
							that no more of it should be brought into the market by the United
							States. He would also write to the <persRef ref="hopeandcompany">House
								of Hope’s</persRef> at Amsterdam, and see whether they, by
							associating themselves with the Willink’s &amp; Van Staphorst’s could
							not accomplish the sale of the Stock there— I told him it would
							doubtless be a great accommodation to our Treasury if it could be
							effected— For independent of this payment, we had now a Squadron in the
							Mediterranean, and I thought it highly probable that there would be a
							necessity of supplying them by Bills upon London— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring took the Copy of the Certificate of
							Stock, with him, and promised to make me his proposals at an early day.—
							He mentioned to me the Accounts of the Surrender of Paris by a Military
							Convention, on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> instant, and the
							sudden and Extraordinary death of <persRef ref="whitbread-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitbread</persRef>, who yesterday

								<persRef ref="mallison-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mallison</persRef> and <persRef ref="johnson-thomas4">Captain
								Johnson</persRef> occupied me also about two hours— Mallison is an
							inventor of a sort of Cork Jacket called by him a Seamen’s Friend, to
							save men from drowning— He has obtained from Parliament a sum of one
							hundred pounds Sterling, not, he alledges as a reward but to defray his
							expences in the experiments to prove the efficacy of his invention— He
							has been applying to Parliament for further encouragement—petitioning
							that every ship in the royal navy might be furnished with a number of
							the Seamen’s Friends. But as the Lords of the Admiralty discountenance
							the application the House of Commons has been inexorable to his
							petition. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mallison therefore comes to me,
							to offer his Seamen’s Friends for the benefit of the American Navy— He
							has sent me two of his pamphlets containing his demonstration of the
							superior merit of his invention, and his correspondence with the
							Admiralty Board here whom he has been unable to convince. I told him I
							had no authority to make a contrast for furnishing the American Navy
							with his Seamen’s Friends— That I could not undertake to judge between
							him who argued ingeniously that his was the best of inventions for
							saving persons from drowning, and <persRef ref="croker-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Croker</persRef> the Secretary to the
							Lords of the Admiralty, who had told the House of Commons that of
							fifty-two inventions for the same purpose presented to the Admiralty
							Board, this was the worst.— That if any American ships of War should
							come to England, the Captains might perhaps be authorized to furnish
							them with a suitable number of his Seamen’s Friends, if they thought
							them useful, and I knew of no other manner by which the American Navy
							could be supplied with them— He said that he should renew his
							application here, the next Session of Parliament—to the House of Lords—
							But as he could not much expect success for any thing that was opposed
							by any one of his Majesty’s Ministers, if he failed then, he should
							abandon all further attention to the subject— The occasional sale of his
							Seamen’s Friends, not being sufficiently profitable to compensate him
							for the time and expence that he bestowed upon them— Captain Johnson’s
							project is upon a larger scale than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mallison’s— He promises nothing less than to destroy the whole Algerine
							fleet, by submarine explosion. Captain Johnson brought this morning a
							draft of the Memorial, by which he makes this offer— He claims no pay,
							grant, or pecuniary assistance until he shall have accomplished his
							work; but only to receive half the value at a fair estimate of the ships
							that he shall destroy— I made for his Consideration several observations
							upon the terms of his proposal which I thought might be liable to
							objections, and he took it away with him to make such alterations in it
							as he should think advisable— Captain Johnson who says he is the
							depository of all <persRef ref="fulton-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fulton’s</persRef> plans; and who says he has improved
							upon Fulton’s Torpedo-system to such a degree that he can fix a torpedo,
							at the bottom of any vessel in spite of any defence that she can make,
							has long been urging his schemes upon the British Government, and says
							he told the <persRef ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of York</persRef>, who
							is his friend that if this Government would not purchase his secret he
							would offer it through me to the American Government— But among his
							proposals was that he should go with a ship of his own; but commissioned
							by the American Government, and totally independent of the Authority of
							any Officer, of the American Navy. I pointed out to him the
							inconveniences, and impracticabilities of this proposal— That he must be
							commissioned there was no doubt— But by our Laws his crew must be
							Americans, and he could not be commissioned in our Navy, without being
							subject to the regulations of the Navy, and of course subjected to the
							authority of the Superior Officers with whom he would have to
							co-operate— He said his only object was that he might keep his machinery
							free from inspection; that he had been exposed to that inconvenience
							here, by being placed under the authority of Officers, who would order
							him away from his ship, and then have his machinery examined according
							to their own pleasure. He would sell his secret itself if the American
							Government would purchase it, but if not he must be allowed to guard
							himself against the inspection of his machinery.— I distrust Captain
							Johnson’s project, precisely because it promises too much— <persRef
								ref="murray-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray</persRef>
							came and introduced to me a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hall</persRef> of New-York— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Murray said his uncle was occupied upon a Memorial to the
							Lords of the Admiralty, upon his claim, <pb n="291" type="ms"/>which he
							would shew me, when prepared; and he intimated a wish to see personally
							some of the Lords of the Admiralty concerning it. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall came to enquire concerning the rights
							of the Children of <persRef ref="mullett-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Mullett</persRef> deceased to his portion of the
							grant made by Act of Congress to the Claimants of the Yazoo-Lands— M<hi

								<persRef ref="evans-mary2;hall-sarah2;tobin-jane">three
								daughters</persRef>, two of whom are married, and one is a widow—
							The Assignees of Frederick Mullett claim the whole, on his supposed
							right of sole heir, or at least a double portion, as the only Son— There
							was a Will made by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mullett; but not being
							attested, it is a nullity here, and as I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hall in America— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall
							that the grant for the release of the Yazoo claims was certainly
							personal Estate, and as such must be distributed equally between the
							four Children— Even if it were real Estate, I believed that by the Laws
							of Georgia, the distribution would be the same— All the children must
							release, and all take the grant in equal portions— The time for making
							the release was limited to the first of January this year—the Act of
							Congress having passed the 8<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of March
							1814— But in this particular case the Commissioners had allowed a
							further extension of time. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall enquired
							whether I had any objection to stating my opinion in writing— I declined
							it as being a mere law question upon which I did not mean to give a
							professional and responsible answer— He asked me if I would give it
							verbally if one of the Assignees should call upon me— I said I would—
								<persRef ref="wilberforce-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilberforce</persRef> paid me a visit, and expressed to me his high
							satisfaction at the restoration of Peace between our two Countries— He
							spoke about an abusive Article in the quarterly Review against America,
							concerning which he had received from America, letters from two
							Gentlemen, one of them enclosing an Answer to it which he had not had
							time to read. He found the Article was ascribed to <persRef
								ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef>; he thought erroneously; and he should write to
							Canning about it— I said the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> was
							represented as being under the Patronage of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning—but the <hi rend="italic">Article</hi>, in two
							pamphlets answering it, which I had received from America, was ascribed
							to <persRef ref="southey-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southey</persRef>, who had however denied being the author of it, in
							a Letter, published in a late Courier. I explained to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilberforce the manner in which the
							friends of Great-Britain in America were affected, by such publications
							as that Article in the Quarterly Review— He said that he lamented it—but
							that those were not the general sentiments of this Nation, and that the
							Quarterly Review itself was a work of limited Circulation— Much more
							limited than that of the Edinburgh Review— I had Conversation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilberforce upon various other topics, and
							proposed to call upon him; but he said he was going into the Country for
							the Summer— The day was thus consumed until half an hour before dinner
							time; when I took a short walk; and a longer one after dinner with
								<persRef ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2">my three

							Peers, most of the foreign Ambassadors and Ministers, and a house full
							of Ladies as Spectators— The <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> came in, with Royal State, precisely at two. He had
							the Royal and Regent’s Crown’s born upon Cushions before him; but was in
							a military uniform, with a multitude of Orders, and over them the Robes
							of a Peer— He wore his Hat, and took his Seat upon the Throne. The
							<persRef ref="abbot-charles">Speaker of the House of
								Commons</persRef> in his wig and black gown, together with a few members of the
							house, all dressed in black appeared at the Bar of the House,
							immediately after the Regent was seated, and made a speech addressed to
							him, which he concluded by presenting to him a bill for raising six
							millions for the service of his Majesty— That and several other Bills
							were read by their titles, and when the Prince by a nod had expressed
							his Assent to them, a Clerk pronounced in very bad French the words Le
							Roi le veut, to some, and soit fait comme il est desiré to others— After
							which the Prince Regent read his Speech, and then the <persRef
								ref="scott-john2">Lord Chancellor</persRef> who stood behind the
							Prince, and at his right hand declared the Session of Parliament to be
							prorogued to the 22<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> of August— The Prince
							then rose and withdrew— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester told me
							that the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> had been in Town yesterday only for an hour, and probably
							would not come to town again before the Winter— After the Prince was
							gone, I saw <persRef ref="gambier-james">Lord Gambier</persRef>, who was
							there, but not in his Robes as a Peer— He was in a plain frock dress. He
							introduced me to <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>,
							to whom I apologized for not having called upon him— I was also
							introduced to <persRef ref="munster-ernst">Count Munster</persRef> the
							Hanoverian Minister, who has just returned from the Continent— The
								<persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fagel-henry">Dutch Ambassadors</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="freire-cipriano">Portuguese</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Sardinian Ministers</persRef> spoke to me of the reported capture
							by our Squadron, of the Algerine frigate— Lords Bathurst and Gambier
							also mentioned it. The Dutch Ambassador told me that he was informed of
							it by a Letter from the Dutch Minister at Madrid— The Spanish Ambassador
							asked if our Squadron had entered the Port of Cadiz— I said I believed
							they had not— He asked if they had attempted to enter— I did not know—
							He seemed to doubt whether it would be admitted, and intimated that
							there was a state of hostility between Spain and the United States— I
							said it seemed by the account received here that our ships had been
							admitted at Carthagena— I asked him what was the state of Relations,
							between Spain and Algiers— He answered that it was also between Peace
							and War— He said he had not any late Communication from his Court
							respecting the United States; but the last that he had received
							mentioned that the <persRef ref="onis-luis">Spanish Minister</persRef>
							sent to the United States had not been recognized— I said I believed he
							had been recognized since the Restoration of the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">king</persRef>, but that a <persRef
								ref="erving-george">Minister</persRef> had been appointed by our
							Government to Spain, whom the king of Spain had refused to receive— He
							said that was because the Spanish Minister in the United States was not
							recognized— From the substance of his Conversation I am not without
							concern that <persRef ref="decatur-stephen">Decatur</persRef> may meet
							with some difficulty there— I came home about three, and wrote until
							dinner time— In the Evening we rode to Kensington Garden, and left the
								<persRef ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2"
								>Boys</persRef> to play bat and Ball in the Park while we walked
							round the Garden— The walk was so much longer than we had expected, that
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was excessively fatigued, when we got
							back— I received the answer from <persRef ref="beckett-j">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beckett</persRef> to my Note of
							Yesterday, respecting <persRef ref="barney-joshua">Commodore
								Barney</persRef>; who he says was improperly detained by the
							Collector of the Customs at Plymouth— He does not answer my suggestion
							for a general order to exempt public messengers from detention.</p>

								<persRef ref="downey-alexander">Alexander Downey</persRef> came to
							ask assistance from me to enable him to return to America— He came
							yesterday with a number of others, but I could not then see them— He
							says there are many of them—he believes nearly two hundred who were
							taken in India; sent from thence to England, and upon their arrival
							here, about a fortnight since, discharged— That they have repeatedly
							applied at <persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley’s</persRef> Office, but have not been able to see him, and
							he has absolutely refused to give them any assistance or relief— That

							age— But her relations give her now no assistance, and she has no means
							of supporting herself and her children but working at making Straw hats,
							which is only during the Summer, and by which she cannot earn more than
							sixteen Shillings a week— Her father and brother are at Charleston South
							Carolina, where she wishes to go, or to New York— I told her that I
							could give her a Passport for herself and her family; but I could not
							undertake to pay the expence of their passage— I advised her to enquire,
							for some Lady who might be going, and who might want an attendant, and
							would thus provide a passage for her— She said she would make enquiries
							and call here again— <persRef ref="wilson-thomas3">M<hi

							the name of the royal authority— I gave him a History of the Paper
							currency of our Revolutionary War, and of the forgeries of the Paper
							which were issued on the royal side— The paper that he produced had the
							appearance of being among the forgeries— He said this paper had been
							paid at the time by <persRef ref="allen-andrew">Andrew Allen</persRef>,
							for a landed Estate in Pennsylvania— And he enquired if I knew where
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen was to be found— I said I

								<persRef ref="bond-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Vessel, by a British Officer in the Port of Antwerp, and two other
							Letters from Sailors, alledging that they are Americans, and have been
							impressed— Requesting him to make the proper Applications for their
							release— I also mentioned to him the case of the Seamen, who have been
							sent here as Prisoners of War, from India, and discharged here— And I
							proposed to him to send them home by one of the Cartels, which have
							arrived here, from America, and found all the Prisoners that were at
							Plymouth, already gone. He said he would make enquiries to ascertain
							what number there is of these Prisoners from India, and take proper
							steps in consequence to send them home. But he complained of the
							impositions practiced by many Sailors, who were continually coming to
							him to demand relief, and who would neither work, nor go on board
							vessels by which he had obtained for them passages to America— I
							enquired of him the means of writing to Gibraltar; and of the earliest
							opportunities of vessels going from this Port to the United States. He
							promised to obtain the information, and let me know this Evening or
							to-morrow Morning— He also mentioned to me a mode of sending parcels by
							the Mail Coach to Liverpool, of which I may in future avail myself.— I
							delivered three Passports for Americans, going to the United States, and

							was married by <persRef ref="white-william">Bishop White</persRef>, at

							the founder of the College, he was entitled to several privileges, which

								<persRef ref="james-i">James the first</persRef>— But it would be
							necessary to have the authentication of Bishop White’s Certificate of
							his own Marriage. And he must have it by the 5<hi rend="superscript"

							Cox to <persRef ref="bond-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Officers, to insult the Russian Officers and kill them in Duels— And
							that not less than five hundred Russian Officers were killed in such

							to a despatch which he had received from his Government, said it was
							their desire to give new activity and extension to their relations with
							the United-States— The despatch mentioned the commercial Treaty of 1799.
							which being only for ten years had of course expired— There was now only
							one Prussian Consul in America—<persRef ref="steinmetz-jacob">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Steinmetz</persRef>; at Charleston
							South-Carolina. He enquired whether any difficulty would occur by the
							American Government, in the admission of Consuls in other Ports—
								<persRef ref="forbes-ralph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ralph B.
								Forbes</persRef> had applied to be appointed the Prussian Consul in
							Boston, and he shewed me a list of the Ports which he had made out where
							he thought Consuls might be useful— They were Boston, Newport, New-York,
							Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Savannah and New-Orleans— I told him
							that I could assure him without hesitation that wherever the Prussian
							Government should think proper to appoint Consuls in the United States,
							they would be received without difficulty by the American Government.
							The Consular Establishment was sanctioned by the ordinary Law of
							Nations, and although it was customary to insert an Article in
							Commercial Treaties for their admission, and the manner in which they
							are considered, we conceived no such Stipulation as necessary, and
							received as freely the Consuls of Nations with which we had no Treaty as
							of those with which we had— It was however to be observed that in both
							cases we considered Consuls, as amenable to the Laws of the Country
							where they exercised their Offices. I requested him however to send me a
							minute in writing of the substance of what he said to me, and I would
							communicate it to the Government of the United States— He promised
							accordingly to send me a note. I wrote a short Letter to the Secretary
							of State, acknowledging the receipt of his despatches by Commodore
							Barney, and one to <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript"

							returned home, and for six weeks they heard nothing more of the affair—
							But then a Carriage drove up from a Public House in the vicinity of his
							Country House where they then resided, in which was a female infant,
							with an ample supply of all the clothing necessary for it, and a one

							Carriage, a Hackney Coach to the Public House— The Hackney Coachman had
							been traced; but he had been taken up by this woman in the Street— Had
							set her down again in the Street upon her return, and knew nothing

							with the Dublin Post-mark upon them, dated 20 and 21. December 1811. and
							signed <persRef ref="ramsay-philip">Philip Ramsay</persRef>. They
							enclosed the two halves of another one hundred pound Bank Note, and the

							place, but purporting to be from the Father of the Child, at New-York—
							It expressed the highest gratitude to Lady Hampden for her care of the
							infant— States that the mother had joined her husband, but some months
							afterwards had been seized with a violent fever, and died— That the
							father is still prevented by indispensable business from coming to
							England; but that his friend Ramsay will come and see the Child— The
							Letters signed Ramsay, made some excuse for being disappointed and
							prevented from coming. Lord Hampden said they had heard nothing further
							since that time— The War with America having come on shortly after the
							receipt of those Letters, they had not been able to have the proper
							enquiries made at New-York. But the child was now six years old, and at
							a boarding-school, and he was very desirous of ascertaining whether any
							such person as this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hill was at New-York—
							He shewed me the two Letters signed Ramsay, and that signed Hill. They
							appeared to me to have been all written by the same hand— But the
							signature F. Hill was in a different, and I remarked to him that I
							thought it a woman’s hand— He said the hand-writing had appeared
							suspicious to himself. The Letter signed Hill, being without date of
							time or place, was also suspicious— He had sometimes thought that some
							person had wrought upon the kindness of Lady Hampden’s disposition,
							knowing that they had unfortunately no children of their own; but she
							had assured him in the strongest manner that she had no knowledge of the
							persons whatever, except remembering to have been at a dancing school
							with the woman who had accosted her in Oxford Street, and professed to
							be the mother of the Child— I told Lord Hampden, that I would make
							particular enquiries of several respectable Gentlemen, inhabitants of
							New-York, now here; and also by writing to my friends at New-York itself
							if he wished; to obtain the desired information— He said perhaps an
							Advertisement in the New-York Newspapers, might lead to some discovery
							of the person. I said that I would procure to be inserted in the
							New-York Prints any thing that he would have drawn up in the form of an
							Advertisement— He said he would send me one— As he was going away he met
							my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> upon the Stairs, and
							asked me if he was at school— I said not yet— I was looking out for a
							school— He advised me to send him to Westminster— He always recommended
							Westminster, and had been there ten years himself. I received a Note
							from <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greuhm</persRef> the Prussian Chargé d’Affaires on the subject which
							he had verbally mentioned to me, which I immediately answered. Wrote

							an Englishman, settled and married in the United States— He had a
							special Passport from <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi

							State, dated in October 1812. and a Letter from <persRef

							who still remained at Washington although the War was declared, to
								<persRef ref="gordon-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>, Under Secretary of State, requesting permission
							that this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carver might be permitted to
							reside here for the purpose of attending Lectures at a Veterinary school
							or College— There was a letter from <persRef ref="rush-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rush</persRef>, stating that this
							Gentleman was coming out under the patronage and at the expence of
							several Gentlemen of Philadelphia— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carver
							stated that when he came out, the War was become so popular in England,
							that he apprehended, if he delivered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baker’s letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton, he should not
							be permitted to stay— He therefore kept it, and remained here in his
							character as an English Subject— He has now been here between two and
							three years— Has attended the Lectures at the Veterinary school, and has
							a diploma from the College, and an honorary testimony as having himself
							suggested improvements in the art— But his friends at Philadelphia, have
							not remitted the funds for his necessary expenditures. He is in
							considerable arrears at the College— The <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher">Russian Ambassador</persRef> has made him
							proposals for entering the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Service; but he would prefer returning to
							America, where he is married, and wished me to consult with a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Capper</persRef>, who was
							prevented by a fit of the gout from calling upon me, whether the benefit
							of his skill could not be preserved to the United States. I agreed to
							call upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Capper (whose address he gave
							me) to-morrow Morning.— The second was a fat, fiery faced Irishman, who
							said his name was <persRef ref="u">Duncan</persRef>— That he had been a
							merchant of Baltimore, and had suffered much by the <hi rend="italic"
								>spoiliations</hi> of the British, before the Orders in Council. He
							expected there would have been an Article in the Treaty of Peace
							establishing Commissioners to settle such claims, as there had been in
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay’s Treaty—and now he came to ask
							me whether I thought the English Government, would give indemnity for
							them— I said that we had used our endeavours to obtain an Article, of
							that description, in the Treaty of Ghent; but it had been inflexibly
							refused by the British Government— Then, said he, [“]we have been
							sacrificed, and I think the Government of the United States ought to pay
							us”— Address yourself, Sir, said I, to the American Government— I am not
							the American Government— I only, made the remark, said he— [“]And so,
							you think our case hopeless?”— “No— I do not say that— Every individual
							case must rest upon its own merits— I know not what the merits of your
							case are— You may still apply to the British Government, and if they
							think you have a just claim for indemnity, I presume they will grant it—
							As between the Nations, there is no prospect of success in making a
							claim for you.” He then took leave, apparently dissatisfied.— I received
							a Letter from <persRef ref="meulemeestermerchants">Mess<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Meulemeester</persRef> at Ghent,
							enclosing two others which they had received for me, and a bill of
							lading for my trunks which they have shipped at Ostend— I had been
							waiting six weeks for an answer to my letter of 7. June to them, and had
							written them yesterday a second, enclosing a copy of it, which was ready
							to be sent by the Post of this day.— The enclosed Letters were one from
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>

							1792. and with whom I once dined in London in 1795. I have not seen or
							heard of him since; until now—he writes from Leghorn— The Letter is

							<persRef ref="king-charles">King</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>Leavenworth</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">Ray</persRef>, and

								Beasley</persRef>, whether the vessel from Ostend, having my effects
							on Board, had arrived. From <persRef ref="lloyd-edward2"

								Capper</persRef>, in Ely Place, as I had yesterday promised <persRef

							and upon conversing with him I found, that he, and <persRef

							Gentlemen of Philadelphia, at whose expence they understood that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Carver was pursuing his studies in
							England.— He shewed me the subscription paper, which was signed by
							several respectable persons of Philadelphia; but I found on perusing it,
							that while recommending M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carver in strong
							terms, and saying that after his return he was to exercise his
							profession, under their patronage, and that of the agricultural Society,
							it only said that they had subscribed the sums against their respective
							names amounting in the whole to about 500 dollars, without promising any
							further contribution— I made this remark, to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Capper, and he fully admitted the fact—though he said he had
							been led by the strong terms in which the paper was drawn up to expect
							that the subscribers would have contributed further, and in that
							confidence had made the advances, which he now found inconvenient. He
							said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carver had observed the most
							rigorous economy— He had pursued his studies with the closest assiduity,
							and was now well qualified as a professor of the veterinary art— There
							was nothing in his conduct which he could rigorously blame; but he had
							written to his particular friend one of the subscribers <pb n="297"
								type="ms"/>to the commendatory paper, at Philadelphia, who had
							answered that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carver had no pretence to
							claim any additional contribution from those subscribers— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Capper, that under these Circumstances I
							could not pay the expences incurred by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Carver—and I thought his best expedient would be to accept the proposals
							of the Russian Ambassador— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Capper
							intimated a doubt whether the Russian Ambassador would make the
							requisite advances of money—there were considerable arrears of debt at
							the College, besides the £210 to him and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wilson— He said something of raising a subscription among the American
							Gentlemen now here— I thought there was little to be expected from that
							resource— I could at least undertake it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Capper said that Carver had asked him to apply to me, which he had
							declined— I called at the <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish

							There were frequent and heavy showers of rain, throughout the day—

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander Baring</persRef>
							concerning the Instructions from the <persRef ref="dallas-alexander"

							Loan, would be about £60000 more— The accounts were making out, and he
							would send them to me open, for my perusal and to be forwarded. He
							preferred leaving this balance to be provided for by the Secretary of

							for some authority from the American Government, or from the Minister at

								<persRef ref="wilberforce-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilberforce</persRef> is one of its principal and most active

								<persRef ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef>— He said he
							was upon the Establishment of the <persRef ref="george-iii"

							had been many years a member of Parliament, though not one at present—
							He said he was owner of the whole town of Milford-Haven; that is of the
							land upon which the town stands, and he appeared labouring with some
							project by which that place could be used as a Port for the commerce
							between the United States and this Country— He said and often repeated

							he wanted to sell now for two years purchase, and to work at his trade
							of a Shoemaker at Philadelphia. He was discharged from the Magnificent
							in May 1814. and since then had been able to obtain work, only for six

							Philadelphia, and could not tell the name even of the Street where he
							said <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> lived (only that it was the Street leading to New-York)
							and as he spoke with a broad Irish brogue, I dismissed him, with a full

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greville intimated to me, that a

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas</persRef> the Secretary of the
							Treasury. He is last from France, and likewise brought me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="jackson-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> at Paris; and one from <persRef ref="boyd-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyd</persRef> to <persRef

								Adams</persRef>— We had also a morning visit from <persRef
								ref="hewlett-john;hewett-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hewlett</persRef>. I took to
								<persRef ref="barney-joshua">Commodore Barney’s</persRef> lodgings
							two Packets of despatches for the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary
								of State</persRef>— He was not at home and his Servant knew not when
							he would leave town, but believed some day this week— <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>
							had called this morning, with the papers which I gave him on Saturday— I
							went to N<hi rend="superscript">o:</hi> 25. Charles Street Westminster,
							and engaged the two Chambers which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb
							had recommended to me; for an house to alight at when I have occasion to
							come to town— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb will attend at them
							from ten O’Clock till four every day. I called at the Engraver <persRef
								ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef> at N. 27 in the Strand
							to enquire for the Legation Seal that I had ordered. It was not ready— I
							called at <persRef ref="turner-richard">Richard’s</persRef> Coffee-House
							Fleet-Street, to see <persRef ref="thorndike-c">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thorndike</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Randolph</persRef> who had paid me
							visits last week— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thorndike is gone to
							France, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Randolph was out. Thence I
							went to <persRef ref="williams-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Williams’s</persRef> Finsbury Square— He was not at home, but I gave
							his brother <persRef ref="williams-charles3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles Williams</persRef>, a Letter to <persRef
								ref="willinkfirm">Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Willink</persRef> and <persRef ref="vanstaphorstfirm">Van
								Staphorst</persRef> of Amsterdam authorizing M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Williams to draw upon them for my account— I stopped at the
							General <pb n="301" type="ms"/>Post-Office, to give notice of my
							removal, and to enquire if Letters could be delivered to me by their
							Carriers at Ealing. I found they could not, and one of the Clerks to
							whom I spoke advised me to write to <persRef ref="freeling-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeling</persRef> the Secretary and
							mention to him the place, where I wished to have my Letters delivered. I
							walked home, and at eleven in the Evening went to a party at <persRef
								ref="wellesleypole-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Wellesley-Pole’s</persRef>— There were about seventy persons in the
							Company—two thirds of them at least, Ladies. Excepting the family, I
							found very few of my acquaintance—<persRef ref="graves-thomas2">Lord
								Graves</persRef>—<persRef ref="u">Count S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Martin d’Aglie</persRef> the Sardinian Minister,
								<persRef ref="neumann-philipp">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neumann</persRef> the Austrian Charge d’Affaires, <persRef
								ref="derayneval-maximilien;derayneval-alexandrine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> and Madame Rayneval</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="ouseley-gore">Sir Gore Ouseley</persRef> to whom I was
							introduced. He arrived, only two days since from S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg. I had some Conversation with him on the subject
							of Persia, whence he comes, and much with <persRef ref="bagot-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> on the topics
							upon which his Mission to America will be occupied. It was between one
							and 2 in the Morning when I came home.</p>

							also had more leisure for my Correspondence, and of course have attended
							more to it— Still a great portion of my time is consumed by visits, and
							by Applications for Passports, American Sailors, and English
							Projectors.— From this time however, a great and immediate change in my
							course of life will take place. We are to remove to-morrow into the
