                        <p><date>1. VI:45.</date> Just as I was rising, a firing of Cannon and of
                            Musketry, and the ringing of Bells announced the celebration of a
                            Holiday; it being the anniversary of the deliverance of Bruxelles; that
                            is of the entrance of the allies— The firing, and the Bell-ringing
                            continued the whole day through, at intervals, and in the Evening there
                            was an illumination of the City— <persRef ref="bauwens-lieven">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Bauwens</persRef> called upon me to
                            say that the Tribunal of appeal would not sit this day for business on
                            account of the Holiday; so that I must give up entirely the idea of
                            seeing it— At 11 O’Clock I went to the Old Palace, and saw successively
                            the Museum, the Public Library and Cabinet of Natural History— The
                            Museum contains a large and valuable collection of Pictures, by the
                            Principal Masters of the Italian, Flemish and Dutch Schools, with not
                            more than four or five Pictures by French Painters— They are in
                            seventeen Saloons or Chambers— Divided into three sets of Seven, five
                            and five. These last are all antient Pictures, painted before the
                            invention of oil-colours— The greatest and most curious collection of
                            the kind that I have seen— The Museum was formed in 1801. and the great
                            proportion of the best pictures was sent to it as presents from the
                            French Government at Paris. Most of them are large Church Pieces, and
                            there is of course too much uniformity in the subjects. There are none
                            of the small, gay and humorous pieces of the Dutch painters of vulgar
                            life— There are also several pieces of Sculpture and Basso Relievos; and
                            several prize pictures crowned by the Academy the last three years— The
                            antient Pictures, painted before the time of <persRef ref="vaneyck-jan"
                                >John Van Eyck</persRef> of Bruges, the inventor of Paintings in Oil
                            are very numerous, and in an excellent state of preservation— I was
                            nearly three hours in going through all the Halls, although they were
                            cold and uncomfortable, so that my guide at one time left me and went
                            away for an hour— The Library is also a numerous and valuable collection
                            of Old Books, but contains very few published within the last thirty
                            years. The librarian not being there I could not obtain access to the
                            Manuscripts. The Cabinet of Natural History serves for the Lectures of a
                            Professor attached to the Institution— It contains the usual Apparatus
                            for Electrical, chemical and Galvanic Experiments—Minerals, Marbles,
                            Crocodiles, Birds of Paradise and Rattlesnakes— The Electrical Machine
                            was different from any that I had heretofore seen, and was said to be an
                            improvement upon those heretofore used— There were two large circular
                            wooden vessel standing on their edges, with concave surfaces lined with
                            tin, and a small tin pipe in the Centre of one of them, placed opposite
                            to each other, each concave side towards the other; which the man who
                            attended me said were acoustic machines, to explain the theory of the
                            transmission of sounds— The softest whisper at one of them could be
                            distinctly heard by listening at the other, of which he gave me the
                            proof— And he told me that it disclosed the secret of the invisible
                            Lady, as no doubt it does— I took one of the Catalogues of the Pictures
                            in the Museum which is very indifferently composed; and left the house
                            just before three O’Clock— Went to a Bookseller’s shop, and purchased a
                            french Post Book of the present year for <persRef

                                Ranwet</persRef> came with the Compliments of <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Vlieshouwer</persRef>, and invited me
                            to a great Ball this Evening at the Vauxhall, where the hereditary
                                <persRef ref="william-ii">Prince of Orange</persRef> was to attend,
                            and where all the principal Noblesse of the City would be. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Vlieshouwer himself he said was not of the
                            Society; but an intimate friend of his, <persRef ref="chasteler-jean"
                                >General Chateler</persRef> had promised to introduce me, if I
                            should incline to go— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ranwet to
                            give my thanks to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vlieshouwer for his
                            attention, but as I intended to leave the City at five O’Clock to-morrow
                            Morning, I should want all this Evening to prepare for my departure— A
                            Ball was a species of amusement in which I could take no other share
                            than as a Spectator, and having only a few days to stay here when I came
                            I had neglected to obtain a presentation to the hereditary Prince of
                            Orange, and could not conveniently appear in a private Society where he
                            would be present.— I dined at the Table d’Hote and was the whole Evening
                            in my chamber, preparing to start at five to-morrow Morning— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Bauwens came and took leave of me, and
                            mentioned that he should return this Night to Ghent— I sent to his
                            lodgings the packets I had made up for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Smith and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bossuyt, with Letters for them
                            both— This afternoon I received a letter from my wife, of 6. January,
                            forwarded to me by <persRef ref="meulemeestermerchants">Mess<hi

                            <hi rend="italic">Cambray.</hi> The Horses had been ordered for me at
                            five O’Clock this Morning; and I was in waiting for them at that time—
                            It was however more than half past five before they came, and I left the
                            Hotel de Flandre <pb n="218" type="ms"/> just before six, as the day
                            began to dawn. My principal motive for departing so early was to reach
                            Valenciennes before six in the Evening, when the gates of the City are
                            shut, and being now a frontier town they are not opened for travellers
                            nor until six in the Morning— The distance from Bruxelles is eleven
                            Posts and a quarter, and the allowance to be made is of about an hour
                            for each Post; stopping only to change horses. From Bruxelles to Mons
                            seven Posts I had only one Postilion, for the four horses, but from
                            Mons, according to the French Ordinances I had two On the other hand
                            there were from two to two and a half franks at each Stage charged for
                            Turnpikes or Barrieres, until the French frontier, but which there
                            ceased. I was at Mons between 12. and 1. O’Clock and there met at the
                            Post-House a Gentleman belonging to Ghent, who recognized and spoke to
                            me, though I did not recollect having seen him there— I arrived at
                            Valenciennes at 5 O’Clock just before dark, and then determined to
                            proceed another Stage to Bouchain. There I found the Post-house was
                            without the walls of the City, and that there was no house to lodge at—
                            I was obliged therefore to proceed another Stage of two Posts to
                            Cambray— There I found the Gates were shut, but they were opened to let
                            us into the City— I stopp’d for the Night at the Hotel de Hollande,
                            opposite the Post-Office, where I alighted, at half-past eight in the
                            Evening— I had travelled 15 1/2 Posts in 15 Hours—never stopping but to
                            change horses. At Mons I was asked for my Passport— At Quievrain the
                            Netherland frontier again, and enquiry was made if I had any thing
                            subject to export duties— At Valenciennes, the enquiry was whether I had
                            any thing contrary to the king’s ordinances, but no examination of my
                            baggage was any where attempted or required. The Roads were as bad as
                            the Season could make them, and at the side of the pavement was a deep
                            mire— The whole road is paved— The ground was every where bare,
                            excepting here and there a small spot where there was a remnant of Snow—
                            The farmers in some places were ploughing up the ground— The aspect of
                            the Country had all the deadness and dreariness of the Season excepting
                            the wheat-fields where the grain had already shot up enough to cover
                            them with verdure— The Country is generally level, and in the
                            flourishing seasons one of the most fertile regions of the Earth— At the
                            Stages from Valenciennes and Bouchain I had to pay four and a half
                            franks for what the Postilions call <hi rend="italic">le decouché</hi>—
                            That is for the lodging of the Postilions and horses, who by the
                            shutting of the gates are prevented from returning home— From Bruxelles
                            I had to pay for half a Post, and from Mons and Valenciennes a quarter
                            of a Post in addition to the distance— An allowance granted at most of
                            the principal where the Postilions and horses are subject to longer
                            detention than at the ordinary Post-houses.— I had taken two small rolls
                            of bread into the Carriage, and had neither ate nor drank any thing else
                            since leaving Bruxelles. I took a very light Supper, and ordered my
                            horses at half past five to-morrow morning, the gates of the City being
                            opened precisely at six.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Gournay sur Aronde</hi>. I left the Hotel de Hollande
                            just at six of the Morning, and the City of Cambray at the opening of
                            the Gates. After travelling five Posts I reached Peronne, at half-past
                            ten O’Clock, and was detained there upwards of an hour, one of the iron
                            Cramps, that keep the spring over the right fore wheel of the Carriage,
                            and employed the blacksmith an hour to repair it. Two Stages further a
                            blacksmith came and examined the Carriage and told me that my fore-right
                            wheel was not solid— I thought he only wanted a job, and told him so— I
                            proceeded another Stage to Roye, and there as the Carriage stopp’d at
                            the Post-house a blacksmith came up, and told me that my left fore-wheel
                            was so loose that I certainly should not get along a quarter of a Post
                            further before it would break down— That it creaked so loud it could be
                            heard quite across the Street— Though I could not perceive that there
                            was so immediate a danger of the wheels this coincidence between two
                            persons who could not have had any concert together gave me some alarm,
                            and I stopped three quarters of an hour at Roye to have the fellies of
                            the fore wheels bound with ropes; something to the disappointment of the
                            blacksmith who had given me the notice, and who had calculated upon a
                            much longer job of work for himself— I then proceeded three stages
                            further to Gournay-sur-Aronde, where I resolved to stop for the Night,
                            though it was only half past six in the Evening, and I had travelled
                            only twelve Posts this day. With my precarious wheels I thought it
                            better to travel before daylight in the morning rather than after dark
                            in the Evening. I lodged at the Hotel du Grand Cerf, and ordered the
                            horses to be ready at 4 O’Clock to-morrow Morning.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>. At a quarter past four in the Morning I
                            took my departure from Gournay-sur-Aronde, and reached Pont Sainte
                            Maxence, the second Stage, just after day-light.— On starting from this
                            Stage, I found a Bridge over the river Oise, which had been blown up
                            last Winter to stop the passage of the Cossacks, and which they are now
                            rebuilding. This was the first and only trace of injury to the Country
                            from the late War, that I perceived on the road. The Bridge is already
                            sufficiently restored for foot-passengers but not for Carriages— I
                            crossed it myself and waited on the South side of it for my Carriage
                            which went over in a ferry boat, about two hundred yards below. I met on
                            the Paris side of the Bridge a Miller, who told me that the Bridge had
                            been blown up to stop the Cossacks— 800 pounds of powder he said had
                            been employed for the purpose. I heard the name of the Cosacks mentioned
                            only one other time upon the road; and that was by a Postilion whose
                            horse was restive and threw him off. He called the horse Sacré Cosaque
                            in Revenge— As I approached Paris the drivers became more alert in their
                            movements— My Carriage was not stop’d at-all for the examination of
                            baggage at the entrance of the City, and at one O’Clock in the afternoon
                            I alighted at the Hotel du Nord Rue de Richelieu, a house which had been
                            recommended to me by <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>. I took the only
                            vacant Apartments in the house; which are two small chambers in the
                            second Story, upon the Street. There is a Restaurateur or Cook in the
                            house. I engaged a Valet de Place named <persRef ref="louisservant"

                        <p>The regular payment is 1 1/2 frank by the Post for each horse— The
                            Ordinance allows only 75 Centimes per Post for each Postilion, but the
                            usage is to give them 1 1/2 frank, the same as for a horse, and they are
                            never satisfied with that. It is indeed an universal principle with them
                            to ask for more, whatever you give them. I usually gave them half a
                            frank for the two. The number of beggars that crowd round your Carriage
                            at every Post-house is from 10 to 20. and most of them objects of great
                            wretchedness— The Blacksmith appears with equal regularity in search of
                            his job; examines very closely the Carriage and gives notice of all
                            necessary repairs. The aspect of the Cities and of the Country is
                            precisely what it was 30 years ago.</p>

                                Crawford</persRef> had mentioned to me yesterday that there would be
                            a cercle diplomatique at Court to-morrow, and asked me if I chose to be
                            presented to the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">king</persRef> and royal
                            family— I had answered that I would, and called this morning upon M<hi

                            would be necessary to go— He desired me to call on him at Noon. I also
                            took and left with him the three Millions of dollars Certificates of

                            Marbois’s Cabinet at a quarter before 9 this morning, which we did— He
                            requested a Gentleman to accompany us, with his grand daughter, a girl,
                            of eight or nine, to the Tribunal, where we obtained seats. The Court
                            opened at ten— There was a President, with eight associate judges. The
                            chamber where the Court sits is very small— I think not thirty feet
                            square— And the crowd of Spectators so great, that one of the doors of
                            the Hall was broken down, and there was danger that some fatal accident
                            would have happened— The cause had already been <pb n="222" type="ms"

                                Tripier</persRef> the Council for the father, Louis Buonaparte to

                                    >r</hi> Bonnet</persRef> the Advocate for the Duchess to make
                            his concluding observations on the reply. It is a Cause upon which in
                            the United States no Court could have jurisdiction— There are very few
                            cases in which it would occur here. The basis of Tripier’s Argument was
                            the paternal authority; that of his opponent’s was the interest of the
                            child— There was scarcely any recurrence to first principles; no
                            exposition of the Laws of France or of other Nations upon the subject—
                            These had apparently formed the materials of the preceding argument— The
                            opinions of <persRef ref="daguesseau-henri">Chancellor
                                d’Aguesseau</persRef>; of <persRef ref="jolydefleury-guillaume">M<hi

                            Procureur General at a Court of Cessation had been cited by Bonnet, and
                            Tripier commented upon them— He spoke about an hour and a half— Bonnet
                            closed in about half an hour— The Attorney General, who in the French
                            Courts is a sort of mediator between the parties, an Amicus Curiae, like
                            the Judge-Advocate of a Court-Martial, is to sum up the cause on both
                            sides next Friday; to which time the cause was for that purpose
                            adjourned. It appeared by the admission of the Council on both sides,
                            that in the case of a legalized Separation of the parties from bed and
                            board, the Court would have a discretionary power to commit the child
                            either to the father or mother, as they should think its own interest
                            would dictate— The question was whether such a Separation existed— A
                            Separation in point of fact has existed for seven years— The family
                            Statutes had regulated how such Separations were to be legalized in the
                            Imperial family.— And that was to be by the mere authorisation of the
                            Emperor, without judicial process or formality— Of this authorization in
                            the present case the evidence was as loose, and imperfect, as the
                            principle was arbitrary and inconsiderate— It was merely a letter from
                            the Grand Marshal of the Palace <persRef ref="duroc-geraud"
                                >Duroc</persRef> to the Mother, after the abdication by Louis of the
                            throne of Holland, declaring that by the <persRef
                                ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor’s</persRef> authority he had
                            ordered possession to be taken in her name, of the Hotel belonging to
                            her husband in Paris, and had assigned a million of franks for her,
                            500000 for the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon3">Grand Duke of Berg</persRef>, (the Son in question) and 250000
                            franks for the <persRef ref="bonaparte-charles2">youngest son</persRef>. And this is the proof upon which the Court
                            is called to pronounce the dissolution of the father’s rights and his
                            authority over his child. The lawyers were both fluent and eloquent
                            Speakers; but both have bad voices, and Tripier speaks thick, with an
                            incapacity of uttering either the letters <hi rend="italic">r</hi> or
                                <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. After the adjournment of the Court I paid

                            noon, and go out with me for the purpose. He came accordingly and we
                            walked— Among the houses to which I went was the Hotel de Valois, the
                            same house where I lodged with <persRef key="adams-john">my
                                father</persRef> in 1778. April the first time I ever was at Paris—
                            It was then a magnificent and elegantly furnished Hotel— It is now
                            altogether in decay, and scarcely furnished at all— Yet the price of the
                            Apartments is as high as at the best Hotels— We also went to the Hotel
                            d’Orleans, Rue des Petits-Augustins, and to one or two others, but I
                            concluded to take lodgings for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith for
                            one week at the house where I am the <pb n="223" type="ms"/>Hotel du
                            Nord. I went with Todd, rather by accident than design into the Salon
                            d’Exposition and the National Museum, where, intending to spend half an
                            hour, we passed three whole ones, and finally were obliged to withdraw
                            at four O’Clock when the doors were to be closed. The multitude of
                            objects was such as left my mind in a state of confusion— The Apollo;
                            the Laocoon, the Venus de Medicis, with a great number of other antique
                            Statues—the transfiguration of <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello"
                                >Raphael</persRef>, the Descent from the Cross by <persRef
                                ref="rubens-peter">Rubens</persRef>, and all the master-pieces of
                            painting here collected, contrasted with the glare of colouring, and
                            unnatural attitudes of the pictures at the exposition, took from me all
                            faculty of meditation and almost of discrimination— It was five O’Clock
                            when I came home; and I spent the Evening in my chamber; writing; and
                            endeavouring to retrieve the arrears of this Journal, which had already
                            run up to nine or ten days.</p>

                            rise early the next morning; of which this day was an example— I had
                            agreed with the <persRef ref="brito-jose">Chevalier Brito</persRef>, to
                            meet him at a quarter before 3 O’Clock P.M. at the Library of the
                            National Institute, to attend the meeting of the first Class which is
                            held every Monday at that hour— <persRef ref="pichon-louis">M<hi

                            successively after two O’Clock, and detained me at home until past 3— I
                            then went first to the Bibliotheque du Roi, where I had by mistake
                            supposed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brito had appointed to meet me—
                            It was already shut, upon which I went to the Institute, and found the
                            Library; but it was more than half past three— Brito was not there— The
                            meeting had begun at three, and the door-keeper told me that I could not
                            enter without a ticket, or being introduced by a member. I then looked
                            over the Salon d’exposition of designs in Architectures and afterwards
                            returned home, walking round, by the Pont Royal, and the Garden of the
                            Thuileries. I find the alterations in them less than I had expected—
                            After dining at home, I went to the Theatre of the Odeon, and saw Il
                            Matrimonio Secreto, the Master-piece of <persRef ref="cimarosa-domenico"
                                >Cimarosa</persRef>; the most enchanting Music that I ever heard—
                            The house was not full. I came home before eleven.</p>

                            she said, j’interdis tout discours sur l’economie politique— Ah! je

                            to the Theatre François, to see the Tragedy of Esther— She invited me to
                            come and see her again, and said she was at home almost every evening.
                            She also apologized for being obliged to leave her company so soon, pour

                            Morning— I called with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith upon

                            I found some company; Ladies and Gentlemen; all unknown to me.— He

                            had been taken from it when six months old and from America at four
                            years and a half— She had forgotten the English language, and afterwards
                            learnt it here. I asked the Count to procure admission for me again at

                            d’Assise at a jury trial. I asked him how the trial by jury was found to
                            succeed here; he said not well— That the Jurors were dissatisfied with
                            their functions and always leaned too strongly in favour of the accused—

                            examining the pictures which were offered to her for sale— There was a

                            16000 franks, for the Julio Romano alone 8000— A five frank piece would
                            have been more than the worth of the whole. Madame de Laval was not the

                            Rivers; because among the Monuments of Antient Sculpture which it
                            contains are two enormous River Gods, the Nile and the Tyber. The only
                            expositions in this Hall are Statues, Busts, and other samples of

                            are restored— The Modern Sculpture of the exhibition is in the same
                            Halls with the Antiques, and offer subjects for comparison to estimate
                            the relative perfection of the Art at the present day.— I am still not

                            closed, and I had just entered the Hall of the Apollo, when the company

                            The house was crowded— The air of Vive Henry quatre was performed, and

                            confined to his chamber sent me his own ticket. The hour marked upon it
                            was precisely eleven— We proceeded immediately, but were so late that we
                            found the hall already crowded and could obtain but very indifferent
                            places— There was a Mass performed previously to the installation; in
                            another Hall which was also much crowded, so that those who heard the
                            Mass could not be present at the installation. After the Mass the

                            Presidents and forty Counsellors or Members of the Court, the Procureur
                            General and his six deputies and the Clerks— The Chancellor d’Ambray
                            read a Speech, stating the motives upon which the <persRef
                                ref="louis-xviii">king</persRef> had seen fit, to re-constitute this
                            Court, the Supreme Court of appeal from all the Courts of the kingdom—
                            The principle assumed was that the Court could not be legitimate unless
                            constituted by the king— Some, a small number of the former members have
                            been removed. Their appointments had been for life—but peu importe, for
                            that said the Chancellor, as nothing but the kings appointment could
                            make them irremovable— The Chancellor paid many compliments to the
                            members of the Court who were retained, and most particularly to the new
                            made first President, <persRef ref="deseze-remuin">M<hi

                            finished his speech there was a general clapping of hands, of which some
                            of the judges in their scarlet Robes set the example. A plain young man
                            standing next to me, said with some emotion—Il me semble qu’on ne
                            devroit pas applaudir un Chancelier de France— The first President
                            Deseze followed next in another written speech in which he returned with
                            fourfold interest all the Chancellor’s compliments, and spoke with
                            eloquence of <persRef ref="stlouis">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>

                            Louis 18— The Procureur General made a very short speech which was not
                            clapped— That of the first President had been applauded though not quite
                            so much as the Chancellor— They all speak thick, and all have harsh and
                            inharmonious voices— After the speeches the Oath was administered to the
                            members of the Court— It was first read by one of the <pb n="226"
                                type="ms"/>Clerks, and then the members of the Court were called
                            over by name; each member of the Court rising as his name was called,
                            extending his arm and hand to the elevation of the shoulder, the palm of
                            the hand downwards and saying je le jure—after which the procureur
                            general demanded that the Ordinance constituting the Court and the
                            proceedings of the day should be registered, and the Chancellor declared

                            three minutes in the same manner, and then left me and accosted another
                            gentleman in the same manner— We were much surprized, and some of the
                            company said he must be crazy, until a Gentleman smiling said it was
                                <persRef ref="u">Monsieur Lécomte</persRef> a Ventriloquist, and
                            slight of hand juggler—he was there for the amusement of the company— He
                            soon after returned to me, and asked me if I had understood what he had
                            said to me before— I said not one word— He said that it was merely a
                            manner of speaking, by which a person standing on one side of him could
                            understand him while a person on the other could not— He was then
                            continually passing round among the company and took away from five
                            gentlemen successively the crosses suspended at their button-holes— The
                            company then passed into the next chamber, and M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lecomte entertained us for three hours with slight of hand
                            tricks and ventriloquism— The last was the most curious— He performed a
                            sort of extemporaneous play, personating a man, his wife, a door keeper,
                            a neighbour and an infant with a succession of dialogues in all those
                            voices. He had an assistant, who towards the close of the Evening,
                            affected to quarrel with him; and for some time part of the company were
                            uneasy apprehending an unpleasant Scene; it terminated however by a
                            reconciliation upon which his assistant, composed, sung, and recited
                            couplets in honour of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
                                Alexander</persRef>, of the <persRef ref="laval-ekaterina">two

                            by calling La Mère des Graces— The entertainment finished with verses
                            recited by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lecomte himself in honour of
                            the family and of the company, finishing with the declaration et

                        <p><date>23. VII:30.</date> The <persRef ref="freteau-emmanuel">Baron
                                Fréteau de Pény</persRef> to whom <persRef
                                ref="barbemarbois-francois">Count Marbois</persRef> had introduced
                            me at his house last week, and who was then one of the Procureurs
                            Généraux at the Court of Assizes, had promised to procure for me a
                            ticket to attend at the Court of Assize at a very interesting trial—
                            Yesterday I received from him a Card, enclosing a ticket for admittance
                            into the interior of the Hall, this day— I went at nine O’Clock this
                            Morning, and at three successive doors was stopp’d by Centinels keeping
                            guard, with orders to let no person in; not even with tickets— After
                            waiting nearly half an hour, I finally obtained admission— The Hall was
                            extremely crowded— It was however nearly 11 O’Clock when the Judges and
                            Jurors came in— The President of the Court <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Bastard de l’Etang</persRef> having
                            taken his seat the Court was opened without any formality by a Crier—
                            Twelve jurors, and two supplementary jurors were sworn, in a similar
                            manner to that of the Oath taken by the members of the Court of
                            Cassation— That is, the jurors Oath was first read by the Clerk, and
                            then every Juror as called out by name rose and said Je le jure— The two
                            prisoners had been previously <pb n="227" type="ms"/>brought into Court.
                            Their names were <persRef ref="dautun-charles">Charles Dautun</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="u">Girouard</persRef>. They were charged with the
                            murder of two persons; the Aunt and the <persRef ref="u"
                                >brother</persRef> of Dautun— There was but one jury for the trial
                            of both the prisoners and for both the murders— The act of accusation
                            was read to them, and both answered they were not guilty of the charges—
                            The Procureur General, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Giraudet</persRef> addressed the Jury and opened the cause to them;
                            repeating with some additional details, and with occasional comments—
                            The President then began the examination or interrogatory of the
                            accused, an incident altogether incompatible with our practice but which
                            forms a very essential part of a french trial. In this case it consumed
                            three hours of time during which the President was scrutinizing every
                            part of the interrogatories to which the accused had been previously
                            subjected, comparing the answers of the two prisoners with the testimony
                            of the witnesses, and calling upon the accused to account for every
                            inconsistency of their own, and for every variance between their answers
                            and the other testimony— Girouard had uniformly denied every thing—
                            Dautun at four several previous interrogatories had told four different
                            stories— At the first he had denied every thing— At the second he had
                            charged Girouard and himself with the murder of the brother— At the
                            third he had charged himself with both the murders, and exculpated
                            Girouard from both— At the fourth he had again denied every thing, but
                            said he had received from Girouard the key of his brother’s chamber— In
                            this he now persisted— The examination being finished several witnesses
                            were successively called in until near six O’Clock, when the Court
                            adjourned to half past nine to morrow Morning. The witnesses in the
                            first instance are kept in a separate chamber so that those examined
                            subsequently first do not hear the testimony of those called in before
                            them— But after being once examined they are suffered thenceforth to
                            remain in Court.— I came home, dined and went to the Odeon Theatre,
                            where I saw Amélie, La bonne Mère, and Une journée à Versailles,
                            performed by the French Company— It was near midnight when I came
                            home.</p>

                            Justice, and found still greater difficulty in obtaining admission than
                            yesterday— My ticket had not been returned to me, and I took this
                            morning the Card from the <persRef ref="freteau-emmanuel">Baron
                                Freteau</persRef> to me in which it had been enclosed— With this I
                            finally got in, but this was also now taken from me and not returned. At
                            half past nine the Court met; and the examination of witnesses was
                            continued untill half past five— The last person examined was <persRef
                                ref="u">Girouard’s</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="u">wife</persRef>, at his own demand, with the consent of
                            the <persRef ref="u">Procureur Général</persRef>— At half past five the
                            Court adjourned to seven— I went home and dined and immediately returned
                            but then found it utterly impossible to obtain access to the Hall— After
                            waiting a full hour at the doors, I gave it up and went to the Theatre
                            of the Odeon— They had finished their first play and just began upon the
                            second; which was La Petite Ville; and that was followed by L’auberge de
                            Calais one of the numerous plays lately written here in ridicule of the
                            English. It was again near Midnight when I came home.</p>

                        <p><date>25. VII:45.</date> I learn by the newspaper this Morning that the
                            Court of Assize sat almost the whole Night through upon the trials of
                                <persRef ref="dautun-charles">Dautun</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
                                >Girouard</persRef>; the first of whom was found guilty of both the
                            murders, and the other acquitted of both by the Jury— Sentence of Death
                            was immediately pronounced upon Dautun by the Court, and Girouard was
                            immediately liberated— The <persRef ref="u">President</persRef>
                            pronounced the judgment at three O’Clock this Morning.— I missed after
                            all the most important part of the trial—the defence—the argument of the
                            Council for the prisoners, and that of the <persRef ref="u">procureur
                                général</persRef>; and the judgment delivered by the President. In
                            the examination of the witnesses, I observed many differences from the
                            practices to which we are accustomed. There was no cross-examination— No
                            objections to any questions, by the Council for the prisoners— In fact
                            they never appeared or spoke during the whole of the trial so far as I
                            heard it.— This laborious dissipation, disqualifies me for all serious
                            occupation at home— My journal has again run several days in arrear, and
                            I neglect the writing of many letters which ought to be written. After
                            writing about an hour this morning, I walked out and lost myself in the
                            Streets of the City two or three hours— Returned just in time to dine at
                            half past four, and then went to the Theatre des Varietés— I saw Patron
                            Jean, le Ci-devant Jeune-homme; Les Anglaises pour rire, and les
                            Habitans des Landes— I had been led to expect much humour and wit in the
                            two last pieces, but they appeared to me flat and insipid— The Parisians
                            are delighted with a coarse and vulgar caricature of English women; but
                            there is nothing ingenious in it— Le ci-devant jeune homme, of which I
                            had heard nothing amused me more than all the rest— A rake of 60, with
                            his doctor and his Mistresses, his drugs, and his debauches, affecting
                            the licentiousness of youth, and tortured with gouts and rhumatisms, was
                            inimitably performed by <persRef ref="potier-charles">Potier</persRef>,
                            one of the principal actors at this Theatre— They begin at 6. an hour
                            sooner than the others; but finished this Evening not before eleven.</p>

                            him to the Palais Royal; where I was presented to the <persRef
                                ref="louis-philippe">Duke of Orleans</persRef>— He asked me whether
                            I was the son of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams who had been
                            President of the United States when he was in America, and on my
                            answering in the affirmative, he said he saw the resemblance between me
                            and my father; but did not recollect having seen me in America— I told
                            him that I was at that time in Europe. He said he had a very grateful
                            remembrance of the hospitality with which he had been treated in
                            America, and was very happy to make my acquaintance— The presentation
                            was over in less than a quarter of an hour, and I returned to my
                            lodgings, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrow immediately
                            afterwards called to take my letters and dispatches for America— He said
                            he should leave the City about the middle of the day to-morrow, and
                            asked me for letters of Introduction to any of my friends at Washington.
                            I promised to bring or send them to him before he should go— I then went
                            and left Cards at the Hotel of the <persRef ref="lebrun-charles">Duke de

                            a quarter before three I went to the Palais des Arts, where I met the
                            Chevalier de Brito, and attended at a meeting of the first Class of the
                            National Institute— <persRef ref="andreossy-antoine">General
                                Andreossi</persRef> read the conclusion of a Memoir upon the
                            aqueducts of Constantinople, which he had commenced last week— Several
                            Reports were read, and among the rest one upon a new printing-press
                            invented by <persRef ref="stanhope-charles">Lord Stanhope</persRef>—
                            Part of a Memoir by a physician of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
                            Domingo upon the geological composition of the West-India Islands was
                            read; but it was so tedious that it soon drove away part of the company,
                            and shed poppies upon those that remained. I was not a little amused at
                            observing numbers of the grave academicians slumbering in their chairs,
                            while it was with extreme difficulty that I preserved myself from the
                            infection. After the Memoir had wearied out two successive readers, the
                            President observed that the Class had heard enough to form a sound
                            estimate of its merit, and appointed a Committee to report upon it—
                            There were about 30 members of the Class present at the meeting; they
                            came and went away as they pleased, and were often engaged in separate
                            conversations two or three together, requiring the use of the
                            President’s Bell to restore silence— The only person among them whom I
                            knew was <persRef ref="humboldt-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            four the President declared the Seance levée— I came home, and soon
                            after went and took up <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi

                            that he gave him very substantial reasons against it— Todd informed me

                            suppose inseparable from a visit to Paris— I now scarcely ever rise
                            before seven— Often but a few minutes before eight— I can do little and
                            seldom any thing more than the reading of the morning before breakfast,
                            which is at nine. From that time until two in the afternoon, I
                            appropriate to writing, when not otherwise engaged— But I have several
                            times been called abroad immediately after breakfast, and for the rest
                            of the day; and at other times visits to be paid or received have
                            occupied all the morning. Between two and five, I walk for exercise, and
                            for curiosity and amusement— I dined at five, when at my own lodgings—
                            The usual dining hour abroad is six. I go to some one of the theatres
                            after dining at home, and return from them between eleven and twelve at
