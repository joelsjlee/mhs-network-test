							Intendant <persRef ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean">Count D’hane de
								Steenhuyse</persRef>, the Mayor, whom we did not find at home, and
							to the British Plenipotentiaries— There was a single Servant there, who

							waiting a few minutes in the room below, came away and left Cards— The
							Intendant received us in a full Court dress— We also called at <persRef

								>Madame De Naeyer</persRef> mistook the hour, and it was between
							five and six when we sat down— The party was of about 25 persons—the
							Meulemeester’s, Van Aken’s, and our Company— I came home to my lodgings,
							after having been to the Theatre, where I saw Francoise de Foix, and
							Monsieur Pistache ou le jour de l’an— It was a day of so much bustle and
							confusion, that the greatest part of it was dissipated.</p>

						<p><date>2. V:30. </date>The pressure upon my time is excessive, and

							<persRef ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef>, <persRef ref="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell</persRef>, and presented to me on Saturday by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— I gave it to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard at his chamber— This subject so insignificant in
							itself gives me more trouble, than if it was important it possibly
							could— It is one of those occasions upon which with an extreme anxiety
							to act with propriety, I feel the hazard of committing an error— The
							manner in which the paper was drawn up, signed, and presented to me,
							was, I think, irregular; the paper is totally different from that which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay promised to draw up, and is
							drawn in a manner not a little embarrassing to me— It neither specifies
							the papers to be delivered nor the persons, to whom I am to deliver
							them. I mentioned these Circumstances in my answer to the Letter, and
							added that I had objections to the request itself which I should state
							at the meeting of the Mission— Before delivering to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard my answer, I called at <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin’s</persRef> chamber, and shewed him the requisition to me—
							He said he had seen it before— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							had shewn it to him and asked him to sign it. He had answered that he
							would sign it, with the addition that he was of a different opinion;
							upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had preferred that he
							should not sign it at-all— I had many new years visits again this
							morning; some in person, and other’s by Cards— Among the rest was
								<persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goulburn</persRef>, who brought me the Times to the 30<hi

								ref="gambier-james">Lord Gambier</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams</persRef>
							had left the City this Morning— We all dined with the Hanoverian
							Lieutenant General <persRef ref="vonalten-charles">Baron Charles
								Alten</persRef>, excepting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay who
							was unwell and sent an excuse. The <persRef ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean"

								>Mayor</persRef> were there, and ten or fifteen English, Hanoverian
							and Belgian Officers— <persRef ref="lyon-james">General Lyon</persRef>
							was one of them— About eight we went to the Concert and Redoute
							Extraordinary on occasion of the Peace— The Hall was crowded as full as
							it could hold— The Concert was just over when we went in, but they
							played Hail Columbia, the second time to greet us— There was an
							Inscription at one end of the Hall— Harmonie, entre Albion et Columbia.
							La Paix, Conclue XXIV. Decembre— I maid a short stay there, and withdrew
							about nine, when the dancing began— I went an passed an hour with

							and took to him the Newspapers that he had lent us, and the Affidavit

						<p><date>5. VI:30. </date>On rising this Morning, instead of diplomatic
							papers, and Letters concerning the loan, of which I have a large file to
							copy; instead of the arrears with my Correspondents which I have to
							bring up, and the still more urgent arrears of this journal which are
							increasing every day, the fancy struck me of answering the Couplets
							yesterday sung by <persRef ref="meulemeester-jean">M<hi

							<persRef ref="meulemeester-marrianne">daughter</persRef>— So, farewell
							for this day all grave and reverend occupation— I could think of nothing
							but my Couplets— After preparing them, four Stanzas in number, I went
							out to a Bookseller’s shop—purchased three small volumes of Étrennes
							Géographiques, with coloured plates, packed them up, with my Song,
							addressed them to Miss Meulemeester, and then wrote a Note to <persRef
								ref="meulemeester-therese">her mother</persRef>, requesting her to
							present them in my name to her daughter— The morning was now gone— A
							meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef> at M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin’s
							chamber had been appointed for one O’Clock; but he was gone out— It
							failed again for the second time— Another important question arose; how
							we were to dress for the banquet of this day— To settle it, <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> at my request called upon <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goulburn</persRef>, and enquired how he proposed to go— He answered,
							in Uniform, and we accordingly all went in Uniform— The banquet was at
							the Hotel de Ville; and was given by subscription by the principal
							Gentlemen of the City— We sat down to table about five O’Clock, in the
							largest Hall of the building fitted up for the occasion with white
							Cotton hangings the American and British flags were intertwined together
							under olive trees, at the head of the Hall. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Goulburn and myself were seated between the <persRef
								ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean">Intendant</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="philippedelens">Mayor</persRef>, at the Centre of the
							Cross-Piece of the Table— There were about ninety persons seated at the
							table. As we went into the Hall, Hail Columbia was performed by the Band
							of Music— It was followed by God Save the King; and these two airs were
							alternately repeated during the dinner time, until M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn thought they became tiresome— I
							was of the same opinion— The Intendant and the Mayor alternately toasted
								<persRef ref="george-iii">His Britannic Majesty</persRef> and the
							United States; the allied powers, and the <persRef ref="william-i"
								>Sovereign Prince</persRef>— The Negotiators and the Peace— I then
							remarked to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn that he must give
							the next toast, which he did— It was the Intendant and the Mayor; the
							City of Ghent; its prosperity; and our gratitude for their hospitality
							and the many acts of kindness that we had received from them— I gave the
							next and last toast, which was Ghent, the City of Peace— May the gates
							of the Temple of <persRef ref="janus">Janus</persRef> here closed, not
							be opened again for a century. There were some french Couplets, written
							by a <persRef ref="kerchove-francois">Baron d’Exaerde</persRef>, which
							were distributed, and should have been sung— But they were omitted, and
							were not worth singing— We rose from table soon after seven, and went
							into the Hall where the Ball had commenced. The Company was numerous,
							and the dancing animated— I met there Madame Meulemeester, who told me
							she had received my Note, and had given my present to her daughter— I
							came home about ten in the Evening.</p>

						<p><date>6. VI. </date>At length the feasting is finished, and I can return
							with less interruption to serious occupations. I wrote again to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> which employed the
							morning. We had at length the meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef>, in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s
							chamber at two O’Clock. It was much hurried, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay being in the
							midst of the preparations for their departure to-morrow Morning— I
							mentioned the letters I had received from <persRef ref="bourne-sylvanus"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourne</persRef> asking if we
							could furnish the Passport for the Herald, if they should find it
							expedient to dispatch her before the cessation of hostilities; M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was for refusing it altogether;
							thinking it was a mere private speculation of individual profit to be
							derived from the possession of the Passport— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin were for
							letting them have the Passport; but only upon Condition that the vessel
							should take any dispatches there might be to send, and without any
							expence to the Public.— As <persRef ref="jones-reuben">Captain Reuben
								Jones</persRef> has not made his appearance, in consequence <pb
								n="208" type="ms"/>of the letter written to him by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, it is concluded that he had left
							Dunkirk before it arrived there, and that he will not come— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard being very anxious to have the
							third Copy of the Treaty dispatched, proposed that it should be sent by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn, who goes to-morrow Morning,
							to <persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef>, with a request to him to forward it by the first
							possible opportunity, and with authority to him to employ a special
							messenger for the purpose. This was agreed to; with the Understanding
							that if Captain Jones should yet come, and be willing to proceed to
							London, and take the Treaty upon the terms offered him by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s letter, that is for £120
							Sterling, he shall have that privilege. I asked M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard if he had a copy of his Letter to Jones, but he had
							none— A letter to the mission was received last Saturday from <persRef
								ref="soubiran-paul">Emile Soubiran</persRef>, an impostor, who
							passed himself off in America for a Count Crillon, and who was concerned
							in the affair of <persRef ref="henry-john3">Captain Henry</persRef>.
							This fellow now sends us extracts from several Letters of <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="serurier-louis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Serrurier</persRef> the French Minister, and <persRef
								ref="brent-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> a
							Senator from Virginia— He pretends that sixteen thousand dollars were
							promised him for having prevailed upon Henry to give up his papers, and
							he now says that unless we cause that sum to be paid to him within a
							Month he will go to America and publish all those Letters. It was now
							questioned what was to be done with this man’s Letter, and it was
							resolved to leave it unanswered. It was also proposed to send his Letter
							to the Government, but no resolution to that effect was adopted. I now
							mentioned the Letter I had received from three members of the Mission,
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Bayard, Clay and Russell and the
							answer I had given to it. I stated that I had not understood that any
							Resolution had passed at the meeting of 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							December, and that the paper sent to me was totally different from that
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had promised to draw up, as it
							neither specified the papers I was to deliver up, nor the person to whom
							I should deliver them.— That I had expected M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay’s draft would be submitted to the Mission for
							Consideration, and that I should have had an opportunity of making my
							objections to it.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that a
							Majority of the Mission had expressed their opinions at the meeting, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said I had refused to put it
							to vote; and said that I knew very well what the vote would be— I
							immediately denied having ever said so. I admitted that at the previous
							meeting I had declined putting it to vote and had said I considered the
							custody of the Papers as my right, subject to the orders of our
							Government, and not subject to a vote— But on further reflection I had
							said at the meeting of the thirtieth of December, that I would deliver
							up any papers specified to me, to any person named to me by a majority
							of the Mission, authorised by them to receive them from me, and to give
							me a receipt from them— That so far from having said I knew very well
							what the vote would be, I had not known what it would be; I did not know
							what M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayards opinion would be, I was not
							conscious that he had expressed any opinion, and I inclined from the
							precedent of the former Mission in which he had acquiesced at least, to
							the belief that his opinion would now have been for the same course.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard now said that his
							recollection was different of the precedent of the former Mission— That
							he himself had all those papers; they were in his trunk on board the
							Neptune— He was sure at least that he had brought the Book with him, and
								<persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> had now taken it home— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin repeated that as he recollected he had received
							from <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef>, all the papers until 31. October, when he,
							Gallatin had withdrawn from the Mission; and he was confident they were
							in his trunk on board the Neptune— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay
							was now set at his ease with regard to the Precedent; and said he did
							not believe there was any such usage, as I referred to— That at least
							there was none such in the British Government— That <persRef
								ref="gambier-james">Lord Gambier</persRef> had said the Papers were
							always returned to the public office, and all theirs would be so. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said Lord Gambier might not know
							much about it, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said he
							considered his authority as nothing, or next to nothing— But that was
							what he had said— It was evident that Bayard himself was the person who
							had asked of Lord Gambier the question; but that he felt a little
							aukward at having been to Lord Gambier to ascertain what it would be
							proper to do with our papers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay then
							asked if I had come to a final determination concerning the papers; that
							if I had and determined to keep them it might be proper to transmit to
							the Secretary of State a copy of the letter from the three members to
							me, and of my answer. I said certainly, it had always been my
							expectation and intention that copies of those letters should be
							transmitted to the Secretary of State— That I had not come to a final
							determination concerning the papers— I had wished to state at this
							Meeting of the Mission that the time was premature for a final disposal
							of them— That with a written demand <pb n="209" type="ms"/>from three
							members of the Mission, to have the papers packed up and sent away, I
							should be reluctant at keeping them; but unless the papers were
							specified I knew not which to send away, nor which to reserve; and
							unless the person were named to me, I knew not to whom to deliver them—
							I knew not where nor how to send them to the Neptune— The mission was
							not terminated— We had just communicated to the British Government that
							we were empowered to conclude a Treaty of Commerce— It was probable they
							would accept the proposal after the ratification of the Peace. In that
							case the effects and Papers would be wanted again— I considered myself
							entitled to the custody of the Papers and if they were to be taken out
							of my hands the person must be named to whom I should give them and must
							give me a receipt for them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said
							there was the principle and the modus— As to any right of mine to keep
							the papers, he could not reason about it— He could not think or speak of
							it with Patience— There was nothing in the Nature of our Government,
							nothing in the nature of the Mission, that gave any colour to it— If it
							had been asked as a matter of courtesy, he was willing to shew all
							suitable respect to the first named member of the Mission— But a
							privilege! a prerogative! he could never acknowledge or submit to it.
							That as to specifying the papers, that could not have been done by him
							because they were in my possession. That there was no necessity for
							naming the person to whom I should deliver them— I might take them on
							with me to Paris, and give them to any other member of the Mission who
							would return by the Neptune— Or I might send them by <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, who would probably go to the Neptune from hence— He
							was desirous of parting in friendship with every body; we had here
							transacted our business together, he hoped to the Satisfaction of our
							Country; and he did not wish to go away with any heart-burnings between
							any of us. All this was said in an acrimonious and menacing tone— I said
							it was not improbable, I should return to the United States in the
							Neptune, myself— I had brought a list of all the books and other effects
							except the papers, which was on the table— I should pack them up and
							leave them here to be sent where and how the mission should direct. The
							copying press and the Papers I intended to take with me to Paris, and
							would deliver them ultimately to any person named and authorized to
							receive them, according as I had offered, by a majority of the Mission—
							The paper I had received was not an act of the majority— It was the act
							of three members— “And although (said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay) those three members form a majority”! Certainly said I; an act of
							the greater number, without consulting the other members, is not an act
							of the majority— Clay now lost all the remnant of his temper—and broke
							out with “you <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not, you <hi rend="italic"
								>cannot</hi>, you <hi rend="small-caps">shall</hi> not
							insinuate that there has been a cabal of three members against you; no
							person shall impute any thing of the kind to me with impunity— It is not
							unexampled that a paper should be drawn up and signed without consulting
							the whole mission. You gave me to sign the very day when I took this
							paper to you, the answer to a Letter from the Prussian Minister at the
							Hague— It was already signed by two members of the Mission, and I had
							never seen it— Nay, I did not know there was such a letter to answer—
							The letter I presented to you was shewn to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin; he was consulted upon it, and might have signed
							it, if he had pleased— As it was addressed to you, and known to be
							against your opinion it was not necessary to consult you.” I replied
							“what I <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> say, I have dared to say in writing.
							Gentlemen may draw from it what inferences they please; I am not
							answerable for them— I am perfectly satisfied that your letter and my
							answer should be transmitted to our Government, and I assure you that if
							you do not transmit them I shall.”— I said nothing in reply to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s example that he had given of a
							paper, drawn up by one member and signed without further consultation of
							the Mission— This has been done several times in cases where there was
							no diversity of opinion, and where every member previously to signing
							the paper might have stated any objection or proposed any alteration,
							upon which the Mission would have been immediately consulted— But it has
							happened in no case where there was any difference of opinion— The case
							relied upon by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was an unfortunate
							one— The letter from the Prussian Minister was dated 13. December— Two
							Copies of it had been transmitted to the Secretary of State, with a
							letter mentioning the substance of its Contents, which letter M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had signed— The necessity of
							answering it had been mentioned at several successive Meetings of the
							Mission, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had made the first
							draft of the answer at the meeting of 29. December, while we were in
							Session. I had made a second draft on the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> and then with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s
							approbation, at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s request, wrote
							it off the morning that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell went
							away, that it might be ready for him to sign— This was the reason why it
							was definitively prepared without consultation of the whole Mission upon
							its Contents— But if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had objected to
							any thing in it, certainly it could not have been sent without a
							decision of the mission upon it— On my reply to the dare not, and cannot
							and shall not, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay cooled down, and said
							that if I had <pb n="210" type="ms"/>not come to a final determination,
							he should wish that our Letters might not be transmitted to the
							Government.— That if I should go home in the Neptune there need be no
							further question upon the subject— That it would cast some dishonour
							upon us all to say any thing to the Government about it— That it would
							look as if we had fallen to a scramble after a few books and papers— I
							said that if such was his desire, I was perfectly willing that the
							Government should not be informed there had been any such question among
							us—and to say no more about it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							proposed that the Books and effects except the papers should be sent to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley at London, to be kept by him
							subject to further orders— This was agreed to— And I retain the papers,
							also until further order— The meeting was then indefinitely adjourned— I
							took the Despatch N. 10. to the Secretary of State, to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to be copied; and was employed all
							the remainder of the day and Evening in copying other papers and making
							up the packet to be dispatched with the Treaty.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith called on me in the Evening, and took the packet with
							a letter for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley, to <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							is that a dog is one of the principal performers— It has had great
							success in Paris and London; and was performed here this Evening for the
							first time— The house was very thin; but the dog performed his part very
							well— The ground is at last covered with Snow, and this day I have seen
							two or three Sledges in the Streets.</p>

							the occasion, of grateful regard for its Inhabitants, who have taken a
							strong interest in our success, and have shewn us many civilities and
							attentions; but above all with gratitude to Heaven for the signal favour
							to my Country in which I have participated at this place— There are
							three Stages between Ghent and Bruxelles—Quadrecht—Alost, and Assche—
							The distance is six and a quarter Posts— I left my Carriage only once at
							the first Stage; and landed at half past five in the afternoon at the
							Hotel de Flandre in Bruxelles— It was the coldest day there had been
							this winter, and was growing colder the whole day— The ground was
							covered with one sheet of snow the whole way; though not any where three
							inches deep— The travelling in sledges would have been excellent— After
							dining alone, I spent the Evening in my chamber, and attempted to write
							a little, without success— Between 9 and 10 I retired.</p>

							Priest in so low a voice that I could not hear one word of it; and
							lasted about half an hour— They take deux liards, or a french sol, for
							every chair, to serve as a kneeling stool, and there are old women and
							boys going about the church, giving chairs and taking half-pence— And

							the middle of the Church there was a box to receive money, and an
							incription in French and in Flemish Ici on offre, pour un nouveau

							about with a box to collect I suppose charity for the poor, shaking the
							half-pence in the box, to remind les fidéles, of their duty still
							further to replenish it— The Church was crowded with people, but there
							were many private conversations going on while the mass was performing—
							Whenever the kneeling time came an enfant de Choeur gave notice of it by
							the ringing of a Bell. This is their form of worship— A Mass every hour,
							from seven in the Morning until Noon; and the worshippers come in and go
							out when they please— After attending the Mass, I took a walk round the
							City, and went into the great Cathedral Church— The most remarkable
							objects in that are the painted windows, which are in very fine Colours,
							and well preserved. On the walls were posted Indulgences— A Mandement

							here an elegant house; and Ladies, which was quite unexpected and for
							which I was not prepared— The company was not numerous; 11 persons at
							table; but an excellent dinner, and delicious wines— The Lady of the
							house, <persRef ref="vilain-sophie">Madame Vilain quatorze</persRef> is
							an elegant woman of french manners; the first thing she said to me was
							that she had a grossesse bien incommode— After dinner she invited me to
							play a game of billiards with her, and beat me with great ease— The
							company was mixed; among them one young English Officer— The tone of
							Conversation sprightly and agreeable, with a little affectation of
							courtliness, and frequent mention of the Prince, and his masquerade
							quadrille, to be given next monday week— At six O’Clock I came away, and
							went to the Theatre, where they performed La Servante Maitresse with the
							new Music of <persRef ref="paesiello-giovanni">Paësiello</persRef>, and
							La Caverne— Paësiello’s Music is always delightful, but I know not why
							he should encroach upon the property of his predecessor <persRef
								ref="pergolesi-giovanni">Pergolesi</persRef>— I prefer the old Music
							of the Serva Padrona— The Music of La Caverne is too difficult for this
							Company, and tedious every where.</p>

						<p><date>30. VI:15. </date>I had visits this Morning, from <persRef
								ref="bauwens-lieven">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lievin
								Bauwens</persRef> of Ghent, and from a <persRef
								ref="vanmanniert-monnier">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monnier van
								Manniert</persRef> a native of this Country, but who has resided may
							years at Philadelphia, and there married a <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Milner</persRef>— He is now a widower, and has two daughters, both
							married— He was desirous of writing to America, and has the intention of
							going there himself the next Summer— About one O’Clock, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Renwett</persRef> called upon me
							and went with me to see the Collection of Pictures of <persRef
								ref="burtin-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burtin</persRef>— On the way he pointed out to me the house or
							rather the ruins where had been the house of <persRef
								ref="egmont-lamoral">Count Egmont</persRef>.— I then recollected
							having seen the house when I was at Bruxelles before— It has since been
							demolished— We also went round by the marble fountain erected by the
							Testament of <persRef ref="bruce-thomas2">Bruce, Earl of
								Ailsbury</persRef> an English Nobleman who resided forty years in
							this City, and left to his heir the order to erect this Monument as a
							token of his gratitude to the inhabitants of the place. He died in 1740.
							and the work was executed by <persRef ref="berge-jacques"
								>Bergé</persRef>, a sculptor of this Country in 1751— It is a costly
							monument, but gives no explanation how it happened that a British Peer,
							public-spirited enough to appropriate a part of his fortune to the
							comfort and embellishment of a foreign City, should have had so little
							of the Sentiment of patriotism, as to have lived as a private individual
							forty years absent from his Country and yet so near it— We were two
							hours in surveying M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burtin’s Collection,
							which is the choicest private Collection that I ever saw. He is himself
							a thorough Connoisseur in Painting, and a very proper object for a
							Painter. He is 72 years of age, and began by asking me, if I was an
							Amateur de Tableaux— I told him that I took great pleasure in looking at
							good Pictures; but that I could not assume the pretension of being an
							Amateur. He said he could give me in five minutes the secret which he
							had been forty years in learning, and which he had fully disclosed <pb
								n="216" type="ms"/>in two Octavo Volumes that he had published, and
							which he hoped would by my means become known in America. Since the
							English had got in here, they had taken more than seventy copies of it,
							so that he had scarcely any left— The French considered his work as the
							first upon the subject, though he had treated the French school harshly,
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Malte-Brun</persRef> the critic had styled him a connoisseur trés
							eclairé, juge sevère mais impartial de l’ecole Françoise. His secret was
							to look at every picture as if the original was behind you, and you saw
							it in a mirror— If it appeared natural to you as an object reflected by
							a mirror, you might boldly pronounce it a good picture— If not you might
							as certainly pronounce it a bad one— As to the French School it could
							boast of only one good Painter, which was <persRef
								ref="lesueur-eustache">Eustache le Sueur</persRef>— I asked him how
							he considered <persRef ref="poussin-nicolas">Poussin</persRef>?— As an
							Italian Painter; formed altogether in Italy— How of <persRef
								ref="lorrain-claude">Claud</persRef>?— Why his very name said he was
							of Lorraine— And all his Art of Painting he learnt at Rome— But <persRef
								ref="rubens-peter">Rubens</persRef>, said I studied likewise in
							Italy— Yes; but he was a great Painter before he went there— You will
							find it all explained at large in my Book— You see, said he this whole
							side of my library— It consists altogether of Books upon the Art of
							Painting—and excepting these four middle shelves, which are Catalogues
							of sales, with their prices, all the rest now that my book is published
							may be thrown into the fire— There is nothing further to be got from
							them. After this introduction we went and looked at the Pictures, and as
							the chambers were cold, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burtin left us
							with his housekeeper, a pretty girl, who he said could explain to us the
							subjects of the Pictures as well as himself. They are in four small
							chambers, and all excellent pictures— He prides himself upon not having
							one indifferent Painting in the whole Collection— Besides the Standards
							of the Dutch and Flemish Schools, <persRef ref="vanmiereis-frans"
								>Mieris</persRef>, <persRef ref="vanrijn-rembrandt"
								>Rembrandt</persRef>, <persRef ref="teniers-david"
							>Teniers</persRef>, <persRef ref="vanostade-adriaen">Ostade</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="steen-jan">Jan Steen</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="vandyke-anthony">Van Dyke</persRef> and Rubens, There are four
							capital Portraits by <persRef ref="holbein-hans">Holbein</persRef>,
							three pictures of <persRef ref="durer-albrecht">Albert Durer</persRef>,
							one of <persRef ref="michelangelo">Michael Angelo</persRef>, and a small
							Portrait of <persRef ref="titian">Titian</persRef> painted by himself—
							The large Pictures appeared to me the least remarkable— The
							Water-pieces, flowers, dead game, living animals, and inside views of
							churches were like those in all good collections of the flemish school.
							A number of sketches, mere daubings of Rubens, and one admirable
							Portrait by the same Master— Several Landscapes like most others; and a
							singular portrait of <persRef ref="terburg-gerard">Terburg</persRef>,
							painted by himself, a bitter Satire upon his disciple <persRef
								ref="netscher-caspar">Caspar Netscher</persRef> and upon <persRef
								ref="william-iii">William 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi></persRef>
							the Prince of Orange— After having admired these nearly two hours M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Burtin sent his maid with us to see his
							four finest pictures in a separate chamber— They were covered with green
							silk veils— A Marriage of <persRef ref="stcatherineofalexandria">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Catherine</persRef>, the Master-Piece
							of Van Dyke— A <persRef ref="francisofassisi">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Francis</persRef> by Rubens; a
							Christ bearing his Cross by <persRef ref="davinci-leonardo">Leonardo da
								Vinci</persRef>; and last and most exquisitely beautiful of all, a
							holy family by <persRef ref="reni-guido">Guido</persRef>— If it was mine
							I would not give it for all the rest of the Collection. The most perfect
							ideal head of the <persRef ref="mary">Virgin</persRef>, that was perhaps
							ever painted. I took a copy of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burtin’s
							Book and returned home— Dined at the Table d’Hote and spent the
							afternoon and Evening in my chamber, alone; reading and writing.</p>

							not to be found— After another walk round the City, I returned to the

							the Theatre, where I saw <persRef ref="moliere">Moliere’s</persRef>
							Etourdi, ou les Contretems, and Le Calife de Bagdad— They perform their

							l’Etourdi performed upon the Stage— Their performance of the Caliph of
