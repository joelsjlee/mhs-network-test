						<p><date>1. VI:30. </date>Having risen earlier than heretofore since our
							arrival in London, I was able to write an hour or two this morning, and
							began the attempt to retrieve the arrears of this Journal— They have run
							from the day of our sailing from Havre; and I am apprehensive will be
							slowly brought up.— I paid visits to <persRef

							and <persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard">Baron Rehausen</persRef> the
							Swedish Ministers, and at <persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi

							was at home, but I saw <persRef ref="goulburn-jane">M<hi

							visits from <persRef ref="vaughan-william;u">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Vaughan</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>.— I dined at <persRef
								ref="grey-charles">Earl Grey’s</persRef>— The invitation was for
							half past six O’Clock— I went at Seven, and found <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> just there— We were the first of the Company.—

									>rs:</hi> Clements</persRef> were of the party. The Ladies
							withdrew after dinner, but the men sat not more than half an hour after
							they were gone— The Conversation was partly about <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>, and partly about the
							business before Parliament— Lord Gray said something to me about
							America, and strongly expressed his hopes that we should continue on
							terms of friendship with this Country— But with regard to the
							impressment of Seamen, he spoke like other English Statesmen— It was
							between eleven and twelve O’Clock when I came home.</p>

							delivered the Letter of Credit to them from the <persRef

								<persRef ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Alexander Baring</persRef> who was there, told me that they were in
							advance to the Government sixty or seventy thousand pounds Sterling, but
							that on the Diplomatic fund, peculiarly applied to the drafts of the
							Ministers they had a balance of about £1600 due to the Government— I
							enquired at what rate they received the Dollar, in their transactions
							with the American Government. He said they received all their
							remittances and made all their payments in the British Sterling, (paper)
							as to the value of the dollar, that was an affair between me and the
							Government— The principal Clerk at the Counting house said the dollar
							was estimated at four shillings and sixpence Sterling— But as the silver
							dollar is current for five shillings and six pence there would be a loss
							of about twenty per Cent, upon every sum that I should now draw here.— I
							have therefore concluded to draw in preference upon Amsterdam.</p>

							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin at the same time that they
							determined to undertake this Negotiation, still adhered to the idea, of

							after receiving theirs this morning, but I was not at home. We dined at

									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams</persRef>, who produced to us a
							Commission authorising them to negotiate with us on the subject— On
							reading over this Commission there were in its recital of our authority
							to treat, two mistakes, one of which was noticed by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and the other by me— The first was
							merely in the arrangement of our names, those of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin being
							placed before mine— This was immaterial, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin remarked that in the British full-power for
							treating with us for Peace, in the recital of our power, his name had
							been placed first. The other mistake, I observed was more material— It
							recited our powers as having been given by the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> of the United States with
							the consent of the Senate and House of Representatives. I referred to
							our Constitution, by which appointments are made by and with the advice
							and consent of the Senate, without the co-operation of the House of
							Representatives. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Robinson said that the
							form had been copied from that of the Negotiation with <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pinkney</persRef>— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams said that it
							was not material— It was the mere recital of our Powers, and was no more
							than if in our recital of theirs it was stated that they had been
							appointed with the approbation and consent of the Lords and Commons in
							Parliament— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said it would
							however be as well to make a minute of it, which he did.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin produced our full-powers, and
							copies of them all were made out by Clerks in the <pb n="264" type="ms"
							/>Office, while we were in conference— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay then stated the necessity which he and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin were under of going to embark in the Neptune, and
							their engagement to leave town for that purpose next Monday. That they
							had waited as long as they could, and if it should be found that we
							could not come to a conclusion before that time, they should go, and
							leave the business to be finished by me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goulburn said that their Commission had not been in readiness before,
							because the <persRef ref="scott-john2">Chancellor</persRef> (who affixes
							the Great Seal) had a fit of the Gout.— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Robinson said that he hoped M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin would find it possible to stay
							until we should come to some result—but if not they, the British
							Commissioners would not overpower me with numbers— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin referring to the previous
							Conferences which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and he had had
							with the British Commissioners, reminded them that they had considered
							the Negotiation as naturally dividing itself into two branches; one, of
							arrangements purely commercial, and the other, on the belligerent and
							neutral questions. He observed that as there would certainly not be time
							at present for the discussion of the second Class of Articles, he had
							made a draft of those upon the first, which he had thought might be now
							arranged; and he put it into their hands— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Robertson said that the most expeditious method of proceeding would be
							for them to give us in return a draft of Articles proposed by them, or
							in the form of alterations to the Articles as proposed by us; to which
							we agreed— The only Article upon which there was any Conversation
							between us, was that relating to the American trade to India— It was the
							only one for which there has yet been any reason to imagine that we
							could obtain any thing useful by a commercial Negotiation, at present,
							and I soon found that the recollections of the two parties, were far
							from being the same, with regard to what had passed at the former
							conferences between them— It had been freely avowed on the British side,
							that with respect to the American trade to the West-Indies, they would
							do nothing— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had understood, &amp; had represented
							to me that the trade to the East Indies was to be put upon the footing
							of the Treaty of 1794, without hesitation or qualification. The British
							Commissioners now stated that they had distinctly and explicitly
							expressed their expectation of an <hi rend="italic">equivalent</hi>, in
							some other commercial point, for the admission of American vessels to
							the indirect trade with India as allowed in the Treaty of 1794— That
							they had observed that the state of the question had changed, since
							1794. when the East India Company exclusively had the British trade to
							India— That the other British Merchants, now had a share of the trade,
							and their interests would thus be differently affected by the same
							stipulation— They had intimated therefore an expectation of some
							accommodation on our part, and had instanced <hi rend="italic">the fur
								trade</hi>. Upon which they had been answered that we were expressly
							precluded from any concession in this particular by our Instructions:
							the motive for which had been altogether political and not commercial—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin admitted the substance of
							all this Conversation thus stated, and of which I had heard nothing
							before—excepting that he had not thought that an equivalent for the
							indirect East-India trade had been explicitly required— It had indeed
							been hinted by the British Commissioners that in return for the India
							trade, a liberal spirit of accommodation would be shewn by the United
							States on some other commercial ground— The fur trade had been
							mentioned. He and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had answered that
							if by that was meant the right to trade with the Indians within our
							Territories we were precluded by our Instructions from granting that.
							The motive for which must necessarily be merely political, since the
							trade itself in a commercial point of view was entirely to our
							advantage. That they had told the British Commissioners that we
							considered our trade to India, as carrying its own equivalent with it—
							We carried there scarcely any thing but specie— We had little doubt that
							it would always find its welcome— It would indeed be convenient to us to
							have the certainty of admission secured by Treaty, but it was not a
							convenience for which we should think it worth while to give any
							specific equivalent— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay suggested that
							the claim for an equivalent had been less pointedly brought forward at
							the former conferences, and in such a manner, that he had not expected
							it would be definitively demanded— The British Commissioners finally
							took M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s draft and we agreed to
							meet them again the day after to-morrow at the same place and hour.— As
							we came out I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin that they had
							put a check-mate upon the East-India-trade Article. He said he thought
							they would yet give up the point— We parted at the door, and I walked
							home— While I was out, <persRef ref="bailey-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> the English Consul at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg had paid us a visit— He
							arrived a few days since, and is shortly to return. I dined with

						<p><date>8. VII:30. </date>The assistant Master of the Ceremonies, <persRef
								ref="chester-robert">Robert Chester Esq<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> called upon me this Morning, and gave me the
							information, concerning the forms, and usages of Court presentations,
							for which I had yesterday enquired of <persRef ref="lieven-christopher"
								>Count Lieven</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester’s
							report was however different in some particulars from that of the Count—
							He asked me first whether I had delivered to <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, a copy of my
							Credential Letter— I said I had;—that he said was entirely right. He
							then asked if I had a Letter for the <persRef ref="charlotte2"
								>Queen</persRef>— I said I had not— He said it was usual, though not
							indispensable— That it was done by the Courts where the Queen had
							personal <pb n="265" type="ms"/>connections, and had always been done by
							the Republic of Holland. That the Queen would nevertheless give me an
							audience when she comes to town upon business; which would probably be
							in the course of a week or ten days— I asked when, and how it would be
							proper for <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to be presented to the Queen— He said
							by <persRef ref="stewart-amelia">Lady Castlereagh</persRef>, and at a
							drawing-room— It was doubtful however whether there would be another
							drawing room, before the Winter. I asked whether it was usual for the
							foreign Ministers to be presented separately to the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus;edward;ernest-augustus;augustusfrederick;adolphus"
								>Princes</persRef> of the Royal family, and when and to whom visits
							of form were to be paid— He said that after having an Audience of the
							Queen, and not until then, it would be proper to call at the Residences
							of all the Princes, and write my name in the Books, kept there, for the
							purpose— And to visit by Cards the Cabinet Ministers and Great Officers
							of the household— I said I had been told that this was to be done,
							immediately after the Audience from the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef>— He replied that sometimes the foreign Ministers
							had done so; but when referred to, he must say that the other was the
							regular course— I said I should then observe it— He added that the
							personal presentation to the Princes, was usually made at the Regent’s
							Levees, whenever any of them attended— And he, or any other person known
							to them would present me— No particular notice was taken of the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth;augustasophia;mary2;sophia">Princesses</persRef>, the
							Regent’s Sisters, or of the <persRef ref="charlotte-augustus">Princess
								Charlotte</persRef>, his daughter.— He promised to come again at a
							quarter past One O’Clock, and accompany me to Carleton-house; which he
							accordingly did— We went in at the private and priviledged entrance, and
							passed through S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Park to the
							Palace— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester observing to me that I
							should give directions to my Coachman always to go by that way— We
							arrived at half-past one—the hour appointed, but were early—finding
							there only <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Freudenreich</persRef>, the Envoy from Berne, and his Secretary of
							Legation. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freudenreich, who has been here
							about a year had his audience to take leave.— He had also received two
							Notes from Lord Castlereagh, one appointing the Audience after the
							Levee, and the other fixing it at half past one— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Chester was much perplexed to account for this Circumstance,
							which was explained as having arisen from occurrences at the last Levee—
							The private Audiences then had delayed the ordinary Levee until five or
							six O’Clock which had detained some of the members of the House of
							Commons from attendance there, in time—which had occasioned complaints;
							and the first idea had been for the private Audiences to be fixed this
							day after the Levee— It was almost three when the Prince Regent began to
							give private Audiences— The first was to <persRef
								ref="grenville-william">Lord Grenville</persRef>, who as Chancellor
							of the University of Oxford presented to him a Book containing an
							Account of the visit of the allied Sovereigns there last Summer. The
							second was to me— Lord Castlereagh, as the Minister of foreign Affairs
							introduced me into the Prince’s closet, where he stood alone; and as I
							approached him, speaking first, said, “M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Adams, I am happy to see you.”— I said—“Sir. I am directed by the
								<persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef> of the United
							States to deliver to your Royal Highness this Letter; and in presenting
							it, I fulfil the commands of my Government, when I express the hope,
							that it will be received as a token, of the earnest desire of that
							Government, not only faithfully and punctually to fulfil all its
							engagements contracted with that of Great Britain, but for the adoption
							of every other measure, that may tend to consolidate the Peace and
							Friendship, and to promote the harmony between the two Nations”— The
							Prince took the Letter, and without opening it, delivered it immediately
							to Lord Castlereagh; and said in answer to me, that the United-States
							might rely with the fullest assurance upon his determination to fulfil
							on the part of Great-Britain, all the engagements with the United
							States— He then asked me if I was related to <persRef key="adams-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams</persRef>, who had
							formerly been the Minister from the United States here— I said I was his
							Son— He enquired whether I had ever been before in England?— I had—with
							a public mission?— Once, with a special Mission during the absence of
							the Minister then accredited here— He said he had known two of the
							former Ministers of the United States here, who were <persRef
								ref="pinckney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pinckney</persRef>, and <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus King</persRef>—very gentlemenly
							Men— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King was very much of a gentleman.—
							Where was M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pinckney now. I said there had
							been two <persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pinckney’s</persRef> here as Ministers from the United States— Ah!
							said he—but I mean the M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pinckney who was
							here before M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King— I said he was now a
							General in the Army— In the Army? said he— I did not know that— Had he
							ever been in the army before?— I said he had—and where is M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King?— I said he was now a Member of the
							Senate of the United States.— And, how did you like living there, at
							Bruxelles, said the Prince— Your Royal Highness probably means Ghent,
							said I— Ay! Ghent! so it was said he—and how did you like Ghent?— I said
							we liked it very much for the result of what was done there— Oh! Yes!
							said he, but I mean did you find any Society there?— I said we had found
							Society— That Ghent was a very antient and venerable City, with proud
							recollections— That its inhabitants thought and talked much of <persRef
								ref="charles-v">Charles the fifth</persRef>, and that it was now
							illustrated again as the Residence where a great Sovereign holds his
							Court.— Ay! said the Prince; there are a number of those great Old
							Cities there— Lord Castlereagh commented in a few words, upon the large
							Cities and the populousness of the Netherlands; and we then withdrew
							from the Prince’s Closet— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freudenreich
							was introduced immediately afterwards, for his Audience to take leave—
							After these Audiences the Levee to the foreign Ministers was held, which
							was over in half an hour, and then the doors were opened for what M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester called the ordinary Levee,
							attended by the persons not priviledged <pb n="266" type="ms"/>with the
							entrée— And we withdrew— Before the Levee, I was introduced by Lord
							Castlereagh or M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chester to the <persRef
								ref="william">Duke of Clarence</persRef>, the only one of the
							Princes of the Blood Royal, that was there,—to most of the foreign
							Ambassadors and Ministers, and to several of the Ministers and Household
							Officers of the Country.— Among them were the <persRef
								ref="seymourconway-francis">Marquis of Hertford</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="ryder-dudley">Lords Harrowby</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="addington-henry2">Sidmouth</persRef>, and some others— <persRef
								ref="graves-thomas2">Lord Graves</persRef>, whom I had known at
							Berlin, recognized and spoke to me. He is now in the household of the
							Duke of Sussex, who he told me was as good, as generous, as noble
							hearted, and as imprudent as ever.— I told him that of the good part of
							the Duke’s qualities I had often heard, with pleasure— He said that he
							was not a good Courtier—but perhaps that would not be a fault to me— I
							said it might perhaps not be a fault— Though I certainly could not
							consider it as a fault to be one— I enquired after <persRef
								ref="brummell-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brummell</persRef> his companion at Berlin— He said that he was
							here— He had seen him this morning— He was married and had a family, but
							was not incumbered with superfluous wealth— In that respect I observed
							that he had associates enough to keep him in Countenance— Yes said he,
							we are a numerous corps, enough— I recognized also <persRef
								ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rayneval</persRef>, the first Secretary to the French, (<persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">Louis l8</persRef>) Embassy, and <persRef
								ref="jenison-franz">Count Jennison-Walworth</persRef> Secretary to
							the Bavarian Legation.— Lord Castlereagh, introduced me also to <persRef
								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>,
							who kissed hands on his appointment as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
							Plenipotentiary to the United States— The Prince in speaking to him at
							the Levee remarked that it was on the same day that I had presented my
							Credentials— By which he intended me to understand that the friendly
							advances of the United States had been met with the utmost promptitude.—
							The Levee itself was not so orderly as those assemblies usually are. The
							Prince went round and spoke a few words to all the foreign Ministers,
							but excepting what he thus addressed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bagot and myself, I heard only what he said to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Freudenreich, which was in a sort of whisper— Je suis faché
							que vous allez partir; mais j’espere que vous reviendrez.— As we
							returned home, I set down M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester, at his
							house 68 South Audley Street— While I was gone <persRef
								ref="dickason-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.
								Dickason</persRef>, and <persRef ref="nevett-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nevett</persRef> had paid visits, and
								<persRef ref="campbell-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Campbell</persRef> had called to settle the account for our passage
							in the Olga— It was but yesterday that the last boxes, and cases of our
							wines and effects were sent to us from the Custom-house.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell is to call again to-morrow— I
							have already had applications from a number of Americans for Passports,
							but have not until now considered myself authorised to grant them.
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef> two
							Gentlemen from New-York, who are going to France came this morning just
							as I was going to Carleton-House— I promised to make out their Passports
							to-morrow Morning. The <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2;adams-george;adams-john2">Children</persRef>
							went this Evening to <persRef ref="astley-philip">Astley’s</persRef>
							Amphitheatre— I received a Note from <persRef ref="morier-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier</persRef> Under Secretary in
							the Office of foreign Affairs, requesting me to call there, at 2 O’Clock
							to-morrow, which I answered, promising to go. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams and I dined at <persRef ref="proby-john">Lord
								Carysfort’s</persRef>, where we met <persRef
								ref="fortescue-hugh;fortescue-hester">Earl and Lady
								Fortescue</persRef>, <persRef ref="king-peter;king-hester">Lord and
								Lady King</persRef>, <persRef ref="grenville-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Grenville</persRef>,—<persRef
								ref="proby-john2">Lord Proby</persRef>, and Lord Carysfort’s
								<persRef ref="proby-charlotte;proby-frances;proby-gertrude">three
								daughters</persRef>, neither of whom is yet married— Lady Fortescue
							is Lady Carysfort’s Sister, and Lady King is a daughter of Lord
							Fortescue’s— I should not have recognized M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thomas Grenville, nor did he recollect me, although we were well
							acquainted with each other at Berlin— After dinner there was a numerous
							party of both sexes who came, but there were no cards— <persRef
								ref="davy-humphrey">Sir Humphrey Davy</persRef>, who has very lately
							returned from Italy, talked much upon his travels there; much upon
							agriculture and farming; much upon the Art of Sculpture and the Laocoon
							and the Venus, and much upon his own chemical discoveries— If Modesty is
							an inseparable companion of Genius, Sir Humphrey is a prodigy.— Lord
							King and Lord Fortescue went down to the House of Peers, to give their
							votes upon the Catholic question, which was discussing there— Lord
							Carysfort had given his proxy to the <persRef ref="grenville-richard"
								>Marquis of Buckingham</persRef>— Lord King returned, having found
							the question decided— I had some conversation with him on the prospects
							of War in Europe— He told me he believed <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> would beat them all—in
							which opinion I did not concur. It was about 12 at Night when we came
							home.</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, and then paid a

								Copley</persRef> appears to be in good health— <persRef
								ref="copley-mary">Their youngest daughter</persRef> is still with

								<persRef ref="morier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morier</persRef>— He said it was contemplated to appoint the
							Commissioners, upon the 4<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> and 6<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							Articles of the Treaty of Ghent. He asked if I thought there would be on
							the part of the American Government any objection to the appointment of
							the same person, as the Commissioner, or two of the Commissions—those of
							the fourth and fifth Articles— I first said that I should wish for time
							to read over the Articles, and would give him an answer to-morrow— But
							afterwards on recollecting the substance of the two Articles I said I
							would not give him the trouble of waiting for an answer— I presumed
							there could be no objection to the appointment of the same person upon
							the two Commissioners particularly as the American Government would not
							be obliged to appoint the same person on their part; if they <pb n="267"
								type="ms"/>should prefer to appoint two— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Morier told me that <persRef ref="barclay-thomas">Col<hi

							the Commissioner on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Articles, having been formerly one of
							the Commissioners for the settlement of the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Croix River, under the Treaty of 1794. And M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>who was also employed on that
							occasion would go with him— It was intended and expected that he should
							go out in the July Packet. <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> was at the Office with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier. I mentioned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier the baggage and furniture that we
							have at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, and expect, here—and
							enquired with respect to its admission— He said that when it arrived, if
							I would write a Note to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, or to him, the order for its admission would
							be immediately sent to the Custom-house— From the foreign Office I went
							immediately to the Office for Trade, where I found that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin had just arrived— Shortly after we met <persRef
								ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Robinson</persRef>, <persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams</persRef>,
							who merely told us that they were not ready with their Counter Projet
							for a commercial Treaty— They said however that they should be very
							shortly ready— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay manifested some
							impatience to be gone: referred to his and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin’s promise to go on Monday next, and asked whether
							the British Commissioners could not before that time send us their
							answer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin appeared disposed to
							allow them more time. They said they hoped by Sunday, at least to be
							able to inform us, when they would be prepared with their Answer— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams said that it was not exactly here,
							as it had been at Ghent; because there, there was nothing else to do— We
							left them, with the hope of hearing from them again on Sunday.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay took a seat with me, in my Carriage,
							and I sat him down at his lodgings— He told me that he did not expect
							the Negotiation would come to any thing; and that if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had been of his mind they would
							have persisted in going away next Monday. He complained that the British
							Commissioners now held with respect to the East-India trade a language
							totally different from that which they had held in the former
							conferences— That they had said nothing about a specific equivalent for
							the indirect trade; but had only spoken of expecting on our part a
							liberal spirit of accommodation in some other part of the Treaty— He
							seemed however inclined to sign the Article for the direct trade, as was
							proposed by the Treaty of 1806. I told him I did not think it worth the
							trouble of signing our names for that— The trade was so much more
							valuable and important to them than to us, that we had in their interest
							a much more certain pledge for its continuance than any Treaty could be—
							And I thought we might risk more than we could gain, by shewing an
							anxious desire for Treaty Stipulations to secure what we knew we should
							have without them— It would encourage them to demand substantial
							advantages from us in return for nothing from them— He said they had no
							reason to suppose from any thing that had passed that we were desirous
							of a commercial Treaty.— <hi rend="strikethrough">I took a half an

						<p><date>11. V:45. </date>I called this morning upon <persRef
								ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef>, and gave him a form of a Passport, requesting him
							to have fifty copies of it printed immediately. I also mentioned to him
							the American Sailors, numbers of whom are almost daily applying to me
							for assistance, and who represent themselves to be absolutely starving.
							He said that almost all those who made such applications were imposters—
							That if he listened to all those that came to him, he should have time
							for nothing else— That he knew and had detected many of them as
							impostors— Among the rest a <persRef ref="u">Captain Grover</persRef>,
							came to me the other day, with a <persRef ref="moojen-j">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Moojen</persRef> a broker, to enquire
							by what authority M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley now acts as
							American Consul— This Grover is Captain of a Vessel, once American
							called the Charleston Packet— She was here when the War broke out, and
							Grover says that to cover the property a simulated sale of her was made
							to an Englishman— Now that <pb n="268" type="ms"/>the American Peace is
							made, and a French war is breaking out again, it is convenient to resume
							the American flag. The American Register of this vessel is in the name
							of one <persRef ref="u">Hess</persRef>, and as he is not here, Grover
							took the name to obtain his clearances; has already been one Voyage to
							Dieppe, and is now laden for another to Havre— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Beasley knowing all these Circumstances, refuses to return
							the ship’s papers and intends to send them home to the Treasury
							Department as the Law directs— I told Grover and Moojen that I had no
							authority over M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley, and knew not upon
							what grounds he acted as Consul— But that Grover must be sensible he was
							violating the laws both of the U.S. and of this Country by personating
							another man, to use a ship’s Papers, and that by the Laws of the United
							States the Papers of the Charleston Packet must be returned to the
							Treasury Department— After leaving me, they employed an Attorney to
							write a letter to Beasley threatening him with a suit at Law for the
							Papers— Beasley told me that he would give them a hint, that if they
							were troublesome he could get Grover hanged for personating another man—
							With <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

							and dined at <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord

							Castlereagh treated us with the politest attention— He seated me at his

							Westmorland was at my Right— Lord Liverpool between M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin— The Conversation at table was here as every where else about
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>. Lord
							Castlereagh had a miniature picture of him on a snuff-box, which he said
							he had bought of <persRef ref="isabey-jean">Isabey</persRef> at Vienna—
							It was the general opinion of all the Noble Lords present that Napoleon
							would shortly take refuge in America; for as to another Island of Elba,
							that was out of the question. That experiment would not be tried a
							second time— Lord Castlereagh spoke of him with studious moderation—
							Said he thought his speech to the Legislative assembly this day received
							was a very good speech— That it noticed in moderate terms the late
							capture of a French frigate in the Mediterranean; but <hi rend="italic"
								>pretended</hi> that it was hostility in time of Peace.— He said
							that last year at the time of the Fontainebleau Treaty Buonaparte had
							expressed the wish of coming to England, to which he, Lord Castlereagh
							had objected, as he could not have been answerable for the safety of his
							person here— That while he was going from Fontainebleau to embark for
							Elba, he had been at several places in great personal danger from the
							honest indignation of the People; but he Lord Castlereagh had much
							rather that he should have come back and be as he now is, than that he
							should have lost his life, while under the protection of the allies.—
							Lord Castlereagh said he had never seen him, though he had felt a
							curiosity to see him; but the only opportunity that he had ever had for
							it was at the time of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and then he had
							abstained, from delicacy— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson
							informed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that the Counterprojet of a
							commercial Treaty would be sent to us on Wednesday, or about the middle
							of the week, and Lord Westmorland invited us to dine with him on Monday
							the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay told me that he and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had
							concluded to stay until that time— We left the table about ten in the
							Evening, and after setting down M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd at
							the Blenheim Hotel, I came home about eleven.</p>

						<p><date>13. VI:15. </date>A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Champion</persRef> wrote me, about the first of this Month,
							requesting of me an interview, alledging that he had something of an

							neglect to answer his Letter— About five days ago he wrote me a second,
							enclosing a very long one from him to <persRef ref="kirkland-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirkland</persRef>, under a flying
							seal, with a request to me that I would forward it— I then answered him
							that I would forward the Letter, and would be happy to see him the next
							morning at ten— He did not then come, but came this morning, and had a
							Conversation with me of more than an hour— I had read his Letter to D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Kirkland, which was a sort of
							Dissertation upon the present state of European Affairs; and
							prognostications concerning the issue of the War, now about to
							commence.— There were in it some impertinences and false suggestions
							concerning <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef>, which absolved me from treating this person with
							much delicacy— I told him that I had read the Letter, as it had been
							left open for my perusal, and that I would transmit it to D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirkland for whom I entertained a very
							particular regard— But that I must in candour say to him that the
							remarks which it contained, respecting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison were totally erroneous, and that if he should in future wish to
							make me the medium of his Correspondence with his friends in America, he
							would be sensible to the impropriety of expressing in his Letters such
							Sentiments respecting the person at the head of the Government of which
							I am the Representative. He said they were opinions very generally
							prevailing in this Country— I said that might be—but they were in my
							opinion, not the less erroneous.— He then talked about the War, and
							expressed some doubts whether it would yet take place— He is as an
							Englishman antiministerial, and the principal object of his Admiration
							is <persRef ref="romilly-samuel">Sir Samuel Romilly</persRef>. As to the
							Athenaeum, the high <pb n="269" type="ms"/>communication that he had to
							make to me was that <persRef ref="shaw-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Shaw</persRef> paid too dear for the Books which he
							ordered to be sent out from this Country—and that books were now to be
							got astonishingly cheap— I asked him how they were to be procured, but
							he appeared to be disinclined to disclose particulars— He intimated that
							he knew, and wished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw to be informed
							of it— I said I had formerly known <persRef ref="lackington-james"
								>Lackington’s</persRef> as the cheap shop for old books— New books I
							had never seen cheap in England— He said that good books were often not
							to be had at Lackington’s.— He finally concluded to write himself to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw, and asked me to forward his
							Letter which I promised him to do. I delivered again this day four
							Passports— One to a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							had written me a letter on the first of this Month, expressing a wish

							verbally this note, and called at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy’s
							lodgings for the purpose, but he was abroad. Yesterday I received a
							second letter from him, renewing the intimation that he had
							communications to make to me— I sent him an answer this Morning,
							promising to dine with him to-morrow.— We had visits from <persRef

								ref="baring-alexander;baring-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and

							formerly been acquainted with <persRef key="adams-john">my

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hubbard</persRef> came in while I was
							there— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gore told me that they should
							leave London on Monday or Tuesday for the Isle of Wight— I enquired if
							they would take one or two packets of Articles for my father— She said
							their trunks were already gone— We dined at four O’Clock, and after
							dinner, I went with <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>, and
							attended a debate in the house of Lords. I had seen in the Newspapers,
							that the Lords were summoned upon a motion of the <persRef
								ref="pettyfitzmaurice-henry">Marquis of Lansdown</persRef>, who was
							to bring up a Report of a Committee upon a Bill relating to the Slave
							Trade, which had passed the House of Commons— I expected therefore to
							have found a full house and a warm debate— There were however not more
							than twenty Peers present, and the debate turned almost entirely upon
							the mere drawing up of the Bill— The Marquis of Lansdown was speaking
							when we went in; and the <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Earls of
								Liverpool</persRef> and of <persRef ref="fane-john"
								>Westmorland</persRef>, <persRef ref="law-edward">Lords
									Ellenborough</persRef> and <persRef ref="stanhope-charles">Stanhope</persRef> took part in the debate. It was
							generally agreed to be the worst drawn Bill that had ever been presented
							to the House— Lord Ellenborough said it was a monster of Legislation,
							and a disgrace to the British Parliament— He, and some other Lawyers,
							and the Bishops were in their official Robes— The other Peers were in
							frocks and some of them in boots— The debate was of about an hour, and
							it was agreed to recommit the Bill— <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, <persRef ref="fazakerley-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fazakerley</persRef>, and some other
							members from the house of Commons came in while the debate was going on—
							After we came out of the house, Lord Liverpool overtook us in the Street
							and walked with me as far as White-hall place, where we parted.— I
							walked home with George by the way of Hyde Park, and on reaching home I
							found a Letter from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="robinson-frederick">Robinson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry">Goulburn</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams</persRef>,

								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> had expected, and led me to expect that I think

							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Gallatin’s lodgings— Neither of them was at home; and I
							left it with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s servant, to give
							to his Master— As I was going to bed, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay called upon me, and I informed him that I had received those

						<p><date>17. VI. </date>I called this morning at <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring’s</persRef> house, but without finding him at home. On my
							return I found at my lodgings <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, with the Letter and the Counter-Projet of the
								<persRef ref="robinson-frederick;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef>. There were three points upon
							which Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Clay and Gallatin upon the
							result of their Conferences with the British Plenipotentiaries before my
							arrival had concluded to enter upon a formal Negotiation— 1. The
							intercourse between the United States and Canada— 2. The mutual
							abolition of discriminating duties, and placing the commercial Relations
							between the two Countries on the footing of the most favoured Nation,
							and 3. The East-India Trade— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said
							that he had been deceived by the British Plenipotentiaries upon all
							three. Their Counter-Projet now offered us a Canadian Article, which
							would give them access to trade with the Indians in our territory— They
							limited to their European dominions the offer to treat us as the most
							favoured Nation, and they limited the intercourse to be secured to us
							with India, to four places, and to two years from the ratification of
							the Treaty, with high pretensions of liberality in granting so much, and
							a formal notification that they gave us the two years only for the
							Government of the United States to be prepared to give an equivalent for
							the <pb n="271" type="ms"/>continuation of the privilege— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that if he had imagined it would
							come to such a Projet as this he never would have entered into this
							Negotiation; and he was for asking immediately a conference with the
							British Plenipotentiaries, stating to them that we had entirely
							misunderstood their intentions, and informing them that we do not think
							it worth while to proceed any further with them in the business— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin was averse to making an
							acknowledgment that he had been deceived; but for meeting the British
							Plenipotentiaries; proposing Alterations to their Counter-Projet, and
							bringing them to a definite answer before breaking off. We therefore
							sent a Note to the British Plenipotentiaries, proposing to meet them at
							the board of trade, this day at three O’Clock; and we accordingly went
							at that hour— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin gave me a seat in
							his Carriage— We found only M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson at
							the Office for trade, who apologized to us, observing that he had come
							to the office only at half past two, which was later than he usually
							came; and that it had been too late to give Notice to his Colleagues—
							That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn lived near at hand, and
							might perhaps be found— But D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams was at
							a distance, and would probably not be at home, if sent for— But they
							would certainly meet us on Monday at the hour most suitable to
							ourselves.— We fixed upon two O’Clock, and observed, that for the sake
							of greater dispatch we might before Monday Morning send them a written
							Communication upon their Counter Projet— We agreed among ourselves to
							meet at Noon to-morrow at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s
							chambers, when he promised to have a Note in Answer to the British
							Counter-Projet, prepared for Consideration.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin set me down at my door; and at five O’Clock I went
							according to my engagement, and dined with <persRef ref="joy-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Joy</persRef> at his
							lodgings, N. 12. Penton Street Pentonville. We were alone, and his
							communication turned out to be, that he should go, without official
							character, but on the basis of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s</persRef> private Letters to
							him, indicating his confidence, and supported by the Evidence of his own
							hatred of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>, proved
							by his publications, to enquire and ascertain of <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">Louis the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi></persRef> Ministers at Ghent, what they would do to
							indemnify American Claimants upon France, if they should be again
							restored to the throne.— I asked him what motive he had to present to
							the Government of Louis 18 as inducement to answer the question— It was
							asking of them a pledge of what they would do on a future contingency.—
							What pledge could they give? why should they give any? and what would it
							be worth when given? He said there was nothing to offer; as he was by no
							means for pledging the United States to take a part in the War, in
							favour of the Bourbons— But perhaps in their ill fortune they might be
							more willing to promise future Justice, than they might be after their
							actual restoration, and he thought that such a promise though
							necessarily in general terms would be worth having— He told me he had
							already had some conversation of this kind, with <persRef
								ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rayneval</persRef> who was brother in Law, to <persRef
								ref="didelot-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Didelot</persRef>, whom he had seen as French Minister at
							Copenhagen, and of whom he entertained a high opinion— He expatiated
							upon the great usefulness of inofficial missions, and how much more a
							person unaccredited could obtain than a regular Minister— As one of the
							Ministers of State, had told him at Copenhagen. I gave no countenance to
							his project of a secret mission to the Court of Ghent which he said he
							was far from thinking of much importance, but to which he repeatedly
							recurred in the midst of Conversation upon other topics— He shewed me a
							parliamentary document to prove the very small proportion of supplies
							which the British Colonies in the West Indies could derive from Halifax
							and Nova-Scotia; but it was of the year 1806, and he gave me one of the
							printed pamphlets of his political essays, part of which only was
							published, the remainder being suppressed as unpopular— He gave me also
							a copy of his Letter to <persRef ref="kirkland-john">President
								Kirkland</persRef>, on the Epilogue to the Play of the Westminster
							School Boys, last Autumn—and of the Epilogue itself— I sat out to walk
							home; but it came on to rain, and I returned in a Hackney Coach.— While
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin were with me this Morning, <persRef ref="perkins-s"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. Perkins</persRef> called upon
							me; but finding us engaged in business, immediately withdrew— We had
							also visits from the <persRef ref="ruffo-maria">Princess of Castel

								<persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							that it was nearly three when I reached the Office for trade; where I
							found the <persRef ref="robinson-frederick;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, and Mess<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi>
							<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> already assembled— We
							entered immediately upon business, and sat nearly three hours— I took no
							part in the discussion— The whole business is conducted with so much
							precipitation, and the reference is so continual to the Conferences
							which had taken place before my arrival, upon the substance of which the
							ideas of the two parties are so widely different, that I have not felt
							it safe or prudent to enter into the debates, and have been entirely
							silent— It became perfectly clear to me this day, that upon no one of
							the three points for which the Negotiation was commenced is there any
							likelihood of our coming to an Agreement with the British
							Plenipotentiaries— Their Counter-Projet presents the Article relating to
							the intercourse with Canada so drawn that it would indirectly give them
							the trade with Indians within our territories, and it does not admit us
							to navigate the river S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Lawrence even down
							to Montreal.— They disavowed the intention of obtaining thus indirectly
							the Indian trade; but they inflexibly resisted the allowance of our
							navigating the waters within their Exclusive Jurisdiction, even for
							rafts to carry lumber and flour to Montreal— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin pressed it upon them, that it was merely to carry
							our own Articles to Port of theirs for the purpose of exportation; and
							that they would have the benefit of that exportation exclusively in
							their own vessels.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay urged to them,
							that it was not a ship, and scarcely even a boat navigation that we
							asked—it was little more than the mere floating of rafts; to be taken
							down in exchange for gewgaws from Europe.— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams was piqued at this term gewgaws, and said that if our
							people liked those gewgaws, no doubt they would give their lumber and
							flour, in exchange for them— The D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							appeared offended too at our proposal to omit the Article altogether—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin urged with force that if the
							Navigation to Montreal was denied us, the Article would be of no benefit
							to us whatever— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams insisted that that
							was no reason for leaving it out— Because if the benefit to us was not
							in that Article it might be in some other, or in the whole Treaty— The
							proposition of placing the two Nations respectively on the footing of
							the most favoured Nation, was confined by the British Projet, to the
							territories in Europe, on the British part— The Plenipotentiaries said
							that by the Treaty of Paris they had granted to the French, the
							privilege of landing and drying fish on the Island of Newfoundland:
							which was given in Consideration of the cession by the French of their
							part of the Island. That on the same principle, privileges had been
							granted to the Dutch, in consideration of the cession by them of the
							Cape of Good Hope, and of certain West-India Islands,—that in the East
							Indies, special privileges were allowed to Nations having themselves
							Colonies there; which were not extended to Nations having none. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin observed that privileges granted
							to other Nations for specific equivalents which we could not grant,
							would not be extended to us by a stipulation to treat us as the most
							favoured Nation. That we had on our part granted a privilege of that
							kind to France, for trading to Louisiana, during a term of twelve years;
							which indeed will have expired before any treaty that we can now make
							could be ratified— But as to the discrimination between Nations holding
							Colonies, and those holding none in the East Indies, he thought that the
							benefit to Great-Britain arising from the general Commerce of the United
							States, and the consideration that all the advantages which we derive
							from Commerce invariably flow back and centre in Great-Britain, would at
							least entitle them to expect to be placed upon as favourable a footing
							in their intercourse with India, as other Nations. It was replied that
							the Nations having Colonies themselves were now allowed the indirect
							trade with India, and that by placing us on the footing of the most
							favoured Nation, it would in point of fact give us for nothing the
							indirect trade for which we had been informed that an equivalent would
							be required. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay remarked that the
							limitation of two years in the Counter-Projet, for allowing us the
							indirect intercourse with India, was in substance a limitation of one
							year—for as our ships all go for India in the Spring it was now too late
							for them to have any benefit from the Article this year—and the two
							years would be expired before the benefit could be enjoyed upon Voyages
							to be commenced the second ensuing Spring— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Adams answered this by saying that he thought two years
							must of course have two Springs— There remained only one Article, that
							for the equalization of duties upon which there appears any prospect of
							our coming to an agreement. There were objections on each side to the
							draft of the Article as prepared by the other— The British draft had
							omitted the abolition of discriminating duties on merchandize imported
							in <pb n="273" type="ms"/>the ships of the two Nations, and had confined
							it to the tonnage duties— It had also omitted the equalization of
							drawbacks and bounties— Our draft included them all— The British
							Plenipotentiaries agreed to include them all, but they thought our draft
							so worded that it would give to American Vessels the same drawbacks
							allowed upon exportations in British Vessels, upon merchandize not
							exported in the same vessel that imported them— They objected that this
							would extend the privilege beyond the intention of the parties, and
							requested a more precise draft of the Article, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin promised to give them— Recurring
							to the East-Indian Article just before the close of the Conference, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson said it was true that if we were
							placed there on the footing of the most favoured Nation, it would not be
							precisely the same thing as granting us the indirect trade without
							limitation, because as other Nations had the indirect trade only by
							regulation and not by Treaty, it might be revoked by Act of Parliament—
							This he said was indeed a new view of the subject; but they were not
							authorized to accede to the Article upon that ground— We requested them,
							and they promised to furnish us as soon as possible the substance of
							what they had said in this Conference, in answer to our Note of the
								17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— As we came out of the office I
							enquired of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin if <persRef
								ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef> was
							gone— He said No—but the Neptune was gone. She sailed yesterday Morning—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Gallatin had first fixed the 14<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> of this Month as the time when they would certainly be at
							Plymouth; and had given notice to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> of their determination to leave London the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— They have however been induced to
							stay until now, and had written to fix again the day of departure to the
							Neptune, for the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							<persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bayard</persRef> and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin took seats in my Carriage, and alighted at their lodgings— I
							found both of them inclined to accept an article for the East-India

							have not the same inclination— I came home and at seven went and dined
							at the <persRef ref="fane-john">Earl of Westmorland’s</persRef>— Mess<hi

						<p><date>20. VI:45. </date>I delivered this day five Passports to American

								>Anthony Shaddock</persRef> Master of a Coasting Vessel, between

								ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef> to make application for his release conformably to
							the Treaty of Ghent. I called this Morning upon <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, to return him some of the Papers which he lent
							me to be copied, and to take others.— I found with him <persRef
								ref="white-john4;white-henry2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry White</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="buchanan-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Buchanan</persRef> of Baltimore, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cruger</persRef> of New-York; all of
							whom had Letters of recommendation to me; which they delivered to me. On
							returning home, and just before dinner I received the promised Note from
							the <persRef ref="robinson-frederick;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, containing the substance of
							what they had said to us yesterday in Conference, upon our proposed
							alterations of their Contre-Projet— I took it immediately after dinner
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s lodgings, where I found
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, and it was determined to ask another Conference with
							the British Plenipotentiaries at two O’Clock to-morrow. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi>Gallatin again expressed the inclination to sign an Article
							limiting us to the direct trade with India, notwithstanding our
							Instructions— On the ground that the British Government having since the
							date of our Instructions allowed to their own subjects, other than the
							East India Company, a direct trade with China, had no longer the same
							motive for allowing the trade to us— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							repeated what he has said several times, that he believed if we did not
							sign an Article, that the British would exclude us from the trade with
							India, altogether— I do not believe that, as it is a trade entirely to
							their own advantage, and in which we export there scarcely any thing but
							specie— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that from all the
							enquires that he had made, and particularly from <persRef
								ref="perkins-s">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins</persRef>,
							the indirect trade was of little or no value; but I said that if we
							should stipulate to be excluded from it, I had no doubt its value would
							soon be discovered in America— That Article in the unratified Treaty of
							1806. having been one of those which gave the most dissatisfaction; and
							having been severely commented on by <persRef ref="morris-gouverneur"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Morris’s</persRef> pamphlet,
							published at the time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that
							he had never seen or heard of that pamphlet. He added that if I
							persisted in my opinion, he and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							could not take it upon them to sign the Treaty with such an Article,
							because it would be unquestionably contrary to our Instructions; and the
							best way was to reserve it for the Consideration of our Government— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was against referring any thing to
							our Government. He was for concluding <pb n="274" type="ms"/>or breaking
							off the Negotiation— He has changed his opinion since his interview with
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, and
							the first Conference which I attended— On the East-Indian Article he is
							flexible enough. But the Canadian Article displeases him, and the
							intimation from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams that it would be
							insisted on inclines him to break off entirely. He and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin however would prefer signing a
							single Article, for the equalization of duties, which they think by far
							the most important Article of the Treaty— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin thought it would be useless to ask another conference— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay wished for it, and we acquiesced in
							sending a Note to ask it— I came home, and then went with a small
							Evening party at <persRef ref="vincent-mary">Lady Vincent’s</persRef>—
							There were about forty persons present, Ladies and Gentlemen, one of
							whom we knew. Some of the Ladies sung a few Italian Airs and Duets, with
							accompaniment of the Piano. The Conversation was all concerning the
							battle in the Netherlands; of which a multitude of rumours, but no
							Official Accounts have arrived. We came home about twelve at Night—
								<persRef ref="brown-james6">James Brown</persRef> the footman whom I
							took on my arrival here, left me this day.— The first worthless Servant

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley</persRef> called on me this
							morning, and I gave him two applications from Sailors, stating
							themselves to have been impressed, and to be detained on board of
							British ships of War. He has made an application for the release of
								<persRef ref="shaddock-anthony">Shaddock</persRef>— He shewed me an
							extract of a Letter from <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef> at Stockholm to him,
							mentioning that <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Erving</persRef> had unfavourable impressions against
							Beasley, and had given them to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and perhaps
							to the Government at home— That he believed M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Beasley had been concerned in covering British property, in
							a contraband trade; which Erving said he had detected, while at
							Copenhagen— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley denied to me having
							ever been concerned in any such transactions. He had been the Agent for
							the Cargoes of three American Vessels, sent into Copenhagen in 1809; and
							shewed me the Powers of Attorney from the owners of those Cargoes in
							Virginia— One of the names was of a house, natives of Great-Britain, but
							Citizens of the United States— Beasley said that unless that was the
							foundation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving’s suspicions he knew
							not what was— An agent of his at Gothenburg, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Nae</persRef>, had opened &amp;
							shewed to others a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving to
							him upon business—which he Beasley had regretted and apologized to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving for. But it had incensed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving, and perhaps given rise to his
							suspicions— Beasley complained however of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Erving for having written against him to the Government, without having
							given him notice of it— I told him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Erving had transiently said something of the same kind to me as to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford. That I would write to him, and
							state what he Beasley had said to me in his justification, and I
							presumed if there was no other ground for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Erving’s prejudice than that he had mentioned, he would acknowledge and
							repair his mistake— That the opening and shewing of Erving’s letter by
							M’Nae was certainly an unpleasant circumstance, and might give
							reasonable ground for suspicion— But it was certainly not conclusive—
							Beasley said he would shew me, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving’s
							Letters to him on the subject.— <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> sent me a Note from
								<persRef ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Robinson</persRef> to him promising that the <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> would meet us this day at 2 O’Clock— I
							took it back to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, and asked him
							for a seat in his Carriage— I told him that if the British
							Plenipotentiaries should continue inflexible on the East-Indian and
							Canadian Articles, I thought it would be best to sign a Convention in a
							single Article, for equalizing the duties; without pretending to make it
							a Treaty of Commerce— That our Countrymen would think it worse than
							ridiculous if we should give them for a Treaty of Commerce, an
							Instrument filled with Articles of mere form, about admitting Consuls,
							and the like, which with or without Treaty would stand on precisely the
							same footing; and without containing a single Article to settle any of
							the points, commercial or political, which really belong to Treaties of
							Commerce— That for equalizing the duties being itself such that it might
							safely rest on the Legislative Acts of the two Countries without a
							Treaty. He differed from this opinion; and said that as to the political
							Articles, they did not properly belong to Treaties of Commerce, and he
							did not know why they were even put into them— He thought they seldom
							were— I said they were in all the modern Treaties of Commerce, and
							instanced that of 1786 between France and England, in which G. Britain
							had admitted the principle of Free Ships making free goods. He said he
							never knew that, and he believed I was mistaken. I afterwards appealed
							to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> who remembered as I did, but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin persisted in his unbelief. He said he had thought
							of two proposals to make relative to the East Indian Article— One was to
							offer a reciprocal admission of British Ships from the East-Indies into
							the United States— The other was to shorten the whole Convention to a
							middle term between the eight years originally proposed, and the two
							years to which the British Plenipotentiaries wish to reduce the East
							Indian Article— I objected to the first as going beyond any thing
							contemplated in our Instructions, and as an experiment the effect of
							which we could not foresee. As since the admission of private British
							adventurers to the East-Indian trade, such a stipulation on our part
							might enable them to take away a great part of our trade with India from
							our merchants. I consented that the second should be made— At one, I
							called upon <persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bourke</persRef> the Danish Minister, to enquire of the character of
							a man who offers himself as a footman, and who had been in his service.—
							At two M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay called and took me with them down to
							the Board of Trade where we met the British Plenipotentiaries.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had given M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Goulburn a new draft of an Article concerning the
							equalization of duties; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson
							thought it still not free from ambiguity, and proposed a draft of his
							own upon the subject— It was however understood that we were agreed upon
							the substance of the Article, the final draft of which might be deferred
							until we should come to a result upon the other points— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin enquired whether we were to
							consider the answer of the British <pb n="275" type="ms"
							/>Plenipotentiaries, as a positive rejection of our proposal for putting
							the Indian Article upon the footing of the most favoured Nation— They
							were not altogether explicit in their answer— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Robinson and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn
							intimated that it was—but D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams was of
							opinion that writing must speak for itself, and that if we wanted any
							explanation of any thing in their written Note, we must ask for it in
							writing— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that we had asked
							for the conference, to save time— That if we were to consider our
							proposal as explicitly rejected, we had another proposal to make; which
							was to omit the second Separate Article of their Contre-Projet, and to
							shorten the duration of the whole Treaty— They promised to take this
							into Consideration when we should propose it in writing.— As we were
							returning home, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay recurred to his idea
							of breaking off the Negotiation— I mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin that in conversation with me before the conference
							he had spoken of the proposal to shorten the term of the Treaty, as to
							be offered for four years; but in stating it in Conference he had
							mentioned no precise period, and they might understand the offer as
							being to limit the whole Treaty to two years— He said that in the
							written Note, he should not make the offer at-all— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that if we accepted it with the
							limitation of four years it would be saddled with the Canadian Article
							as drawn by them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and I both
							thought that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams’s adherence to the
							Canadian Article was a mere freak of his own, and that they would
							readily consent to omit the Article.— We parted at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin’s door leaving him to make a
							draft of the Note, to be sent— As we were sitting down to dinner I
							received a Note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, with the
							draft upon which he and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had agreed,
							asking me to look it over, and saying they would call upon me
							immediately after dinner to prepare and send it— They accordingly came,
							and we made out the Note; which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							wrote, and we all signed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin took
							it with him to send to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson, who
							lives near his lodgings— I made out a copy of this Note, which brought
							the Evening to near Midnight.</p>

								Bollman</persRef> at his lodgings in Buckingham Street-Strand. He
							shewed me the medals which he had struck at the Monnoie des Medailles at

								>Emperors of Russia</persRef> and <persRef ref="francis-i"
								>Austria</persRef> and the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king

							of the Place Vendome; and that on the return of <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">Louis 18</persRef> from England— He had sent one
							to Russia and told me that he gave 280 franks for striking the six. In
							the first instance they declined striking them at all from an
							apprehension that the hardness of the metal would break the dies— He had
							however shewn them a mode of doing it upon which they consented to try
							the experiment and succeeded— The proportional specific gravity of
							silver, gold and platina is 11. 19. and 21. and the proportional value
							at present of Platina is intermediate between silver and gold, about 4
							to 1. to silver and 1/4 to 1 to Gold. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bollman has a plan for making a coinage of Platina for which its
							infusibility and its gravity render it peculiarly convenient— The first
							preventing its being melted down, and the second making counterfeits of
							it impracticable. The Doctor had a few pieces with the Austrian Ducat
							stamp, which <pb n="276" type="ms"/>he had got struck at Vienna— He also
							shewed me some of the metal in its natural state, something like
							gold-dust— The secret is to compound it into masses— And although it is
							one of the rarest substances in Nature, hitherto the uses to which it
							has been made applicable have not sufficed for the consumption of all
							the metal that has been found.— The Doctor thinks also that silver must
							continue to depretiate as it has already much depretiated in its value—
							The mines in Peru have for some years ceased working for want of a
							supply of quicksilver— But there is now a contact for that supply from
							the mines near Trieste, and the transportation has been undertaken by
							the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">house of Baring</persRef> here—the
							Government having furnished a ship of war for the purpose— D<hi

						<p><date>29. VI:30. </date>Wrote a Letter to the <persRef
								ref="dallas-alexander">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> on the
							subject of the proposed loan. At half past eleven O’Clock, I went to
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef>
							according to appointment— I found in his Antichamber the Russian
							Ambassador <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>, the
								<persRef ref="pratt-john">Marquis of Camden</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="planta-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Planta</persRef>,
							and one or two other persons— After waiting a few minutes I was received
							in his Lordship’s Cabinet.— I gave him <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury’s</persRef> Commission as Consul
							at Liverpool, which he had sent me, to obtain the exequatur— Lord
							Castlereagh said it would be immediately made out.— I then spoke to him
							of the <pb n="279" type="ms"/>case of <persRef ref="shaddock-anthony"
								>Anthony Shaddock</persRef>, a man taken the last Autumn as Master
							of a coasting vessel between Savannah and Amelia Island. A Citizen of
							the United States— Taken as a prisoner of War— Paroled at Bermuda for
							some time as a prisoner of War, and then sent over here in the
							Vengeur—to be tried by a Court Martial as one of the mutineers of the
							Hermoine frigate— I said that it was impossible for me to wish to screen
							from condign punishment a person who should have been guilty of such a
							crime as that—but the man was a Citizen of the United States.— I had
							reason to believe that the Evidence upon which the suspicion against him
							had been raised was very weak— He declared that he knew nothing of that
							crime— I hoped and trusted he was innocent— But the principle to the
							benefit of which I thought him entitled was the fulfilment of the Treaty
							stipulation to restore All Prisoners of War— Lord Castlereagh did not at
							first recollect the affair of the Hermoine frigate; but afterwards said
							he had some remembrance of it, and thought it a very <hi rend="italic"
								>disgusting</hi> thing. He enquired where the man now was— I did not
							know, but he had been sent to England I said in the Vengeur— He said it
							seemed to him it brought back again the question of the War— That they
							did not consider a British Subject as a Prisoner of War— That every
							Government in Europe would consider such persons as Traitors, and not as
							Prisoners of War— I said I was not acquainted with any such usage in
							Europe— That it was true the case of <persRef ref="macdonald-aeneas"
								>AEneas M’Donald</persRef> in this Country appeared to sanction the
							principle in its rigour— He had indeed been sentenced, but not executed—
							But this man was not triable as a traitor; even on that principle— He
							had not been taken in arms, but in a merchant vessel. While the War had
							lasted, Great-Britain might adhere with what strictness she thought
							proper to the principle for which she contended in theory, but having
							stipulated in the Treaty for the restoration of all Prisoners of War, I
							conceived that it was no longer competent for her to make any
							discrimination, or to enquire where any individual prisoner was born— I
							said I had preferred asking this interview, and stating the case
							verbally, to the formality of an official note with a hope that the man
							might be released without such public interposition— Lord Castlereagh
							expressed himself perfectly satisfied as to the manner of my
							application; but he gave me no reason to expect that it would be
							effectual— He said he supposed that the Admiralty Court was that where
							the trial was to take place— I said I had supposed so, when the case was
							first represented to me; but I afterwards learnt that the trial was to
							be by a Court Martial— This Circumstance had strongly confirmed me in
							the impression that it was my duty to claim in the man’s behalf the
							benefit of the Treaty— The Agent for Prisoners of War, had in the first
							instance claimed the release of the man, and had been answered that the
							matter was in a train of legal investigation— But the mode of trial
							itself, was one not congenial to the general feelings either of
							Englishmen or of Americans, nor such as in their opinions could give the
							fullest Confidence to Innocence— First to be sent across the Atlantic
							Ocean, and then to be tried by a merely military tribunal were
							hardships, from which I felt it my duty to use every endeavour to redeem
							any American Citizen— The fulfilment of the Treaty it was equally my
							duty to require— This man had some property in America; and had friends
							who took an interest in his situation here— They had applied to me for
							my interposition in his behalf, which I could not feel myself justified
							in denying. Lord Castlereagh took a minute of the man’s name and of the
							Ship in which he was sent to England, as if to make further enquiry into
							the matter; but without promising any thing.— I then spoke of the
							Passports— I told him that until within these five or six days,
							Passports to go to France had been delivered at the Alien Office, to
							Americans desirous of going there, upon their producing Passports given
							them by me— That several of them had now been told that something
							further from me would be necessary— Several foreigners had also been to
							me stating the wish to go to America, and that they were also referred
							from the Alien Office to me— It was my desire to conform myself to the
							regulations of this Government, and at the same time to secure to my
							fellow-citizens the liberty of going where their concerns may call them—
							He said he did not know precisely what the regulations were— The
							Alien-Office was in the Home Department under <persRef
								ref="addington-henry2">Lord Sidmouth</persRef>; we should see him at
							the Levee; and it would perhaps be best to speak on the subject to him—
							I mentioned again the misconstruction of an Article in the Treaty of
							Ghent, by the British naval Commander in Chesapeake Bay, relating to the
							restoration of captured Slaves, and asked him if he had not received
							some communication upon the subject from America— He said there was a
							voluminous Correspondence concerning it received yesterday from <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>—
							He had apparently not read it, and said that he should be obliged to
							leave town to-morrow Evening for Bruxelles— But during his absence the
							business of his Department would be transacted by <persRef
								ref="jenkinson-robert">Lord Liverpool</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>— He asked if this
							matter concerning the slaves was not the same about which <persRef
								ref="horner-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horner</persRef>
							had yesterday made a Motion in the House of Commons— I said I believed
							not— From what I had seen in the Newspapers of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Horner’s motion, it referred to Slaves said to have been
							taken in the United States, and sold in the West-Indies— What I now
							referred to was the restoration of Slaves, taken during the War,
							stipulated to be restored, but still detained by the British Naval
							Commanders. He said it should be attended to, and asked if I had any
							particular desire that <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot’s</persRef> departure should be
							hastened— I said I could only <pb n="280" type="ms"/>desire that he
							might go as soon as would suit his own convenience and that of his
							Government— I returned home and at 2 O’Clock went and attended the
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent’s</persRef> Levee— All the
							foreign Ambassadors and Ministers were there; and I was introduced by
								<persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rayneval</persRef> to the <persRef ref="delachastre-claude">Comte de
								la Chatre</persRef> the Ambassador of <persRef ref="louis-xviii"
								>Louis 18</persRef>. I also became acquainted with the <persRef
								ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="u">Sardinian</persRef> and <persRef ref="ramadani-anthony"
								>Turkish Ministers</persRef>, and renewed old acquaintances with
								<persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard">Baron Rehausen</persRef>, the
							Swedish Minister, whom I had known at the Hague, and with <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtoys</persRef>, Secretary
							of the Spanish Embassy, whom I had known in the like capacity at Berlin—
							The Turkish Chargé d’Affaires, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ramadani
							told me that he had been formerly acquainted here with <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef>— He spoke of our war with the Algerines, and
							expressed a wish that the United States would send a Minister to
							Constantinople.— He told me that the Algerine Squadron lately off Lisbon
							had taken a vessel under the Ottoman flag, which had sailed from this
							place with his papers— But he had no doubt she would be restored when
							she got into Port— The Sardinian Minister said they were doing infinite
							mischief to the Navigation of his Country, and that our Squadron would
							meet with every assistance and good Office that could be afforded them
							in the Island of Sardinia— I spoke to Lord Sidmouth on the subject of
							the Passports at the Alien Office— He requested me to call on Saturday
							next at 12 O’Clock, at his Office—the Home Department, when he said he
							would introduce to me <persRef ref="beckett-j">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Becket</persRef>, whom he had placed at the head of the
							Alien-Office, and who would immediately settle with me some general
							rule, by which American Citizens, desirous of going to France may be
							accommodated— He assured me that every disposition to accommodate
							American Citizens would be shewn that was possible— The first, or
							Diplomatic Levee was short—the <persRef ref="ernest-augustus">Duke of
								Cumberland</persRef> was the only Prince of the blood present. The
							Regent spoke a few words to all the Ambassadors and Ministers, and asked
							me if I had ever been in England before. When the second Levee commenced
							there was a crowd of persons thronged into the chamber, among whom I
							knew only <persRef ref="bailey-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef>, the Consul at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							Petersburg— He came up to me, and asked me if it was over— He said that
							he had been presented and knighted, but that it was done so in an
							instant that he hardly knew how it happened—never having been there
							before. I congratulated him upon his new dignity— He said it was about
							as good as the order of <persRef ref="vladimir">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t</hi> Wolodimir</persRef>— As we retired I spoke to <persRef
								ref="fagel-henry">Baron Fagel</persRef>, the Dutch Ambassador, and
							enquired after his brother <persRef ref="fagel-robert">Robert</persRef>,
							and his brother in Law <persRef ref="u">Boreal</persRef>— He told me
							that Boreal had escaped unhurt in the late Battle, though his Regiment
							had been almost destroyed— I came home from the Levee about four
							O’Clock, and just before dinner received a Note from the <persRef
								ref="robinson-frederick;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> agreeing to sign a Convention, as we
							proposed by our Note of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
							proposing to meet us at the Board of Trade at 2 O’Clock to-morrow. I
							took it immediately after dinner to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— He sent over for
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, who came, and they both read the British Note—
							There was some question, whether it required a reply— I thought and
							strongly urged that it did— We agreed to meet at one O’Clock to-morrow
							at my lodgings. I walked afterwards to the Park, to meet <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="adams-john2;adams-george;adams-charles2">Children</persRef>,
							but they were returning home. I met <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef>, who was going to take
							his seat in a Stage for Liverpool, to go to-morrow Morning.</p>

							came this morning and took his Passport and that of <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Remsen</persRef> to go to

							the <persRef ref="dallas-alexander">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>
							and a Packet of Newspapers for the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary

							<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> came to my lodgings, to
							consult with me, upon the Note which we received last Evening from the
								<persRef ref="robinson-frederick;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay thought no reply from us was necessary— I thought one
							indispensable— Of two alternatives which we offered them in our last
							Note, they accept one; but with pretensions of generosity, as if they
							were granting a favour, which I thought it essential to repel— I
							insisted on this, until M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin took
							from his Pocket the draft of a Note which he had prepared and with the
							substance of which I was satisfied— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							ultimately consented to sign it, and immediately transcribed it from the
							draft.— We took it with us, and delivered it ourselves to the British
							Plenipotentiaries. We were now agreed upon the substance of the
							Convention which is to be for four years from the signature and consists
							of five Articles.— From the Drafts made of the second Article on both
							sides its ultimate form was agreed upon— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin had inserted the exception relative to the West-Indies, in the
							body of the Article— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson had
							proposed to make a separate Article of it. The conclusion was to put it
							in a paragraph at the Close of the Article— There was in the East-Indian
							Article a proviso that American Vessels might touch for refreshment, but
							not for Commerce at the Cape of Good-Hope, the Island of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Helena, or other British places in the
							African or Indian Seas, in their voyages to or from the British
							Possessions in India. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin observed
							to the British Plenipotentiaries, that this did not allow the same
							privileges to American Vessels going to or from China. The limitation
							was a novelty— It had not been in the former Treaties, and he mentioned
							it now, not that we intended to make a point of it, but for the British
							Plenipotentiaries to consider whether it was worth adhering
							to—particularly as it would not prevent a single American voyage to
							China. It then became proper to consider of the preamble— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn drew one up, from former
							Precedents, which he shewed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin.
							He said that in the Preamble to the Treaty of Ghent, there had been a
							mistake— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay asked him what it was—
							Goulburn avoided answering the Question; but said that one of the Clerks
							in the foreign Office, upon his return here had told him they had made a
							mistake— It did not <pb n="281" type="ms"/>however affect the validity
							of the Treaty. I observed then that there had been another error, both
							in the Preamble, and in the order of the signatures at Ghent, which it
							would be necessary to avoid repeating at present. The first was that in
							the Copies on both sides the <persRef ref="george-iii">king of
								Great-Britain</persRef>, and the British Plenipotentiaries were
							first named, and the second was that the signatures all followed each
							other in succession,—the American Plenipotentiaries signing under those
							of Great-Britain. The usage of all Treaties between European Sovereigns
							we understood to be what is called the alternative—each of the parties
							and his Plenipotentiaries being first named, in the copy which he
							receives— The Signatures of the respective Plenipotentiaries being on a
							line, and alternate. Those of each party signing first, in the Copy
							which he receives— With regard to the order of the signatures, the
							British Plenipotentiaries made no positive objection; but D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams said he did not know there was any
							such usage, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said the same.—
							I told Goulburn that if he would take the trouble of enquiring at the
							foreign Office, he would find it an universal usage— As to the
							alternative, in the preamble, and in naming the Parties in the Treaty,
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams said that in such a case the
							Copies would not be alike— I said that as it was a practice by common
							consent generally established and understood, and the mere variation of
							order in naming the Parties made no change either in the substance or in
							the words of the Treaty, it did not in any manner affect the essential
							accuracy of the copies. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said
							that in this case, the changes must then run through the whole Treaty— I
							said if the Preamble and ratifying clause were right, it was not so
							material in the body of the Treaty; but if he would have a draft copy
							made out as was agreed, and as they intended to execute <hi
								rend="italic">their</hi> copy, and send it to me, I would have <hi
								rend="italic">our</hi> Copy made out, corresponding to it, and ready
							to be executed Monday Morning. They promised to send me such a draft
							Copy— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin had expressed some wish to finish the business this
							day or to-morrow. But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn were under the necessity of
							attending at 4 O’Clock the House of Commons, where there was to be a
							close vote upon a question of a grant of £6000 per annum to the <persRef
								ref="ernest-augustus">Duke of Cumberland</persRef> on his Marriage;
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn was obliged to go out of
							town to-morrow, and will not return till Monday Morning.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he did not know how the
							usage was, with regard to the alternatives in the Treaty; but he knew
							the order in which we had signed and sealed at Ghent had been wrong—
							That it ought to have been in parallel lines— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Robinson finally said he believed we were right— At least he
							knew it had been so at the Treaty of Chaumont, which was the only Treaty
							that he had ever been before concerned in making.— We left the British
							Plenipotentiaries just at four— I took over to <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>, my
							Letter Book of the Joint Negotiations, and a number of Papers to be
							copied into it— Thence I went to the Guildhall Coffee-House, to see
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chevalier</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef> had informed me by a Note, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chevalier would go to-morrow morning for
							France— He was not at his lodgings: I left with my Card, a letter for
								<persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Erving</persRef>, from the <persRef ref="ochacon-tammaso">Duke of
								Sorentino</persRef>, which he had brought to me yesterday— I
							returned home to dinner, and wrote to <persRef key="adams-abigail">my
								Mother</persRef>. After dinner, I took a ride with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> to Hyde Park corner, and we walked from thence to
							Kensington Garden, and the Turnpike at the lower end of it.— I was
							apprehensive this morning that <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> in the hurry and pressure of business, would
							forget the application which I made to him yesterday, in behalf of
								<persRef ref="shaddock-anthony">Anthony Shaddock</persRef>, and I

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The month has elapsed in a state
							of confusion resembling that of the first week after my arrival here— My
							Correspondence runs in arrears constantly accumulating. This Journal has
							also a perpetual tendency to run in arrear.— The essential difficulty of
							all Journalizing is that the more the day is absorbed by occupation, the
							less time is left for committing the record of it to writing. We have
							settled none of our family arrangements— The <persRef
								ref="adams-john2;adams-george;adams-charles2">Children</persRef> are
							still all with us, it being now the midsummer Vacation at all the
							schools— They have masters for writing and arithmetic, fencing and

							completely taken up, that I have none left to attend to them— The

								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james">my

							narrative— Visits, dinners, Passports, and Projectors, have left me
							scarcely a moment for preparing my own public dispatches, or answering
							the Letters of my private Correspondents.— I rise irregularly from five
							to half past seven, and after the reading which I begin the day with,
							write in this Journal until ten— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>We</persRef> then breakfast, and I have visitors or applicants for
							Passports, often without intermission, until four in the afternoon. My
							own means of escaping is to go out myself, which I have frequently been
							obliged to do, for business, and often to return visits— From four to
							six, I have occasionally two hours during which I can write, and when
							possible employ them in that manner— From Six to Seven we dine, and
							after dinner, I sometimes ride out with the rest of the family, but more
							commonly walk an hour or two, for exercise—alone or with my Son, George.
							We return home between nine and ten, soon after which, I finish the
							day.</p>
