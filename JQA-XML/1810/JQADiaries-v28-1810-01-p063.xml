							about 4. leaving the company still dancing— I had much conversation with

							about <persRef ref="divernois-francis">d’Ivernois’s</persRef> late
							pamphlet; and asked me, what I thought its weak part— But he did not
							give me his own opinion— At Supper I sat next to <persRef

							officer, about 25 years old, who has been repeatedly sent by the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> in special missions,

								ref="francis-i">Emperor of France</persRef>— He has been during the

								>Napoleon</persRef>, and in his immediate family—constantly the
							companion of his table; and sleeping in his tent— He told me that he had
							been present at eight pitched battles— Among which were those of Eylau,
							Friedland, <pb n="65" type="ms"/>Essling and Wagram— That of Essling he
							said was totally lost, “mais grandement”—by the French. And that it was
							entirely the fault of the Austrians that they did not take advantage of
							it— He said that the military reputation of the <persRef
								ref="charlesarchdukeofaustria">Archduke Charles</persRef> was
							irretrievably lost, and that all the present misfortunes were imputable
							to him, almost alone.— He told me several particulars relating
							personally to Napoleon— I asked him if he was subject to the epilepsy—
							He hesitated about answering—but finally said, not to his knowledge—
							Then casting his eyes on both sides, as if fearful any body might hear,
							he said “il a la galle rentrée.” He added that he slept little—waked
							often in the night, and would rise in his bed—speak—give some order, and
							then go to sleep again— The <persRef ref="u">Duke de
								Mondragone</persRef> told me it was not certain whether he was to

							to it— That two years ago, he wanted to marry the <persRef
								ref="catherinepavlovna">grand-duchess Catherine</persRef>; who
							though the most ambitious woman in the world, absolutely refused to have
							him— The Grand-Duchess Catherine is her <persRef ref="catherinethegreat"
								>grand-mother</persRef> over again— If any thing should ever happen
							here, it will be in her favour— The idea has never yet occurr’d to her;
							but it is impossible that it should not occur— And it would be the most
							ungrateful thing in the world—because—&amp;c.— The Grand-Duchess
							Catherine detests the French, and the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>Ambassador</persRef> made her an excellent answer at the Peterhoff
							fête last Summer— The Ambassador kept two Country-houses; one at
							Kammenoi-ostrow, to be near the Emperor, and one on the Peterhoff road,
							to be near “sa belle”—<persRef ref="vlodek-alexandra">Madame de
								Vlodek</persRef>— The Grand Duchess Catherine rallied him about his
							fondness for the Peterhoff road— The first time, he was taken by
							surprize, and got over it as well as he could—but prepared himself for
							the second. Effectivement, the Grand-Duchess renewed the attack— Oui
							Madame, je trouve le chemin de Peterhoff charmant— But I have another
							reason for frequenting it— Comment cela, Monsieur l’Ambassadeur?—
							Because it enables me the sooner, to receive the news of the frequent
							victories of l’Empereur mon Maitre— The Ambassador’s Ball last Night was
							very pleasant and lively— A year ago, he could not have given such a
							Ball—half the ladies at least, who were there last Evening, a year ago
							se seraient faites malades—would have sham’d sickness, to decline going—
							All the women, were of the English and Austrian party—to begin par la
							maitresse de l’Empereur— But she has no political influence at all— She
							is the last person in the world through whom any thing could be
							obtained— Some little place, or trifling favour for any person she might
							patronize, perhaps might be excepted, but the Emperor makes it a point
							of honour to allow no political influence to the woman by whom he has
							children because she is beautiful, and he is young, and fond of
							pleasure— The Ambassador is going to give another ice-hill party in a
							few days— Il fait une dépense d’enragé pour cette femme la. (Madame de
							Vlodek.) The Emperor Napoleon has been unanimously advised by all the
							persons in his confidence, to this divorce of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-josephine">Empress</persRef>— He is going to make his
							Empire of the West, and will incorporate the whole of Holland with it—
							How wonderfully, and how steadily he is favoured by Fortune &amp;c!—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six is very communicative, and I regret very
							much that he is going away.— He not only gives much information, but
							says that from which much more important inferences may be drawn—
							Navarro was not at home— I left his papers and his pamphlet— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef> told me
							that <persRef ref="u">M. de Rumigny</persRef> had called upon him, and
							asked him, whether the <persRef

								Gentlemen</persRef> in my family were “liants”—that he should be
							glad to be particularly <pb n="66" type="ms"/>acquainted with them— To
							go out with them to the ice-hills &amp;c.— This gives further materials
							for reflections— I closed my visits by calling upon <persRef
								ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Fisher</persRef>; who has

							and in all the dresses of the several provinces of the Empire. The
							Empress Mother played at cards about two hours— The Emperor and imperial
							family walk’d the Polonaise through the apartments untill 11. O’Clock,
							and then went in to the Palace of the Hermitage to the Supper— To this
							the foreign Ministers, and in the whole about two hundred persons were
							admitted by special invitation— The supper was served upon several
							tables— That in the centre appropriated to the imperial family; but at
							which the French Ambassador, was also seated— The other foreign

							England. He intends going, to-morrow in the afternoon— His visit this

								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador’s</persRef>— He
							had appointed to see me at eleven— I was however at his house in
							sufficient time— I told him the object upon which I had wished
							particularly to converse with him at this time, was the order of the
								<persRef ref="frederick-vi">king of Denmark</persRef>, under which
							the property of American Citizens, to so large an amount had been
							sequestered in the Ports of Holstein— That this measure was said to be
							intended only for the purpose of suppressing an illicit trade between
							these Ports and the English, and for the condemnation of English
							property: but in reality it had fallen most oppressively upon American
							Citizens and American Property— He doubted at first whether he could do
							any thing in the case; but finally promised to write to his Government
							the substance of our Conversation, and its object on my part; that the
							Court of Denmark should restore as speedily as possible the property
							really American, sequestered, by their late order, and discriminate in
							its severity between the English and the Americans.— I led the
							Conversation much into the general subject of the Continental System,
							and the impolicy of those measures which instead of injuring the
							English, went to the ruin of all their rivals in commerce, and operated
							entirely to their advantage— He appeared not to have much information
							upon the subject; but as far as he understood it, to agree with me in
							opinion. He supposed that the American Embargo-Law was still in
							operation— While I was with him, <persRef ref="schenck-hans">Count
								Schenck</persRef>, the Minister of the king of Wurtemberg called; to
							go out with him to the Ice-Hills— I therefore left him and returned
							home— At 3 O’Clock I went with the <persRef

							company went and used those at the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> palace about half a mile from the Ambassador’s
							house— We did not go— About four O’Clock, he came with his Company from
							the Hills— His Company were as usual, his own Diplomatic Circle, and the
							family connections of <persRef ref="vlodek-alexandra">Madame de
								Vlodek</persRef>.— There were a few young men whom I had not seen
