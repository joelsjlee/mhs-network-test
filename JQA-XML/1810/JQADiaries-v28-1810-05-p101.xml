							The house was newly painted and as that made it necessary to keep the

							About 6. we rose from table, and joined the procession of Carriages— The

								<persRef ref="isaac">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Isaac</persRef> last

						<p><date>14. </date>Visit this morning from <persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six</persRef>— He told me a number of
							anecdotes respecting the revolution, which placed the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> upon the throne— He
							says that he has ascertained to demonstration not only that the Emperor
							was in no manner accessory to the murder of <persRef ref="paul-i">his
								father</persRef>; but that he was affected with the deepest horror
							at the Event— That he absolutely refused for a long time to assume the
							Government, to which he was finally persuaded by old <persRef
								ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count Soltikoff</persRef>, who had been his
							governor, and the superintendent of his education— Paul had untill
							within six months of his death had but one bed-chamber with his wife—
							But his favourite Turkish slave <persRef ref="kutaisov-ivan"
								>Kutaissoff</persRef> had bred discord between them; and he had
							ordered the door between his chamber and the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress</persRef> to be barred— He had notice
							when the conspirators broke in upon him; in time to seek a retreat
							through this door— It was barr’d as he had ordered, and he lost his
							life— There was another door, between his chamber and that of his valet
							de chambre— The officer commanding the guard that Night, and a
							conspirator, that same evening locked the door, and took the key away in
							his pocket—justly foreseeing that the valet de-chambre, on finding the
							key gone, would not mention it to the Emperor, for fear of being
							punished for negligence in losing the key— The first plan of the
							conspiracy was formed by <persRef ref="panin-nikita">Count
								Panin</persRef>,<space/>and <persRef ref="benningsen-levin"
								>Benningsen</persRef>— It was communicated to the Governor of the
							City <persRef ref="pahlen-peter">Count Pahlen</persRef>, who engaged in
							it— The <persRef ref="zoubov-nikolay;zoubov-valerian;zubov-platon"
								>Zouboff’s</persRef> were merely instruments— More than eighty
							persons were privy to the project; many of whom spoke of it with great
							indiscretion— At Moscow the news was expected for many days before it
							arrived— Pahlen himself, at a dinner a fortnight before, said to
							somebody, who was speaking of Paul’s strange conduct—“This will not last
							another fortnight; we are all too tired of it[”]— At <persRef
								ref="beloselsky-alexander">Prince Beloselsky’s</persRef> On the very
							Night of the deed, a person said in presence of the Prince, and all his
							Company; “the Emperor Paul has not four hours more to live”— And
								<persRef ref="laval-jean">M. de Laval</persRef> went home at
							Midnight with this notice, and was called up in less than four hours,
							and told that the Emperor Paul was dead— Paul himself had received some
							intimations of what was in agitation— He was extremely jealous, and
							suspicious of every body— The very morning, or day before his death, he
							had uttered in presence of his Mistress <persRef ref="gagarin-anna"
								>Princess Gargarin</persRef> threats against the <pb n="106"
								type="ms"/>Empress; the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Grand-Duke
								Alexander</persRef>, and every body, indiscriminately— Princess
							Gargarin was alarmed at it; and gave notice of it to <persRef
								ref="ouvarov-fedor">General Ouvaroff</persRef>; who went to Count
							Pahlen, one of Paul’s greatest favourites, to request he would use his
							influence to appease the Emperor’s mind— Pahlen let him into the secret,
							and prevailed upon him to join the conspiracy.— These are among the
							anecdotes which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six has collected respecting
							that Tragedy— I asked him if he had heard that Paul’s Empress, when
							informed of Paul’s death; after recovering from the first shock
							occasioned by the intelligence, said to the Officer who brought it “Eh
							bien! Je suis donc votre Impératrice[”]— To which the Officer answered,
							Madame, c’est Sa Majesté l’Empereur Alexandre qui est mon Maitre.— He
							said he had not; but that under the external forms of attention and
							affection, he knew there was no cordiality between the mother and the
							Son— He said she was not popular here; and at this time particularly,
							was blamed, for having prevented two years ago the Marriage of the
								<persRef ref="catherinepavlovna">Grand-Duchess Catherine</persRef>,
							with the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>— I
							dined this day with the Chancellor, <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>, at a great Diplomatic dinner— There were
							several persons present, who were Strangers to me; among the rest,
								<persRef ref="razumofsky-gregory">Count Gregory
							Razumofsky</persRef>, newly appointed Minister of the Public
							Instruction, and <persRef ref="stroganov-grigori">Baron
								Stroganoff</persRef>, just returned from a public mission to Spain.
							At dinner I sat next to <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count de
								Maistre</persRef>, the Sardinian Minister, a man of taste and
							letters, who told me upon some enquiries which I made, that if there was
							any Grammar and Dictionary of the Slavonian language extant, it must
							have been compiled, and published by the Propagande at Rome— The
							Slavonian translation of the Psalms, used here by the Church, was
							considered he said as a Master-piece— Many of the Clergy here believed
							it to be the work of <persRef ref="stjerome">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Jerom</persRef>, who was a native of Dalmatia— But it was not
							probable— For S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Jerom, who was so celebrated by
							his vulgate Translation, if he had made that of the Psalms into the
							Slavonian, must have mentioned it in some other of his numerous works— I
							came home early and attended <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Boucher’s</persRef> Lecture— He is now thoroughly upon the subject
							of Maritime Law, and discuss’d the question of open and close Seas— He
							pronounced the Toll-duty levied by the <persRef ref="frederick-vi">King
								of Denmark</persRef> at the passage of the Sound, lawful and just,
							as being a fund for supporting the light-houses and other objects for
							the preservation of vessels navigating in these Seas— But he did not
							succeed remarkably well in distinguishing why Denmark should levy this
							duty rather than Sweden; and he told me after the lecture, that he could
							give no satisfactory reason for it— At this Lecture I met also <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boreel</persRef>, Count Romanzoff’s
							private Secretary, who spoke to me respecting the work he is preparing
							upon the History of the armed neutrality, and upon which he requested my
							observations.</p>

						<p><date>17. </date>I was engaged great part of the morning in learning

							noticed the question I had put to him, why Denmark should levy a duty
							upon the passage of vessels through the Sound, and not Sweden, to which
							he gave what he thought a sufficient answer.— That is, that the channel
							is on the Danish side. He said he had taken great pains to trace the
							origin of this duty, but had not succeeded in ascertaining it— His
							Lecture this Evening was upon Shores—Alluvion—and <hi rend="italic"
								>attérrisement</hi>, which he said should not be confounded
							together— The first was gradual, the last the effect of some sudden
							&amp; extraordinary change— He mentioned a very singular and celebrated
							law-suit which had been decided not long since in the kingdom of Naples
							arising from an event of this kind— An Earthquake, had transported one
							man’s house upon the territory of another— And the question was to whom
							the house then belonged— The first tribunal decided in favour of the
							first proprietor; but upon the appeal the Superior Court reversed this
							decision and gave the house to the owner of the land where it had
							fallen— Very justly, said M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher, because it is
							an invariable maxim that the accessory follows the principal— Now the
							house was the accessory to the land, and not the land to the house— As
							if Earthquakes respected maxims of Law; or as if maxims of Law, were
							made to meet the contingencies of Earthquakes— The natural Justice of
							particular cases is very often at variance with the general maxims of
							Law; and this with submission to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher,
							appears to be one of them.— At the Lecture I met the <persRef

								ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef>— He is a good-tempered man, and has

							<persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien</persRef>— Stedingk told me he did not know now when he

							to Russia.) S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien asked me many questions about

								Empress</persRef> was admired in France, for her beauty— Most
							especially for her foot, which I suppose is like the foot of <persRef
								ref="queengenevra">Queen Genevra</persRef>— The Count also talked of
							the War in Turkey, a subject which he appears to understand very well—
							He is more of a soldier than a Courtier; but he has a taste for jewelry
							and skill in the learning of precious stones. In the Evening I attended
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher’s</persRef>
							lectures, which was upon islands—wrecks of the sea, and treasure trove—
							Some others of his auditors as well as myself, had hesitated to join in
							his approbation of the Neapolitan tribunal for giving the house of one
							man to another, because an earthquake had transported it upon his land—
							He defended his doctrine by the usual argument that Courts of Justice
							must decide questions upon general principles and not upon particular
							contingencies— The latter kind of Sentences he said were called Rustic
							Judgments (Jugemens rustiques) and they were condemned by all
							enlightened Jurists— He had got a long story about my question to him,
							and its answer, in his procès verbal.</p>

						<p><date>23. </date>There is a custom of visiting annually the fortress of
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg this day, the occasion of which I
							have not heard. I thought I had not the time to spare and did not go—
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef> called upon me this afternoon; and told me he was
							informed that <persRef ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef>
							had left Paris.— The <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French
								Ambassador</persRef> gave this Evening a splendid Ball, on occasion
							of the <hi rend="strikethrough">illumination</hi> marriage of the
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>— It was
							attended by the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, and
							Imperial family. The Hotel was elegantly illuminated, as were those of
								<persRef ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="bussche-calmor">Count Bussche</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="six-willem">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six</persRef>—the <persRef
								ref="bray-francois">Chevalier de Bray</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="brancia-francesco">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Brancia</persRef>,
							the Chargé d’Affaires of Naples.— As the imperial family were at the
							Ball, it was necessary to go early— We went at 9 O’Clock, but it was
							day-light as at noon, so that the illumination made scarcely any show
							at-all— It was past two in the morning when the Court retired, after
							which we immediately came home— It was then again broad-day-light, and
							by the time I got to bed, almost Sun-rise. At midnight it scarcely could
							be called dark. The Emperor was <pb n="110" type="ms"/>gracious to every
							body, even beyond his usual custom, which is remarkable for affability—
							He asked M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris to shew him where <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Adams</persRef> sat, and danced a Polonaise with her; and afterwards
							one with <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine
								Johnson</persRef>, a Circumstance the more noticed, as she has not
							been presented at Court— He enquired of me whether I had taken a walk
							this day, and on my answering that I had, he observed that he had not
							met me— He said that the difference of my looks in the Street, without a
							wig, from that in which he had usually seen me, had been the cause that
							the first time he had met me he did not recognize me— He told me the
							occasion upon which he had commenced the practice of walking daily— It
							was recommended to him to strengthen his foot, which had received a hurt
							last Summer, by the oversetting of his droshky.— And although he
							preferr’d riding on horse-back, he believed walking was the healthiest
							of all exercise. The <persRef ref="williamfrederickphilip">Prince of
								Wirtemberg</persRef>, the brother of the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef> entered also into
							conversation with me, though I had never been presented to him— The
							Rooms were excessively warm, and a very small part of the company took
							real pleasure in the fête.— I heard the Ambassador himself say to some
							one, that he gave this Ball, because he was obliged to do it— It gave
							him no pleasure— I spoke to Count Bussche, about his illumination— Ay!
							said he— I promise you, I am well paid for <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
							illumination— I asked General Pardo, if as a good Catholic, he did not
							expect to have some atonement to make hereafter for the vain and
							excessive enjoyments of this Night— Nay, said he— But I hope what I
							experience this Night, will expiate some of my Sins— Count S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien, told me of a speech made by the old
								<persRef ref="charlesjoseph">Prince de Ligne</persRef> upon this
							marriage, not fit to be repeated— I had some conversation at supper,
							with a nobleman whose name I have not yet learnt, upon the Russian and
							Slavonian languages.</p>

								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher’s</persRef> Lecture; which
							was upon Wrecks of the Sea &amp; Strays— But it was very short— The time
							was principally occupied in the reading and commenting upon the procés
							verbal of the last Lecture— And in some reflections upon the questions
							which Monsieur le Conseiller d’Etat had received in an anonymous letter,
							from a very learned, polite and modest person, of which he should take
							more notice hereafter— There was more agitation of the question
							regarding the Neapolitan judgment upon the transported house. A
							gentleman had enquired how it would be, if a whole City should be thus
							transported— A very perplexing question to Monsieur le Professeur, who
							could only suggest that the principle <hi rend="italic">of lésion
								d’outre moitié</hi>, by which according to the civil law, a man may
							redeem on equitable terms whatever he has sold for less than half its
							worth, might rescue the City, from the possession of its new proprietor—
							The lecture closed about half past eight— We amused the remainder of the
							Evening with Cards, &amp; Chess— <persRef ref="schladen-friedrich">Baron
								Schladen</persRef>, the Prussian Minister called upon me this
							morning— I had told him last Evening, that I wished to have a little
							conversation with him, and would call some morning at his house. I read
							to him the passage from <persRef ref="pitcairn-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Pitcairn’s</persRef> letter, upon which I had desired
							to see him— The object is to endeavour to obtain a remission of part of
							the duties in the Ports of Prussia, upon articles imported, which are to
							be sent into the dominions of other Sovereigns— They make the transit
							duty, equal to that upon consumption— The Baron said that he would write
							to the <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">Minister of Finance</persRef> upon
							the subject, and give him an account of our conversation; but he said
							that the necessity of raising by any means whatsoever money, to pay the
							arrears of contributions <pb n="111" type="ms"/>to the French, was such,
							that the diminution of duties was the most improbable thing in the world
							to be obtained— Every distant or secondary consideration must be
							forgotten or sacrificed to that— The duties and taxes in every shape,
							and upon every Class of the People, were oppressive beyond all
							conception— They had among others an income tax of <hi rend="italic"
								>eight</hi> per Cent upon every individual in the kingdom, which
							might be repeated three times in a year— In short such was the
							desperation of their Affairs, that any reasoning upon probable or
							contingent benefits, at any future period could scarcely be expected to
							obtain a hearing— I urged it to him as an argument of direct and
							immediate interest; on the ground that a moderate transit duty, would
							produce more revenue, than one which should nearly amount to a
							prohibition— He appeared readily to accede to this opinion, but not to
							entertain the Expectation that it would be adopted by his
							Government.</p>

						<p><date>27. </date>I have been troubled with a severe cold and cough, ever

							It waked me this morning, when I had been scarcely four hours in bed— I
							rose and found the Sun, about an hour above the horizon; but it was
							little after 4. O’Clock— On trying a short nap, further, I found it on
							waking again, nearly ten— We rise late of course, and I find the
							mornings very short— I walk’d only to the Winter Palace, and saw the
							river full of the ice, floating down from the Lake Ladoga— I dined with
								<persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk</persRef>, and arriving
							late, found his company at dinner when I arrived— Had a game of Chess
							with him after dinner— He had received a Courier from Stockholm this
							morning, and expects the frigate which is to carry him home, in a
							fortnight at Cronstadt; orders having been already expedited to
							Carlscrona, for her, to sail— His successor, he told me was not yet
							appointed. It would probably be <persRef ref="skjoldebrand-anders"
								>General Skiöldebrand</persRef>, but whether he would accept the
							appointment was uncertain. He had written to him (Count Stedingk) to
							enquire what he ought to insist upon as a Salary, if he should come—to
							which the answer would be, the advice not to come at a Salary under
							twenty thousand rix dollars banco—at two Rix dollars to a ducat— Upon
							this at the present favourable course of exchange, he could live
							decently; and not upon less— But whether the Government would give so
							much was questionable—and on other terms the General would probably not
							come. I asked him what his own Salary as Ambassador had been— He said it
							was thirty thousand Rix dollars, besides a Pension of three thousand,
							which he received in his military capacity— He still now received the
