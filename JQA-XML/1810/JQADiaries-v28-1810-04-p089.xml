							therefore doubts whether any English or French translation of the work
							will appear. The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, pays
							entirely for the plates of the Russian Work; which have cost him 100,000
							Roubles— But the mere paper upon which they are struck off, has risen so
							much in price, that they cannot afford to give it good; and use mean
							paper which is another disgrace to the work— The Russian Edition is of
							1000 Copies; of which not a hundred will ever be read; and the German
							Edition so small, that there are no copies left for new Subscribers—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Telisius gave me; for he would not allow me
							to pay for it, his own copy of the first volume; and has taken my name
							down as a subscriber for the remaining volumes— The Dissertation upon

							Krusenstern is here on a visit— He commands the Blagodat, the largest
							ship in the Russian Navy; and perhaps in the world— He has been many
							years in England; and two or three in America— After these visits,
							walking on the Quay, I met <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General

						<p><date>7. </date>At ten this morning I called at the Office of <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Grootten</persRef>, who accompanied
							me to the Alexandrofsk Manufactory of which he is the superintendant— A
							manufactory for spinning Cotton yarn; under the patronage of the
								<persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress-mother</persRef>— The
							buildings are about 7 wersts or 5 miles from the City, on the banks of
							the Neva, beyond the monastery of <persRef ref="nevsky-alexander">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Alexander Newsky</persRef>. The establishment
							is under the direction of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Wilson</persRef>, an Englishman— There are four or five hundred
							carding, spinning, and winding machines, which are kept at work, by
							three Steam Engines, variously constructed, according to the recent
							improvements upon that great mechanical invention— There is also
							connected with the establishment a manufactory of Cotton Stockings;
							where they also wove silk Stockings, while the silk was to be procured—
							The needles—Cards—and much of the machinery are made within the
							manufactory— The labour is executed by about five hundred foundling
							children, nearly an equal number of both sexes; and most of whom are
							taken at the age of eight, nine, or ten years from the foundling
							Hospitals of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg and of Moscow— They
							remain here, the boys untill 21. and the girls untill 25 years of age,
							unless sooner married— They then have liberty to quit the establishment
							or to remain connected with it at their option. They have apartments
							accommodated for the married couples, of which there are now about
							twenty-five; and they are increasing— The institution having existed not
							more than twelve years, it has only been within four or five that the
							marriages began to take place— Of the earliest, almost all the children
							died, and even now a small proportion of those that are born are likely
							to live— This mortality is attributed to the ignorance of the Parents—
							But the confinement of the chambers allowed to the families—their
							extreme poverty— The want of cleanliness, and the almost pestilential
							air which I found in them sufficiently accounted in my mind for the
							fact.— In two of the family apartments I saw Russian Cradles; which are
							a sort of hammock suspended by four small cords from the end of an
							elastic pole, fastened by the other end near the head of the bed— It
							hangs about four feet from the floor, and the mother can reach her hand
							to the pole to rock the cradle, from her bed; by bending the pole at
							pleasure. It is a very clumsy contrivance, and the child must be always
							in danger of falling to the floor— An accident which four times in five
							must prove fatal— The working foundlings themselves look for the most
							part wretchedly, and very unwholsome— Of two hundred and forty girls,
							from ten to twenty-five years of age, I scarcely saw one that could be
							called handsome; and very few, not positively ugly. When we arrived they
							were just going to dinner— The girls in a long room with tables on the
							two sides and a passage-way between them— The girls were all standing
							between the bench and the table; with their faces towards the little
							image of the virgin hanging at the wall, at the other end of the Hall,
							and chanting Grace before meat— At that furthest end the floor of the
							room was raised a step higher and a separate small table was placed at
							which about twenty of the girls took their seats— Their fare was the
							same as at the other tables— But to be seated there is an honorary
							distinction, for particular industry and good conduct.— The dining hall
							of the boys is of the same form and dimensions a story higher— But there
							were not more than nine or ten, at their table of distinction— The
							plates and dishes of the girls were of wood; those of the boys of
							pewter— Their dinner was a thin turnip soup, and a dish of boiled
							buckwheat, of the consistency of hasty-pudding, <pb n="91" type="ms"
							/>Their bread rye, and their drink Quas— They are served at table by
							invalids belonging to the establishment, and who have no other duty—
							They have school-rooms where at certain hours of leisure and on Sunday
							mornings they are taught to read, write, and cypher.— They attend public
							worship at a Church in the neighbourhood the priest of which gives them
							also occasional religious instruction at the buildings of the
							institution— The girls all sleep in one long bed-chamber, where there
							are four rows of beds the whole length of the room, and in several
							recesses three or four rows more— Its appearance was neat—the bedding
							all clean—but the air was not good— That of the boys bed-chambers which
							were in two or three Stages, of a large square hall, with inside
							staircases to the second &amp; third stage, was much worse—almost
							insupportable— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wilson told us it had not been
							ventilated the whole Winter— By the regulations they must all be in bed
							before 10 at Night, and rise by 6. in the morning— Their task of work is
							twelve hours a day, and for any extra work which they choose to do, they
							are paid— The girls and boys are kept very carefully separate, and
							although marriages between them are encouraged, yet M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Grootten says not a single <hi rend="italic">accident</hi>
							has yet happened— Is this owing to Constitutional coldness?—to the
							continence of hard labour and penurious subsistence, or to the
							perfection of subserviency secured by their mode of breeding and
							education?— Perhaps to all the causes combined with the severity of the
							climate, and the rigour of the regulations— The machinery has been very
							expensive— And before the introduction of the Steam-engines, which is
							only within four or five years, it was kept at work also with great
							expence— French and German projectors, devised a number of water-wheels,
							which after the waste of much time and money were found utterly useless—
							Then came a M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gascoigne, an Englishman, of great
							mechanical genius, the inventor of the sort of great guns now called
							Carronades, but which from him were in the first instance called
							Gasconades— Some unsuccessful speculative inventions had impaired his
							fortune in England and he had come to Russia where he was employed at
							the head of a manufactory of iron, some 150 or 200 Wersts from S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, when the Direction of this
							Institution was also put into his hands— He introduced horse-mills to
							work the machines; a great improvement upon the former processes, but
							which still left the establishment so expensive that they could not vie
							with the cheapness of the English manufactures— <persRef
								ref="gascoigne-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gascoigne</persRef>,
							had one third of the profits from the sales, and accumulated a great
							fortune, of which he died possessed a few years since— He had introduced
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wilson as his assistant in the direction,
							and since his death M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wilson has his place; but
							without his emoluments— He has introduced the Steam engines, which have
							much reduced the expence of the works, and since the War with England,
							followed by the prohibition of English Goods, this manufacture is in a
							flourishing condition— But M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wilson has no pay—
							Nothing but occasional presents, leaving him in a state of anxiety and
							suspense, with regard to his future prospects—and the order of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Wolodimir which he received last year from the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, as a mark of his
							favour.— There are twelve different kinds of machines used in the
							process of carding and spinning the yarn— But three or four of them are
							employed in effecting a modification of the Cotton which might be
							accomplished by one, and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wilson has invented a
							machine for that purpose, which is now just beginning to work— There is
							also much of the labour still done by the hand which might be done by
							machinery; particularly the wiring of the leather, for the carding
							machines— I mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wilson the American
							invention for this purpose, of which he told me that he had heard
							before— They have also here various small machines for making up the
							yarn into packages, for sending away— The Reels wind off seven threads
							of a given length which are fastened together, &amp; form the first
							combination of the prepared article—a number of these gatherings
							according to the fineness of the yarn forms a skain— The skain is
							weighed, and according to the number of skains to a pound is numbered
							from twelve to twenty— The skains of the same numbers are weighed in
							parcels of ten pounds, and from the scales are put into a hollow squared
							steel press, in which they <pb n="92" type="ms"/>are screwed down into
							as small a compass, as the hand of the workman can press them—then they
							are taken out in a cube apparent solid, and made into packages of brown
							paper tied up with twine— These are deposited upon shelves in the place
							where they are made up, for ten days together— After which the ten days
							work is all removed at a time to the warehouse of the manufactory; ready
							to be taken away by the traders from Moscow and other parts of the
							Country, who purchase it by whole sale, and take it here at the
							manufactory— Very little of it is taken at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg— Besides the Cotton they also spin some coarse thread from
							flax— A material to which M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Grootten wishes that
							the whole manufactory were confined; because the flax is the produce of
							the Country itself.— After spending about four hours in going over the
							different parts of this Establishment, I returned with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Grootten to the City, and left him at his house— I dined
							with the <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron de Blome</persRef>, and a
							company of about twenty—foreign Ministers—the <persRef
								ref="naryshkin-alexander;naryshkin-dimitri">two
								Narischkin’s</persRef>, the Grand Veneur, and the Grand Maître des

								d’Alopeus</persRef>—<persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi

							and requested his aid to procure all the Volumes of the Transactions of
							the Academy of Sciences at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, necessary

							promised me to mention it at the Conference of the Academy, and give me

								<persRef ref="pallas-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Pallas</persRef>, who is in Crimea— He still complains of the neglect of

								<persRef ref="schubert-friedrich">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Schubert</persRef>, there are no learned Academicians— Pallas is

								ref="alexanderthegreat">Alexander the great</persRef>— The rest are
							all Russians—that is, nothing— The academy is daily declining, and
							supports itself now principally by printing books for individual
							authors. He shewed me also a press, which he has had made for colouring
							prints— It is precisely upon the principle of <persRef ref="watt-james">Watt’s</persRef> copying press; only
							larger— He shewed me also a number of coloured prints for Gmelin’s
							Historia Fucorum, which he has taken upon vellum paper, to send to
								<persRef ref="barton-benjamin2">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Barton</persRef>— But he says they cost five Rubles a print— He had

							on Russian paper and uncoloured. D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Barton
							complained of the badness of their execution; and he sends him these to
							shew him what can be done— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Telisius was the
							editor of the German Edition of Pallas’s Voyages. I enquired of him for
							Pallas’s work on the various dialects of the Russian Empire; but he said
							if it was to be procured it would only be by advertising for it in the

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adelung</persRef>.— I found with M<hi rend="superscript"

								Gauler</persRef> the engraver; whose pupils are employed in

							walked round the quay and the Fontanka, home— At seven in the Evening we
							attended the first Lecture of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Boucher</persRef>, upon maritime and commercial Law— He was about
							three quarters of an hour reading it. His audience consisted principally

							Commerce— <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="kotschubey-victor">Count Kotschubey</persRef> were
							both there— The Lectures are to be on Monday and Thursday Evenings at 7.
							O’Clock— The introductory lecture was panegyrical upon the Emperor
							Alexander, and said much of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher himself—
							Count Romanzoff it seems had insisted upon the suppression of an
							Eulogium upon him which it had contained— With this there was an
							Oratorical amplification of the merits of Commerce, and a rapid sketch
							of the antient history of Commerce— Noticing the Rhodian Laws—the
							Consolato del Mare—The Judgments of Oleron and Wisbuy—and the Ordinance
							of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Lewis 14</persRef>— The Lecture finished
							soon after 8— Cards and Chess amused the remainder of the Evening.</p>

						<p><date>15. </date>I attended this morning the service of the Greek
							ceremonial in the Church of <persRef ref="stisaac">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Isaac</persRef>— In some respects it differed from
							those that I have witnessed heretofore— There were only two officiating
							Priests— The choir of singers at the left hand of the Chancel was small,
							but the singing as usual excellent— There was one ceremony, which I
							could not ascertain whether the administration of the Communion, or of
							baptism. There were two vessels, as if containing, one the bread and the
							other the wine—the former borne by the inferior priest upon his head—the
							other; a cup carried in the hand by the other priest, raised to the
							level of his eyes— The cup only was administered, and that only to the
							infants of a number of women, who held them in their arms—on the whole I
							concluded it was baptism— The subordinate priest read, nearly
							half-an-hour from a book—but whether it was a homily or chapters from
							the Bible I could not ascertain— After the service was over that which I
							took to be baptism was repeated to two women with infants who were not
							there in time for the first— They stood about the centre of the
							church—the inferior priest read to them from the book for some time—
							They then went up to the balustrade. The inferior Priest there took
							their children, successively from the mothers, carried them to the
							Superior in the Sanctuary, and a moment after returned, and gave them
							back— The mothers appeared delighted to have obtained the blessings— The
							multitude of self-crossings—the profound and constantly repeated bows,
							the prostrations upon the earth &amp; kissing of the floor witnessed the
							depth of Superstition, in which this people is plunged perhaps more
							forcibly than I had seen before. The isle of the Church where alone the
							service can be heard was crowded, but there appeared to be only people
							in the lowest classes of Society, moozhiks and common Soldiers there— A
							collection for charity was made during the service, and beggar-boys and
							girls were going about and asking alms, frequently during the
							performance— I saw one little girl, obtain several single copeeks,
							principally from the soldiers. The collection was received on tin
							Canisters with <pb n="95" type="ms"/>narrow holes on the lids, to let in
							the money— But there were several copeek and two copeek pieces on the
							lid itself, and some of those who put on it two copeek pieces, took
							single copeeks from it in exchange— In the centre of this Church, which
							is built in the regular shape of a Cross, the trophies lately atchieved
							from the Enemies of Russia are suspended. They are not numerous— I saw
							one English flag there; but I know not where it was taken— The Pictures,
							as in their other Churches, are some good, and some very bad— I suppose
							those the worst executed are the most esteemed for sanctity. I walked

								Six</persRef> paid me a visit this morning, and we had a long
							conversation upon political subjects. He is the exact counterpart of
								<persRef ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>— The <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> is his idol— He
							once told me he was afraid, Napoleon before he died would take upon him
							to demand the adoration of mankind, as being something superhuman— This
							idea, he said, was entertained by the whole family of the Bonaparte’s,
							and as strongly by his own <persRef ref="bonaparte-louis">king
								Louis</persRef>, as by any of them— I do not know whether Napoleon
							will ever assume the God, or not; but if he should M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Six would be one of the most devout, of his Priests— His
							subjugation of Soul is complete— But he is a man of great political
							information; of long experience; of better principles than most
							Statesmen, of this or any other day; of good intentions—of good
							disposition—anxiously desirous of the esteem of others, and especially
							of those whose judgment he fears— Conscious of compliances with the
							Times, which stubborn Virtue cannot approve his mind is in a frequent if
							not continual struggle to justify himself to his own feelings— The
							worship of Napoleon is thus in some sort necessary to his quiet— It
							helps him to apologies of which he feels the want— When his chain galls
							him he looks at it, and takes comfort in the thought that it is gold—
							Pardo, bites at his with the fury of a phrenetic, but without having the
							strength to break it— Six’s information is usually more accurate than
							that of the General— He is not so much blinded by his Passions— He loves
							to tell <hi rend="italic">Secrets</hi>, and often communicates with
							injunctions of profound secrecy, the common rumours of the Exchange.—
							The day I dined with him last week, he told me that the Rotterdam
							Gazette that day arrived had brought accounts of a french officer having
							landed in England, who was said to be the bearer of propositions for a
							pacific negotiation— That by a private letter he was informed, that this
							Officer was <persRef ref="durac-geraud">Marshall Duroc</persRef>— This
							however he begged me not to mention, as he had communicated it to no
							other person but the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>Ambassador</persRef> and myself— The next morning <persRef
								ref="smith-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. S. Smith</persRef>
							asked me, if I had heard the report current upon the Exchange two days
							before that Duroc had landed in England, upon an errand of Peace— The
							Hamburg news-paper on Saturday brought the report and its refutation.
							This day M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six observed to me that it appeared
							Duroc was not the man; though he had been announced in the Morning
							Chronicle.— His visit was so long that I had time only for a short walk—
							Dined at <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome’s</persRef>, and saw
							many of his maps, of which he has a fine collection— <persRef
								ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal</persRef> had
							called upon me this morning to remind me, that <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher’s</persRef> second lecture would be
							at 7. this Evening.— It was a quarter past seven before we got there,
							and he had begun about ten minutes before— His subject was relative to
							bills of exchange— He traced the etymology, and explained the meaning of
							the word <hi rend="italic">aval</hi>, which is used at the bottom of
							french bills, and he insisted much upon the necessity of fixing with the
							most accurate precision the meaning of all terms of art.— His Lecture
							was not written; but he held in his hand a small paper containing
							apparently minutes of the points upon which he touched— He was less than
							half an hour, and observed that this and perhaps three or four of the
							next Lectures would not be very interesting— But after that he should
								<pb n="96" type="ms"/>enter upon topics of importance— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef> spent
							part of the Evening with us— I engaged him to endeavour to get some
							further information concerning the recent English negotiation here, and
							the state of affairs between Russia, &amp; France, which is peculiarly
							interesting to us.</p>

								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Fringan found so much difficulty in reading
							the manuscript, that the Professor, put off the lecture untill a fair
							copy of it <pb n="97" type="ms"/>should be made out— He announced a
							Séance extraordinaire, for Saturday Evening at 7. O’Clock, when he
							should state a question upon commercial Law, to be discussed in writing
							by the pupils attendant upon his Lectures. He also announced, that many
							persons having requested to see his introductory discourse, all of whom
							he had been obliged to refuse, he had determined to open a subscription
							for printing it— The cost would only be one or two roubles for each
							subscriber, and the Discourse would be very useful in the future
							attendance upon the course— This new mode of lecturing, is not agreeable
							to the hearer— It is much too desultory; and naturally leads to tedious
							repetitions— The Comment upon one paragraph consisting very frequently

							with twelve scenes, I suppose from the legend of his life, painted in

							even open— And the Roman Catholic church service was finished just as I
							went to go in— I met a crowd of people coming from it; many of them with
							palm branches in their hands— The branches were all budded, and almost

							commemorate the purification of the Virgin Mary— This it seems among the
							Roman Catholics is one of the Holy Mysteries; and this Sermon explains
							how it is mysterious— The example of the Virgin is repeatedly urged as
							an argument for submission to the divine Will, but the assignment of her
							motives, which should operate alike upon others is admirable— I place it
							among the best of the Bishop’s discourses.</p>

							hours was performed, partly without the Church round which the Priests
							went three times successively in procession, and partly within it, where
							was a representation of the Sepulchre from which the Saviour arose— The
							crowd of People attending was excessive— At Midnight, the signal was
							given by the firing of a Cannon at the fortress; which was soon after
							followed by several others; and at two or three subsequent periods of
							the night a salvo of twenty-five or thirty guns was fired— The midnight
							service is performed at all the Churches, and the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> and Imperial family attend at
							their Chapel— Among the customs of the Country is that of embracing one
							another at this period, and all the people who attend at the Court
							Chapel are admitted to kiss the Emperor’s sleeve, and the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress’s</persRef> hand— It is also the
							custom to make presents upon this day, and particularly of eggs— The
							muzhik’s present real eggs, hard-boiled and died red with log-wood; for
							which they receive roubles— Persons of higher standing present eggs of
							sugar, glass, gilt-wood porcellain, marble, and almost every other
							substance, and of various dimensions. Many of them made into cups, or
							boxes, filled with sugar-plums— Others with paintings and biscuit
							figures upon them, emblematical of the crucifixion and resurrection—
							Some of these eggs are made to cost a hundred roubles or upwards—
							Servants present these eggs to their Masters and receive presents in
							return as at the new year— Friends present them to one another and
							embrace— It is a mode of gallantry, allowable towards Ladies, by
							Gentlemen of their intimate acquaintance; and in return for an egg, the
							Gentleman is entitled to <hi rend="strikethrough">the return of</hi> a
							salutation— The parade was this morning more splendid than usual; and of
							longer continuance. I went to the Roman Catholic Church and heard Mass
							performed. There appeared during the day time to be no service at the
							Greek Churches— The Streets all day were crowded with People— New
							dresses—equipages—liveries were driving round the City, and met at every
							turn— The whole circle of Court visits by cards must be paid, as on
							new-year’s day; and the visits in person are more numerous than at that
							time— I paid four or five visits in person, leaving Cards.— The Court
							attendants came to pay and receive their Compliments as usual— I met
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef>, and walked with him on the Square of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Isaac and the line— On the Square are a number of
							Fair shows, under temporary shelters erected for the occasion, and the
							common people were amusing themselves in whirligig Chairs, and Swings—
							There are four Chairs to a wheel, which contain two persons each, and
							move round in a perpendicularly circular motion— But it is very slow,
							and kept up only by a muzhik pushing forward each of the chairs as it
							descends— The Swings are a plank suspended by four cords fixed at its
							ends, from a gallows standing over it; on the plank are two Seats for
							two persons each— At each end of the plank a man, or woman standing, and
							holding by the cords which pass from the plank to the cross piece of the
							gallows, keep the swing in motion by the exertion of their muscles, and
							by changing the centre of gravity at the moment when the swing reaches
							its highest elevation on each side— This they do, by simply bending
							their knees, and thus shortening their own length— And I saw at least as
							many swings thus kept in motion by women, as by men.— The Mass at the
							Catholic Church was remarkable only as it was long— The music was
							exquisite— The Sermon, in Italian, had been preached before the Mass—

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> I rise irregularly, between 5 and 10 in the
							Morning; and scarcely any two days successively at the same hour— Read
							or write untill breakfast time, which is about ten— From that time,
							untill 3. in the afternoon, I write when I can— But visits to receive or
							pay interrupt and often entirely prevent this employment— From 3 to 5. I
							appropriate to my daily walk; but that is also very often abridged or
							prevented by the same causes— At 5. we dine— From 6 to 8 or 9. I read,
							as much as similar interruptions will admit— From nine untill bed-time,
							we play cards or chess occasionally— From eleven to one in the Morning
							is the hour at which we retire— Some times half an hour earlier than
							eleven, and sometimes as much after one— It is now not dark untill ten
							at Night.</p>
