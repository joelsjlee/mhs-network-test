							I do not think it prudent to ask, and if obtained might rather be useful
							to private speculation than of general service to the general commercial
							interest— As M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris intends to pass the

							me that the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had ordered the

							immediately wrote a Note to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris,
							desiring him to send the papers to Archangel by express; and promising
							to send them to him as soon as I should receive them— Between 11. and
							12. at Night Baron Campenhausen’s Messenger returned, with a second note

								ref="bussche-calmor">Count Bussche’s</persRef>; but he was so unwell
							that he received no Company— The French Ambassador’s House is just at

							Paces to a minute; and a Werst is 1360 of my paces and takes me 11

							minutes, and 2050 of my paces. Although there can be no exact precision
							in this mode of measurement it is far more accurate than that of any

							between the <pb n="149" type="ms"/>second and third Werst-Stones is
							about one hundred yards too great, and those between the first and
							second and the third and fourth, each about 50 yards too short— The
							Werst-Stones are pyramidical Stones erected on a Square pedestal about
							ten feet high. The first Stone is in the City, about half a Werst within
							the Gate— This is the point of departure, and there is a Sun–dial on the
							North and South-sides of the Pedestal— There is a similar set of
							Werst-Stones on the Moscow road. The distance to Czarsko Zelo and Moscow
							is Marked on these; as that to Peterhoff is on the others— After dinner
							I walked nearly to the Foundery, and in the Evening took a Russian
							vapour bath, at a bathing house near or on the Fontanka.</p>

								Smith</persRef> brought me several letters of heavy complaints from
							Archangel— Of Americans detained there— I dined at the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador’s</persRef>, with a
							great company of about sixty Ministers, Generals and Senators— I
							mentioned to the Minister of Police, <persRef ref="balashov-alexander"

							the <persRef ref="nelson">black man’s</persRef> wife sent out to him in

								>Emperor</persRef> he thanked me— He said the man had already

							taken him into the Emperor’s service— But that he had refused to take
							him unless it was my wish— The Count has indeed been very polite; but
							Nelson says that he first sent for him to enquire whether he did not
							wish to serve the Emperor.— The <persRef ref="detraversay-ivan">Marquis
								de Traversey</persRef> told me he was sorry that the arrangement for
								<persRef ref="jewett-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jewett</persRef> to enter the naval Service could not take place—
							That he would not take the Commission of a Lieutenant, and as <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris’s</persRef> Certificate had only been that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jewett had commanded a Ship of 22 guns,
							the Emperor had remarked that it was only a Corvette, and not a
							frigate.— I spoke to <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gourieff</persRef>, the Minister of
							Finance; to whose department a great portion of the Affairs of Commerce
							have been transferr’d— I asked him if he had spent any time this Summer
							in the Country— He said no—that he was so much engaged in business that
							he had found it impossible to leave the City. I said that the Affairs of
							his Department must naturally engross all his time; particularly as I
							learnt there had been a great addition to them in the commercial
							business— He said that so far as commercial affairs related to the
							Finances, they were by the new arrangement placed under his direction—
							But the general management of commercial matters was entrusted to the
							Treasurer General of the Empire, <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar"
								>Baron Campenhausen</persRef>— I observed that as the Commercial
							Department was that upon which all the important concerns of my
							Countrymen depended, and as it was now under his Superintendence, I
							begged leave to recommend them to his protection and attention— That
							they were of great importance to my Country, and of course to me— And
							that I considered them of considerable consequence to the interests of
							this Empire, and especially to its finances— He said he so considered
							them himself, and that as far as depended personally upon him I might
							rely upon every thing that he could go to give facilities to our
							Commerce— I said that for some time past, great obstructions and
							difficulties had arisen to the admission of American vessels here,
							especially at the Port of Archangel; that I had presented a Note some
							time since to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef>, relative to some of the cases, and had made
							verbal representations upon some others— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris had also made various applications— That it gave me infinite
							pleasure that the Emperor, in every one of the cases had decided in our
							favour, and I was obliged to Baron Campenhausen for immediately
							communicating to me these decisions— But unhappily I found new
							complaints were still arising, as the old <pb n="150" type="ms"/>ones
							were done away— That I had just seen several letters from Americans at
							Archangel, from which it would seem that their property had all been put
							under Seals, and that they were in the greatest alarm and consternation—
							Apprehending nothing less than a general confiscation— He smiled, and
							said that during the interval, or as it might be called, interregnum,
							while the business was transferring from one department to the other,
							some strange things had indeed occurr’d— But he hoped that now things
							would go on in better order— And besides said he, the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> has given us a
							very good example, by his late transactions with regard to the United
							States—which I think we ought to follow— This was the key— And just then
							dinner was announced, and terminated our conversation. I sat at table
							between <persRef ref="schladen-friedrich">Baron Schladen</persRef>, the
							Prussian Minister, and the French Consul, <persRef ref="lesseps-jean"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lesseps</persRef>, with both of
							whom I had much conversation— I told Baron Schladen, how sincerely I had
							been affected at the news of the <persRef ref="louiseauguste">Queen of
								Prussia’s</persRef> death.— He expressed himself gratified at this
							notice of her, and said it was a consolation to find that she was not
							only generally lamented, but regretted even by those who had been her
							enemies while she lived— He afterwards asked me some questions about
							these new measures in France relating to America— I told him that they
							were opening their own doors, just at the same moment while they were
							shutting those of his Country against us— He said he hoped I considered
							that measure in its true light, as one which was assuredly not a result
							of the inclinations of his Government— I made him easy on that score by
							the fullest assurance, that I was fully satisfied whence it came, and
							harboured no resentment for it, against his <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">Sovereign</persRef>— He then told me
							that in consequence of the Conversation I had with him some months
							ago—v. p. 110. he had written to his Court, and mentioned that interview
							with me, adding a recommendation of the object, which I had appeared to
							wish— That he had received in regular time an answer to his despatch on
							that occasion, instructing him to come to a confidential explanation
							with me on the subject— That he was ordered to assure me that as far as
							the personal dispositions of the king and his Government went I might
							place the most perfect reliance upon it— And that every facility would
							be granted, which lay within their power— But then at the same time he
							said, he saw from the tenor of the remaining part of the dispatch, what
							sort of a turn affairs must take, and he had preferr’d to omit even the
							execution of his Instructions, rather than say things to me, which might
							have led me to form, and perhaps to communicate to my own Government
							expectations, which would be disappointed. The Baron’s intentions I
							believe were good, but I think I should not have been misled by his
							executing his instructions— Probably however he was not at liberty to
							explain the influence which was then pressing for our exclusion; and he
							could perhaps not have attempted to conceal it without a degree of
							dissimulation which a few days would expose, and at which he was
							reluctant— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lesseps’s conversation would
							not figure well upon paper— I asked the Grand Master of Ceremonies
								<persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander">Narishkin</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">Mons<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> de
								Maisonneuve</persRef> whether there would be a Court held to-morrow,
							as I had heard— They told me there would not, but that it was customary
							for foreign Ministers to attend at the ceremony of the Mass which is
							performed at the Monastery of <persRef ref="nevsky-alexander">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Alexander Nevsky</persRef>, at 11.
							O’Clock in the Morning; that places were given them; and that last year
							almost all the Ministers attended.— We dined by candle-light; for the
							first time this Season— In the Evening, after my return home, I received
							by an estafette, a couple of letters from Americans at Riga, who ask for
							my assistance to obtain admission for their vessels.</p>

								Nevsky</persRef>, a Prince of Novgorod who reigned about the year
							1250— And is also what they call the name day of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>— At 11. O’Clock I went with
								<persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								W. Smith</persRef> to the Monastery, where the crowd was great, and
							the concourse of the People from the Perspective to the Church, on both
							sides of the Street was excessive— When we got to the Church we found it
							difficult to ascertain a proper place to stand in— None of the other
							foreign Ministers was there excepting <persRef ref="schenck-hans">Count
								Schenk</persRef>, who came in sometime after me, and who was as much
							embarrassed as myself— He took a place among the Officers in attendance
							on the Imperial family, which he found was not the proper one, and
							returned to where I had taken mine— <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>, at length seeing me came to me, stood
							next to me during the whole Ceremony and explained to me many parts of
							the performances. The silver Shrine of the Saint is at the right hand of
							the Chancel, as you go up the broad aisle to the altar.— Before this
							Shrine was spread a large carpet, on which the Emperor took his stand;
							with the <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef> at his
							left hand— Next to her the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress
								Mother</persRef>, then the Grand Dukes <persRef ref="nicholas-i"
								>Nicholas</persRef> and <persRef ref="michael2">Michael</persRef>,
							and the <persRef ref="annapavlovna">Grand Duchess Ann</persRef> behind
							her mother— The Crown Officers and attendants were ranged in a line
							beyond <pb n="151" type="ms"/>the Emperor, up to the steps to the shrine
							of the Saint— <persRef ref="peter-friedrich">Prince George of
								Oldenburg</persRef>, husband of the <persRef ref="catherinepavlovna"
								>Grand Duchess Catherine</persRef>, the Prince of Wurtemberg,
							brother of the Empress Mother, and a number of Officers, and Strangers
							stood before the Chancel on the right side of the aisle, and a number of
							ladies, and crowd of women at the left— The ceremony was performed by
							the <persRef ref="podobedov-amvrosy">Archbishop</persRef>, and the other
							Priests who usually perform at the Imperial chapel, with the same quire
							of singers— But it was not a Te Deum; and differed in many respects from
							an ordinary Mass— Count Romanzoff told me that the two candlesticks,
							which the Archbishop occasionally takes in his hands; one with three
							lighted candles and the other with two, and which he waves downward
							crosswise, were symbolical of the Trinity, and of the double nature of
							Christ— <persRef ref="coxe-william">Coxe</persRef> I think mentions
							this— At a particular part of the Ceremony a sort of embroidered cloth
							was waved, or rather shaken over the Altar— The Count said it was during
							the Credo, and to express the uncertainty of the time, when the mystery
							of the descent of the holy Ghost commences— The Greek Church not having
							thought the precise moment ascertainable— After the Mass was finished,
							the Emperor went up to the Shrine of the Saint—knelt and kiss’d the
							silver coffin three times; twice at the side, and once on the top— The
							Empresses—Grand Dukes, and Grand-Duchess, all followed in turn, and
							repeated the same Adoration of the Saint— The Grand-Duchess Ann a
							beautiful princess of about 17 years of age performed her part at once,
							with the most complete prostration, the most grace and the most dignity—
							As the Empress-Mother descended the steps, the Emperor lent her his arm
							to assist her— There were then three small pictures in frames given to
							the Emperor and two Empresses, and small round loaves of bread to each
							of the members of the Imperial Family— On going out of the Church the
							crowd was so great that the passage out to my Carriage by the way at
							which we had entered was totally barr’d; I followed the crowd of the
							imperial Officers, through the only passage way that was open, supposing
							it led to another issue; untill I found myself unexpectedly in the
							Archbishop’s Apartments where the Emperor and his suite had been invited
							to a Breakfast— One of the Messengers of the <persRef
								ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">Grand Master of the Ceremonies</persRef>,
							gave me notice that the attendance of Strangers there was not usual, and
							I at length found the way out to my Carriage— The crowd of People in the
							Streets, continued as great on our return, as when we went— It was about
							3 O’Clock when we got home— In the Evening I went with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef>, and for the first time took <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> with us to the German Play—
							It was an Opera, by <persRef ref="kotzebue-august"
							>Kotzebue</persRef>—“Fanchon des Leyermäydchen.”— The Music by <persRef
								ref="himmel-friedrich">Himmel</persRef>—on the whole, indifferent,
							though it has two or three agreeable songs.— Charles was much astonished
							and delighted— After the Play I walked as far as the marble Palace on
							the Quay— The <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French
								Ambassador’s</persRef> House, was illuminated— Count Romanzoff’s
							Hotel and a number of other public buildings, also— At the Houses of all
							the foreign Ministers, and many others there was a shew of illumination;
							that is from a dozen to a hundred lamps with oil burning in front of
							each house, and sometimes half a dozen candles in the windows— I asked
							Count Romanzoff, at the Church, when he could see me again; and he
							appointed me Friday Morning at 11. O’Clock.</p>

						<p><date>12. </date>Long morning visits from <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal</persRef> and from <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris</persRef>. While he was here, the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef> also paid me a
							visit— I had been very desirous of some conversation with him, upon
							public affairs, but was now obliged a second time to postpone it. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal told me many circumstances
							respecting the capture of the <persRef ref="louisantoine">Duke
								d’Enghien</persRef>, which was done by a French Corps of troops
							under the command of M. de Caulaincourt— He was then Aid de Camp General
							of the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">First-Consul
								Bonaparte</persRef>— He was of a noble family of Picardy, and
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-gabriel">his father</persRef> had owed
							his fortune to the protection and patronage of the <persRef
								ref="louishenrijoseph">Prince de Condé</persRef>.— He received an
							order to go to Strasburg—there to assemble the Commander of the troops,
							stationed at that place, the <persRef ref="hermann-jean">Mayor</persRef>
							of the City, and two or three other officers—and in their presence to
							open a second sealed order which was delivered to him— On the
							performance of this duty he found it contained an order to take a column
							of troops which were placed at his disposal, to cross the Rhine, and
							enter upon the territory of the <persRef ref="charlesfrederick2">Grand
								Duke of Baden</persRef>; to seize the person of the Duke d’Enghien
							who resided there in the Country at a house of his own, and transport
							him to the prison of Vincennes, near Paris— He was very much distress’d
							at having such a Commission entrusted to him, but he executed it; and it
							was for that service that he was rewarded with his Duchy, his Embassy
							here, and other rewards and honours. The Duke d’Enghien was residing at
							that place with the knowledge and consent of Bonaparte— He used even
							occasionally to go to Strasburg to the <pb n="152" type="ms"/>Play, with
							the consent of Bonaparte, who had been asked whether he had any
							objection to it, and had made none— The Duke had notice of the approach
							of the French troops, and was advised to make his escape, as it was
							supposed they could have no other object than to take him; but he had
							refused, on the idea that it was impossible there could be any design to
							seize him.— He was carried to the Prison of Vincennes, and without any
							formality of process shot, at two O’Clock the next morning. The
							examination and interrogatories which were published the next morning in
							the Moniteur were sheer fabrications— No trial, and no interrogatory was
							had; and the persons whose names were signed to those seeming judicial
							documents never saw them untill they found them in the newspapers— The
							Duke was shot at two O’Clock in the morning, and buried in a ditch that
							surrounds the prison— There was another mysterious transaction of which
							the remembrance had been just renewed at Paris— About three years ago a
								<persRef ref="desegur-octave">Monsieur de Ségur</persRef>, son of
							him who is now <persRef ref="segur-louis">Grand Master of the
								ceremonies</persRef>, and who was sub-prefect of Soissons suddenly
							disappeared, and nobody knew what had become of him— A few days before
							he had said in a company where M. de Caulincourt was speaking of his
							having been present at the passage of several rivers “but Sir, you say
							nothing about <hi rend="italic">the passage of the Rhine</hi>[”]— It was
							rumoured that as a quarrel had ensued and violent words passed upon this
							speech Segur had been challenged, and assassinated in the Bois de
							Boulogne— But now, all of a sudden immediately after the disgrace of
								<persRef ref="fouche-joseph">Fouché</persRef> the Minister of
							Police, young Ségur has appeared again safe and unhurt— The conjecture
							is that Fouché had him seized and confined in some prison, and that by
							the change of parties at Paris he has obtained his liberation. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal promised me a copy of the
							official Notes between the French and Russian Governments on this affair
							of the Duke d’Enghien, and observed what a refinement of assumption it
							was to send Caulincourt here as Ambassador, after what had taken place—
							As Montréal went out, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris came in,
							and was a few minutes after followed by the French Ambassador, with whom
							I wished to have some conversation, and could but partly accomplish my
							object— I dined with a Company of about sixty persons at <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>—principally the
							same Company, and on the same occasion as the dinner of the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> at the French Ambassador’s— That is the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">birth</hi> name-day.— The <persRef
								ref="navarro-rodrigo">Chevalier Navarro</persRef> introduced me to
								<persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron Campenhausen</persRef>,
							the Treasurer-General of the Empire, whom I had not known before— I
							spoke to him of the vessels and cargoes of Americans in difficulty at
							Archangel— He professed to be very much concerned at these occurrences,
							and reprobated in the severest terms the conduct of the Commission for
							neutral Navigation there; which he told me he would entirely organize
							over anew— But these new organizations produce many more difficulties
							than they remove.— I also spoke to him respecting the vessels which have
							arrived at Riga, about which he desired me to write to him, so that he
							might state the case for the consideration of the Emperor. I spoke upon
							all these subjects also to <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">Monsieur de
								Gourieff</persRef> next to whom I sat at table— And I asked the
							French Ambassador, to have some further conversation with him, owing to
							the interruption which prevented me from having it so freely as I had
							wished this morning.— He asked me to come and dine with him on the
							Peterhoff road to-morrow— I also told <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron
								Blome</persRef> the Danish Minister that I wished to converse with
							him concerning the captures of the American vessels lately carried into
							Norway— He told me he would call upon me to-morrow or on Saturday—
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lohman</persRef>
							sent me some English Papers, and a note saying he would call on me
							to-morrow. I called in the Evening at M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

								18<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August— He goes to-morrow for
							Riga—returns shortly here and in November expects to go back to England.
								<persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef> also paid me a
							visit; and I urged to him the case of the American vessels taken into
							Norway; eight of which I knew to be Americans, which had sailed from
							Cronstadt, laden with Cargoes, all of property unquestionably American—
							I dwelt upon all the arguments which occurr’d to me, to shew the claim
							which they had upon the Danish Government to be discharged— He professed
							very good personal dispositions of his own, and asked me to write him a
							note on the subject; which he promised to transmit to his Government—
							About four O’Clock I went out to the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>French Ambassador’s</persRef> Country-House on the Peterhoff road,
							and dined with him— There were only his own family, <persRef
								ref="lesseps-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Lesseps</persRef>, and three or four Russian Officers there— Before
							dinner I express’d to him <pb n="153" type="ms"/>my surprize at the
							measures of France, towards the United States— The repeal of the Decrees
							of Berlin and Milan, removed the most important causes of our
							complaints, excepting the late seizures and sequestrations, which I
							understood were reserved for further negotiation— But at the same time
							here were orders to exclude us from the Ports of Prussia, of Holstein,
							and Mecklenburg—and other indications which seemed altogether
							incompatible, with the spirit of conciliation manifested by the other
							measure— He said the only way he could account for them was that they
							had been of prior date— But he said these were subjects upon which his
							Government said nothing to him— The only time they had spoken to him of
							our affairs, was, on what he had mentioned to me relative to <persRef
								ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef>, and on which he
							had requested me to write to my Government— I told him that I should
							certainly write to my Government, whatever I could think would have a
							tendency to reconcile the interests and policy of our two Countries—
							That he would be sensible that my situation in relation to General
							Armstrong, rendered me the last person, who in delicacy or propriety
							ought to be the medium of indefinite complaints against him to his own
							Government; but that if owing to any inconveniences of Communication
							arising from the state of things there, his Government thought proper to
							make any informal and inofficial observations, which they were desirous
							of transmitting to the United States, and would commit them to him, and
							he to me, I should take great pleasure in giving every aid in my power
							to every purpose calculated to restore harmony and good-understanding
							between the parties— A circumstance which might perhaps occur if General
							Armstrong should leave France, as I had heard was still his intention— I
							told him the French Government appeared to me still too much addicted to
							that repulsive policy, which the <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">Prince
								of Benevento</persRef> had justly assigned as the Cause; which under
							the former Monarchy, had occasioned the loss of almost all the influence
							in the United States that France had acquired during the War of the
							American Revolution— That the influence of France might be great if she
							pleased, but that as England by her conduct seemed determined to
							reconcile us with France, so France by her’s was rendering the same
							service to England— He told me that he would write the substance of my
							observations to his Government— That as to the complaint against General
							Armstrong; he did not understand it to be a thing which would injure his
							credit at home— But it was only said that he scarcely ever saw the
							Minister— That he never went to Court, and that whenever any thing was
							to be done, he was presenting testy Notes, which made written answers of
							the same sort indispensable, and which widened matters, when by verbal
							explanations they might be conciliated— So I now see the whole front of
							Armstrong’s Offence, is omitting to go to Court, and presenting Notes
							too full of truth and energy for the taste of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>— I had already
							mentioned to the Ambassador yesterday and repeated to him this day the
							Articles in the French Official Gazettes containing misrepresentations
							in matters of fact which produced injurious effects even here, to our
							Commerce—instancing particularly that the French Consuls in America had
							ceased to deliver Certificates of Origin— After dinner I walked home—and
							found letters from <persRef key="adams-abigail">my friends</persRef> at
							Quincy to the 12<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of July, brought by

							called on me, just as I was going to see <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, and at my
							request, again afterwards— He came for a Passport and is going first to
							Sweden, and then to England, or America— I went according to
							appointment, at 11. O’Clock to Count Romanzoff’s, and had some further
							Conversation with him— I told him that although the decision of the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, upon all the cases
							concerning which <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Harris</persRef> or myself had made representations was
							favourable, that I was continually receiving new, and more heavy
							complaints— That since the arrival of the revisor, who had been sent to
							adjust all the difficulties, they had been multiplied four-fold; and
							that in some instances there were now complaints of personal
							ill-treatment— The Count said he hoped that henceforth there would be no
							more occasion for any complaints, and read me a letter, which he had
							this morning received from <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron
								Campenhausen</persRef>, in answer to what he had written to him,
							immediately after my last conference with him— This letter contained in
							substance the same thing which Baron Campenhausen had assured me of, in
							his <pb n="154" type="ms"/>verbal message to me— That he had given the
							most precise and positive orders to the Commission of neutral Navigation
							at Archangel to expedite as soon as possible the business of the
							American vessels— That he regretted exceedingly the delays which had
							been occasioned by the neglect or misconduct of the Commission, and that
							he had thought it his duty severely to reprimand them for it. I then
							mentioned to the Count the case of the vessels which have arrived at
							Riga, after finding themselves excluded from the Ports of Prussia, and
							of Holstein; and which not having been originally destined to Russian
							Ports did not possess Certificates from the Russian Consuls, as in
							ordinary cases was required— He desired me to write him a note on this
							subject, which he would immediately recommend to the Minister of
							Commerce— He asked me whether I had heard a Report that the British
							fleet intended an attack upon Carlscrona, to take away the Swedish fleet
							that is there— I had; but I did not believe it— He said the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king of England</persRef>, had never acknowledged
							the present <persRef ref="charles-xiii">king of Sweden</persRef>, and
							now that a <persRef ref="charles-xivjohn">French General</persRef> was
							called as the successor to the throne, they would probably be still more
							exasperated in England against Sweden— I told him I understood that
							Carlscrona was too strongly fortified to be exposed to such an attack—
							The Danes he said were also apprehensive of an attack on Christiansand,
							and had lost some gun’boats at Bergen in Norway— I said it was
							impossible to feel much for them; they were inflicting all the injury
							they could upon our trade, and were obstructing particularly the trade
							with this Country—that of the 47 vessels they had lately taken into
							Christiansand, seventeen or eighteen were Americans; eight of them had
							sailed loaded from Cronstadt, and knew them to be of perfectly neutral
							property— The Count said that they treated them exactly in the same
							manner— And the only way in which he could account for it was to
							attribute it to want— They were so poor, and had now so scanty means of
							subsistance that they could not subsist without plunder— He asked me,
							what I thought would be the result of the late measures in France— I
							answered that as they were <hi rend="italic">conditional</hi>, to depend
							upon corresponding measures on the part of England, it was yet very
							doubtful to me, what the result would be. Although England had
							repeatedly promised to revoke her orders in Council if France would
							repeal these decrees, yet as the whole advantage of the system on both
							sides had accrued to her, I was apprehensive she would not keep her
							word— She would cling as long as possible to the continuance of the
							system— He asked me whether <persRef ref="armstrong-john">General
								Armstrong</persRef> was still at Paris; I said he was— He observed
							that while he himself was at Paris, General Armstrong once appeared at
							Court; which was much remarked, as it was said he was not in the habit
							of attending there at-all— That the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Emperor</persRef> then spoke to him— This was the Court of which
							the General gave an Account in his despatch, which I remember to have
							read while I was in the Senate of the United States— On leaving the

							too heavy charges against him in his accounts—and refusing to settle
							with him by arbitration. He says that Harris sets up the advantages
							which he derives from his Consular Office here for sale; to the highest
							bidder— First to the House of <persRef ref="blandowandco"
								>Blando</persRef> which failed—next to that of the Cramer’s, and now
							to that of Meyer and Brüxner— That he makes the Consular Agents whom he
							appoints in the out-ports pay him a part of their Commissions on
							consignments made to them, and has quarreled with <persRef
								ref="kusel-friedrich">Küsel</persRef>, his Agent at Archangel, for
							accounting with the Cramer’s for this business, and not immediately with
							him.— He thinks it, and with some reason a defect in our Consular
							system, that the Consul’s having no pay are obliged to resort to such
							expedients— But he is so much exasperated that there appears to be some
							exaggeration in his representations— He said that in 1808 and 1809. it
							was customary for American Masters of vessels arriving here to pay from
							three to twenty-four thousand Roubles to Harris to be divided between
							himself and <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">Secretary</persRef>; to obtain admission— That twelve
							thousand Roubles was the sum demanded of him, but that he finally got it
							reduced down to three thousand, which he actually paid— When I asked him
							whether he was certain the money was divided between the Consul and the
							Count’s Secretary, he said it was a thing which he could not prove. That
							the Consular Office, at that time was the Counting House of the
							Cramer’s— That he paid the three thousand Roubles, for which in the
							first instance twelve thousand were demanded of him— That it was
							understood to be for the Consul and the Count’s Secretary, and that to
							his knowledge twenty-four thousand Roubles were paid by the Captain of
							one American vessel— None then obtained admission without paying, and
							the sum was always as large, as the Master could be perswaded to give—
							He mentioned a number of other abuses, and read me a letter which he had

								>Alexander</persRef>, then Grand-Duke, and now Emperor; and by his

							quantity of sugars brought by American vessels, have been entered at the
							Custom-house of Archangel as raw sugars— They have been seized on the
							ground that they were really refined sugars, crushed to powder, and
							falsely entered as raw, to evade the higher duties of impost levied upon
							refined sugars— This was the business upon which <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Andrews</persRef> was deputed— They
							affirm that these are really raw Havannah sugars, which have in fact a
							strong resemblance to refined sugars and liable to be mistaken for them—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris on the arrival of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Andrews sent a Note to Baron Campenhausen
							to this effect and complaining in strong terms of the revisor, by whom
							the seizure was made— Samples of the sugars had been sent to Baron
							Campenhausen for his inspection, upon examination of which he pronounced
							them to be refined sugars reduced to powder; and he wrote to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris requesting him to come and inspect
							the sugars himself— Harris still persisted that they were raw sugars,
							and proposed to Baron Campenhausen to have the samples submitted to the
							inspection of two Merchants and a refiner; which the Baron has
							accordingly done— The two merchants were <persRef ref="severin-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> P. Severin</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="krehmer-benedict">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> B.

							pronounced the sugars to have been refined and then powdered— It has
							placed him in an aukward situation after the part that he has taken in
							the business; and I have narrowly escaped getting into one myself— As
							the case now stands its appearance is not favourable to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Andrews or his constituents— But Harris
							still insists that the decision concerning the sugars is erroneous and
							absurd— His principal reason however now is, the respectability of the

							to the last that he had sent him concerning the sugars seized at
							Archangel— This Note announced the <hi rend="italic">unanimous</hi>
							decision of the examiners, that the sugars were refined; charged the
							importers with an intention of paying duties far less than the real
							article would have paid; and vindicated the conduct of the Revisor, in
							terms of the highest approbation. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris
							was much embarrassed what to do and asked my advice— I advised him to
							reply by a full explanation of the difference between the Havannah and
							refined sugars; by a full exposure of the Circumstances tending to shew
							that these could not have been refined; and then to conclude by
							observing that after having done every thing in his power and
							conformably to his duty to protect the rights and interests of his
							Countrymen, he should as became him leave the subject to whatever
							decision this Government thought proper to make concerning it— He called
							again in the Evening, and told me that he had been with <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Andrews</persRef> to Baron
							Campenhausen, and had given him every possible explanation— Had assured
							him that these goods were imported in this state from the Havannah— That
							a large parcel of them had been sold at Archangel for 24. Roubles per
							Poud; while the price of refined sugars was at 60— That the duty levied
							upon refined sugars, if now required upon this, would be sufficient to
							produce to him a loss of fifty Cent upon his voyage—and that the rest
							was of the same kind— Harris says that Campenhausen appeared much
							surprized, at this explanation, and professed that he would do every
							thing possible to secure justice eventually to the importers. I pass’d
							the day at home and read <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon’s</persRef> Panegyric upon <persRef ref="stagnes">Saint
								Agnes</persRef>— The first in his volume of panegyrics— This Lady is

							died a martyr. Massillon says very little of her History— He speaks of
							her beauty; her chastity; her refusal of many high offers of marriage;
							and her suffering persecution and death, in general terms.— It seems
							there are panegyrics of this same Saint extant; by the most celebrated
							fathers.— I was reading this Evening the character of <persRef

							Empress Mother. Another is the <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna"
								>Empress Elizabeth’s</persRef> kitchen; for this Sovereign of the
							Empire prided herself upon her skill in Cookery, and was used to prepare
							dinners for select parties in this building— The kitchen is much upon
							the <persRef ref="thompson-benjamin">Rumford</persRef> plan— <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Catherine the second</persRef>
							<pb n="158" type="ms"/>who had other tastes besides those of Cookery,
							had in these buildings also a hermitage where a table for twelve persons
							descends and ascends by machinery so that it may be served, without the
							presence of any servants in the apartment with the Company— From this
							chamber there is a balcony in front, just before a large fish pond; full
							of carp. They come upon the summons of a Bell, rung by one of the
							Servants, and feed upon the crumbs of brown bread thrown to them upon
							the water— And there is a balcony in the rear, facing the gulph of
							Finland, and from which there is a full view of Cronstadt— But the
							principal curiosities of the place are the water-works; all of which
							were set to playing for us to see— There are a great variety of pipes
							and fountains; some in the form of gilded statues, others of Animals and
							fish— Some of Urns—some of rolling sheets and some even of plants and
							trees—the waters are carried to the top of some of the buildings, made
							to spout from the summit of their domes, and roll down, streaming from
							their roofs.— The meanest of all the contrivances is a fountain, with
							three leaden ducks pursued by a dog, which are movable, and made to
							imitate the barking of the dog and the quack of the ducks— The imitation
							besides its being ridiculous is very bad— We had taken a cold collation
							with us, and they lent us a room in one of the external buildings
							connected with the palace, where we took it— Once a year, in the summer
							Season the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> usually gives a
							great Ball at this place, to which the public in general are admitted—
							The gardens are all illuminated and the water-works all played by the
							light of the illuminations. On these occasions the Foreign Ministers are
							all accommodated with lodgings at these buildings— But this year the
							usual entertainment, from motives of economy has been omitted— We
							quitted Peterhoff at half past 5. O’Clock in the afternoon, and reached
							home precisely a quarter before eight— We stop’d about ten minutes at
							the Garden of the <persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander">Grand Chamberlain
								Narishkin</persRef>, to look at a white marble statue, representing
							the Rape of Proserpine, for which he is said to have given ten thousand
							roubles, and which is very well executed— There are on the road to
							Peterhoff a great number of Country seats, inhabited during Summer, by
							the nobility and the principal merchants— Strelna, the Summer-Residence
							of the <persRef ref="constantine3">Czarowitz Constantine</persRef> is of
							the number— And at the 15<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Werst there is

						<p><date>25. </date>Before Breakfast this morning I had a visit from a
							messenger of the <persRef ref="balashov-alexander">Minister of
								Police</persRef>, with two sailors who have been taken up at
							Cronstadt, and who give themselves out as Americans— But they have no
							protections and belong to no American vessel there— And upon examination
							I found that one of them was by his own story not an American Citizen,
							and the other though pretending to have been born at Long-Island, spoke
							English with the accent of a German— They pretended to have been taken
							by a British Frigate coming from Tonningen to Petersburg in the Brig
							Hawk from Boston, and after being kept three weeks to have been set on
							shore upon a Russian Island near Hoogland; from which they found their
							way in a Transport to Cronstadt. I sent the Gentlemen with them to
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

								Andrews</persRef> and <persRef ref="plumer-ernestus">M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Severin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="krehmer-benedict">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Cramer</persRef>, and the Sugar-refiner have pronounced to be
							refined sugars afterwards powdered— I afterwards called upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris, to speak on the subject with him—
							The two Sailors he says are English Seamen, who have made their escape
							from some British Man of War— As to the sugars he says <persRef
								ref="meyer-jc">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Meyer</persRef> has
							seen them, and pronounces them with the most undoubting certainty, white
							Havanna Sugars and not refined— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Treasury</persRef>; and consulted me
							again upon his answer to <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron

							at the Baron’s letter to him, I recommended again to him coolness, and
							the suppression of all resentment, at least untill the suspicions too

							removed— I then went to <persRef ref="colombi-antonio">M<hi

						<p><date>26. </date>Morning visits from <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal told me of some political
							intrigues in agitation; and brought me a couple of pamphlets containing
							information concerning the cultivation of hemp. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Harris says that there happened to be one member of the
							College of Commerce who understood something of the nature of Havanna
							sugars, and who pronounced the samples brought from Archangel to be of
							that description— In consequence of which the report of the College has
							been suspended, and the appearances begin to be more favourable to the
							persons interested— As I was little acquainted with the different sorts
							of sugar myself, and the various processes of its refinement I have been
							making some enquiries concerning it, and consulted <pb n="159" type="ms"
								/><persRef ref="jaubert-pierre">Jaubert’s</persRef> Dictionnaire des
							Arts et Métiers— I was thus engaged untill dinner time, and walked
							immediately after dinner. The days are already so short, and are so
							rapidly growing shorter that after the close of this month I shall be
							obliged to take all my exercise in the morning— Spent the Evening in
							writing, and in reading the newspapers lent me by the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef>. I have made
							it a practice for several years to read the Bible through in the course
							of every year— I usually devote to this reading the first hour after I
							rise every morning— As including the Apocrypha it contains about 1400
							chapters, and as I meet with occasional interruptions, when this reading
							is for single days, and sometimes for weeks; or even months suspended,
							my rule is to read five chapters each morning, which leaves an allowance
							for about one fourth of the time for such interruptions— Extraordinary
							pressure of business, seldom interrupts more than one day’s reading at a
							time— Sickness has frequently occasioned longer suspensions— And
							travelling still more and longer— During the present year, having lost
							very few days, I have finished the perusal earlier than usual— I closed
							the book yesterday— As I do not wish to suspend the habit of allowing
							regularly this time to this purpose, I have this morning commenced it
							anew— And for the sake of endeavouring to understand the Book better, as
							well as of giving some variety to the study, I have begun this time,
							with <persRef ref="osterwald-jean">Ostervald’s</persRef> french
							Translation; which has the advantage of a few short reflections upon
							each chapter.— I ought perhaps to be ashamed at having read this Book
							through, so many times, and at possessing its contents so little as I
							do— The regular and methodical manner of reading is not without defects—
							The division, by a given number of chapters is arbitrary and artificial—
							The appropriation of a certain hour inevitably devotes times when
							occasionally the attention is absorbed by objects, passions, interests,
							feelings, which the affairs of life bring up as it runs, and when the
							mind cannot command its application— The Bible is in many of its parts,
							as <persRef ref="peter">Saint Peter</persRef> says of his brother
								<persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> Epistles, hard to be
							understood— It presents difficulties of various kinds— The help of
							Commentators I have scarcely ever had at hand, and if I had, could not
							use, without devoting several hours of every day, instead of one to this
							object— It has long been one of the numerous Resolutions, which I take,
							and do not fulfill, to undertake this at some indefinite time; but I am
							always making to myself excuses for postponing it to some future time—
							Imperfect as my method is, I regret none of the time thus bestowed— At
							every perusal, I do add something to my knowledge of the
							Scriptures—something to my veneration of them, and I would hope,
							something to the improvement, which ought to result from this
							occupation, and which is the great motive to it— I received notice from
							the Grand-Master of the Ceremonies, <persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander"
								>Narishkin</persRef>, that there would be a Court held to-morrow, on
							the anniversary of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							Coronation, and a Te Deum on occasion of the late victory over the
							Turks.</p>

									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rosenzweig</persRef> the Chargé des

								Watzdorf</persRef>, the new Minister from his Court arrived last
							Evening. I had some Conversation with the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef>, from which I
							understand that he has received new instructions relative to the
							Commerce in what are called colonial Articles— I thanked him for the
							loan of the Moniteur’s, and for the return of the English Papers which
							he had lent me— I mentioned to him that I had observed with pleasure the
							attendance of <persRef ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef>
							at Court, on the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon’s</persRef> birth-day; considering it as an indication that
							our relations were becoming again more favourable in their aspect there—
							He said he had again received assurances that the dispositions of his
							Government were extremely friendly towards the United States— I said
							then that they should make a clear and a strong distinction between the
							English &amp; the Americans— That he said in relation to Commerce was
							very difficult— I assured him, that the only difficulty was in the
							inclination— That if this existed, nothing was more easy; as was
							completely proved in this Country; where either the Consul or myself
							could and did easily discriminate between those who pretended to be
							Americans, and the English who on false pretences gave themselves out as
							such— I mentioned to him the vessels, which had been detected as coming
							with false papers by <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>, and consequently
							seized and confiscated by this Government; and also the persons whom I
							had detected myself— I told him that only two days ago the <persRef
								ref="balashov-alexander">Minister of Police</persRef> had sent me
							two Sailors, who <pb n="160" type="ms"/>pretended to be Americans, but
							whom upon five minutes conversation I found not to be such, and whom
							therefore I sent back to him— I enumerated the particulars by which we
							were enabled to make this discrimination— The different pronuntiation of
							the language— The personal acquaintance we have with many of the
							merchants who trade here— And the secret marks of the Papers— If France
							was making War against the English, there was no real difficulty in
							distinguishing between them and the Americans; but if she was making War
							against certain Articles of Merchandize, to be sure, discrimination
							would be of no Avail— He told me, that to be candid, there was a pretty
							strong sentiment against the colonial trade at Paris, because they
							considered it as all English— For, says he—you, for instance raise no
							sugar— I told him that he was much mistaken— That a great deal of sugar
							was raised in the United States; and particularly in the Country ceded
							to us by France—Louisiana— But Cotton—Indigo— We were perhaps the
							greatest raisers of these Articles in the world, they were among our
							most valuable staple Articles— Besides, there were the Spanish
							Islands—South America—these were not English—and the Emperor Napoleon
							could not consider them as such; for he had more than once officially
							declared his friendliness to them, and his willingness for their
							Independence— With regard to that he said he could not give an opinion—
							But as to the Certificates of Origin said to be given by French Consuls
							in America, he was assured that they must be false, as the Consuls no
							longer gave any such certificates— I assured him in the most earnest
							terms that this was a mistake— That to my certain knowledge vessels
							which had sailed from the United States, as late as the month of June,
							had brought genuine Certificates of Origin from the French Consuls— I
							then added that if these were the Sentiments prevailing still with the
							French Government, I could not but lament it— That as long as they
							prevailed, however strong the friendly dispositions towards the United
							States might be said to be, the course of policy pursued must be
							injurious to them in the highest degree— You will do us, said I, immense
							injury— You will oppress the Continent of Europe, and yourselves with
							it; but take my word for it, and I pray you three years hence to
							remember what I say, you will do England more good than harm; you will
							not cut off her Communication with the Continent; you will not
							essentially distress her Commerce; but you will lay the world under the
							most grievous contributions, for her benefit and advantage— But said he;
							there is a prodigious accumulation of colonial articles and of her
							manufactures on her hands which she cannot dispose of; her Bank paper
							money is depretiating. Her merchants and great manufacturers are
							becoming bankrupts; the course of exchange is draining her of metallic
							specie; and therefore perseverance in this system must eventually compel
							her to come to terms of Peace— Why then said I, did she not snatch at
							the offer which you have just made her, of giving up the whole system?—
							I see nothing like a symptom of her giving up even her orders of
							Council— No! she wishes you to adhere to your system; because she knows
							and feels that it turns to her advantage— You speak of the accumulation
							of colonial articles in her warehouses; and what is the accumulation of
							your wines and brandies, and what was the accumulation of grain upon
							your hands?— It has induced you to grant licences for vessels to go from
							any where to England, and to bring back what they please; only upon the
							condition that they export an equal quantity or value of your
							productions from France— He said he was informed that the importations
							were restricted to certain specific articles, and did not include
							colonial articles generally— I told him that my information was very
							different, and it was a notorious fact that immediately on the
							understanding being had that this trade by licences was to be allowed,
							the price of colonial Articles in London had immediately risen ten or
							twelve per Cent— The <persRef ref="brancia-francesco">Chevalier
								Brancia</persRef> told me that he found upon enquiry my information
							respecting the proposition made in the Imperial-Council for securing the
							election of <persRef ref="peter-friedrich">Prince George of
								Oldenburg</persRef> as the successor to the throne of Sweden, by the
							restoration of Finland, was correct; and he also told me that the late
								<persRef ref="charles-xiii">king of Sweden</persRef> had come to the
							frontiers of this Country, and written to the Emperor, requesting
							permission to Embark from his dominions, and go to England— That the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had sent his aid de
							Camp <persRef ref="ozarowski-adam">Count Ozarowsky</persRef> to him, but
							with what answer, was not known— I walked immediately after dinner— In
							the Evening there was the most general illumination that there has been
							since our arrival here— This is the third in the space of three
							weeks.</p>

							acquired the reputation of sanctity by his austerities, and
							self-chastisements— The bishop gives no regular biographical account of
							him, but alludes to some of the incidents of his life, as to Events well
							known— He was the founder of the order of <hi rend="italic">minims</hi>,
							a name which he gave to his monks to denote their great humility— He was
							also it seems a performer of miracles; upon which there is a remarkable
							passage in this Panegyric— The learned prelate between his philosophical
							light and his religious prejudices; between the glory of his Saint and
							the ridicule of his superstitious legends appears embarrassed what to
							say, and finally says what he ought not. He plainly shews that he holds
							all these pretended miracles as spurious, and yet he censures the age
							for not believing them.— In another passage, with terms almost
							irreverent he charges God almighty with avenging his justice by
							multiplying crimes upon Earth; and calls for an exterminating angel to
							destroy that usurping Jeroboam, <persRef ref="william-iii">William
								3</persRef>— This discourse is one of those which teem with
