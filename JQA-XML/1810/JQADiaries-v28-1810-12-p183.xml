						<p><date>20. </date>I called this morning before breakfast, at about 11.
							O’Clock upon <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron
								Campenhausen</persRef>, and had a Conversation of two hours with
							him, on the subject of the American vessels, which are waiting for
							admission at the Ports of Revel, Baltic-Port, Riga, and Liebau— He
							received me with politeness, but complained that he had been for a
							fortnight very unwell with a rhumatism, <pb n="187" type="ms"/>and
							unable to go out of his house— I mentioned to him the subject of my
							visit. Told him of the letter which I had written more than a fortnight
							since to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> on
							this subject— That I was now about to dispatch a Courier to Gothenburg
							to embark there for the United States, and that I was desirous of
							informing the Government what the ultimate decision concerning these
							vessels and their Cargoes would be—that <persRef ref="rodde-c">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rodde</persRef> had called upon me yesterday,
							after having been with him, and mentioned to me that there were some
							Circumstances which had occasioned suspicions in his (Baron
							Campenhausen’s) mind, which perhaps it might be in my power to explain
							to his satisfaction— He said that with regard to the vessels there was
							no question or difficulty— But that with respect to the Cargoes, the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had ordered a special
							examination and determination to be made upon the sixty-seven vessels
							which had arrived at the out-ports since the close of the Navigation
							here— That they belonged to a Convoy, <hi rend="italic">about which a
								great deal had been said</hi>— And after several of them had been
							admitted; it was found that one of them had two sets of Papers; by one
							of which she had entered as coming only from Gothenburg, and by the
							other she appeared to have come from Fernambouco— The Emperor had
							therefore directed that a special examination and comparison of the
							papers of all these vessels should be made— That of the American vessels
							some had all the papers in order, and with regard to them there would be
							no difficulty— Some wanted papers for part of their Cargoes; and some
							for the whole— Some had certificates that their goods came from
							Calcutta, and one from Marie-Galante— That the laws of the Country were
							express and positive, as to the papers required; and if any were
							admitted which were not provided with those papers it must be by special
							indulgence— I observed that I supposed the only paper required by law,
							of which these vessels would be destitute would be the certificates of
							origin from the <persRef ref="ewstaffer-alexis;dashkov-andrei"><hi
									rend="italic">Russian</hi> Consuls</persRef>, and the cause of
							their wanting them was that they had been originally destined for other
							Ports than those of Russia—for the Ports of Denmark or of Prussia; and
							they came here only in consequence of finding themselves excluded from
							them— That two vessels under the same Circumstances had been admitted
							more than two months since, on a representation which I had made to him
							and to Count Romanzoff; and that I had considered that as a precedent
							which would apply in all other cases of the same description— That, he
							said could not be concluded, for in those cases the decision was by the
							special order of the Emperor himself— They were solitary cases of
							exception from the rigour of the law; but now it had become necessary to
							decide upon the general principle; which the Emperor had thought proper
							to refer to the council; and my letter to Count Romanzoff had also been
							referred to the same body; together with the other papers.— But he said
							it was rather hard upon Russia, to have such an immense mass of foreign
							merchandizes, thus thrown upon her in a manner, after the navigation
							season was closed—especially in the unfavourable state of her exchange—
							I told him I was very glad he had given me this intimation, because it
							would give me an opportunity of suggesting to him several considerations
							which appeared to me both equitable and important in favour of my own
							Countrymen— I should not contest the correctness of his principle that
							the export trade should be encouraged more than that of imports— It was
							natural and reasonable that every Country should wish to have the
							general balance of trade in her favour, and should frame her commercial
							laws at home upon that foundation— It was my duty to speak only of the
							portion of trade carried on between Russia, and my own Countrymen— That
							on the trade carried on by the Americans here, the balance was in favour
							of Russia and I could not suppose it would be insisted that we should
							bring nothing but money in payment of the articles of Russian produce
							and manufacture which we come to take— He said he could not conceive how
							the balance should be in favour of Russia, when the ships came almost
							all laden with colonial articles, one Cargo of which would pay for more
							than three return Cargoes of any Russian Articles— I told him, I must
							with submission question the correctness of his estimate— I owned that
							generally speaking the Russian Exports were more bulky than the Colonial
							Articles, for corresponding values, and perhaps if he supposed hemp to
							be the only article exported, it might take three Cargoes of that to pay
							for a rich Cargo of Colonial wares. But if he would take the
							manufactured articles as the standard, the proportion would be far more
							equal, and an import Cargo, would certainly not pay for two return
							Cargoes of the same burthen— He instanced Indigo— But I told him that
							could in the nature of things form but a small part of the imported
							Articles— No vessel would be laden with it entirely— Of very few Cargoes
							indeed would it form a large proportion. Besides which I added that many
							American vessels came here in ballast; and went home laden to the <pb
								n="188" type="ms"/>amount of 3 or 400000 Rubles. Many American
							Merchants who had balances left after the sale of the Cargoes which they
							sent here, and the loading of their vessels in return, left the balance
							in the hands of their correspondents to be vested in the funds of the
							Country, or in goods to be exported the ensuing season which contributed
							to support the prices of the Articles, at times when otherwise there
							would be scarcely any sales for them at-all— From the very nature of the
							trade between the United States, and this Country, it must be the
							interest of the Americans who carried it on, to load their vessels with
							the richest Cargoes of Russian manufactures that they could carry, that
							they might make a profit on the homeward as well as on the outward
							voyage— That certainly there was no gold or silver carried from this
							Country to America— But he said it was the same thing if the money was
							paid by remitting Bills— There was no profit I replied in making
							remittances; for whatever the rate of exchange was, by taking a Bill on
							London or Amsterdam, a man would never get more than the worth of his
							money in the market; while by exporting a Cargo of goods he would always
							calculate upon a suitable commercial profit to be made upon them— The
							distance of the United States; the necessary length and expense of the
							voyage made this profit a more essential object to the merchant— The
							opening of the trade to South-America, and the Spanish West-India
							islands, had naturally much increased the trade between the United
							States and Russia— Those Countries consumed great quantities of the
							Russian manufactures; more even than North-America. We took from them
							their productions, and carried them those of Russia in return— The Baron
							said that au reste, these were political considerations which ought not
							to operate in the case of the vessels in question; for if they had come
							in conformably to the laws of the Country, they could not at any rate be
							subjected to the rejection of their Cargoes on mere views of policy— He
							asked me if I had seen an Article in the Gazettes; a letter from
							Elseneur, in which it was denied in the strongest terms that there were
							any American vessels in this Convoy at Gothenburg— It seemed he said as
							if the American Government itself ought to take notice of such charges
							as those— I did not at first understand to what Article he alluded; but
							when he explained it, I told him, yes, I had seen that Article, which
							was dated at Elseneur, but which I presumed he knew was fabricated at
							Paris— That in pretending there were no Americans among that fleet at
							Gothenburg it had certainly made a false statement— That perhaps there
							might be in the fleet some vessels which had assumed the American flag,
							without being entitled to it; but as the fleet consisted of about seven
							hundred sail; and I did not know of more than twenty-five or thirty
							Americans among them, the proportion of real Americans to the whole
							number was certainly very small— He asked me what was the reason that
							American vessels had been excluded from the Prussian and Danish Ports— I
							told him, because the Governments of those Countries had been required
							to pass ordinances to that effect, by an authority which they could not
							resist— That I need not tell him it was an act involuntary and reluctant
							on their part— But the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">kings of
								Prussia</persRef> and of <persRef ref="frederick-vi"
								>Denmark</persRef> were to be pitied rather than blamed for the
							rigours extorted from them, and which it could not be supposed would
							have been exercised by them, if they retained the sentiment or the
							pretension to Independence— He asked me what could be the motive of
							France for this rigour— I told him that France had undertaken to levy a
							duty of fifty per Cent upon most of the Articles which were brought by
							American vessels— If the same Articles could have been freely imported
							into Denmark &amp; Prussia upon the payment of moderate duties; the
							french Government could not with all its power have prevented the
							introduction of them by contraband into France, and therefore could not
							have raised that enormous and oppressive duty. France too entertains the
							opinion that she cannot injure commerce of any kind without injuring
							England; and provided she can strike England cares not through whose
							sides the thrust is made.— But was there not a great abuse (he asked) of
							the American flag made by the English—did not they counterfeit papers—
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef> himself had written him last Summer that he could
							not vouch for the authenticity of any papers relating to Cargoes; and
							there had been for instance a vessel arrived at Archangel entered as
							from Gothenburg, and which for sometime appeared to have papers
							perfectly in order— But afterwards another set of Papers had been found—
							She had been dispatched from Dublin; and even the Instructions to the
							Captain were found, in what cases he was to produce one set of papers,
							and when the other— I said there were undoubtedly cases of that kind;
							and there were Americans as there were individuals of all other Nations,
							who would practice any imposition which could bring them profit— They
							were however <pb n="189" type="ms"/>few in number, and easily detected—
							Less frequent indeed than those instances of English forgeries
							presenting themselves in the semblance of American ship papers, which
							had been exposed and denounced by the American Consul himself; and for
							the exposure of which I had not escaped the obloquy of the English
							public Journals— He asked what could have become of all the vessels of
							that convoy from Gothenburg, if there were really seven hundred of them—
							I said he would find if he consulted the Gazettes which he had mentioned
							to me, that a great number had been captured and would be confiscated by
							the Danes. That some had come to the Russian Ports, and that all the
							rest had perished in Tempests— But that if he chose to send a messenger
							round to all the harbours of the Baltic as far as Gothenburg and on both
							its shores, I imagine he would find there had been very abundant
							salvages from all these wrecks. I would of course not be understood as
							now speaking of the Russian Ports— But setting them aside it was a very
							generally received opinion among the merchants that notwithstanding all
							the manifestations of rigour against every thing English which were
							resounding throughout Europe, it was not an impossible thing by a
							suitable sacrifice of an adequate sum of money, and a judicious
							application of it, English property, and English vessels under whatever
							disguise might even now obtain admission into many Ports of the North. I
							said this was what had been mentioned to me by some of my Countrymen as
							the most extraordinary circumstance in its appearance to them; and that
							even in the difficulties which they had met with at Archangel, they had
							seen other vessels far less entitled to admission than theirs according
							to the intention of the Laws obtain that admission with apparent
							facility— He smiled and said he supposed there might be some such cases;
							but that they must have escaped detection by the apparent regularity of
							all their papers— That, I replied was probable; and indeed it was
							obvious that those who were deliberately practising fraud and imposition
							would be most punctiliously correct to every formality— He said that the
							certificates produced for some of the goods in these Cargoes stated them
							as coming from Calcutta; and others from Marie Galante— That Calcutta
							was altogether an English Possession, and that the certificates might as
							well have been from London—that Marie-galante having been formerly a
							possession of France, it might be a question whether the goods had been
							exported from the island before or since it had been taken by the
							English, and it seemed incumbent on the importers here to furnish proof
							that it was before— I asked him whether he was certain that the papers
							of the former kind certified the goods as from Calcutta; or in general
							terms as from <hi rend="italic">India</hi>— That he said was another and
							a distinct question. There were some from India, but those he had
							referred to expressly mentioned Calcutta— I told him I had heard of both
							the cases, and had reflected upon them, as certainly they presented
							under the existing laws of the Empire questions deserving of very mature
							reflection— That the Commerce of the United States with India, even with
							Bengal, was so far from being justly considered as English, that it was
							a rival trade to that of the English; and carried on with the People of
							the Country— That our vessels had been admitted into the Ports of the
							British Settlements there by virtue of an Article in our Treaty with
							England of 1794; and that we had not since been excluded from them; but
							that on a late Negotiation for the renewal of this Treaty, the English
							Government had refused to renew that Article, on the urgent
							representations of the East-India Company who have the monopoly of the
							trade with India in England, and who complained that our competition
							there was ruinous to them.— As to the articles from Marie-Galante, the
							fair presumption was that their exportation must have been previous to
							the occupation of the island by the British, because it might be taken
							as a general rule that the moment a West-India Island became a British
							Possession, our vessels, and those indeed of all other Nations but
							themselves were excluded from them— But said he, did you not just tell
							me that you were admitted to their Colonies in India? do they make a
							distinction between the East and the West?— I said they did—that in the
							same Treaty of 1794 that I had just mentioned, there had originally been
							inserted an Article by which our vessels were to be partially and
							conditionally admitted to their West-India Islands— But the condition
							had appeared so burthensome to our own Government that the Treaty had
							been ratified with the exception of that Article; and therefore our
							vessels are never admitted to their islands in the West-Indies, except
							when to save the inhabitants of the islands themselves from famine,
							their Governors allow us to come for three or six months at a time, by
							special proclamations— Returning then to the goods from Calcutta, he
							said that he thought the importers should at least have produced proof,
							that they were not of English produce or manufacture— I told him that if
							he would permit me between him and me, in perfect confidence, and with
							the assurance that <pb n="190" type="ms"/>that it should operate no
							disadvantage to the persons interested, I could tell him that they did
							possess the proof, which he thought should be required of them— Why then
							did they not produce it?— Because it was contained in a document
							perfectly authentic; but which the french Government had thought proper
							to declare to be false— Oh! said he, I understand you—it is the
							certificate of the French Consuls— Well, they are right not to exhibit
							that— Finally he assured me that the business should be decided in a
							very few days— Certainly by the beginning of the next week. That every
							thing on his part was ready, and the Council would have decided upon it
							some days since; but that other business of importance had taken up all
							their time. He urged me strongly to detain the Courier two or three days
							longer, which at this Season he thought could not be of much
							consequence; for so long a journey and voyage— This too he said had been
							one occasion of the delays in the decision— Because at any rate the
							vessels could not get away for some months, and that a delay of some
							days could be no material injury to them. I observed to him that all
							delays might seriously affect them in the disposal of their Cargoes, and
							in their negotiations for a return Cargo— They could do nothing while
							the question about their admission was in suspence— Besides which there
							was a Circumstance which it might require some delicacy for me properly
							to mention— But my Countrymen upon arriving here applied to merchants to
							assist them in transacting their business— The moment a difficulty in
							relation to their papers occurred, it was suggested to them, that the
							way must be smoothed by a payment of money; which I believe was
							sometimes charged when it was not paid— He said he thought persons who
							were capable of such a thing ought to be exposed— That in the ordinary
							cases at the Custom-House, or before the neutral Commission, there might
							be some use of money—there might be some bad men, (mauvais sujets)
							there, whom it was impossible to detect; but in this case he could
							assure me there was no occasion for money, and could be nothing obtained
							by it— The Commission or Custom-house had nothing to do with it— The
							Emperor had ordered it for a special decision of the Council, and money
							was out of the question— He again repeated the request that I would
							detain the Courier two or three days longer; and said that as to the
							greater part of the Cargoes they would certainly be admitted; and as to
							the rest said he; we will try and find some expedient to let them in
							too. I finally consented to detain the Courier untill Tuesday or
							Wednesday; though I told him I should have to apologize to Count
							Romanzoff, from whom I had already received the Passports and his own
							despatches for the Minister of His Majesty in the United States— I left
							the Baron after a Conversation of about two hours.— Two Gentlemen of his
							friends came in about half an hour before I had finished— But finding us
							engaged they pass’d into another room untill I came away— It was about
							one O’Clock, when I got home to breakfast— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris was here immediately afterwards— I had agreed to go this day with
							him, and dine at <persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count
							Stedingk’s</persRef>; but wishing to write in the Evening, I thought
							best to postpone it. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris dined with us.
								<persRef ref="adams-wb">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams</persRef> also

							with which she was perfectly satisfied— The Empress said to me vôtre

							said I ce Cadeau là ne vient pas de chéz nous— C’est une Calomnie qu’on

							said l’Imperatrice prend la peste pour la fievre Jaune— Mais vous vous

							eight in the Evening I went alone; to the Ball.— It was as all these
							Balls are excessively tedious; though the Empress-Mother was very
							gracious, and extremely attentive to do the honours of her house— She
							twice express’d to me her regret at M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams’s not
							being of the party— And also that Mademoiselle sa Soeur was not there—
							Mais pour cette jeune personne je suis sure que ce n’est rien que la
							timidité qui l’a empêché de venir— I stood the whole time untill Supper,
							which was served just about 12. at Night— The Emperor made some remark
							to me upon the warmth of the Rooms; which were indeed excessively warm.
							I had conversation with <persRef ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count

							<persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk</persRef>—<persRef

							the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef>.
							Great part of the time I stood gazing, and doing nothing— It had been a
							great object of curiosity and anxiety with the other ministers to see
							whether the Empress and <persRef ref="annapavlovna">Grand-Duchess
								Ann</persRef> would dance Polonaises with <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien</persRef>.— They did not— They dance only with the French
							Ambassador, and he only sits at the Imperial table at supper— Count S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien has been here about a year, without any
							regular diplomatic character; and having no rule of etiquette to operate
							concerning him, has been invited to dine with the Emperor, and to the
							Hermitage parties— He has lately received and presented his credentials
							as Envoy-Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, a Minister of the
							second order— The Emperor has ordered that he should still be invited to
							the hermitage parties— At which several of the other Ministers of the
							same rank, none of whom receive such invitations have taken great
							offence, and have written about it to their Courts— S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Julien by his exultation at these distinctions, has
							aggravated the mortification of the others, and has countenanced a
							report which has been in circulation that he was in all respects to be
							treated with the same honours as an Ambassador; and even that there was
							a Convention between the Courts of Vienna and of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg, by which this was reciprocally agreed.— He was however this
							Evening treated in no respect differently from the other Ministers of
							the second order— At our table, and next to me the Roman Catholic
								<persRef ref="siestrzencewicz-stanislaw">Archbishop of
								Mohiloff</persRef> took his seat— It was not indeed his place; but
							the attendants suffered him to remain; and sitting next to him I had
							some conversation with him. When the Empress-mother, going the rounds of
							the tables, and speaking to every guest in turn came to him, she said to
							him with a smile, vous êtes ici sans doute pour la bénédiction— Pour la
							souhaiter, Madame, said he; puisque vôtre Majesté Impériale vent bien me
							le permettre— Upon my observing to him that the Greek Church was
							tolerant, he intimated to me that I was mistaken. the Government indeed
							said he is tolerant, and protects us—if they did not we should certainly
							be persecuted— He appeared to have some little knowledge of America; and
							told me that untill <persRef ref="carroll-john">Bishop Carroll</persRef>
							had been made an Archbishop, his diocese and his own, were he believed
							the two largest for extent of territory in the world.— After the supper,
							there was only a Polonaise danced, and the Imperial family retired about
							half-past one O’Clock in the morning— I was at home before two.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>—</date> I seldom rise before full day-light; or in
							other words, during the present month before nine O’Clock— My first
							occupation is to read five chapters in the French Bible with <persRef
								ref="osterwald-jean">Ostervald’s</persRef> reflections— Write my
							journal of the preceding day; or any thing else that is urgent upon
							hand— Breakfast about eleven— From that time untill 3. p.m. I write,
							settle household or other accounts and pay, or much more frequently
							receive visits— The numbers of Americans now here, make this part of my
							time precarious for any steady employment— From three to five I usually
							walk—dine from five to seven— From seven untill eleven at Night, I pass
							in my chamber reading or writing as occasion requires— Or in Company
							abroad; or with Evening visitors at home— About Midnight is the hour for
							bed. By retiring from almost all the Societies which are commonly
							frequented here, which under my Circumstances I could not well avoid, I
							am able to lead a life more regular than that of the last Winter— I find
							however that I have very little real leisure upon my hands; and of that
							little I do not make a profitable use.</p>
						<p>The year 1810 is past; and to all past time we are already dead— It has
							been to me rich with the blessings of Providence, for which I would be
							duly grateful to the giver of all good— Having been employed in the
							service of my Country, I am not conscious of its having witnessed any
							neglect in the performance of my official duties; nor can I charge
							myself with any intentional wrong in the private offices of life— But I
							have indulged too much indolence and inactivity of mind; and have not
							turned my leisure time to good account. I have pursued no object
							steadily; and the year has left no advantageous trace of itself in the
							annals of my life— I have formed my domestic establishment here in a
							very exact proportion to my means; but upon such an establishment a
							Public minister here can enjoy very little consideration, and must be
							subject to great animadversion— It is with great difficulty that I have
							hitherto adhered to my principles, and having now a full year’s
							experience, I think I shall be able to carry it through. I begin already
							to be sensible of the approaches of age. I cannot hope for any
							intellectual improvement upon my faculties from the present time— I pray
							for the power and the will to make a better improvement of them— And for
							the blessing of Heaven continually upon <persRef
