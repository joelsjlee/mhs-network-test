							having changed his residence, which is now distant from my own house,

							going in just before me— Their Conversation was on the expence of

							Petersburg— Bussche said he had a very small salary; and was determined
							to spend none of his own fortune in this detestable Country; to which if
							he had known what it was before he came, horses should not have dragg’d
							him— He chose therefore to live very economically— He had a small, but
							very pretty house in the City, for which he paid upwards of eight
							thousand Roubles a year for Rent, and which he partly furnished— His
							Country Seat cost him two thousand five hundred Roubles for the Summer
							months— And he was obliged to keep three Valets de Chambre, three
							footmen, a Chasseur, a Swiss, and Moozhiks he knew not how many— A
							Droshka, and eleven horses; each of which cost twenty-eight roubles a
							month to feed— General Watzdorf told us that he was 51. years old had
							been twice married—had two children by <persRef ref="watzdorf-marie">his
								first wife</persRef>, one of which was a <persRef
								ref="watzdorf-marie2">daughter</persRef>, already married— That he

							felt himself altogether a novice in diplomacy— I afterwards returned

							suggested as desirable by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Daschkoff— The People
							of the United States were so extensively engaged in commercial
							Navigation to all parts of the world, that the traffic with the Indians
							on the North-west Coast could not be prevented, but by special
							prohibitions of Law— Prohibitions, which it would seem almost, if not
							altogether impracticable to carry fully into Execution— The Russians
							were a Nation not so much addicted to Navigation as my Countrymen; and
							yet he the Count was well aware, how ineffectual the prohibitions to
							send vessels to particular foreign Countries were, to prevent them from
							going there— If such was the experience of this Government, the
							difficulties must obviously be much greater in preventing a trade so
							distant, with wandering savages, scattered along a Coast over several
							degrees of latitude; having no Ports, no Custom-houses, not even
							permanent dwelling places, from which it would be possible to collect
							evidence of any transgression of the Law— That even were a Convention
							concluded to prohibit this traffic, the Indians would probably still get
							their supplies; if not from our vessels, yet from the English; either by
							water, or by land from the British Settlements North of us. And although
							nothing could be easier than to draw an Article of a Convention to
							prohibit the trade, it would indicate a want of frankness and candour in
							the United States to contract engagements, and then find them not
							executed— For though it should arise from a state of things not within
							their controul, it would be manifest that such a State of things ought
							to have been considered before the contract was formed. I was however
							instructed to enquire, what would be the boundary line, within which it
							was the wish of this Government to extend the prohibition? A Question
							which I had already intimated in the former conference— The Count
							answered me, that he would render to the Emperor an exact report of the
							observations I had now made to him— That it was an object concerning
							which they had no great solicitude— Their first idea had been that this
							trade with the Indians, especially as to the Article of fire-arms, might
							be as detrimental to the United States themselves as to the Russian
							settlement and more so. That in that point of view the United-States
							might find it expedient to issue the prohibition, provided it were
							compatible with our Constitutions.— He did not think it possible for
							these supplies of arms to be furnished to those Indians from the British
							Settlements by Land. But with regard to a mutual stipulation, he
							candidly confessed there was no basis— To engage that the Russians
							should not thus traffic would be nugatory, as no Russian vessels traded
							there— And there was no privilege, which could be granted for trade with
							the Russian settlement, but what now existed de facto— The trade of all
							Nations there was perfectly free— As to the fixing a boundary, it would
							be most advisable to defer that to some future time; for the sake of
							avoiding all possible collision, and even every pretext for jealousy or
							uneasiness— In the present State of the World, the first and strongest
							wish of his Heart was to bring all the civilized Nations to pacific
							dispositions, and most carefully to avoid every thing which could strike
							a single new spark of discord out among them.— At any rate I might be
							assured of the continuance of the Emperor’s amicable dispositions
							towards the United States— They were as strong and fixed as they ever
							had been; and he might even say stronger— Our attachment to the United
							States, says he, I assure you <hi rend="italic">is obstinate</hi>— <hi
								rend="italic">More obstinate than you are aware of</hi>.— I replied
							that I understood the force of the term which he had used— That if there
							were particulars of which I was uninformed, I knew full well in a
							general point of view the attachment to which he alluded, and that most
							certainly it should not remain unknown to the Government of the United
							States. That indeed a comparison between the measures not only of
							France, but of all the neighbours of Russia, in the North of Europe,
							Denmark, Prussia, Sweden, with regard to the commerce of the United
							States, with those of Russia, during the present year, would of itself
							be a strong indication to the Government, and to the People of the
							United States, of a disposition in Russia, very different from that
							which they have experienced <pb n="165" type="ms"/>elsewhere, and it was
							impossible they could be insensible to it— I had learnt however from
							some of my Countrymen, lately arrived here after detention at
							Copenhagen, that there had been some measures of restriction upon the
							privateers, and some others favourable to the Americans, lately adopted
							by the Danish Government— There had obviously been a change also lately
							in the policy of France— The project of cutting off all commerce between
							the British Islands and the Continent could no longer be pursued, since
							licences were openly offered for sale by authority of the French
							Government at Hamburg— But, said the Count, there is an Embargo— The
							Government there, do not allow the vessels to sail— I said that I had
							private advices, that every vessel with a French licence was understood
							to be exempted from the operation of the Embargo, and might go when and
							where it pleased. But, said he, there is a new edict of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>, forbidding all
							such vessels from taking any passengers; and in my own opinion there is
							no real change in the policy of France— The Ministers and People about
							the Emperor prevail upon him sometimes to sign edicts and ordinances
							which they think and represent as changes of his policy, but they find
							themselves mistaken— His intentions remain the same— He thinks the only
							means by which he can influence England, is by distressing the English
							commerce, and that is after all his real object— Now as much as ever— I
							said that I believed this opinion correct; but certainly the means to
							the end were continually changing; and the experiment upon which he now
							seemed to rely was to levy upon importations the most excessive
							duties—which if really levied must ultimately fall upon his own People
							the consumers— I then mentioned the case of the Havanna sugars arrived
							in American vessels at Archangel; and which the revisor at that Port,
							and <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron Campenhausen</persRef>
							has taken for refined sugars broken up and powdered— On which they had
							suspected and accused the importers of having endeavoured to introduce
							them by fraud, and having brought them from England— I immediately saw
							by the manner in which the Count talked upon this subject, what I have
							all along suspected, that there is a purpose behind the curtain in this
							affair— He first asked me whether I did not think they might possibly be
							refined sugars powdered, and that there had been an attempt to introduce
							them as raw, to evade the payment of the heavier duties— I said I
							believed it impossible— These vessels came from the United States with
							all the regular documents, including certificates from the <persRef
								ref="ewstaffer-alexis">Russian Consuls</persRef>— I knew some of the
							merchants who had expedited them, and did not believe they would lend
							themselves to such an attempt to defraud the Russian Government— I knew
							the nature of the Havanna white Sugar, and the ease with which it might
							be mistaken for refined loaf-sugar powdered— But the expence of
							powdering whole Cargoes of loaf-sugar, would be far greater than the
							saving in the difference of the duties— The first cost of loaf sugar to
							break down, would be double, what these sugars are offered for and
							actually sold in the market here— There was no possibility of profit,
							but the utmost certainty of a heavy loss, in the attempt which was
							suspected— There was besides the easiest of all possible means to
							ascertain the fact by boiling down an equal quantity of refined sugar
							and of that in question— The result would immediately shew the
							difference between them.— But said he, if there is this similarity
							between them that they are so liable to be mistaken for each other, I
							should recommend to the Emperor to prohibit their importation—(this is
							the true secret) for at least it opens a door to fraud, and may deprive
							the revenues of the duties on refined sugars— And indeed, before I
							quitted the Department of Commerce, I had similar informations reported
							to me of the importation here at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg of
								<hi rend="italic">refined sugars</hi> under the name of <hi
								rend="italic">powdered</hi> raw— I said that if the Emperor should
							consider the interests of His Empire as requiring a prohibition that the
							white Havanna sugars should henceforth in future be imported into this
							Country, it would undoubtedly be a misfortune for us; but the Emperor
							must certainly decide as he thought fit— I could not however myself
							conceive a motive for excluding a raw sugar, superior in quality more
							than in price to the others, fit as any others for refinement by the
							manufactures of the Country, and which could be mistaken for refined
							sugar, only because untill recently, it had been very little known and
							imported here— That the quantities in which it now came arose I presumed
							from the free admission of our vessels, and the great increase of our
							trade with the Island of Cuba, under the new Government which it had
							assumed— And I had observed that among the Articles which the new
							Government of Caraccas had permitted to be imported from the United
							States, Russian Manufactures were included— I supposed the Government at
							the Havanna had done the same— I said I was glad of this opportunity of
							conversing with him upon those Events, which seemed to me to be of
							transcendent importance, not only to us; but to the General Politics of
							Europe— (I knew this was touching upon a string to which the Count’s
							feelings would respond— They did so instantaneously—) He said that it
							would have been impossible for himself to have expressed more exactly
							his opinion than I had just done— He asked me, whether we <pb n="166"
								type="ms"/>had before the late Revolutions in the Spanish Colonies,
							any Commerce with the Havanna, and whether our vessels had been admitted
							there— Whether I knew what sort of Government they now had there—
							Whether they had sent any Ministers or Agents to the United States; and
							whether I thought they would be able and would adhere to the intention
							of maintaining themselves in a State of Independence— I told him that
							our vessels had always been admitted at the Havanna— That like many
							others of the West-India Islands, they depended in some measure upon the
							Continent of North-America for subsistence— That we had therefore always
							enjoyed a trade with them arising from their necessities; and it had
							always been very valuable— But undoubtedly the late revolutions had very
							much increased it— That I was not accurately informed what the Nature of
							their Government was; nor whether they had agents or Ministers in the
							United States— I had nothing upon the subject from the Government, and
							only saw by the Newspapers that they had sent agents to Washington who
							had not however been recognized— That as to their maintaining their
							Independence, that would probably depend upon Events and arrangements in
							Europe— If the war should terminate in the establishment of a Sovereign
							of the Buonaparte family or appointment in Spain, undoubtedly the
							Colonies of that Nation would no longer continue in that relation. The
							sentiment of the People, both upon the American Continent, and in the
							Spanish Islands was so unanimous and so strongly pronounced on this
							point that they could never again be made dependences upon Spain, under
							that Government, unless by conquest; which Spain would not be very able,
							nor I believe France very willing to undertake— The Emperor Napoleon,
							nearly a year since had declared himself ready and willing to
							acknowledge the Independence of the Spanish Colonies, if the People of
							the Countries themselves desired it— That they would desire it in
							preference to dependence upon <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Spanish
							Monarchy was beyond all question; and it seemed to me a thing altogether
							conformable to the <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> of all the European
							continental powers— The only obstacle of serious import that I could
							foresee to this result would come from England— She could not help
							perceiving, that it must give the death blow to the old colonial system
							of Europe; which was founded upon the contracted and despicable basis of
							monopoly between the Colony and its European Master— If once the Spanish
							and Portugueze Colonies on the American Continent, and all the
							considerable Islands in their neighbourhood acquire Independence, and of
							course the enjoyment of a free trade with all the world, England will
							make but a sorry figure with her exclusion of all trade but her own with
							her petty islands of Barbadoes and Jamaica— There was it seemed to me
							already some Evidence of the jealousy with which England had witnessed
							the late manifestations of Independence in the Spanish Colonies— I
							observed that the Junta at Cadix had issued a proclamation against them;
							with a declaration that they had ordered a naval force to be stationed
							so as to blockade them— Now as to a blockade by the naval forces of the
							Junta at Cadix, it would be only matter of ridicule, if it referred for
							execution only to their own— But I concluded that in publishing this
							paper they were assured of the co-operation of British naval forces for
							their blockade, and strongly suspect that it was under British
							instigation that they issued the manifesto. If such be the case it most
							clearly demonstrates in what light the English Government consider these
							Events— But whatever Britain might think, or wish, this course of Events
							is too mighty for her controul— Can she recover Spain for <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand 7</persRef>. and Portugal for the
								<persRef ref="john-vi">Prince of Brazil</persRef>?— As to Ferdinand
							7. said the Count, I consider the use of his name in the present stage
							of affairs as absurd, and becoming ridiculous. A Prince in a foreign
							Country—a prisoner, in possession of another Sovereign; without a
							prospect of ever being restored— It is impossible that the American
							Colonies should remain even nominally under his Government— Then said I,
							without hesitation I do give it as my opinion that all the Spanish
							Colonies will be either Independent, or at least have an existence
							totally different from that which they have been under from the
							discovery of Columbus to these times— If France and the European
							Continental powers chuse, it will be Independence— As to Brazil its
							Independence is already declared— The removal of the royal family of
							Portugal, was in the result; nothing more nor less than a declaration of
							Independence, for the Portugueze Colonies in America— Accordingly
							England has just been making a Treaty of Commerce with the Prince
							Regent; and I doubt not he will find it for his interest to make another
							Treaty with the United States, and with any other European Power as well
							as with England. The Count enquired whether we had a Minister there. I
							told him of <persRef ref="sumter-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Sumter’s</persRef> appointment, and that the newspapers mentioned
							his having arrived at Rio Janeiro— Of which however I had no official
							advice— By this time <persRef ref="navarro-rodrigo">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Navarro</persRef> was announced as being in the
							antichamber waiting; and I rose to take my <pb n="167" type="ms"/>leave—
							The Count with much earnestness expressed his regret at being
							interrupted in this conversation, and again assured me with great
							apparent satisfaction of his most entire and perfect coincidence of
							opinion with me on this subject— Before leaving him I mentioned <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas3">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones’s</persRef> desire
							to be presented at Court, to the Emperor— I told him that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones had been a fellow-traveller with <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Poinsett</persRef>, who
							had given him such a favorable idea of Russia, that he had come as a
							traveller to visit the Country— The Count enquired what was M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones’s condition in life; adding however an
							apology for the question, and intimating that he did not wish me to be
							very particular in the answer. I told him that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jones was a young Gentleman, of a respectable family; who had no
							particular profession— <persRef ref="jones-t">His father</persRef> was
							wealthy, and he was now traveling for his own pleasure and improvement—
							He asked what was the father’s occupation, and I told him he was a
							merchant— The Count asked me to give him the Gentleman’s name; which I
							did; and he said he would take the Emperor’s orders concerning it— The
							Emperor returns this day to the Winter Palace, from his Summer Residence
							at Kammenoi Ostroff— As I left the Count I met M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Navarro going in— I came home, and read my letters from America, and the
							Anthology Criticism of my Lectures— It is tolerably well-written; but
							full of inconsistency, and excessive both in praise and blame—especially
							the praise— <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, with the intention of going by land
							to Gottenburg, and embarking there for England. I paid a visit to
								<persRef ref="bainbridge-william">Captain Bainbridge</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lynch</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lewis</persRef>, but found
							neither of them at his lodgings— I found however M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Donovan; who promised to take letters for me for England— He expects to
							go in two or three days— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Donovan now explained
							to me the nature of his complaint against Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="meyer-jc">Meyer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bruxner-george">Brüxner</persRef>, for overcharging him in his
							account— He read me the copy of letter which he had written this morning
							to <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris</persRef>, enclosing one of his last letter to Meyer and Bruxner—
							And while I was with him he received M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris’s
							Answer, returning him with a refusal to receive it the copy of the
							letter to Meyer &amp; Bruxner, and the letter to himself enclosing it.—
							He read me M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s Answer, which was in cool and
							considerate terms— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Donovan’s observations upon
							it were equally so. I asked him if he had obtained the extract from the
							Custom-house of the duties actually paid on his imported Cargo— He had
							not— But he had obtained the order for it from the Minister— And then he
							had received a letter from a certain Notary public, broker, and
							interpreter, imploring his Compassion for the expeditor, and
							custom-house collector and receiver, and intreating him not to pursue
							any further his enquiry on this subject, as it would involve them and
							their families in irretrievable ruin. This was proof as decisive for his
							purpose, as the extracts from the duties themselves— These were the
							people, who by underweighing and underguaging, entered goods at the
							custom-house, for about half what they ought to be entered— The
							consignment merchants made their foreign correspondents pay the whole
							duties; but by suitable inducements prevailed upon these expeditors, and
							custom-house weighers and gaugers to reduce the entries about one half—
							This double plunder from the foreign Correspondents and the Government
							here was thus shared between the Consignees, and these Custom-house
							subalterns— The Clerks and yet inferior waiters there seeing all this
							management and able to ruin those who practice it by informing against
							them steal to the amount of about ten per Cent upon all the deposited
							goods, and make the connivence of their superiors to these thefts, the
							price of their silence at the malversations of those Superiors— As his
							evidence was adequate to his object, he had been unwilling to ruin the
							poor subalterns the mere instruments of these frauds, and he had pursued
							his inquiries no further— He also appeared fully convinced that he knew
							the origin and sole cause of the transactions respecting the Havanna
							sugars seized at Archangel. The Commission there knew them to be Havanna
							sugars, as well as the Importers— Nothing was easier than to distinguish
							them from <pb n="168" type="ms"/>refined sugars— But last year the
							consignment merchants at Archangel, had charged all their American
							Correspondents large sums, for obtaining what they called facilities;
							that is for conciliating the favour of the Commission for neutral
							Navigation— But they had really given to the Commissioners not more than
							one quarter part of it, and kept the other three fourths for themselves.
							The Commissioners had been informed of this, and as long ago as last
							Winter had acquainted the Merchants, that they should in due time be
							punished for defrauding them of their honest perquisites; and hence
							arose this supposed mistake of raw for refined sugars— The private
							interest of the <persRef ref="krehmer-benedict;krehmer-sebastian"
								>Cramer’s</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="severin-henry;severin-peter">Severin’s</persRef> did the rest—
							As Petersburg merchants they are jealous of the Archangel trade— As
							sugar-refiners, they are jealous of other refineries lately erected on
							the Wolga by merchants of Archangel— If the sugars in question had been
							seized and confiscated, they might have been purchased at low prices,
							for the refinery of the Severin’s and Cramer’s, and hence the opinion so
							readily given by Peter Severin, his refiner and Benedict Cramer, that
							the samples were refined sugar— Such are M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Donovan’s opinions, probably somewhat tinctured by his resentments—
							After leaving him, as I was walking on the Mall in front of the
							admiralty, I met the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, who
							stop’d and spoke to me— He said the autumn had been finer than the
							Summer— But as to Summer said he—we have had none—you must have a
							terrible opinion of our climate— I said that as long as one enjoyed
							good-health, all climates might be rendered agreeable— You have a
							countryman arrived, I hear, said his Majesty— yes Sire.— <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas3">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones</persRef> (said
							he)—an acquaintance, I am told of <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Poinsett’s</persRef>— Yes Sire. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Poinsett carried home with him such agreeable
							ideas of his visit to Russia, that he inspired M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jones with the desire of visiting the same Country— And where did M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones see M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Poinsett— They
							returned in company together from Europe to America— what? Has M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones been in Europe before?— Yes, Sire—he has
							travelled in France, Italy and England.— What? and returned to Europe
							again?—perhaps, upon his private business?— Sire! he is a young man of
							Fortune; who travels for his pleasure, and to acquire instruction— After
							having been once in Europe, and returned home, the taste for traveling
							was not satiated, and he has come a second time— He must then have a
							strong taste for it indeed; for such a voyage as that is not like
							crossing the Neva— My Countrymen Sire, are so familiarized with the
							Ocean, that they think not much more of crossing it, than of going over
							a river— I enquired how his Majesty had enjoyed his health? perfectly
							well said he— And added with a significant smile—Ce ne sera pas le
							physique qui me tuera—ce sera le moral—upon which we parted— I collected
							from his last words, that there were subjects under his consideration,
							which gave him some concern— Walking afterwards upon the Quay I met
								<persRef ref="crichton-alexander">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

						<p><date>12. </date>About ten o’clock this morning, as I was preparing a
							letter to send by <persRef ref="donovan-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Donovan</persRef>, came the Messenger from the <persRef
								ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">Grand Maitre des Cérémonies</persRef>, to
							inform me that two ships would be launched at the Admiralty— The hour
							fixed for this, was half past twelve at Noon; but it would probably be
							about one— And the members of the Corps diplomatique were invited to
							attend if they pleased— Feeling uncertain where to go, and how to
							proceed, in order to be in the rule of etiquette, I called upon <persRef
								ref="navarro-rodrigo">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Navarro</persRef>, who
							had been at similar ceremonies before— He told me that being not very
							well he did not intend to go— But that in proceeding to the Admiralty, I
							should find there some of the Officers of the Department of the
							Ceremonies who would shew me, where the Corps Diplomatique were
							stationed— Navarro then told me what his errand was the other day when I
							met him at <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
							Romanzoff’s</persRef>— It was to announce the appointment of a Minister
							from the <persRef ref="john-vi">Prince Regent of Brazil</persRef> to
							this Court—a <persRef ref="u">Monsieur de Bedzara</persRef>; and he
							shewed me the answer which he had just received from Count Romanzoff, to
							this Communication. It express’d the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> great satisfaction, at receiving this
							information, and his determination to appoint a Minister to the Prince
							regent in return— This led us into some conversation, and I expressed to

							descended majestically upon the bosom of the flood. I found neither

							But I came to the Platform where the Emperor &amp; <persRef

							the Second ship S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Eustaphie, rush down upon the
							river, as advantageously as it could be seen any where. They were both
							seventy-four gun ships, and very finely built. The whole ceremony was

							Ceremonies Narishkin, who apologized for the lateness of his notice, and
							said he knew nothing of it himself untill last Night at Midnight.— I

							The division is in the author’s manner— John Baptist condemns the World

							The mutual opposition and condemnation of each other between Sanctity
							and Worldly-mindedness constitutes the partition of the whole discourse—
							It is not one of those studded with odd figures, and strangely applied

							at the same time three tickets for the Play at the Hermitage in the

								ref="jones-thomas3">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones</persRef> to the

								ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">M. de Maisonneuve</persRef> respecting
							the presentation of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones to the <persRef
								ref="nicholas-i;michael2">Grand Dukes</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="annapavlovna">Grand Duchess Ann</persRef>, after the Circle,
							when I found that the <persRef ref="catherinepavlovna">Grand Duchess
								Catherine</persRef> would also receive presentations. I therefore
							requested to be presented to her myself; and the same favour for all the
							gentlemen of the legation excepting M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. S. Smith,
							who declined— The Circle was held between one and two O’Clock, and all
							the Imperial family excepting the Grand Duchess-Catherine were present—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones was presented; as was a <persRef
								ref="fagnani-federigo">Count Fagnani</persRef> a Chamberlain of the
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> as king
							of Italy— After the Circle we waited about three quarters of an hour

								Watzdorf</persRef> the Saxon Minister, and <persRef
								ref="luxbourg-charles">Count Lüxbourg</persRef> as Bavarian Charge
							des Affairs had been presented to the young Grand Dukes and the Grand
							Duchess Ann; after which they returned, and we were all presented to the
							Grand-Duchess Catherine, and her husband <persRef ref="peter-friedrich"
								>Prince George of Holstein Oldenburg</persRef>, at their apartments—
							General Watzdorf and myself were presented separately, and the rest of
							the Gentlemen all together— The Grand-Duchess spoke of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Smith and <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Poinsett</persRef>; and asked some questions about
							America; whether I had lately heard from there, and how long it took for
							vessels to come— The Duke also who stood by her side made some
							observation which I scarcely remember— She is about the middle-size,
							with a beautiful countenance; expressive eyes, and a fascinating smile—
							It was nearly four O’Clock, when we returned <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>to</hi> from the Palace. And at half past-six immediately after
							dinner we went there again— About seven we went in to the Theatre at the
							Hermitage— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> and imperial
							family came about 8. they sat in a row of Chairs immediately behind the
							Orchestra. the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French
								Ambassador</persRef> sat in the same line the last person at the
							right hand of the Emperor, <pb n="173" type="ms"/>and next to the Grand
							Duke Michael— The Great Crown Officers and Ladies, with <persRef
								ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien</persRef> sat in chairs behind them and on the lowest range
							of benches forming the amphitheatre for the Spectators. For there are no
							boxes—the Ministers of the Corps Diplomatique sat on the right hand
							second row, and all the others were filled with the nobility of the
							Country—the men on the left side, and the women on the right. The french
							Opera of Cendrillon was performed for the first time— The music partly
							of <persRef ref="isouard-nicolo">Nicolo</persRef> the original composer;
							and partly of <persRef ref="steibelt-daniel">Stey belt</persRef>, set
							here—the play is splendid—the music agreable, and the ballets as usual.
								<persRef ref="duport-louis">Duport</persRef> danced very well— Two
							of the songs were encored by a signal from the <persRef
								ref="naryshkin-alexander">Grand Chambellan</persRef>, by the
							Emperor’s order— About 11. at Night the Opera was over, and we travelled
							over the Palace to view from the Emperor’s Apartments the fireworks—
							Those upon the Water did not well succeed; owing probably to the high
							wind that blew— There was a blue palace of lamps beyond the river—very
							well executed; and the bouquet or wheat-sheaf of rockets with which it
							concluded was handsome— About half-past twelve at Night it was all
							finished and we returned home— M. de Maisonneuve again repeated to me,
							that the Emperor himself had written the name of Miss Johnson as one of
							the persons to whom tickets for the Hermitage should be sent, and that
							it was a very extraordinary mark of distinction. M. de Maisonneuve was
							very attentive in accompanying the Ladies, after the Play, untill we
							left the Palace to come home.</p>

								Harris</persRef> called upon me this morning, and had some

								ref="donovan-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Donovan</persRef>— He has
							received the protest and letter which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Donovan
							left behind to be delivered to him; with which he is highly offended. I
							told him what had pass’d between M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Donovan and me
							upon this subject before his departure— As Donovan threatens both a
							publication in the American Newspapers, and to make a complaint against
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris to the Department of State, this
							Gentleman is naturally very much concerned, and not without some
							agitation at this state of things— I told him every thing of which
							Donovan had complained against him, excepting perhaps the most important
							incident, which requiring some delicacy in the Communication, I reserved
							for another occasion— He assured me that so far as respected himself he
							should have in his power the means of a complete justification— That
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Donovan’s charges against him were unjust,
							and unwarrantable, which he could prove, but as to the facts alledged by
							Donovan, he did not explicitly deny any of them— He declared his
							determination to prosecute him for a libel; and seemed to think he was
							punishable for having protested against him in his official capacity—
							They are indeed somewhat rigorous in their restrictions upon Notarial
							protests; but I told M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris that in our Country
							People were allowed to protest against almost every thing— With regard
							to the substance of Donovan’s complaints against the brothers Cramer, I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris, that in objects of controversy
							between individuals I never settled my opinion, upon hearing only one
							party; but that if Donovan’s story was true, I should consider him as an
							excessively ill-used man; and should be disposed to make great
							allowances for his very natural resentment— He said that the <persRef
								ref="krehmer-benedict;krehmer-sebastian">brothers Cramer</persRef>
							had treated him very ill, himself; so that he had broken off all social
							intercourse with them; especially with the elder brother Benedict— But
							that since they had received the protest and letter of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Donovan, and found them selves in difficulty, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> B. Cramer had written to him, and called upon
							him, to ask his assistance to defend them against M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Donovan’s charges— That as to the affair of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Donovan’s wines, he believed they would not find it easy to
							justify them entirely—They had under the appearance of a sale to
								<persRef ref="lopez-dionizio">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Lopez</persRef>, actually purchased the wines themselves—but he
							Harris, solemnly declares that he knew nothing about it, and rather more
							faintly, that he had not derived any profit from it— He is however
							perfectly confident of his own full justification— I had also some
							conversation with him respecting <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Symonds</persRef>, and the necessity of making some provision from
							the monies due to him, for the payment of his debts and support of his
							necessary expences— He promised to speak upon the subject to <persRef
