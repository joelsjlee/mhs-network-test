								>Bishop Butler’s</persRef> Sermon upon the same personage— I have

							Sermon in terms of very high approbation— I do not think so much of it
							myself— My father has so strong and reflecting a mind, that I always
							distrust my own judgment when it differs from his— But I think he
							overrates some of the books, which he first read in early life, and
							which opened to his mind philosophical views of nature, by no means
							uncommon, but which struck him most forcibly because they were new to
							him— Butler’s Balaam is a rough, unfinished and very imperfect sketch of
							a strange and mysterious character in the Bible— To illustrate that
							inconsistency of human nature, by which a man sees and approves the
							right, while he pursues the wrong— But it does not elucidate as I think
							it might the Story of Balaam, and it is written in a careless and
							slovenly style— It gives an exposition of a passage in the prophet
								<persRef ref="micah">Micah</persRef> respecting Balaam, which is at
							least questionable, and according to <persRef ref="osterwald-jean"
								>Ostervald’s</persRef> french Bible not admissible— I read also in

							last Monday, on her return to Twer.— As the principal part of the

							made no secret of their discoveries.— The perfection of the work here is
							certainly not equal to that of the workmen at Paris, but it requires

							appropriated for the <persRef ref="petergeorgepaulalexander">infant
								Prince</persRef>, and his Nurses and attendants— The steam and water
							baths here as elsewhere are in different apartments— The bathing tub is
							of tin, and fitted into the floor in the middle of the room. over it is

							poured when they choose it— The chapel is not yet consecrated; for which
							reason the Ladies were allowed to go into the Sanctuary— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Narishkin told us however that it was a rigorous rule of
							the Greek church never to admit a woman into the Sanctuary. I remarked
							nothing on this visit but what I had seen before— The music room is
							circular and not large— The Prince’s Cabinet is elegant but without
							magnificence— There are no Carpets on the floors; but a very beautiful
							parquet— In the library there is a looking glass of one plate seven
							arsheens (16 feet 4 inches) high, and three arsheens (7 feet) wide.—a
							very magnificent thing, but out of its place— The bed-chamber is hung
							round with loose hangings of dark green velvet— The bed in the center of
							the room between the two doors— The Curtains sloping from the head to
							the foot of the bed. Among the time pieces of which there is one in
							almost every room, that which pleased me most was with a bronze figure
							of a Venus with a little Cupid bursting from an egg-shell which she
							holds in her hands— There is on the Sopha’s and Chairs too much gilding
							for my taste— The porcelain is not very beautiful and there is not much
							of it— The Siberian vase of Agate is very large and was very much
							admired. After going over the Palace I walked to the Foundery, and in
							returning upon the Quay of the Neva, met the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef>; first on horseback, and the second time
							walking.— He then stop’d and spoke to me about the weather, and the
							appearance of the river— He asked me what was my habitual walk— I told
							him, commonly to the foundery— He asked where I lived— I told him in the
							New Street, in a Corner house partly fronting on the Moika— The
							Apartments in which <persRef ref="einsiedel-george">Count
								Einsiedel</persRef> had lived— He knew it by this description, and
							said the situation of the house was not good;—on account of walking— I
							said its situation was not remarkably advantageous; but that the walks
							in every part of the City were so convenient that it rendered the
							situation of a house almost immaterial— And pointing to the Quay on
							which we stood, I said it was one of the finest works ever made by men’s
							hands— He said they had a great advantage in possessing so much of the
							material, the granite rock; of which in Finland there were immense
							masses— That the rock on which the Statue of <persRef
								ref="peter-the-great">Peter the first</persRef> was placed, was one
							of the smallest of those rocks which could have been found— That it
							formed blocks of whole mountains, and that there were places where it
								<pb n="179" type="ms"/>was to be seen at once in both the stages of
							its first formation and of its last decay— I told him that I was
							acquainted with this Rock, and that my own Country produced it in great
							plenty— That it was considered as hardening and becoming more solid, by
							being exposed to the Air— He said it did for a certain period of time,
							after which it decayed, and crumbled into dust— But he added it would
							last a long time, and then looking at the wall bordering the quay,
							observed with a smile, “there is no danger for this, yet”— After I left
							him as I was walking home, I met and walked with <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>.— The
							Ladies went in the Evening to the Play— I spent it in reading <persRef

							His Aunt <persRef ref="naryshkin-anna">Madam Narishkin</persRef>, an old
							lady of eighty years of age lives there, and being infirm in health the
							Count passes much of his time with her— I told him I had requested to
							see him on account of a number of American vessels which had arrived at
							Revel, at Baltic Port, at Riga and at Liebau since the Navigation at
							Cronstadt to which they were bound has been closed— Several of them were
							in the first instance admitted without difficulty; but afterwards an
							order had been issued to suspend the admission of the rest, and to
							prevent the unloading of those which had been admitted untill further
							orders— That the persons interested in these vessels and cargoes were
							alarmed and uneasy under these difficulties, and some of them had
							applied to me for my interposition in their favour— The Count said he
							supposed that some suspicion might have arisen from the supposition that
							these vessels belonged to the great convoy of six hundred sail which had
							been so long signalized by the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef>, and which it was said had now entered the
							Baltic, coming from Gothenburg. I told him that they had actually come
							from Gothenburg, and probably belonged to that convoy— But I trusted he
							would not suspect me of attempting to shelter under the American name
							any traffic or property prohibited by the Laws of this Country— He said
							that he could hardly express to my face what he thought upon this
							subject; but it was certainly nothing distrustful of me— I then said
							that I had a list of these vessels which I was perfectly assured were
							bona-fide American— That I had received letters by several of them from
							my friends in America, of the most recent dates which had come to hand—
							That the Captain of one of them, the Supercargoes of several, and the
							owners of almost all were personally known to me as Citizens of the
							United States, and that with regard to them all I had such information
							as left me no doubt that they were really Americans, and that all proper
							Confidence might be given to their papers.— He desired me to write him
							unofficially a short letter on this subject, stating all these
							Circumstances, and intimated that the difficulties that had been raised
							would easily be removed; promising to lay the matter as soon as possible
							before the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>— He then entered
							into a general Conversation, and asked me to give him my candid Opinion
							upon the Emperor Napoleon’s tariff of 5. August last; and upon his
							decree for burning all merchandize of English manufacture— I did
							accordingly give him my opinion fully and freely with respect to both—
							The Count did not explicitly say that he agreed with me in opinion; <pb
								n="183" type="ms"/>but I am convinced he can hardly entertain a
							different one— He told me that he had received a Courier from Sweden,
							with the Account of the determination there to declare War against
							England, for which the french Minister had allowed only five days. We
							had also much Conversation upon the news—the armies in Portugal—the
								<persRef ref="george-iii">king of England’s</persRef> illness, and
							other common topics—not of sufficient interest to be written down. I was
							with him about two hours— On returning home I found <persRef
