								Jewett</persRef> called upon me this morning, and gave me the first
							information of the Death of the <persRef ref="louiseauguste">Queen of
								Prussia</persRef>— That all the Prussian Ports were interdicted to
							all American vessels, and that the French, Austrian and Westphalian
							Ministers had left Berlin— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jewett also asked my
							opinion with regard to the propriety of an American Citizen’s entering
							the service of Russia, intimating that he had such a disposition himself
							under the expectation that in case the war with Turkey should continue,
							there would be room for active service on the Black Sea, and if Peace
							should ensue, an opportunity to facilitate the commercial intercourse
							between the United States and that part of the world— I told him that so
							far as my own opinion went, I saw no impropriety in his purpose; and did
							not think much of the liberality of the principle, which would forbid
							every American Citizen from entering the Service of a foreign Sovereign
							in Amity with the United States— But I observed to him that this was not
							the prevailing opinion in America— If the newspaper accounts were to be
							credited a proposed <pb n="131" type="ms"/>for an Amendment to the
							Constitution of the United States, had passed by the requisite majority
							of both Houses of Congress, at their last Session, by which if it should
							become part of the Constitution, an American Citizen would forfeit his
							rights and character as such, by the mere act of entering into a foreign
							Service— Even if this project should not be adopted by three fourths of
							the State Legislatures, its passage by two thirds of both Houses of
							Congress was an indication of the prevailing current of popular opinion
							in America— He asked me whether I knew that it was a regulation in this
							Country that an Officer coming from a Republican service to enter that
							of Russia, must take a grade lower than that he had before held— I had
							not heard of any such rule— He said he had been told there was one,
							introduced during the reign of the <persRef ref="elizabethpetrovna"
								>Empress Elizabeth</persRef>— But he understood that an Officer who
							had been Aid de Camp to <persRef ref="eaton-william">General
								Eaton</persRef>, and as such ranked as Major, though he had only a
							Captain’s Commission, was admitted as a Major, into the Russian service—
							This to be sure would be a strong case, since Eaton himself never had
							any Commission Military, higher than a lieutenant, and was a General
							only of his own Creation. He added that he could not consent to enter
							this Service in a lower Station than that which he held in the service
							of the United States; where he was a Commander of a Sloop of War— It was
							impossible he should accept a lieutenant’s Commission, when he
							considered the general level of the Officers of that rank here.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jewett made an excuse for not dining with us this
							day, and brought one from <persRef ref="barthe-dominick">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							<persRef ref="osgood-thomas">Osgood</persRef>, <persRef ref="ashton-william"

									>r:</hi> Raimbert</persRef> came in after dinner, and confirmed
							the Accounts from Prussia— I walked out on the Moscow road, and measured
							a Werst in walking— I found it 1366 paces going, and 1375 returning— I
							had estimated it at 1334— In the Evening I received from the Grand
							Master of the Ceremonies <persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander"
								>Narishkin</persRef>, a notification of a Court mourning of six
							weeks, divided into two equal parts; for the Queen of Prussia—to
							commence to-morrow— <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine

							to return there soon. I wrote part of a letter to the <persRef

								ref="vonblome-otto">Baron de Blome’s</persRef> at Kammenoi Ostroff;
							with a company of about thirty-five persons— All the Corps Diplomatique,
							of the French alliance were there— <persRef ref="vlodek-alexandra"

							lately from Sweden by the way of Tornea told me that he had seen
								<persRef ref="regnard-jean">Regnard’s</persRef> Inscription, which
							was in a Church near the Lake of Tornea— But that Regnard and his
							companion were mistaken, in supposing themselves at the world’s end.
							They had mistaken the Lake of Tornea for the Sea— He himself had been
							two degrees farther North than Regnard, and <persRef
								ref="skjoldebrand-anders">General Skïoldebrand</persRef> had been to
							the North Cape, which was five degrees further North— I asked <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>

								Eugene</persRef>, said to have been written by himself— He says he

								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef>
							in <persRef ref="stroganov-alexander">Count Strogonoff’s</persRef>
							Garden on the Island; where we saw the tomb of <persRef ref="homer"
								>Homer</persRef>, and several other remarkable works of art— I
							particularly noticed a Statue of Granit, of very imperfect workmanship
							which I took to be of Egyptian and very early sculpture— And a Marble
							Statue of the Art in its highest perfection— A man on one knee,
							sharpening a knife upon a Stone. <pb n="132" type="ms"/>There are also
							before the House two Colossal Marble Statues, copies from Antiques; one
							of <persRef ref="hercules">Hercules</persRef>; and the other a Goddess
							with an oaken crown—perhaps <persRef ref="minerva">Minerva</persRef>—
							Count Strogonoff is the greatest friend and patron of the Arts, in this

							Wasili-Ostroff home— The sky and temperature of the atmosphere, have
							already the appearance of Autumn.</p>

							Country Seat—it is opposite the Convent of Noble young Ladies, above the

							about five Miles; which in ascending the stream, rowing at the same time
							against the wind took us two hours— We found M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Krehmer and all his family were gone out; to a party at their neighbour
								<persRef ref="kotschubey-victor">Count Kotschubey’s</persRef>; who

								ref="bailey-daniel;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs:</hi> Bailey</persRef>, their brother and Sister in Law—
							After passing about an hour there, we returned in the boat, and landed
							at the Corner of the Winter Palace, whence we walked home— We came down
							in about half an hour; muffled in Surtouts and wadded pelisses— I read
								<persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> funeral Oration
							upon <persRef ref="louisdauphin">Louis</persRef> the Dauphin, Son of
								<persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>— History represents this
							prince, as brave; benevolent, indolent and voluptuous— The bishop of
							Clermont makes him a model of perfection;—though indeed he does give a
							transient glance at the irregularities of his early life— There is in
							this Discourse another bitter invective, against <persRef
								ref="william-iii">William 3</persRef>. and a character of him, drawn
							in a few lines, and with great spirit— Piteous lamentations at the
							reverse of France’s Fortune’s, which are astonishing to the Bishop
							considering the piety of Louis le Grand; who had taken away the high
							places— That is, who had revoked the Edict of Nantes— So that in
							Massillon’s opinion the persecution of Protestants, gave Louis Le Grand,
							a fair claim to the interposition of the Almighty; that he might enjoy
							perpetual victory over Protestants. His only conclusion is that the Sins
							of the Nation <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi> have more than
							counterbalanced the merits of the king; and that to punish them, he
							afflicts the man after his own heart (Louis 14) with disasters— So much
							for preaching politicks— Yet Massillon constantly preaches Christian
							humility—the forgiveness of injuries and conflict with the world— There
							is even an excellent passage in this spirit, relating to the death of
							the Emperor, then at War with France— There are also fine Characters of
							the <persRef ref="montausier-charles">Duke de Montausier</persRef> and
							of <persRef ref="bossuet-jacques">Bossuet</persRef>, the Instructors and
							Governor’s of the Dauphin’s Youth. <persRef ref="beauvilliers-paul"
								>Beauvilliers</persRef> and <persRef ref="fenelon-francois"
								>Fenelon</persRef>, are only mentioned with honour.— This is the
							anniversary of the day when we sailed from Charlestown, for S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg— The year has flown swiftly away— And
							as of all former years, I have not improved it as I ought. The
							opportunity to do essential good, has not yet occurr’d— Let me yet
							implore the father of Spirits; for the occasion—for the resolution,
							perseverance and skill to improve it; and for the success which he alone
							can give in reward of good intents, which he alone can inspire.</p>

							American vessels from the Russian Ports— This is most likely, and the

							something had occurr’d between the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> and Count Romanzoff, which had produced some
							coolness towards the Count—who by some interference at the army had
							prevented <persRef ref="kamensky-nikolay">General Kamensky</persRef>
							from making peace with the Turks— He further adds that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Borel told him the Emperor very lately said in a private

							day disconcerted my regular plan, and gave me grounds for expecting it
							will be still more discomposed.</p>

								<persRef key="adams-thomas">brother</persRef> only to the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of February. A <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Symonds</persRef>, called upon me from Archangel, upon some private
							business of his own— So that I was engaged unavoidably untill the
							instant when by appointment I was to call upon <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>— I was even
							delayed by it as much as a quarter of an hour later than the time he had
							fixed— On arriving at his house, I found he was gone out, (or otherwise
							engaged) and was desired to call again in an hour— I went in the mean
							time to <persRef ref="raimbert-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Raimbert</persRef>, and
							requested of him the information for M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Kettell, to
							forward to him by the first mail to Sweden— I returned at the expiration
							of the hour to Count Romanzoff, whom I now found, and who apologized to
							me for his absence when I had first called. I immediately began my
							making to the Count the Representations in behalf of the Americans, who
							had written from Archangel to obtain my interposition in their favour.
							The admission of all vessels, direct from the Ports of Portugal in
							Europe, was prohibited here, by an ordinance of 22. May last.— These
							vessels sailed from Lisbon, at a time when this Ordinance could not be
							known there— They have Cargoes, which would sell at very high prices if
							admitted, and which must in part perish if sent away— I urged as
							forcibly to the Count as I could that these Circumstances ought
							equitably to considered as operating to take these vessels out of the
							purview of the Imperial Ordinance— The Count however, as I expected was
							inflexible; and gave the obvious answers to my arguments— That the
							measure was general, and arose from the State of the War— That
							particular exceptions upon the grounds I had stated could not be
							admitted— That individual hardships must accrue from every such measure
							of extensive operation, and that there was no way to prevent them— I
							then stated the particular circumstances of the “three Sisters,” one of
							the two vessels, which sprung a leak, and must be repaired before she
							can go away—suggesting the motives of humanity for granting a permission
							to sell at least enough of her Cargo to pay for the necessary expences
							of these repairs— The Count requested me to write to him upon this
							particular case, which should be taken into consideration— I spoke to
							him further respecting the affair of Captain Symonds; with which he was
							already acquainted— He said that as there had been a difference of
							opinion between the Commission at Archangel, and the Procureur, who was
							an Officer appointed immediately under the Minister of Justice, two
							persons had been specially appointed by order of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> to go to Archangel, and to
							decide upon the business— He took however the attestation from the
							Commission, which I had received from Captain Symonds, and carried with
							me, which he promised to examine with due attention— The Count as soon
							as possible made the conversation general, and with the preliminary
							caution, which he always takes in inviting me to free Conversation, that
							he wished me to consider him as laying aside altogether the Chancellor
							of the Empire, and conversing merely as an individual, he asked <pb
								n="134" type="ms"/>asked me to give him my advice; what was to be
							done, to restore freedom and security to commerce in the world. I told
							him with the same reservation that setting aside all official character
							and responsibility, and speaking merely as an individual speculating
							upon public affairs, the advice I should give to his Excellency was as
							soon as possible to convince the French Government, that the Continental
							System as they called it, and as they managed it was promoting to the
							utmost extent the views of England; was instead of impairing her
							Commerce, securing to her that of the whole world, and was pouring into
							her lap the means of continuing the War, just as long as her Ministers
							should think it expedient— But I said I could hardly conceive that the
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> was so
							blind as not to have made this discovery already— Three years
							experience, with the effects of it becoming every day more flagrant had
							made the inference too clear and unquestionable. The Emperor Napoleon
							with all his power, could neither controul the Elements, nor the
							Passions of Mankind— He had found that <persRef ref="louis-i">his own
								brother</persRef> could not, and would not carry his system into
							Execution, and finally had cast at his feet the crown he had given him,
							rather than continue to be his instrument there any longer— That Country
							was now united to France; but the trade with England would be carried on
							as before, and the only difference would be an increase of contribution
							to pay some more French Custom-house Officers— The Count partly
							questioned the accuracy of my Statement, respecting the commercial
							prosperity of England, but admitted it in the general— He said too that
							as long as a system was agreed to be pursued, he thought exceptions from
							it ought not to be allowed— I asked him how that was possible in the
							present case, when the Emperor Napoleon himself was the first to make
							such exceptions, and to give licences for a direct trade with England.
							He said he thought all such licences wrong; and he believed there were
							not so many of them as was pretended— There was indeed one case here, of
							a vessel coming both with an English licence, and a licence from the
							Emperor Napoleon— He was of opinion that she ought to be confiscated for
							having the English licence— But the French commercial &amp; diplomatic
							agents were very desirous that she might go free, on account of her
							French Licence, and perhaps the Emperor in consideration of his ally
							might so determine— He complained bitterly that all the antient
							established principles both of commercial and political rectitude had in
							a manner vanished from the world, and observed with all her iniquities
							England had yet this advantage over her neighbours of having hitherto
							most successively resisted all the innovations upon antient principles
							and Establishments— For his part, since he had been at the head of
							affairs here, he could sincerely protest that one wish had been at the
							bottom of all his policy, and the aim of all his labours— And that was
							universal Peace— The Peace with Sweden had been made— That of Austria
							had succeeded; but it seemed by some fatality the instant one Peace was
							made the dearest aim of some people and their indefatigable labour was
							to make another War— He asked me what I thought would be the effect in
							England, of this reunion of Holland with France— Some People he said
							were of opinion that it would produce a great sensation— I said I did
							not expect so— I believed that the British Ministry, and the thinking
							men of the Nation would be pretty much of the <persRef
								ref="champagny-jean">Duke de Cadore’s</persRef> opinion, that since
							the Union of Belgium with France, the system of Holland must necessarily
							be that of her mighty neighbour, and would feel quite indifferent
							whether that member of the French Empire, was under the administration
							of king Louis Napoleon, or under that of the Arch Treasurer <persRef
								ref="lebrun-charles">Duke of Plaisance</persRef>— From various other
							hints, I inferred however that this new arrangement was by no means
							pleasing to the Count, and of course I presume not to the Emperor. The
							Count observed also that the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king
								of Prussia</persRef> had been compelled to shut his Ports against
							American vessels, which he supposed was a momentary impulse of the
							Emperor Napoleon to prevent his brother Louis from going to America— I
							told him I believed it was a measure to which he had been instigated by
							an English <pb n="135" type="ms"/>influence, operating upon his custom
							house Officers— It was well known that English vessels and English
							Cargoes, were admitted with the utmost freedom and facility, on payment
							of a sufficient per centum to the french Officers— As long as American
							vessels were openly admitted they could not be laid under this
							contribution— The English traders were thus subject to a disadvantage in
							the competition of the market; by their instigations the french Officers
							represented to their Government that the prohibited English trade was
							carried on under American Colours, and so the king of Prussia is forced
							to issue an order, excluding American vessels from his Ports—
							Notwithstanding which I was informed that private letters from merchants
							gave assurances that they might come as heretofore, and would be
							admitted on payment of the tax— I added that I hoped we had nothing of
							the same kind to apprehend here— The Count said that far from it, they
							should be glad to give every possible facility to the <hi rend="italic"
								>direct</hi> Commerce between the United States and this Country;
							and that he would cheerfully agree to any proper measure to promote its
							further extension.— But as to the trade with their Enemies, that being
							forbidden, measures of restriction, necessary to prevent it, must
							necessarily sometimes occasion inconvenience to real neutrals, and they
							were obliged to extend the same restrictions to their own subjects— I
							said that with regard to the imperial ordinances prohibiting trade with
							England, this was a subject, with which I could have no authority to
							interfere, and in respect to which I could claim no indulgence. It was
							the direct trade alone for which I was sollicitous—a trade I flattered
							myself as useful and advantageous to Russia, as to the United States— I
							had heard that the Danes irritated perhaps at the loss of their Sound
							duties, occasioned by the blockade of Elseneur, were endeavouring to
							obtain the exclusion of our vessels here; and perhaps some
							representations had been made, by their diplomatic agents here, to that
							effect— He said he had not heard of any— That if our vessels could
							escape the pursuit of the Danish privateers, Russia was under no
							obligation whatsoever to guarantee the payment of Sound duties to the
								<persRef ref="frederick-vi">king of Denmark</persRef>— The right to
							those duties arose solely from circumstances of locality, and the
							perception of the duties must be accomplished by Denmark’s own means of
							execution— At the conclusion of this conference, which lasted about two
							hours, and in which with the utmost freedom, and earnestness I urged to
							the Count the total inefficacy of the pretended continental system, to
							accomplish its professed objects, and the necessity of convincing France
							that such is the case, I mentioned to him the intention of <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Everett</persRef>
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray to visit Moscow, and requested letters
							for them, which he promised to furnish— He enquired whether <persRef
								ref="smith-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. S. Smith</persRef> was
							yet there, and I informed him that he was gone to the great Fair of
							Makarief— On returning home, I wrote to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hellen,
							in answer to his letter, received this morning, and sent the packet,
							with the manuscripts concerning the trade of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg, and the Accounts furnished by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Raimbert</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>, to be
							forwarded to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Roberts</persRef>—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray, after dinner, sent for his newspapers,
							and the copy of my lectures which he had received— He had learnt from
							the Papers, an account of the arrival of <persRef
								ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Count Pahlen</persRef> at Philadelphia,
							which I immediately after dinner, communicated in a note to Count
							Romanzoff— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris came and spent an hour with me
							this Evening.— Excepting while he was here, I was from dinner time,
							untill past two in the Morning, absorbed in the perusal of my own
							lectures, without a conception of the lapse of time; untill at the close
							of the first volume, upon looking at my watch, I saw with astonishment
							the hour— What a portion of my life would I give, if they could occasion
							the same accident to one other human being— But they are now upon their
							trial in the world— And I pray that I may be duly prepared for
							resignation to their Fate—whether of total neglect; of malicious
							persecution—or of deserved condemnation— The first I do not expect— The
							second is so certain, that my principal difficulty will be in discerning
							between it and the third, which if it should come, will mortify my
							Vanity, but even then may have an useful influence upon my heart— By
							teaching me the lesson of <hi rend="italic">humility</hi>.— A lesson
							which I sorely want, and which I pray God to give me the grace to learn—
							These lectures are the measure of my powers; moral and intellectual— In
							the composition of them I spared no labour, and omitted no exertion of
							which I was capable— I shall never, unless by some special favour of
							Heaven, accomplish any Work of higher elevation or more extensive
							compass—</p>

						<p><date>17. </date>I had this morning a succession of visitors who kept me

									ref="barthe-dominick">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Barthe</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="u">Captain Symonds</persRef>— Count Rzewuski and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six, are on the point of departure; the former
							for Vienna, and the latter for Paris— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six told
							me that his Instructions had been to return to the Empire; but that he
							had hesitated whether to go directly to Paris untill the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador</persRef> of his own accord
							advised him to go— He had then observed that perhaps the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> might perhaps be
							displeased at his going there; upon which the Ambassador told him he
							would give him a letter to the <persRef ref="champagny-jean">Duke de
								Cadore</persRef>; from which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six concludes
							that the Ambassador has instructions to send him to Paris. He told me
							also that he had talked with the Ambassador concerning our affairs— That
							he could now say with certainty what he had before hinted to me, that
							probably much of the difficulty of our situation with France, arose from
							the dislike which <persRef ref="armstrong-john">our Minister</persRef>
							there, had incurr’d of the French Government— That the Ambassador
							himself would freely converse with me upon the subject if I wished it—
							That he was persuaded if <hi rend="small-caps">I</hi> was there,
							the differences between the two Countries would soon be arranged to our
							satisfaction— He entered into some detail to convince me that I was the
							only person who could accomplish this, and seemed to expect that I
							should write all this in substance to the Government of the United
							States— I told him that I was much obliged to the Ambassador, for his
							good opinion of me, and that as to himself, as he was going to Paris, if
							he should find any occasion upon which he could serve our Cause, I
							should be grateful to him on my own account as well as on that of my
							Country— That however well I might think of my own qualifications to
							succeed in making an arrangement between the United States and France,
							there was too little prospect of the possibility of such success, not to
							make me very reluctant at the idea of being employed to undertake it; as
							there was certainly no person in the United States, to whom a failure of
							such a Negotiation would be personally so injurious as to me— That I had
							reason besides to suppose that the American Government would prefer
							keeping me here sometime longer, and sending some other Minister in case
							General Armstrong should go home. That in the relative situation in
							which I stood with General Armstrong, I could not in delicacy transmit
							to the American Government, any general intimation that he was obnoxious
							to that of France, and that although he had heretofore hinted to me that
							this was the case, I did not even now know what General Armstrong’s
							Offence had been— He said they did not impeach his integrity; but that
							he was morose, and captious, and petulant— Now I am afraid that under
							the Circumstances in which the General has been there, the last three
							years, they would have had quite as much reason to be dissatisfied on
							such grounds with me, as they can have with him— And I am sure I should
							think it very ill treatment from him, if upon such vague and loose
							pretences he should transmit to the Government a complaint that I was
							thought morose, captious or petulant, with suggestions that he himself
							was the fittest man to take my place— I do not suspect M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Six of any ill design in this affair, for I believe him
							sincerely and cordially my friend, and that of America— Neither do I
							incline to suspect the Ambassador; I suppose him to be indifferent upon
							the subject; and rather to have fallen in with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Six’s opinions than to have spoken from any particular Instructions to
							himself— My own course upon this occasion is plain— To be silent— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six asked me for another Copy of my letter to
								<persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Otis</persRef>,
							of which I had already given him one— I gave it him, and also a Copy of
							the Review of <persRef ref="ames-fisher">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Ames’s</persRef> works— He promised me if any thing should occur at
							Paris, which might be of importance to American Affairs, and which might
							be useful for me to know, he would directly or indirectly give me
							information of it— He goes next Tuesday. <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Symonds</persRef> was in trouble about his Servant who was stop’d
							here, just as he was on the point of departure for Archangel— But I
							could give him no assistance. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Boucher brought me some books on Coins, weights and
							measures which he lent me— He said he should resume his course of
							lectures the latter end of next Month; and complained that the
							Ambassador, with whom he dined yesterday had told him avec un ton qui ne
							lui convenait peut-être pas, that in his programme for the public<hi
								rend="strikethrough">ation</hi> exhibition, there was a gross
							grammatical error— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray came to take leave, and

						<p><date>19. </date>I was unwell yesterday and this day; though not so much
							as to confine myself to this house— I began again the minutes in
							writing, on perusal of the New Testament. And finished a letter which I
							began yesterday to <persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gray</persRef>, at Boston— I read <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon’s</persRef> funeral Oration, upon Madame, the mother of
								<persRef ref="philippe-ii">Philip</persRef> Duke of Orleans, Regent
							of France, during the minority of <persRef ref="louis-xv">Louis
								15</persRef>. It is remarkable that this Discourse does not even
							give the name of the Princess in honour of whom it was delivered; and
							with regard to her Country, only mentions that she came from Germany—
							Her name was <persRef ref="elizabethcharlotte">Charlotte
								Elisabeth</persRef> of Bavaria. She was the second wife of Monsieur,
							only brother of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>. His first
							wife was Henrietta of England, Sister to <persRef ref="charles-ii"
								>Charles 2</persRef>.— This is the last of the Bishop’s funeral
							Orations, and they are not in any respect those of his works which do
							him the most honour— They are all funeral Sermons, and the uniformity of
							partition, as well as the great sameness in the topics of Eulogy,
							renders them somewhat tedious— A form of encomium which recurs much too
							frequently is a very severe general remark upon Princes or Grandees, for
							the purpose of exempting from that particular censure the person whose
							panegyric he is pronouncing— Thus he can never tell his auditory that
							Madame, or Louis le Grand or <persRef ref="louisdauphin">Monseigneur le
								Dauphin</persRef>, were affectionate to their kindred, without
							adding that kings and Princes in general have no bowels for their family
							relations— He cannot claim for them the credit of any one virtue,
							without accusing all persons of their condition, of its opposite vice—
							This is cheap flattery, and not very severe morality. There is high
							encomium in this Discourse upon the Regent, Duke of Orleans, who was
							present to hear it; &amp; who little deserved it. I also read this
							Evening <persRef ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef> character of
								<persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>— Evening walk, in a shower— The
							Nights are rapidly lengthening.</p>

							“C’est d’abord un très galant homme[”]—said the Ambassador—but he never
							shews himself—and upon every little occasion, when by a verbal

							peevish Notes— This is much the same thing as what <persRef

						<p><date>26. </date>My intention is to attend every Sunday, at some one of
							the places of public worship, and to devote a proper portion of that day
							to occupations, meditations and studies suitable to it— Yet for several
							months past I have suffered myself to be diverted from a great part of
							this purpose—for more than three Months, I have not visited a church,
							and the devotion of the day has been confined to the perusal of one
							Sermon of <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef>, and perhaps
							a few pages of <persRef ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef>
							Scripture characters. This day I had destined to some thing more, but
							scarcely had I risen from breakfast, when a large packet of American
							Newspapers was brought to me, from Cronstadt—forwarded by <persRef
								ref="young-alexander">Young</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="minns-thomas">Minns</persRef>— I had not looked them over, when
							a letter from Archangel, with two dispatches from the <persRef
								ref="smith-robert">Secretary of State</persRef>, and more newspapers
							were brought me— The composure and tranquility of mind which my purpose
							required was now unsettled for this time, and I spent the day, as I have
							done so many others—upon worldly cares—only reading the first of
							Massillon’s Sermons on a Religious Profession—that is on a Nun’s taking
							the veil; and Robinson’s Character of <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef>. The abstraction from temporal passions and
							affairs, and the attention to religious concerns recommended by both
							these writers, and equally appropriate to the subjects of their
							discourses had not sufficient influence upon my mind. Rebel Nature holds
							out more than half my heart— In the Evening I walked in the Summer
							Gardens, and on my return home, met <persRef ref="ashton-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Ashton</persRef> and <persRef ref="plumer-ernestus"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Plummer</persRef> going from my house—

								Harris</persRef> was here this forenoon, and again after dinner,
							with letters from Archangel, and complaints of Masters and Supercargoes
							of American vessels that they cannot get admitted— <persRef
								ref="smith-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. S. Smith</persRef>
							dined with us— At 8. O’Clock in the Evening I went to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> according to his
							appointment— I first mentioned to him the despatches which I had
							received on the subject of <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Daschkoff’s</persRef> application to the Government of
							the United States in relation to a trade between the United States, and
							a Russian Settlement on the North-West Coast of America— But I told him
							I was referred to Documents forwarded by another opportunity, and which
							I had not yet received.— He said he had also received despatches from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Daschkoff, stating that his application had
							been favourably received by the Government of the United States— That
							they had a growing settlement on the North-West Coast of America, and
							that from it a profitable trade might be carried on to China— That they
							had sent two vessels there, under the command of <persRef
								ref="krusentern-adam">Captain Krusenstern</persRef>, which had gone
							from there to Canton— Canton was a Port open to all the Nations of
							Europe; but the Russians who were specially favoured by the Chinese
							Government had an exclusive trade with them, carried on at a place
							called <hi rend="italic">Yakta</hi>— But the Chinese had refused to
							admit Captain Krusenstern’s ships at Canton, upon the <hi rend="italic"
								>pretext</hi> that as the Russian trade with them had long been
							carried on with exclusive privileges at Yakta, they supposed that if the
							Russians meant to change the channel of trade, they would have given
							them notice of it— And as they had heard nothing about <pb n="143"
								type="ms"/>such vessels coming to Canton, they could not tell,
							whether they were really Russians or not— There had been the Count said,
							some <hi rend="italic">Sheets</hi> pass’d between the two Governments
							since on the subject, but the convulsed state of Europe and other
							objects of so much greater magnitude had so absorbed his attention that
							they had not yet come to any arrangement with China, for the admission
							of Russian vessels at Canton— He had therefore wished that the trade
							from the Russian Settlement on the North-West Coast of America, to
							China, might be carried on by the Americans— And as the Settlement
							itself was in the neighbourhood of Indians, who were sometimes
							troublesome and dangerous neighbours to it, he had thought an
							arrangement might be concerted with the United States, under which the
							Americans might have the trade of the settlement, under a restriction
							not to furnish warlike weapons and instruments to the neighbouring
							Indians— I told him I collected from the papers which I had received,
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Daschkoff was not specifically instructed,
							as to the limits within which it was wished that the Restriction should
							be extended, and asked him whether he could point them out to me— He
							said that it would require some consideration; but that their maps
							included the whole of Nootka sound, and down to the mouth of Columbia
							River, as part of the Russian possessions.— By way of digression the
							Count explained to me the <hi rend="italic">mode</hi> of their
							Negotiations with China; which is by sending <hi rend="italic"
								>sheets</hi>, as they call it; the correspondence is in the name of
							the <hi rend="italic">Senate</hi>; addressed to an Assembly of a like
							Nature in China; and their sheets are also address’d to the Senate here;
							who however never see them; and never have any thing to do with the
							negotiations— At one period of the reign of <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Catherine 2</persRef>— The Chinese sent her
							a sheet to tell her that a Governor of one of the Russian Provinces
							bordering upon them, was a<hi rend="italic">bad man</hi>. In consequence
							of this she ordered an enquiry to be made into his conduct, and found
							that their complaints were well grounded— The officer was therefore
							immediately removed, and the Chinese were informed that the Empress had
							thus proceeded with just attention to their complaints. This compliance
							however only made them insolent, they sent another sheet, to say that
							the removal of the offending Governor was not sufficient; but that he
							must be empaled and his skin sent to them by way of atonement— The
							Empress was so shock’d at this barbarous and insulting message, that she
							immediately issued an Edict, prohibiting all her subjects from having
							any intercourse with the Chinese whatsoever, and this prohibition
							continued eight or nine years in force— As the trade was a very
							advantageous one to the Chinese, they became soon very anxious for its
							restoration, which they solicited during the whole of that time; untill
							the Empress, like a person who finally becomes weary of resentment
							consented to the restoration of the trade. Since then, and even now the
							Chinese practiced a sort of coquetting affectation of indulgence to the
							Russians— Very lately as I might have seen by the newspapers some of
							their highest characters, and even a Governor of one of their Provinces
							had come to a Russian town on the frontiers, and had attended at the
							celebration of the Mass— It had even given rise to a laughable
							circumstance. The Chinese Governor, who had heard the whole ceremony
							performed, standing, was so much delighted with the singing, that he had
							asked for an instructor, who could teach his son to sing one of those
							songs— And they had accordingly furnished him a singing Master, who had
							taught the young man, not the Mass, but some Russian Songs, which he had
							learnt to sing, very well.— I now recurred to the cases of the American
							vessels which have arrived at Archangel and at Cronstadt, to whose
							admission so many difficulties and delays have been opposed— I urged the
							necessity of a very speedy decision concerning them, stating the
							certainty that they would be detained for the Winter unless that
							decision should take place in the course of a very few days—that in
							every case it would be extremely injurious to the adventurers to be thus
							detained, and in many cases equivalent to a total loss of the voyage— I
							urged in particular that the Navigation from Archangel would probably be
							closed within a month or six weeks— That from the length of the voyages,
							both in coming and returning of American vessels, made a longer time
							necessary for them to remain in Port than for others, and pleaded
							equitably for a peculiar attention of dispatch in their behalf— That
							after their admission they must yet have time to dispose of the Cargoes
							they had brought, and to purchase Cargoes for their return; none of
							which business could be transacted, while they were left in suspense,
							whether they should be finally admitted at-all. That possibly <persRef
								ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron Campenhausen</persRef>, whom I had
							not the honour of being personally acquainted with, and with whom if I
							did know him, it might perhaps be improper for me to have any
							conversation upon these subjects, might entertain suspicions in relation
							to many American vessels, owing to the extraordinary numbers of them
							which had arrived during the present Season— But the fact was that a
							number far beyond that of any preceding year had really arrived both
							here, and at Archangel; coming directly from the United States, and
							destined to return directly thither— That I had anticipated this <pb
								n="144" type="ms"/>Event, and as he knew, had announced it to him,
							as infallible, so long ago as last Winter— That the Causes of it were
							the obstructions to our Commerce, which it experienced in almost every
							other quarter— The suspension of it by our own Laws in the preceding
							years; and above all the encouragement which our merchants had derived
							from the peculiar favour which his <persRef ref="alexander-i">Imperial
								Majesty</persRef> had been pleased to manifest towards the United
							States— From my private advices, and from the complexion of the
							newspapers which I had received down to the middle of June, I knew that
							the exclusions which we were now subject to, in Prussia, Mecklenburg,
							and as I expected to learn by to-morrow’s Post, in all the Ports of
							Holstein, were all expected in America—but many of our Merchants in all
							the Sea Ports had said, happen to us what will elsewhere, at least we
							are sure of being well received in Russia.— That I hoped Baron
							Campenhausen would be made sensible of these Circumstances and of the
							essential importance to so many of my Countrymen, that they should be
							immediately admitted— I added that this would be still more urgent for
							all those who might yet arrive before the close of the Season— That I
							had received numerous letters, and from a variety of persons, all
							meeting with the same difficulties; and every one thinking that there
							were particular Circumstances in his case, which would entitle him to
							special indulgences and exemptions— I was unwilling to trouble him with
							each of these cases separately, as I wished them all to participate in
							the same advantage, and was desirous of sparing him the tediousness of
							particular details.— That I had already had the honour of addressing to
							him a note, respecting the vessels which had arrived from Lisbon— That
							the Supercargo of a vessel arrived at Archangel from New-York, had
							written to me, to ask whether a special order for his admission could
							not be obtained on account of his having brought dispatches to me, and
							also to this Government from M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Daschkoff— The
							Count said this was undoubtedly Evidence that the vessel came from the
							United States; and he had in other instances alledged it as such
							himself— But it could not be evidence either of the nature of the Cargo,
							or that the vessel was not last from some Port of Great-Britain— That it
							could not be therefore a sufficient foundation for a special order— I
							then observed that in dwelling so earnestly upon the wish that I had
							expressed, I flattered myself I was promoting the interests of his
							Majesty’s Empire, as much as those of my own Country— That the number of
							American vessels which had come here, and the quantities of the Russian
							productions which they wanted to take in return, were highly favourable
							to the agriculture and the manufactures of this Country— That they gave
							encouragement to its Industry, and contributed more than any thing to
							support the course of its exchange. Such were the obvious effects of the
							vessels which had arrived; but I thought it unnecessary to press this
							argument much, as I was persuaded His Excellency knew better than I did
							how strongly it was supported by the fact— The Count said he well knew
							that it was exactly so— That he had been hitherto the Minister of
							Commerce; but that a new arrangement had been made, by which, all
							business of this nature was transferred to Baron Campenhausen. That he
							must do him the justice to say he was an officer of great activity, and
							dispatched business as fast as he could— But he was extremely apt to
							entertain suspicions, and possibly some delays might arise from this
							Circumstance— He the Count was fully sensible of the weight and Justice
							of the observations I had made to him— He would immediately make a
							minute of it, in writing, (which he did) and would write to-morrow
							morning to Baron Campenhausen pressing the subject in a special manner
							upon his attention— I observed that my Countrymen felt an extraordinary
							anxiety at these unusual detentions, from remarking their coincidence,
							with the ordinances of Prussia, Mecklenburg, &amp; Denmark, excluding us
							from their Ports, and from an apprehension that the same influence under
							which it was known that those orders had been issued might be exerted
							even here— He assured me in the most solemn manner <pb n="145" type="ms"
							/>that I might rely upon it there was no foundation for these
							apprehensions. That the Emperor’s Sentiments and intentions with regard
							to the United States remained unaltered— But he asked me whether a
							favourable change had not taken place in the State of our Relations with
							France— I said that France had partially opened her Ports to the United
							States. He said he believed there was something still more recent, and
							that a sort of agreement had been entered into, between France and
							England, for the allowance of commerce in certain Articles, by means of
							neutral vessels— I had not heard of this; but I observed that in the
							midst of all these violent ill offices which France was doing to us, her
							Government was making the most solemn asseverations of the best possible
							dispositions, and the most friendly sentiments towards us— That I had
							within this week or fortnight received such assurances from the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef> here; while at
							the same time the Mecklenburg and Danish orders for excluding our
							vessels from all their Ports, were coming out— The French Government too
							had issued a declarations that the French Consuls in the United States
							no longer delivered any Certificates of Origin; and therefore that all
							papers purporting to be of that description, produced by the Masters of
							American vessels in the Baltic must be forgeries— But nothing could be
							more false than this assertion— All the vessels coming from the United
							States, brought certificates of origin given by the French Consuls, and
							I had myself delivered to <persRef ref="lesseps-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lesseps</persRef> a letter from the French Consul in
							Boston, informing him that he had given such a certificate to the Master
							of the vessel which sailed the latest of any that have yet arrived— In
							the order to exclude American vessels which they had made the Duke of
							Mecklenburg sign, that Prince had committed himself to an assertion
							equally wide from the truth— He affirms that for a long time no colonial
							articles have been exported from the United States— This was sporting
							with the common sense of mankind in a manner almost unparalleled— The
							Count replied that it was indeed extraordinary— And with regard to the
							Certificates of Origin, he had remarked that the declaration asserted
							the French Consuls had not delivered any, depuis quelque tems—an
							expression so vague that it might mean a week or a year, and could
							warrant no inference to falsify any such papers yet produced— With
							regard to this system of restriction, the Count seemed to me more than
							ever convinced of its inefficacy, and prepared at least in his own mind,
							to give it up— He asked me whether I had heard the news from Sweden— I
							told him I had heard it rumoured that the Prince of Ponte Corvo,
								<persRef ref="charles-xivjohn">General Bernadotte</persRef>, was
							elected Crown-Prince— He said it was true— That there was a Courier
							coming to him with the account of this Event, who had not yet arrived—
							But another Courier had— It was a most unaccountable thing in itself,
							and in the manner of its accomplishment— The Emperor Alexander, had
							determined that he would in no wise interfere in this election, or
							manifest his sentiments in an affair so interesting to his neighbours,
							untill after the conclusion— The <persRef ref="frederickchristian"
								>Prince of Augustenburg</persRef>, brother of the late <persRef
								ref="charles-august">Crown Prince</persRef>, had in the first
							instance been unanimously elected; or at most there had been in the
							secret Committee but one single vote for the Prince of Ponte-Corvo— As
							the <persRef ref="frederick-vi">king of Denmark</persRef> had proposed
							himself as one of the Candidates, and had written to the <persRef
								ref="charles-xiii">king of Sweden</persRef>, requesting that he
							would nominate him, the Duke of Augustenburg unwilling to offend his
							brother in Law, and benefactor, the king of Denmark had not absolutely
							accepted; but neither had he positively refused. After his Answer the
							king of Sweden had proposed, and the diet had resolved to renew the
							offer, and urge the Duke’s acceptance of it— A Courier had been sent to
							him with this second proposal; but before his answer could be received
							they had proceeded again to an election, and chosen the Prince of
							Ponte-Corvo— It was strange enough to see kingdoms given away, by third
							parties; but to see a nation thus give itself away, was inconceivable—
							He asked me what I thought would be the sentiment about it in England— I
							said I believed it would give great displeasure in England, but that it
							appeared to me the king of Denmark had most reason to be displeased with
							the issue— I enquired finally of the Count, whether he had any late
							accounts from the army in Turkey— He said, none since the Te Deum— I
							complimented him upon the successes of the Campaign hitherto— He said
							that <persRef ref="kamensky-nikolay">General Kamenskoy</persRef> had
							certainly distinguished himself and given great proofs of military
							talents— I observed that we Americans were neutrals in this War— And
							that he knew the fundamental principle of our Policy, was to take no
							part in the great political affairs of Europe— That by the means of
							Commerce however we had important relations with them, and that as in
							discussion with him in my official character, I could speak of nothing
							but in its relation to Commerce, I must naturally seem to him to attach
							an importance to subjects of that nature, greater than in his relative
							estimate they could deserve— <pb n="146" type="ms"/>But as he sometimes
							did me the honour to say that he would lay the Chancellor of the Empire
							aside, and freely express his sentiments as from one private gentleman
							to another, I would ask the same indulgence of him in saying that for
							the commercial interest of my Country, it would be much better that
							Constantinople should belong to the Emperor of Russia than to the Grand
							Seignor— He appeared to be much pleased with this remark, and said with
							a smile that after this War, he hoped the Americans, would have free
							access to trade with the Russian Possessions upon the Black Sea— This
							conference lasted more than an hour, when the Danish Minister the
								<persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron de Blome</persRef> being
							announced, I took leave of the Count and returned home— Afterwards
							walked almost to the foundery and came home late in the Evening.</p>

							at the close of the two preceding Months— The ardour of pursuit upon
							weights measures and Coins has necessarily given way to more pressing
							occupations— My Correspondence has become more active; but my
							interruptions are still more frequent, and from dinner time, my Evenings
							are now almost entirely curtailed— Chess has subsided entirely— Cards
							have become very rare— Music now occasionally takes their place. I have
							begun to read a little by Candle-light— But it affects my eyes— Russian
							I am afraid is laid aside, not to be resumed— On the whole Time passes,
							and leaves no permanent traces behind—</p>
