						<p><date>4. </date>I had a visit this morning from <persRef ref="montreal-f"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal</persRef>— I went again to the
							fortress, and saw the <persRef ref="olenin-alexey">director of the
								Mint</persRef>—who told me that there were no weights to be sold
							there, but directed me to a <persRef ref="hynam-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Hynam</persRef>, an Englishman, as a person who might
							give me the information that I wanted— He also ordered that the works at
							the mint should be shewn me, by an Englishman, under whose direction
							they are— There are two Steam engines; one of the power of 50 horses and
							the other of twenty-five, by the means of which the works are
							principally performed— The silver comes from the Russian Mines— The
							smelting process, is usually done in the Night and early in the morning—
							It had ceased for this day, so that I could not see it— From those
							furnaces the silver is received in short, narrow bars, which by passing
							between rolling mills, is expanded to a length of about eight feet, and
							a width and thickness, adequate for the various pieces of coin to be cut
							from it— From these bars are cut out the blanks which are to serve, as
							coins, which are first annealed in a hot oven, then pass’d between two
							cheeks, which round the edge and stamp the impression upon it, and
							finally <hi rend="italic">coined</hi>, by a machine which strikes off
							from sixty to seventy in a minute— The weight of the rouble is 4.
							Zolotniks and 82/96—a range of 4/96 of a Zolotnik in excess or in
							deffciency is allowed for each piece— If the blank is found heavier than
							this it is filed down to the weight—if lighter it must be melted over
							again— The remnants of the long bars out of which the blanks are cut
							must be melted over again— It appears to me that several of the
							processes would be susceptible of much improvement. There is so much
							waste of filings and other small particles which get scattered on the
							floors, that there are brushes at all the doors at which on going out
							every person must scrape the soles of his boots or shoes to take off the
							adhering particles; and the mint-man assured me that the amount annually
							collected from this operation was very considerable— There is little or
							no gold now coined, and few silver pieces other than roubles— Nor, if I
							judge of the average, from this days appearance, many of them— One
							coining machine only was at work, and that tended by a boy.— There are
							separate rooms for striking medals, where the coining machine is worked
							by the hand, and not by the steam engine— They were at work upon a medal
							for the City of Riga, to commemorate the centurial day since its
							subjection to the Russian Empire— Its date is 4. July 1710 and 1810. On
							one side are the profile’s of <persRef ref="peter-the-great">Peter the
								great</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="alexander-i">present
								Emperor</persRef>, facing each other— On the</p>

						<p><pb n="123" type="ms"/>reverse a view of the City of Riga— The heads are
							extremely well executed— Particularly that of Peter— The medalist is a
							German named <persRef ref="leberecht-carl">Leberecht</persRef>— I
							enquired if any of them could be procured, when they should be finished;
							and my companion promised to procure one for me— On my return I sent
								<persRef ref="u">Waldstein</persRef> to make enquiries of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hynam; but he found that he works only for the
							Emperor— In the Evening I went with the <persRef

						<p><date>11. </date>I enter this day upon the forty-fourth year of my age.—
							How large a portion of the longest life, I have already past, and to how
							little purpose. The last year of my life has been one of the most
							useless in respect to the pursuits which my imagination is so ready to
							frame before-hand— Let me hope that if another anniversary of my
							birth-day, is indulged me, I shall be able to give myself a better
							account of the time— I had this morning a visit from <persRef
								ref="potocki-john">Count John Potocki</persRef>, who seems to be
							dissatisfied with the situation of things. His brother, <persRef
								ref="potocki-severin">Count Severin</persRef>, told <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef> that he
							should very shortly ask the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> permission to retire from his service— They are
							not inclined to French politics.— I went to see <persRef
								ref="hynam-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hynam</persRef>, in
							pursuit of information respecting the weights and measures of this
							Country. He is a very ingenious artist, and has reduced the measures to
							the greatest possible precision. He says the Russian Arsheen is exactly
							28 English inches— He has made by order of the Emperor standard metallic
							measures, for all the Governments of the Empire, from which the Arsheen
							is to be made, and he has orders himself to make forty-thousand
							iron-Arsheen rods for the Government— He has an instrument by which he
							marks the gradation of a 36000<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> part of an Inch—
							But to make it he was obliged to use wood (mahogany) across the grain,
							and agat stone—for he found that the warmth of the hand produced an
							expansion of metallic instruments, which was incompatible with this
							minuteness of accuracy— With regard to weights he had scales to indicate
							and weights to mark the 400<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> part of a grain Troy
							weight— But though he has obtained orders to have the standard weights
							at the fortress delivered to him to compare them with the English
							avoirdupoise and Troy weights which he has, authenticated from the
							British exchequer, he has not yet obtained them— He has however compared
							the Standard Zolotnik at the fortress with his own weights, and found it
							weigh 65 1/2 grains. But the other standard Zolotnik, which is at the
							bank (for there are two, used as standards) weighs 69 grains 11 1/25. or
								2.<unclear>div<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi></unclear> 21. gr. 4/100. By the first of these
							Standards the Russian pound would be equal to 6288 grains Troy— By the
							second it would be 6627.84. making the difference in one pound of 339.84
							grains, or between 5 and 6 per Cent.— It is therefore very natural that
							there should be so much difference, in the reports of different
							authorities, and so much uncertainty upon the whole subject since there
							are two standards, thus widely different from each other, to which equal
							recurrence is had— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hynam promised to give me the
							exact proportions between the Russian and English pounds, as soon as he
							should ascertain them; and in the mean time lent me some small English
							Troy-weights with which I can compare mine. He is also very curious on
							the subject of magnetism, and has an instrument to shew the dip of the
							needle in different latitudes— He told me he was acquainted with
								<persRef ref="churchman-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Churchman</persRef>, who had given him one of his books.— In the
							Evening I went with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> and <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Gray</persRef> to the great Theatre, where we saw

							dined with us— I invited several other American Gentlemen, but they were
							engaged.— I walked in the Summer-garden in the Evening; but found myself
							with a severe cold all day; and this Evening with a sore breast, and
							painful cough— In this Climate I have been repeatedly seized, with these
							remarkable colds and coughs, which have a character peculiar to
							themselves— This is <pb n="125" type="ms"/>already the third time I
							suffer by them, since the first of May, Old Stile, when I caught one of
							them at the Catherinenhof ride.— I continue my comparisons of weights,
							and slowly obtain information concerning them— There is a new Manifesto
							respecting the Coins, which gives some additional data, for ascertaining
							the true weight of the Russian pound.— It declares the Rouble of 83 1/3
							Zolotniks of pure silver to the pound, and of 5 pounds 6. Zolotniks to
							the 100 Roubles, to be the <hi rend="italic">Unit</hi> of the monies of
							the Empire— This was already established by an Ukase of <persRef
								ref="paul-i">Paul I</persRef>. of 3. October 1797— He had issued a
							previous Ukase on the same subject— <persRef ref="storch-heinrich"
								>Storch</persRef> says 24. January 1797.— The manuscript translation
							of it furnished me by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal, is of 20.
							January 1797— I have several Roubles both of Paul and <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Alexander</persRef>, coined under the last
							ordinance, and they weigh 321. grains each, Troy weight— Now if 4.86.
							Zolotniks the weight of the Rouble is = 321. grains Troy, the pound is =
							6340.74. grains and the Zolotnik = 66.05— But as an excess or deficiency
							of 4/96 of a Zolotnik or about 3 grains is allowed on the coinage of
							each Rouble, and as their general principle is to weigh the blanks, with
							the allowance of excess in the scale, it is fair to conclude that 1 1/4
							grain in each Rouble belongs to this excess, and that the true weight of
							4.86. Zolotniks may be settled at 319.4. grains which brings the pound
							to 6316. as I had fixed it before— The imperfection both of my weights
							and scales makes it impossible for me to do more than approximate to the
							truth—</p>

							from <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Fisher</persRef> and <persRef ref="ashton-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Ashton</persRef>— Count Rzewuski told me the subject of
							his residence here. He was a creditor of the Polish Grand Marechal de la
							Couronne, <persRef ref="oginski-michal">Count Oginski</persRef>; whose
							Estates were confiscated at the time of <persRef ref="catherinethegreat"
								>Catherine the second’s</persRef> conquest of the part of Poland in
							which they were situated— An Ukase of the Empress however declared that
							those Estates should be answerable for the debts of the former owner,
							and a part of the lands themselves were allotted to Count Rzewuski for
							his demand which was of 60,000 ducats— This arrangement was left
							untouched during the reign of the Emperor <persRef ref="paul-i"
								>Paul</persRef>—but in 1804. after the Count had been seven years in
							possession of the lands, an Ukase of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>present Emperor</persRef>, annulled his grant, and a Commission has
							since been appointed to liquidate his claim— They awarded to him
							thirty-one thousand ducats, about half the amount of his due, and this

							for the payment even of this he has now been waiting about six months,

							is certainly not true; but I believe he is not perfectly well informed.—
							He has written again, and the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador</persRef> has also written, to urge the
							French Government to change their policy towards the United States.— I
							took a short walk this Evening, and pass’d the remainder of the day at

							of about twenty-five gentlemen, diplomatic and military— The invitations

							the Minister of Finance, and <persRef ref="galitzin-alexander">Prince

								<persRef ref="luxbourg-charles">Count Lüxbourg</persRef>.— The

							told me that <persRef ref="krusentern-adam">Captain

							Captain Krusenstern had sent to the king of Prussia, a copy of the first

							this order— But the Statutes of the order required that it should be
							exclusively reserved for Generals, and Admirals, while M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Krusenstern was only Captain of a ship— However, said the

							wear.</p>

									>rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> was very unwell; confined almost the
							whole day to her bed— My own cough though less severe than yesterday and
							the day before, was still troublesome— In the Evening I walked in the
							Summer-Gardens— Remainder of the day at home; the warmth of the weather
							forbidding exercise in the heat of the day.— I met <persRef
								ref="potocki-john">Count John Potocki</persRef> on the Quay, who
							told me that he had been this morning at Court at the Tauridan Palace,
							where the <persRef ref="catherinepavlovna">Grand-Duchess
								Catherine</persRef>, and her husband <persRef ref="peter-friedrich"
								>Prince George of Oldenburg</persRef> now reside— They arrived the
							day before yesterday by water, from Twer. <pb n="126" type="ms"/>Having
							gone through the volume of <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon’s</persRef> Sermons upon the mysteries, I began this day
							to read that of his funeral eulogies— The first of these which he
							pronounced was in honour of <persRef ref="devillars-henry">Henry de
								Villars</persRef>, Archbishop of Vienna in Dauphiny— It commenced
							his reputation as a preacher, and decided his Superiors to fix him in
							that career, which it seems he entered with reluctance— It is a
							brilliant piece of composition, but bears strong marks of youth and
							immature Judgment—overloaded with ornament, especially with those
							figurative scriptural allusions, which constitute a peculiar character
							of the author’s manner— The Eulogium includes scarcely any biography—
							The qualities for which the Archbishop is praised, are generally
							laudable; but among them is his extraordinary zeal for the persecution
							of Protestants.— Some instances of what now would be deemed the most
							illiberal bigotry, are alledged as his most transcendent proofs of
							merit— His boldness and inflexibility in defending the rights of the
							Church are also commended, though with some obscurity of expression—
							There is indeed throughout the discourse a mystical turn of phrase,
							needing study, to be intelligible. It is in three divisions—considering
							the Prelate as 1. An upright man 2. A faithful bishop. 3. A charitable
							and compassionate father— The style is highly oratorical. It concludes
							with an intimation of doubt whether the Archbishop’s soul was in
							purgatory, but calling on the Priests to sing the Mass for it— There is
							also an imitation of the celebrated invocation to <persRef
								ref="agricola">Agricola</persRef>, at the conclusion of his life in
								<persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef>— This Henry de Villars was an uncle of
							the famous <persRef ref="devillars-claude">Marshall Villars</persRef>, who saved France, or at least <persRef
								ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>. by winning the battle of Denain,
							against <persRef ref="eugene">Prince Eugene</persRef>.— I began also
							this day to read <persRef ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef>
							Scripture Characters, and read that of <persRef ref="adam"
								>Adam</persRef>— The author professes to have written them for a
							plain, Country Congregation; for which they appear to be suitable.</p>

							two <persRef ref="buhler-karl;u">Baron’s Bühler</persRef>— <persRef

								<persRef ref="galitzin-woldemar">Princess Woldemar
								Galitzin</persRef>, venerable by the length and thickness of her
							beard— This is no uncommon thing among the ladies of this Sclavonian
							breed— There is at the Academy of Sciences the portrait of a woman now
							dead, but with a beard equal to that of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato</persRef>— But of living subjects, the Princess Woldemar
							Galitzin is in this respect of all the females that I have seen, the one
							who most resembles a Grecian Philosopher— After dinner part of the
							company walked in the gardens— Went into the hut which M. de Laval calls
							his hermitage, set down upon the couches round the room, and had some
							agreeable conversation; in which Madame de Laval, and Count S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien principally figured— This Lady appears to
							me the most amiable, intelligent, and respectable Russian woman that I
							have seen. Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien is an old Soldier who
							has fought many a hard campaign in the Wars, but who has been an
							Austrian Courtier, all his life— His character is frank, sociable,
							good-humoured, with a remnant of libertinism, in which he takes a pride,
							like all the noble rakes of the last century— Licentiousness with regard
							to women, was peculiarly the fashion of high life in that age— Perhaps
							it is inseparably the vice of high life in all ages— I partly walked
							home; not having been out before going to dinner.</p>

								<persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six</persRef>, who
							informed me that the <persRef ref="louis-i">king of Holland</persRef>
							has actually abdicated, and that French troops have taken possession of

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six does not yet know whether the <persRef

							this arrangement, or whether the remaining part of Holland is to be
							incorporated with France— I enquired of him the cause of this procedure;
							but he appeared not inclined to talk freely upon the subject, and I did
							not press it— I conversed with him on the weights, measures and Coins of
							this Country; and he lent me two publications from which I hoped to
							gather some additional information— The one is the Manual of the new
							French weights, measures and Coins; and the other a comparative view of
							the Russian with all the others known in the world; by <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Borel</persRef> the

							detected some inaccuracies in M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Borel’s views of
							the American Coins— This is the great source of distrust which I have
							almost universally found upon examination of tables— That I find errors
							precisely in those with which I am most intimately acquainted, and of
							the accuracy of which I am a judge— The inference from the error that I
							ascertain to those which I cannot verify, is so natural, that I have a
							very qualified confidence in any compilation of tables whatsoever— M<hi

									>r:</hi> Borel’s</persRef> Tables and Tarbe’s manual of the new
							french weights and measures a little farther— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Borel in his comparative views of the Russian pound with the English and
							American Troy Weights gives 91.19 lb. Russian as equal to 100 lb. Troy—
							This would make the Russian lb. = 6316.482 642/9119 grains
							Troy—differing from the standard on which I had fixed, only between 13
							and 14. 1000<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> parts of a grain— He gives 100 lb.
							Russian as corresponding to 109.66. lb. Troy, which would make the
							Russian lb = 6316.416 grains Troy, differing 18 one hundredth parts or
							nearly 1/5 of a grain from my standard, and nearly as much from his own
							comparison of the Russian weight with the 100 lb. Troy— These
							differences arise, only from his assuming 100 lb. as the object of
							comparison and giving only two decimal figures for the fraction— His
							comparisons with the Avoirdupoise, and with the <pb n="128" type="ms"
							/>french weights present still greater difference of results; arising
							however in all probability from the same Sources. It is a copious
							fountain of inaccuracy, that in almost all the tables the smallest
							weights and measures are compared only to two or three decimal
							fractions, and then the remnant is left unstated or an excess given
							without noting its amount— For as the greatest weights and measures are
							only multiples of the smallest the misstatement of the millionth part of
							a grain or of an inch becomes an enormous error in the computation of a
							Million Tuns, or of the distance of a fixed star— I read this Evening to

							Lyons and then as Archbishop— He does not panegyrize his Persecution of
							Protestants; and his topics are all unexceptionable— But the composition
							is not so well polished, and there are more ludicrous phrases than
							usual— There are also many repetitions of ideas, contained in the Eulogy
							of Villars; particularly the imitation of <persRef ref="tacitus"
								>Tacitus</persRef>, and the closing allusion to purgatory.— In the

								Ambassador</persRef> at his house of Kaminoi ostroff— The company
							were about sixteen— The Ambassador is a man of the most polished and at

							annual expence of a million of Roubles— Has a family of sixty-five
							persons and keeps fifty-six horses in his stables— He maintains the
							State and Splendour of an Ambassador with sufficient dignity, but in his
							manners is modest and unassuming— There is a becoming gravity in his
							manners, and something in his countenance and eye which indicates
							hardness as well as polish— The Company as usual was diplomatic—
								<persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six</persRef>
							renewed to me in conversation the assurance that the king of Saxony is
							not a descendant from John Sobieski, and said that he had been reading
								<persRef ref="coxe-william">Coxe’s</persRef> account of the family
							this morning— Coxe’s book was the very place where I had found it, and
							on returning home, I looked at Coxe’s genealogical table of the
							Sobieski’s, and found that I had not been mistaken— The Ambassador read
							to us some private letters from his friends at Paris, containing
							accounts of the disaster at <persRef ref="schwarzenberg-karl">Prince

								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor</persRef>, and <persRef

							<persRef ref="schwarzenberg-pauline">wife</persRef> perished in the

							Prince de Conty, who died in 1709— His form of Eulogy is always the

							3. As a man of superior Understanding—Hero—Sage—and Genius— This Prince
							was really a distinguished character, and in 1697 was elected <hi

							himself supplanted by <persRef ref="augustus-ii">Augustus 2</persRef>.
							whom the pious Bishop of Clermont calls a Jeroboam— There are some

							and he says that they are brave as well as the French; but that <hi
								rend="italic">humanity</hi> is peculiar to Frenchmen— Among the
							topics of praise is one, for his having insisted upon his right of <hi

							General <hi rend="italic">Satire</hi>, upon Princes, Grandees, rich men,
