							would require some attention to be kept a useful Servant, and that he
							had not been long enough in my Service, for me to be understood in my

							character as far as I have observed it, and as favourably as I could
							consistently with truth.— I spoke to the Baron afterwards about the
							capture of American vessels, and of the report I had heard that in one
							of them some dispatches for me had been taken and opened. I told him
							that if I should receive a more authentic confirmation of this, I should
							take the Liberty of writing to him concerning it. He said he would

								Maclure</persRef>— At 7. in the Evening I attended the Public
							exhibition of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Boucher’s</persRef> disputants, on the question, whether “a Country,
							being a Peninsula, blockaded by Sea, and at the point of connection with
							the Continent having to contend against powerful armies; being without
							money, without credit; without connections—but having in abundance the
							most diversified productions, the means necessary for repelling force by
							force, and for subsistence, whether such a Country, in such a State, can
							carry on a great Commerce, pay its troops punctually and supply them
							with provisions?” The assembly was held at the house belonging to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Peter’s School— The hearers were numerous, and
							among them were a few Ladies— The Dissertations, read were by <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rachette</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="khvostoff-alexander">Count Alexander Khvostoff</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mayeur</persRef> his

							and <persRef ref="freygang-wilhelm">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Freygang</persRef>— They were apparently written on both sides of
							the question, but the writers in the negative took care not to be too
							much in the right— The question itself without stating precisely the
							present political situation of Russia, bore too many of its essential
							features, to make a public discussion of its merits altogether impartial
							under such a Government as this— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher had
							announced that he should sum up the arguments of the several
							memorialists, and conclude with his own opinion— But he did little more
							than declare himself for the affirmative; and assigned little else in
							support of his opinion, but that the Commerce might be carried on, and
							the troops paid, by means of a Bank of deposit. The allusions to this
							Country, in the application of the question were frequent in all the
							memorials; and the compliments to the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> and his Minister numerous— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Boucher, who called upon me on Thursday, with a dozen
							printed Invitations to this meeting, told me that he had received last
							Evening an anonymous Memoir, perfectly well written in the negative,
							which he believed was by <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Montréal</persRef>— But it could not be read at the

							too late— <persRef ref="raimbert-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Raimbert</persRef>, who also paid me a visit yesterday, told me that
							Maximin (Consolat) his grandson, had written that Memoir— Among the

							Soltikoff</persRef>, brothers, the <persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander"
								>Grand Master of Ceremonies Narishkin</persRef>, the <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Le Coeur’s</persRef> school, at Passi,

								<persRef ref="cochrane-charles">Cochran</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="bache-benjamin">Franklin Bache</persRef>, and <persRef

							interested to extol him for a Hero; and they have too successfully

							gratitude to a benefactor, and to the strongest ties of kindred—
							Massillon dwells sufficiently upon this last reproach, without noticing

							upon Blockades— His learning upon the first point was curious, but as
							usual undigested and confused— His remarks upon Blockades shallow, and
							incorrect— He announced an extraordinary meeting for next Saturday
							Evening to discuss the anonymous Memoir, on the question of last
							Saturday, the author of which he said, had made himself known to him— He
							propounded also a new question for discussion at a second public
							exhibition to be held in the Month of September—“Whether women are
							qualified to perform the Office of arbitrators”— To shew that this was
							no new question, he read a passage from the Code of <persRef
								ref="justinian">Justinian</persRef> declaring women incapable of
							acting as arbitrators, and annulling all decisions of women as such.
							There was no procès-verbal, this Evening—the public exhibition not
							having left time to prepare it— But it will not be lost— For M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher observed that although objections had
							been made to this mode of lecturing, he should persist in it, being
							persuaded of its utility, from an experience of five and twenty years— I
							walked for about an hour after the lecture.</p>

							of uncommon sacrifices of consideration and a reputation which in the
							Spirit of this age, economy cannot escape— In this Country beyond all

							hitherto, and hope for firmness of character to withstand them in

						<p><date>30. </date>Pass’d the day at home, without the interruption of any
							visitors. In the Evening I walked in the Summer Gardens, and over the
							long Bridge— The width of the river there is by my customary
							admeasurement 805 of my paces or 2213 feet—at the lower Bridge it is
							only 364 paces or 1000 feet.— I wrote something this day, but still gave
							an undue proportion of the time to my enquiries concerning weights
							measures and coins— My precise object is to ascertain those of Russia,
							with their relative proportions to those used in America— But I find it
							extremely difficult, and indeed as yet have not succeeded in fixing <pb
								n="121" type="ms"/>accurately my ideas on the subject— I procured
							sometime since a Russian Nest of Brass weights from one pound to a
							quarter of a Zolotnik, and a pair of Scales— I have compared them with
							an Apothecary’s scale and weights, which we brought with the medecine
							chest from America. By this comparison I found that the Russian pound
							was equal to 6312 3/4 grains— But all the smaller Russian weights were
							incorrect— Some weighing more, and some less than the proportion. The
							Scales too are so coarsely made that they scarcely indicate any
							variation of less than a quarter Zolotnik; which is the smallest of the
							weights they use among the Silversmiths— My apothecary’s balance was
							much more accurate, and much more sensible to small weights— There are
							however differences of full half a grain in several of them.— <persRef
								ref="maudru-jean">Maudru</persRef> in his Russian Grammar says that
							the Russian pound is equal to 409 <hi rend="italic">grammes</hi> of the
							new French standard, and <persRef ref="webster-noah">Webster</persRef>
							in his Dictionary gives 15.444. grains troy weight for the gramme—
							Supposing both these correct, the Russian pound will be equal to
							6316.596. grains Troy; about three and three quarters of a grain more
							than I found it by the comparison of the weights and scales. But I had
							no English weight of more than two drams or 120 grains, and all my
							apothecary’s weights together amount only to 301 3/4 grains. I was
							therefore obliged by means of these to make other heavier weights to
							compare with the larger portions of the Russian pound, and having no
							smaller weight than 1/4 of a grain I could come within that only by
							conjecture— These circumstances together with the slight difference in
							my smallest weights accounting for the difference of 3 3/4 grains
							between my experiment, and the numbers given by Maudru and Webster. I
							have considered them as correct, and accordingly take the Russian pound
							to be = to 6316.596. grains English Troy weight— Maudru is however not
							exact in his comparisons of the Russian weights and measures with those
							of France, and Webster, differs from others, and even from himself—for
							in one page he makes the old Paris Pound as 27 to 25 English
							Avoirdupois, and in the next he gives a table in which 109. pounds
							avoirdupois is exhibited is equal to 100 Paris pounds— <persRef
								ref="storch-heinrich">Storch</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>George</persRef> whom I have also consulted, are not more accurate—
							So that I may still find occasion to correct my present estimate— In
							round numbers the usual maxim is that 36. Avoirdupois pounds are equal
							to a Russian pood of 40 pounds— And <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montreal</persRef> has given me a Memoir of
							the trade of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, in which he makes the
							100 lb. avoirdupois equal to 111 4/16 Russian pounds, in which case, if,
							as Webster says the English Avoirdupois pound is equal to 7000 grains
							Troy, the Russian pound would then be only 6292.098 grains Troy. I find
							also upon examination as much uncertainty, and discrepancy, in the
							account of measures, as in that of weights.— I collect however some
							information, and put my researches in a train which may terminate in
							some useful knowledge.</p>
