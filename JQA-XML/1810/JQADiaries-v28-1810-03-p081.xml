						<p><date>27. </date>I went to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff’s</persRef> this morning, at eleven O’Clock, the hour that
							he had appointed in consequence of my request for an interview with him—
							I found <persRef ref="dalopeus-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								d’Alopeus</persRef> and <persRef ref="benkendorf-aleksandr">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Benkendorff</persRef> with him; who retired
							immediately upon my going into his cabinet— He said they were both on
							the point of going to Naples, and had come to ask him for Passports— As
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Benkendorf he was a young man, who might form
							himself there in the diplomatic career, as well as any where; but he was
							inclined to put off the departure of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> d’Alopeus,
							as long as he could— He did not like to see him go to Naples— He had all
							proper respect for the <persRef ref="joachim-i">king of
							Naples</persRef>; but the relations of that Country with this, were not
							of sufficient importance to require that they should be confided to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> d’Alopeus, whom he considered as one of the
							ablest diplomatic characters of this Empire. <pb n="85" type="ms"/>The
							Chargé d’Affaires of Naples, he said; had sent to request an interview
							with him— He supposed it was to inform him of the appointment of a new
							Minister here, which he understood had taken place— The <persRef ref="u"
								>Duke de Mondragone</persRef>, on account of his own domestic
							affairs; or for some reason of that kind not desiring to return here—
							The Count then enquired what was the object upon which I had desired to
							see him— I told him it was on the case of the American vessel the
							Intercourse; which had been condemned by the Commission for neutral
							Navigation at Archangel; upon which <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef> had sometime since presented
							to him a note; and which at a former interview I had also mentioned to
							him— I assured him that the vessel and Cargo were undoubtedly American
							property; and dwelt upon all the alleviating Circumstances which could
							be adduced to prevail upon him to have the proceeds of the sale restored
							to the owner, <persRef ref="cutts-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Cutts</persRef>— I observed to him that this had been suggested as a
							probable indulgence to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cutts, by the
							Commissioners themselves; as he had assured me— That one motive for the
							condemnation was the vessel’s having touched at Gottenburg, on her way
							from Bilbao— But that she had arrived just at the time of the conclusion
							of Peace; and at a time when I had heard that other vessels had been
							admitted— He said this must be a mistake— That no vessels whatever had
							been admitted from Sweden before the signature of the Treaty at
							Frederickshamm; and that during the negotiations there had not even been
							an armistice.— The other ground of condemnation was the want of a rôle
							d’equipage, which I said was to be accounted for from the length of time
							since the vessel had left the United States; and the changes in the crew
							which had been necessary— The Count promised to attend to the subject,
							and intimated that they were in discussion with another friendly power,
							on similar cases— On the whole there is very little chance for the
							restoration of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cutts’s property— I then told the
							Count of the recent intelligence from Denmark; that a new Ordinance
							respecting privateers, was about to be issued; and that a large number
							of privateers was fitting out in the Ports of Denmark.— I spoke of the
							anxiety which it occasioned among the Americans now here, and who
							propose returning to America with Cargoes of the produce of this
							Country— Though inclining to think this apprehension without foundation,
							I said I was myself fearful it might interrupt the freedom of Navigation
							of our vessels that would be coming here; and I said that as this was an
							object interesting to this Country as well as to us, perhaps an
							intimation might be given to the Court of Denmark, from this Government
							which would operate as a restraint upon the Danes, and afford some
							protection to our trade— The Count said that if the free course of
							vessels coming to this Country should be obstructed they might no doubt
							address reclamations to the Danish Government; but that as to an
							ordinance for privateers, it was hardly possible to make any objection
							against such a measure as that— Denmark was probably stimulated to it by
							France; and it was impossible that there should be any security for
							Commerce untill England should incline to terms of Peace— What should
							now prevent this he could not conceive— Spain had heretofore been
							alledged, as a cause for declining Negotiation—but Spain was now
							entirely subdued; Cadix alone excepted— The English army had abandoned
							its defence, and had retired into Portugal— What could now be the motive
							for persisting in the War; unless it was the mere pleasure of perpetual
							hostility— A system which could hardly be supposed, as the intention of
							any Government. The Count enquired what was the present state of our
							affairs with France and with England?— I told him that I had no recent
							intelligence— That extracts from English newspapers had announced that
								<persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pinkney</persRef> our Minister at London, had left that City and
							embarked for America; but I had no authentic information to that effect—
							That from America I had no accounts of any thing important since the
							rupture of the negotiations with <persRef ref="jackson-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jackson</persRef>, but
							that if as appeared <pb n="86" type="ms"/>from the latest accounts from
							England, the British Government was really inclined to a settlement of
							differences with America, I presumed it would be accomplished;
							especially as the violence with which France and her dependences were
							proceeding towards us, would exasperate the Spirits of the People
							against them, and make them more readily incline to conciliation with
							England— That the conduct of France towards us was unaccountable— That
							if we were at open War with her, she could do us no more injury that she
							now does; and that we should then at least enjoy the advantage of a free
							trade with England. The Count said that it was not for him to account
							for the motives by which a foreign government might be guided; but he
							could see no rational ground for the proceedings of France towards
							America— He asked whether it was true that so much American property had
							been confiscated at Naples— I told him, not only at Naples, but in
							Holland, in France, in Spain; wherever they could lay their hands upon
							our property they had taken it; and without any possible motive other,
							than the determination to plunder. He said he hoped at least they had
							not got the vessels at Cadix, of which he had seen in the English
							newspapers that there were a great number— I said I hoped at least they
							would escape— He said, that he saw by another article in the English
							papers that the French Toulon fleet was out; and that an action between
							them and Lord Collingwood was expected— I told him I was sorry to hear
							it; as the issue of such an action would undoubtedly be the same as that
							of all their naval battles, in the present war, and would only tend to
							buoy up the temper of the English people, for a further continuance of
							the War; without producing any imaginable good— He said it would have
							the further ill-effect of destroying the remnant of any counterpoise to
							the naval force of Great-Britain—without which it seemed impossible to
							expect a permanent Peace— I observed that it appeared probable there
							would be a change in the British Ministry; as they had been several
							times left in the minority in the House of Commons; and it was very
							difficult for a Ministry to stand against a majority or even with a
							small majority in that House— As the Ministers usually had the Prudence
							to retire while they could command a majority to sanction their
							proceedings— But, said the Count, it does not follow that a change of
							men, will be a change of Ministry— Should <persRef ref="canning-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Canning</persRef> for example come in
							again, it would not be a change of ministry— And even if <persRef
								ref="grenville-william">Lord Grenville</persRef> should come in, it
							is doubtful whether it would be such a change as to produce Peace— Lord
							Grenville was the principal personage in a Ministry which commenced and
							carried on the War that laid the foundation for all those of the present
							times— He may be called emphatically the man of the War; and in his late
							Speeches in Parliament he seems to blame the Ministers only for pursuing
							a different system of War, from that which he had pursued—that is, for
							sending expeditions to the Continent instead of money— Now to be sure, a
							War merely with money, does not bear so hard upon a Nation, as a War
							with men—but then what can it effect? what is the result of this pitiful
							dole to beggary? an ally of a generous spirit instead of receiving it as
							assistance, will consider it as an offence— Now I can confide this to
							you—(Je puis vous le confier.) In our War with France which preceded the
							Peace of Tilsit, a War which we were waging for the English, since it
							was commenced on account of Hanover, we had proposed to the English that
							they should send an expedition to the Continent, which might operate as
							a diversion in favour of the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king
								of Prussia</persRef>, and of the <persRef ref="gustav-iv">king of
								Sweden</persRef>, with whom we were then upon good terms— Instead of
							that, they sent a <pb n="87" type="ms"/>million Sterling, to be
							distributed equally among the three Sovereigns; and this was the time
							when Lord Grenville was the Minister; and his great expedient— The
							generous Sentiments of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>
							induced him to order that part of the money which was sent here to be
							kept in deposit; and it has been sent back to England since the
							commencement of this War with her— I replied that if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Canning should come again into the Ministry, I did not
							believe that a Peace would be possible, so long as he should continue
							there; but that if Lord Grenville should come in; particularly if in
							conjunction with <persRef ref="grey-charles">Lord Grey</persRef>, I
							thought there would be a possibility of Peace—. That upon the subject of
							the maritime pretensions of Great-Britain, Lord Grenville was to be sure
							in some degree pledged, but as a Statesman of experience and judgment,
							he must submit to the necessity of modifying systems according to times
							and circumstances— That as to his emphatical attachment to the former
							War, it was to be remembered that he professed to consider that as a War
							of principles— A War against Jacobinism— A War, against the French
							Republic— I presumed he could not have any thing to dread at present
							from the Jacobinism or the Republicanism of France— The Count smiled,
							and said that to be sure, when one reflected upon the whole history of
							this French Revolution, and saw that violent Republicanism thus
							terminate in the greatest excess of Monarchy, it ought to be a great
							lesson for Mankind— I now took leave of Count Romanzoff and came home;
							soon after which <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef>, the
							Danish Minister called to pay me a visit— I mentioned to him the private
							accounts which had been received here of privateers, fitting out in the
							Danish Ports, and the paragraphs in the newspapers mentioning that a new
							ordinance for privateering was soon to be issued— He said that he could
							not undertake to answer that it was not so; but that he had received no
							indication of it from his government— That if it was so, undoubtedly it
							must be from a foreign instigation, and there could only have been left
							the alternative of doing it of their own accord or by compulsion— That
							he himself had advised the suspension of the privateering; and that
							having his Estates in Holstein, he knew how advantageous to his own
							Country the trade which the Americans had brought there was. But as I
							had told him how anxious the Americans now here, and who were going home
							at the opening of the Navigation were in consequence of these accounts,
							he said that certainly there could be no danger for them, since it was
							only against English trade that the privateers could be armed— But
							probably vessels coming into the Baltic would be molested; for the
							English would not suffer them to come without licences, and that his
							Government considered every vessel having a British licence as lawful
							prize— I told him that according to the orders of Council of April last
							the navigation to the Baltic would be open to American vessels, direct
							from America, without British licences, and that I did not expect that
							the British would add any new restriction— He appeared not to have known
							this modification of the orders in Council. In conclusion, as he was
							going away, I told him I hoped he would write to his Government, and
							urge them not to permit the Americans to be molested by their
							privateers; but he only answered by general asseverations of his own
							good dispositions— He told me that <persRef ref="vyazemskaya-elena"
								>Princess Waezemsky</persRef> was to dine with him; and what
							disconcerted him much was that she must dine at three O’Clock; while he
							was accustomed to dine at five.— I pass’d the remainder of the day at
							home.— In the Evening we had cards and Chess— I read <persRef
								ref="coxe-william">Coxe’s</persRef> account of the Russian
							Historians and Poets, and wrote most of this day’s journal.</p>

						<p><date>30. </date>Before I left Boston my friend <persRef ref="davis-john"
								>Judge Davis</persRef> sent me several copies of <persRef
								ref="godon-sylvain">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Godon’s</persRef>
							mineralogical observations made in the neighbourhood of Boston; with a
							box of samples, of the rocks and stones described in it; to be presented
							to any Society or individual, to whom such enquiries might be
							interesting— I have determined to give them to the Society of
							Naturalists at Moscow. But wishing first to examine the collection
							myself and comparing it with the description, I devoted this forenoon,
							with <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Everett</persRef> to that purpose— We accordingly went through the
							whole Collection— As we were interrupted by short visits from <persRef
								ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montreal</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six</persRef>, it
							took us all the rest of the morning, so that I could not walk out—
								<persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Galloway</persRef> was also

								>We all</persRef> dined at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Glukoff’s</persRef> and had a Russian dinner— Fish in great
							abundance for the observers of lent, and flesh in equal profusion for
							the Americans.— On coming home this Evening I found <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>; who
							informed me that <persRef ref="smith-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J.

									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Maclure</persRef> had this day arrived.</p>

						<p><date>31. </date>I received a Card of invitation from <persRef
								ref="ouvarov-fedor">General Ouvaroff</persRef> the Aid de Camp
							general of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, to attend
							the funeral of <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">his wife</persRef>—at
							the Catholic Church at 10. O’Clock this morning. On enquiry I was
							informed that the Ceremony would commence at the General’s House, where
							I went accordingly with <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> at 10— We were however too
							late— The Street before the house was so much crowded with Carriages,
							that we could not approach the gate; and at the moment when we arrived
							the coffin was brought into the Street, and placed under the Canopy,
							upon the hearse— We followed in the procession of Carriages; but when we
							came to the Church, it was so crowded that we could not get more than
							half way up the centre aisle— The funeral service was performed
							according to the Roman Catholic ceremonial, with very fine music of the
							Composition of <persRef ref="mozart-wolfgang">Mozart</persRef>— It was
							about two hours long— And from the excessive throng, we found it almost
							as difficult to get from the Church as it had been to get to it. The
							Coffin was carried from the Church and a procession of Carriages again
							was formed to go to Strelna where the interment was to take place— On
							returning home I found <persRef ref="smith-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"

							where we met <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher</persRef>
							a Professor, who is about to commence a course of lectures upon maritime

								<persRef ref="naryshkin-dimitri">Grand Veneur
							Narischkin</persRef>—to <persRef ref="schenck-hans">Count
