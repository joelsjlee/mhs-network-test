							But I find as with his elder brothers a difficulty in fixing his
							attention— The sugar-plums yet serve as a guard against the sentiment of
							toil, but to dispense them with efficacy, is a delicate task— To allure
							the attention of a child without fatiguing it is difficult— To fix it
							from wandering is yet harder— His eyes fly over the page, and when I am
							pointing to one letter, he insists upon looking at another—upon turning
							over the leaf; upon hunting for a picture; upon any thing but naming the
							letter to which I point— This is so often repeated that I find it at
							least as hard to keep myself from irritation, as him from inattention—
							But the slightest manifestation of impatience, or harshness disgusts the
							child, and then nothing is to be done with him— There is a period of
							education when severity may be necessary to fix application, but it will
							not answer to begin with it— The essential qualities for a teacher are
							Patience, and Perseverance.</p>

							with <persRef ref="u">M: Gervais</persRef>, one of the under Officers in
							his department, who immediately left him. I again returned him my thanks
							for the care of my packets forwarded by his Courier to Paris, and of
							those which had come by his Courier and he had sent me— I mentioned also
							that I had sent him a Copy of the Official Documents published by the
							Government of the United States concerning the recent Negotiations with
							Great-Britain and France— He enquired whether it was probable, as seemed
							to be indicated by a Passage in the late Speech of the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king of England</persRef> to Parliament, that the
							Negotiations between them and the United States, would be resumed— I
							told him that if the Sentiments of his Britannic Majesty were such as
							his Speech professed, the Negotiations undoubtedly would be resumed; and
							that as we must always implicitly believe the word of a king, thus
							solemnly spoken in the face of the world, I considered it as certain
							that they would be resumed— The Count made no reply to this; excepting
							by a smile, and a very significant look, in return for my compliment to
							the Faith of kings.— I then mentioned to him that I had a letter from
								<persRef ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef> in which
							he expresses his feelings of congratulation to me that I am in a place
							where there is some regard for our Country and its rights, and that I
							had also letters from Hamburg expressing the gratitude of my Countrymen
							there for the interposition of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> with the Court of Denmark, and the effect which
							many of them had already experienced from it, in the liberation of their
							property— He said that <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron
								Blome</persRef> had informed him a week or ten days ago, of the
							answer he had received from his Court, to the dispatch he had sent in
							consequence of Count Romanzoff’s application to him, by order of the
							Emperor—which answer was that the Danish Government would pay the most
							particular attention to the interest which the Emperor had taken upon
							this occasion; that they would give all possible dispatch to the
							proceedings, and that their own wishes were entirely conformable to the
							desire manifested by the Emperor upon this subject— He then added that
							he was glad that the opportunity which the Emperor had thus taken to
							shew his friendship for the United States had been attended with this
							success— He regretted that the Commerce of the United States elsewhere
							appeared still to be subject to seizures and ill-treatment, and that
							altogether it seemed impossible there should be any safe Commerce untill
							the Peace— That the profligacy with which the English under at least the
							obvious connivance of their Government were attempting to carry on their
							trade with fraud and forgery was such as he could not reflect upon
							without astonishment— The English were a Nation illustrious by the men
							of Genius and of learning, distinguished in the Arts and Sciences, whom
							they had produced—illustrious by the degree of power and importance in
							the affairs of the world which they had attained— Their Commerce also
							had been very extensive; and although it was known and admitted that in
							their commercial intercourse with others their activity and enterprize
							gave them advantages, of which they always were eager to make the most
							they could— That they would make those with whom they would treat commit
							as many faults as they could lead them into, and turn them with all <pb
								n="79" type="ms"/>their ingenuity and address to their own benefit,
							in short that they had an extraordinary talent at making profitable
							bargains, yet there was a sort of integrity to the reputation of which
							they had always aspired; and which they had effectually acquired— A
							British Merchant was considered, as a man of honour; a man of
							principle—who would disdain to participate in a base of infamous
							transaction for the mere profits of trade— But now, said the Count, I
							will give you a sample of what are the principles of British Merchants—
							There arrived in our Ports last Autumn thirteen ships, with Cargoes,
							which entered as coming from the Port of Lisbon—under neutral Colours—
							None of them had the Portugueze flag, of which I was very glad.— Among
							the documents which they exhibited, was a <hi rend="italic">Certificate
								of Origin</hi>, apparently under the hand and Seal, of the Russian
							Consul at Lisbon— This Gentleman has long been personally well known to
							me, and I have a high esteem for his character and good conduct— In
							which point of view I have often mentioned him to the Emperor himself.—
							I had no reason on seeing those Certificates of origin to doubt from the
							appearance of the hand or the seal that they were not authentic; but as
							the vessels have been detained here over winter by the ice; and as I
							could have time in that interval to get an answer from him, I took good
							measures to get a letter transmitted to him, with a list of these
							vessels, and of the documents apparently executed by him, with an
							enquiry whether these were all authentic— I have lately received his
							answer, and not one of the documents is authentic—the whole thirteen are
							forgeries. Now I ask—said the Count what difference in principle there
							is between this case, and the same transaction upon the seal of a deed,
							or the signature of a bill of exchange—and what one is to think of a
							Government which licences people to trade on such documents?— He then
							continued that the chargé d’affaires of the Queen of Portugal had often
								<hi rend="italic">tormented him</hi>, (m’a tourmenté) for the
							admission of Portugueze vessels from Lisbon— This was impossible— The
							Emperor had made no change in his relations with Portugal— He was not at
							War with Portugal; he continued to receive <persRef
								ref="navarro-rodrigo">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Navarro</persRef> as
							the Queen’s chargé des Affaires.— Portugueze vessels from Brezil, or
							elsewhere, not enemy’s Ports would be freely admitted; but from places
							notoriously in possession of the English; it could not be, without
							making a burlesque of the Imperial ordinances against trading with the
							English— The Count made also many enquiries whether I had any
							intelligence from South-America; which appeared to be an object of
							peculiar interest at this moment; but I had none— On some allusion that
							I made to the rigour with which the French Government and its
							dependencies were proceeding towards America, which I told him would
							most powerfully negotiate in the United States, in favour of their
							reconciliation with England; he asked me whether I knew that <persRef
								ref="burr-aaron">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Burr</persRef> was gone
							to Paris— I said I had heard he was arrived there— He said he did not
							know of his arrival; but that he knew from a certain source that he was
							gone there— He said Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Burr had written a letter
							to him requesting permission to come here; but that not being desirous
							of encouraging people who had fled from the violated laws of their own
							Country, to come into this, he had not answered his letter— If he wanted
							to come here he must make his application through me, and if I had
							desired it, no difficulty would have been made.— He enquired what Burr’s
							project had been; which I explained to him—as well as its complicated
							nature would admit in the compass of a short conversation— After this I
							told the Count of the letter I had received from London, for the
								<persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">Abbé Brzozowski</persRef>, au
							Collège des Nobles—of the Circumstances under which I had received it,
							and of my determination to send it back to the person who had forwarded
							it to me; unless he the Count were of opinion that I might without
							inconvenience send it to the person for whom it was destined— I added
							that if the writer in requesting me to convey this letter to its address
							had thought proper to leave it open for my perusal, <pb n="80" type="ms"
							/>and I had found it relating only to private concerns of business or
							friendship, I might have sent or delivered it to the person to whom it
							is directed, without giving the Count any trouble on the occasion— But
							that I could not become the intermediate of any Correspondence from a
							foreign Country at War with this, the contents of which were unknown to
							myself, without giving notice to him, and obtaining his consent.— That I
							presumed this was a letter merely upon private concerns—that I knew the
								<persRef ref="lee-archibald2">American Gentleman</persRef> who had
							forwarded it to me; and had no suspicion that he would be accessary to
							the transmission of any improper correspondence; and as the letter was
							said to be important, (I supposed, to the correspondent) I wished he
							might not be disappointed by failing to receive it— The Count at first
							discovered some marks of surprize; and said he believed I had better
							send the letter back— He enquired particularly how it had been forwarded
							from England—said that from the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the
							person to whom it is directed, he appears to be a Subject of the
							Emperor, and not a Russian— That there was no such thing here as a
							College des Nobles— That he supposed it must mean the Corps des Cadets,
							and that this Abbé was one of the Instructors there— I told him that
							such had been my own conjecture— After pausing a few minutes the Count
							requested me to wait a day or two during which he would make enquiries,
							and then return me a final answer, whether to deliver the letter as
							directed or send it back— He seemed then inclining to think it might be
							delivered, and he thanked me in terms of the greatest cordiality for the
							notice I had thus given him; declaring his entire approbation of the
							principle, and his particular sense of the delicacy which I had observed
							towards this Government in the application of it.— I spoke to the Count
							respecting the Note which I presented nearly three Months since,
							relative to the claims of the Weymouth Commercial Company and <persRef
								ref="thorndike-israel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Thorndike</persRef>—
							He said this Subject belonged altogether to the Department of the
							Marine; but that he would speak to the Minister of Marine about it— He
							made a similar promise with respect to accelerating the expedition of
							Passports for American Citizens coming into this Country or going out of
							it— They are always delayed from a fortnight to three weeks, after going
							through all the formalities, required by the ordinances, before
							Passports can be obtained— The Count said he had frequently heard the
							same complaints made before— That it belonged to the <persRef
								ref="kurakin-aleksei">Minister of the Interior</persRef> to remedy
							this evil; and he would speak to him concerning it— As I took leave the
							Count invited me, and desired me to invite <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Adams</persRef> to a supper at his house on Thursday next. He said
							that to explain an old bachelor’s giving a supper to Ladies, he would
							observe it was for the <persRef ref="katharine-amalie">Princess Amelia
								of Baden</persRef>, who is going away; and who had permitted him to
							give her a supper— I left the Count about 2. O’Clock; came home, and
							afterwards took a short walk before dinner— <persRef ref="harris-levett"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef> pass’d most of the
							Evening with us.</p>
