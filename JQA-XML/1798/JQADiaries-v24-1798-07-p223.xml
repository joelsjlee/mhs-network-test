							request. this afternoon at 6 o’clock. He said the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">king</persRef> had fixed on Thursday at
							1/2 past ten in the forenoon, to give me an audience for the delivery of
							my letters of credence, and apologized for the long but necessary

							likewise of the <persRef ref="louiseauguste">queen</persRef> and
							afterwards of the <persRef ref="frederica-louise">queen mother</persRef>
							if she remains in town.— I am to send a memorial to the department,
							concerning the renewal of the <hi rend="italic">Treaty</hi> <pb n="224" type="ms"/>Treaty, referring to the powers which I
							communicated last Winter.— The department of finances will be consulted,
							but all will go through that of foreign affairs.— The Count said, I
							should do well to wait until the next week, for they were at present
							occupied with a thousand little minutiae, relative to the ceremony on
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which though trifling and insignificant in
							themselves required an indispensable attention— The homages belonged
							properly to the department of the fiefs held by <persRef ref="u">M. de
								Werder</persRef>, but there were numerous references to the other
							departments so that they were all employed.— He asked me if I had
							received an invitation to attend— I had, this morning.— He enquired
							whether I had any news from home— Told him as late as 7. May principally
							relating to our situation with France, which I presumed was known to
							him.— He had seen the late publications on both sides— The accounts
							appeared to represent an open rupture as probable.— I told him that
								<persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">Talleyrand’s</persRef> performance
							finished by an assurance that the Directory wished to live at peace with
							America: that notwithstanding the very hostile temper apparent through
							all the rest of the publication, if this closing assurance was true,
							peace would be preserved, for it was ardently desired by the American
							Government. He hoped it would, for at least if so, it would be <hi
								rend="italic">one War the less</hi> (une guerre de moins)— I told
							him that the present situation of things suggested the alterations which
							I should have to propose in the Treaty— As the principles practised upon
							by the maritime powers required some such measures— He said that as to
							these principles of navigation they were at present <hi rend="italic">un
								peu en l’air</hi>, but every disposition would exist here to prove
							the friendship and good will of this government towards the United
							States, and to make such arrangements as might be advantageous to the

							from the <persRef ref="charles-theodore">Elector of Bavaria</persRef>,

							of course the last introduced.— I presented to the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">king</persRef> my letters of credence,
							and repeated the motives of my mission which I had mentioned to him at
							my first audience last Winter. At the same time I presented the
							compliments of my Government, of condolence upon the death of <persRef ref="frederick-william-ii">the late
							king</persRef>, and of felicitation upon his own accession to the throne— He
							answered me with kindness, assured me of his sincere friendship for the
							United States, and said he was happy to see me now fully accredited
							here, and hoped I should long remain here— Then made some enquiries
							after my family here, and enquired again concerning <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>.— Upon coming
							out I found Sieyes, whom I had seen at the Hague, in the month of May
							1795, of which I reminded him— He had forgotten it— I then went with M.
							de Maisonneuve to <persRef ref="vonvoss-sophie">Madame de Voss</persRef>
							to enquire when the <persRef ref="louiseauguste">Queen</persRef> would
							see us. She said some other day, of which we should have notice— She
							told us about her journey, with which she appears much pleased; and of
							the Queen’s carriage oversetting.— Of the charming Ladies, and
							inexpressible names, they met at Warsaw &amp;c &amp;c.— We found the
							Count Schall there. Returned immediately to town, and soon after went
							out to dine with <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Schickler</persRef> at Strahlau, about 3 English miles from Berlin,

						<p><date>6. </date>Between 9 and 10 this morning, went to the royal Palace,
							into the Hall called the white Hall—on the third story— We were early—
							At about ten the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king</persRef>
							went in procession with his Generals and Ministers to the Dome church,
							and heard a sermon. At about twelve he returned escorted as before,
							entered the Hall, and ascended a throne prepared in it for him. His
							brothers <persRef ref="frederickhenrylouis">Henry</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="frederickwilliamkarl">William</persRef> stood on his right
							hand. The Princes <persRef ref="augustusferdinand">Ferdinand</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Augustus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="radziwill-anton">Prince Radziwill</persRef> on his left;
							further on the right the principal Generals and aid de camps of the

							deputations from the magistrates of the several provinces— In a box at
							the right, all the foreign ministers and their Secretaries. In one at
							the left, all the other foreigners present. In a small gallery at one
							corner of the Hall, were the <persRef ref="louiseauguste"
								>queen</persRef>, the <persRef ref="frederica-louise2">queen
								mother</persRef> and princesses— The <persRef
								ref="vonderreck-eberhard">Minister de Reck</persRef> began by a
							speech addressed to the deputies which was answered by the President of
							the deputations <persRef ref="vonarmin-georg">Arnim de Suckow</persRef>—
							Then a secretary read the oath of allegiance, which was afterwards
							repeated word by word, by all the deputies, and closed with three cheers
							of “Long live Frederic William III.”— Then one of the Ministers read the
							act signed by the king declaring on his part that he will maintain all
							the rights and privileges of the respective States. After which the
								<persRef ref="alvensleben-philipp">Minister Alvensleben</persRef>,
							read the list of favours granted on this occasion.— The three cheers
							were the signal for the sounding of the trumpets and kettle drums and
							the firing of 24 guns without the palace. From thence the king went down
							one floor, entered under a canopy upon a balcony fronting the public
							square, where the same ceremony was repeated and the oath taken by the
							deputations of the Citizens.— The People in and round the square in
							front of the Palace, must have amounted to 50,000 persons.— It was all
							over before one o’clock,—when the king sat down to dinner, with upwards
							of 1200 persons.— As I was retiring through the white Hall, I found the
							Queen mother seated, with her ladies of honour— She called me to her and
							said she would take leave of me there— I had sent last Evening to know
							when I could wait upon her, with my compliments upon the renewal of my
							credentials.— She goes out of town this Evening.</p>
						<p>The day passed without any unpleasant accident— All illuminations for the
							evening had been forbidden.</p>
