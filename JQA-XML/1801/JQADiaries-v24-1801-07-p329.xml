						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The life on board ship is so
							uniform that the only difference between one day and another, is that of
							the wind. I find upon this passage what I have observed upon others
							heretofore— The sea affects my head—disqualifies me for all application
							of mind—insomuch that all the time I pass upon the sea is in a manner
							lost time— I cannot write— And though I read the more, I retain nothing
							of my reading— Retirement and silence indeed are necessary to reflection
							and on board ship they are impracticable— On this passage I rise at
							about 7 in the morning—breakfast at eight—dine at one afternoon—take tea
							at 6. and <hi rend="italic">turn in</hi> between 11 and 12 at night— The
							intervals are all pass’d alike— When the weather is fair, upon deck,
							gazing at the skies and the waves; and occasionally looking through the
							spy-glass at some other vessel we chance to see.— The rest of the time I
							read— But merely to pass the time; and with a rapidity proportioned to
							the weakness of attention. I am just finishing the Lycée or Cours de
							Littérature of <persRef ref="laharpe-jean">Le Harpe</persRef>, as far as
							it is yet published, that is the 14<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> volume— I
							suppose there must be at least seven more volumes to come— And the whole
							will not be worth <persRef ref="blair-hugh">Blairs</persRef> Lectures—
							The book is however amusing— He has indeed nothing original— For his
							theory he analyses <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="cassius">Longinus</persRef>, <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>, <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="quintilian-marcus">Quintilian</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="boileau-nicolas">Boileau</persRef>, as for the application he
							still analyses the great writers of antient &amp; modern french
							literature. This method might perhaps be prescribed by the character of
							the authors auditory at the Lyceum, and has its use for the reader; but
							it injures the work as an elementary treatise.</p>
