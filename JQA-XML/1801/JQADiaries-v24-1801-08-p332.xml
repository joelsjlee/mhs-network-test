						<p><date>31. </date>With the wind at Southwest this was a very fine day. We

							great change in the colour of the water, the smoothness of the sea, and
							the land-birds we saw indicating the proximity of the land we sounded
							this evening at 8, and found bottom at 14 fathoms— We are therefore not
							more than that number of leagues from the shore; that is our Longitude
