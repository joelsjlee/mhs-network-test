								Southard</persRef> brought me all the proceedings of the
							Court-Martial on the case of <persRef ref="porter-david">Captain
								Porter</persRef>— And proposed that we should read them together—
							But the defence was incomplete— <persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter
								Jones</persRef> was his Counsel, and although the Court had directed
							that the defence should be delivered in writing, Jones had complied with
							this direction only in appearance, speaking as if from a written paper,
							but in reality expatiating from a brief— This defence was delivered last
							Friday and Saturday; and by the indulgence of the Court Jones was
							allowed till Monday, to produce it in writing— It was then not ready,
							and the Court adjourned from day to day that he might bring it in, till
							Wednesday—the Court then passed an order that if the defence should not
							be delivered the next morning they would make up their decision without
							it—of which they directed the judge Advocate to give notice to Captain
							Porter— The next day, that is yesterday a manuscript, purporting to be
							the defence upon the first charge was delivered in, with a promise that
							the rest should be furnished as soon as possible— The Court however made
							up their decision without waiting for it, and thus the papers were
							brought to me—with an additional manuscript of about half the defence on
							the second charge, which was delivered to the judge Advocate this
							morning; but had not been before the Court—and it was stated that the
							remainder would be ready in the course of this day. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard said <persRef ref="coxe-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coxe</persRef>, the judge
							Advocate had told him, that the manuscript differed materially from the
							defence as it was delivered in Court— I observed to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard that I could receive and act upon
							no paper, not transmitted to me by the Court <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> <pb type="ms"
								n="904"/>itself; and yet that it would be extremely irksome to me to
							decide upon the sentence of the Court, without that which the accused
							considered as his defence— I thought it best therefore, not to read any
							of the papers at present; but to send them back to the Court, together
							with that portion of the defence which had been delivered this morning
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coxe, and with an intimation to the
							Court of my wish, that they would so far indulge the accused as to
							receive and transmit the remainder of his defence— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard prepared accordingly such a
							Letter, which after a slight revision was transmitted with the papers to
							the Court— <persRef ref="brown-jacob">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							Inquiry in a case of <persRef ref="cummings-alexander">Major A.

								>Wingate</persRef> are about to return home to the State of Maine;
							apparently anxious for a decision upon the charges against <persRef
