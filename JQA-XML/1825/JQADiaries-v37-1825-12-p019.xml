						<p><persRef ref="graham-george">George Graham</persRef> came to take

								ref="butler-robert">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								Butler</persRef>, and the Delegate <persRef ref="white-joseph"
								>Joseph M White</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham
							thought if it should be advisable to sell the Lands, the sales should be
							postponed to the autumn of the next year— I had met <persRef
								ref="hagner-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hagner</persRef>
							riding on horseback this morning, and desired him to call upon me— He
							came, and I mentione’d to him the claim of <persRef
								ref="mckenney-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								M’Kenney</persRef>, the reports against it of two Clerks, one in
								<persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef> the fifth Auditor’s and one in <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller’s; and the reply of <persRef
								ref="coxe-unknown3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coxe</persRef> to
							this Report— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hagner if he would
							take and examine the Accounts, and give his opinion upon M’Kenney’s
							claim— After some conversation concerning it; he said he would wish
							first to speak of it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasonton, to
							which I acceded.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> spoke very
							doubtfully of the issue of his negotiations with the Creeks, and
							somewhat despondingly— They are excessively anxious to have the line of
							the Chattahouchy river, which would leave them still some territory in
							Georgia— I said I thought this inadmissible— It would still leave the
							root of the controversy in the ground— It will be better to lay the
							Treaty as it is, before Congress, to decide upon it as they think
							proper, than to set it aside and form another leaving the bone of
							contention, still to be fought for— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef> was here twice,
							once with some papers of the Department, and afterwards with a Letter
							from <persRef ref="walsh-robert">Walsh</persRef>, asking that a copy of
							the Message might be forwarded to him by the Mail of the Morning before
							it shall have been delivered in— I desired M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brent to see Force concerning it— <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							came inclining to the wish that I would recommend in the Message the
							project of a Breakwater near the mouth of Delaware River— But as it is a
							measure for the peculiar advantage only of the City of Philadelphia, I
							thought it would be better that it should be introduced by the Memorial
							from the Chamber of Commerce—without apparent recommendation from the
							Executive— Most of the other names in the margin, are of Members of
							Congress who called on visits— They are now coming in numerously every
							day. <persRef ref="derby-richard">Captain Richard Derby</persRef> is an

								ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General</persRef>, who he said had
							been several days uneasy before I had called upon him for a Report on
							the Administration of the Office— I told him the delay had been
							altogether accidental; and that mention was made in the Message of his
							management of the Department, in a manner which I trusted would be
							satisfactory to him— He said he had talked with <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
							and he thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean would exercise

							candidate for the Speaker’s chair or not— That last Spring he had

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef>; but he had lately
							heard it was very doubtful whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor
							could be elected; and many of his friends had urged him to be a
							candidate— That it would be inconvenient to him; as it would prevent him
							from taking part in the debates on the floor, and would deprive him of
							the means of practising in the Supreme Court— But he thought he should
							be governed by the advice of his friends— Watkins said he had mentioned
							this to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> who had desired him strongly to dissuade Webster,
							from placing himself in competition with Taylor— Watkins asked if he
							should say anything to Webster from me— I said he might tell him that he
							had assured me last Spring, that he would not stand in competition with
							Taylor; but would aid his election with all his influence— I had nothing
							further to say. <persRef ref="macdonald-unknown">Captain

								>Thornton</persRef> came from Alexandria; Editor of the Phoenix

							introduced <persRef ref="gray-unknown7">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gray</persRef>, recommended to him, as an ardent political friend of
							mine— Visits from 17. members of the House, two of the Senate and 1
							delegate. <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>
							brought with him a Letter from the Creek delegation on the subject of
							the Negotiation with them; declining any cession of their lands beyond

									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Gaines</persRef>. There are

								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had

								>Vice-President</persRef>—thought he had used him ill; and intrigued

						<p>Rose with the dawn— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> called immediately
							after Breakfast, and I pointed out to him a passage of his Report, in
							which I advised an omission of a few words; of which he immediately
							perceived the propriety— I heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef> this morning from
							Philippians 1.11. “Being filled with the fruits of Righteousness, which
							are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.” He announced

								<persRef ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lloyd</persRef> of Massachusetts and <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> calling to
							visit me— Webster said that with regard to the Election of Speaker, he
							should act precisely as he had told me last Spring, and that what
								<persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> had said to me yesterday was altogether of his own
							conclusions— <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Livingston</persRef> of Louisiana, and <persRef
								ref="verplanck-gulian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. C.
								Verplanck</persRef> had called on <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> and left Cards for me— I received visits afterwards
							from <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef> of New-York, and <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane</persRef> of Delaware— In the
							afternoon I heard at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef>’s a Stranger from Hosea 11.8. “How shall
							I give thee up, <persRef ref="ephraim">Ephraim</persRef>? how shall I
							deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set
							thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are
							kindled together.”— There is a singularity, an obscurity, a sublimity in
							this text which led me to expect flights of enthusiasm from the
							preacher. But his discourse was cool and rational, and all the inference
							that he drew from it was the great reluctance with which the Supreme
							Creator inflicts punishment upon Sinners— <persRef ref="taylor-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John W. Taylor</persRef> spent
							the Evening with me, conversing upon the prospect of Speaker’s Election,
							and upon the composition of the Committees in the event of his success.
							He has encouragement to expect 109. votes, but from encouraging
							expectations, in such cases large deductions must always be made— The
							duplicity practised on elections by ballot is matter of no flattering
							speculation upon human nature— Where the issue of such an election is
							doubtful, there are numbers, who excite hopes in all the candidates with
							a view to have credit with the successful one for having contributed to
							his victory. I hear that M’Lane is very sanguine in his expectations of
							success, and <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Stevenson</persRef> of
							Virginia expects to make a strong poll also— With regard to the
							Committees, I supposed he could not displace the Chairmen generally who
							had been such in the last Congress, but he was disposed to arrange the
							members so that Justice may be done as far as is practicable to the
							Administration— I wrote little this evening.</p>

						<p>This day commenced the first Session of the 19<hi rend="superscript"

							Speaker of the House of Representatives at the second Ballot. His

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane</persRef> of Delaware and
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stevenson</persRef> of Virginia; neither of whom had more than 40
							votes at the first ballot. Taylor had 89. and at the second ballot 99—
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> came to announce to me the
							first result; and <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Watkins</persRef> the second— <persRef

							M.H.R. came with a new Colleague, <persRef ref="vanhorn-espy">M<hi

							named <persRef ref="cummins-unknown2">Cummins</persRef>, for a visit of
							curiosity— <persRef ref="towson-nathan">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Towson</persRef> came to introduce <persRef

								<persRef ref="handy-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Handy</persRef> and <persRef ref="gallaudet-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallaudet</persRef>, for a

								Tingey</persRef>, for a visit; much afflicted at the rumours in
							circulation, about the leaking of the Brandywine— Says she is a very
							fine ship; but was laden too deeply—32 pounders being too heavy metal
							for a frigate. <persRef ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								James Lloyd</persRef> came, and we signed and sealed two Deeds as
							Trustees, to convey the Estate of the late <persRef ref="apthorp-g">G.
								W. Apthorp</persRef> and his <persRef ref="apthorp-anna"
								>wife</persRef> now both deceased— These deeds were sent to us by
								<persRef ref="thatcher-peter">Peter Thacher</persRef>— The Trusts
							were created in 1803 and 1804. by Deeds drawn by me— To carry into
							effect the bequests of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Apthorp’s Will.
							There were now, (our signatures) were witnessed by my Sons <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and are yet to be acknowledged before a
							Magistrate. The Secretaries of the Treasury and Navy, were here in the
							Morning, and those of State and War, after the adjournment of the
							Houses— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> said that he
							had tried last Evening to see the members of the House from New-Jersey
							but could not find them— <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> brought papers relating
							to the appointment of Officers to two Revenue Cutters— <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							brought me a Treaty which he had signed with the Minister of Guatemala—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> the draft of
							his answer to the deputation of Creek Indians positively declining to
							treat on the basis of accepting a cession bounded by the Chatahouchy—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay strongly inclined to treat on
							the basis of accepting the Chatahoucy for the boundary, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour intimated a similar opinion— He
							proposed to consult the members of the Georgia Delegation, to which I
							assented— They spoke of the Election of Speaker— There were 193 members
							present—97 necessary to a choice— At the first ballot Taylor had 89.—J.
							W. Campbell 40. M’Lane 36. Stevenson 17. <persRef ref="condict-lewis">L.
								Condict</persRef> 6. Scattering 5— At the second ballot Taylor 99.
							M’Lane 44. Campbell 42. Stevenson 5. Scattering 3. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell’s votes were from Pennsylvania
							and Tennessee, chiefly. M’Lane’s from Georgia, South-Carolina, and
							partly from Virginia— Stevenson’s mostly from Virginia with some from
							North-Carolina— Clay thinks the election evidence of the strength of the
							Administration; insisting that many of the members have strong personal
							objections to Taylor— The New-Jersey members all voted for D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Condict at the first ballot; which
							accounts for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard’s not having been
							able to find them last Evening— I was engaged all this

						<p>This is a list of a part of this day’s visitors, for there were eight or
							ten others whose names and persons equally escaped me— They are almost
							all members of Congress, paying visits of civility. <persRef
								ref="ruffin-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruffin</persRef>
							who came with <persRef ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef>
							is an Inhabitant of Cincinnati, and brought me friendly remembrances of
							my Classmate <persRef ref="mayo-daniel">Daniel Mayo</persRef>.</p>
						<p>It was half past eleven when the Committee from the two Houses came, and
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith</persRef> speaking for
							them said they had been appointed to inform me, that they had assembled,
							and were ready to receive any communication I should be pleased to make
							to them— I answered that I would thank them to inform the two houses of
							Congress, that I proposed to make them a Communication in writing this
							day at 12 O’Clock, upon which they immediately departed— At 12 O’Clock I
							sent accordingly my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> with
							the Message— There were with it Reports and Documents from the
							Secretaries of War and the Navy; a Report from the <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General</persRef>, and printed Copies
							of the Treaty with the Republic of Colombia; the Ratifications of which
							have been exchanged since the close of the last Session of Congress. The
							Secretary of War had sent only one copy of his Report and the
							accompanying documents— Of all the other papers there was a copy for
							each house— And apprehensive that one of the houses might think itself
							neglected, I sent to the War Department for a second copy of <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>’s Report, which
								<persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major Van de Venter</persRef>
							afterwards brought. The delivery of this annual Message is one of the
							principal duties of the President of the United States, and there is a
							deep responsibility attached to it. The bustle of the day and the
							multitude of visitors suspended much reflection, and relieved in part
							the intense anxiety that I am unable entirely to suppress. I await with
							whatever composure I can command the issue. <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> took my approval for the site of a Navy-Yard at
							Pensacola, to annex a copy of it to the documents sent to Congress.
							Southard speaking of the Election of <persRef ref="taylor-john"
								>Taylor</persRef> yesterday, said he was excessively unpopular, and
							mentioned objections to him which he had heard last Night for the first
							time— I told him I had never heard of them before, and was exceedingly
							sorry to hear of them now— But they were objections of a nature usually
							overlooked in public men— I believed myself that the Southern rancour
							against him upon the Missouri questions, the anti-Clintonian rancour
							against him in New-York, and his attachment to me, had been causes quite
							sufficient to account for his unpopularity without resorting to tales of
							Scandal— <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> had papers concerning the fraudulent failure of
								<persRef ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thomson</persRef> at
							Philadelphia, by which, there is danger that the United States will lose
							nearly a Million of dollars. Governor Barbour came and seemed strongly
							inclined to treat with these Creek Indians upon the basis of taking the
							Chatahoochy for the boundary. I agreed to a meeting of the members of
							the Administration concerning it at one to-morrow. Evening spent in
							writing.</p>

						<p>The stream of visitors began immediately after breakfast and continued
							until Noon when the Houses of Congress met— In the succession of them
							for more than two hours, the names of several of them passed unheeded—
							This owing to the multitude, it was impossible to avoid. The
							conversations with them all were upon ordinary subjects. <persRef

								King</persRef> as Minister to Great-Britain— <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							came with a list of the Officers of the Treasury Department and Customs
							appointed since the recess of Congress— Cabinet Meeting at one— Present
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barbour</persRef> S.W. and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> S.N. The question
							for discussion was upon the answer to be given to the deputation of
							Creek Indians— Governor Barbour read their Letter and the draft of his
							answer— <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef> had been
							authorised to propose to them a cession of all their Lands in the State
							of Georgia— His Journal states that this was his proposal— But they now
							say that they understood the Pproposal to be the Chatahouchy for the
							boundary— And <persRef ref="crowell-john">Crowell</persRef> the Agent
							sustains them in the allegation— But Gaines had no authority either to
							propose, or to accede to this— And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							thought this the principal difficulty of the case— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> had been at his house, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster had urged above all things not to let the Georgia
							question go before Congress— And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							said his great apprehension was that if it went before Congress they
							would do nothing—and he shewed the various motives by which different
							members would be actuated to do nothing— I asked him if this would not
							release the Executive from the obligation to do any thing also— We ask
							of Congress to annul the Treaty, or to furnish the means to compel the
							execution of it by the Indians— Congress do nothing— We consider the
							Treaty as binding, but the Indians refuse to comply, and remain on the
							Lands after September 1826— We have no means to compel their compliance
							and therefore can do nothing till Congress meet again— After much
							discussion it was concluded that the Secretary of War should answer the
							Letter of the Indians, declining to treat except on the basis of the
							cession of all the Lands’ in Georgia, and should call upon General
							Gaines to explain the difference between his views of the proposals last
							made by him to the Indians, and their understanding of it— The meeting
							adjourned about four O’Clock— <persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P.
								Cook</persRef> spent the great part of the Evening with me— I
							attempted writing with little success.</p>

								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> at the Presidential Election, but he did not mean

								Clay</persRef>— He thought he could not vote for the nomination of

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef>—one was that he

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King say, that the Mississippi ought

							further in this manner when other persons came in and interrupted him—
							He took leave saying he would call again— I had desired <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> came first with a
							reply from the Delegation of Indians lamenting the failure of their
							proposals, and asking another interview with me, to lay their grievances
							and pour out their afflictions before me— Governor Barbour said he had
							mentioned this desire of theirs to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>—who observed that they saw no objection to my
							seeing the Indians again according to their desire. I said I would
							readily see them before they should go away— But it would be best to
							postpone the meeting for the present— At this time they would only set
							forth their distress, and throw themselves upon my Mercy and Compassion—
							If I should answer them inflexibly, it would only increase their
							distress— If I indulged any sympathy for them, it would imply censure
							upon the Treaty, which we must yet maintain, and would be offensive to
							Georgia— Perhaps we may yet come to some agreement— I desired him
							therefore to answer the Indians that I would certainly hear them again
							before they should return home—but I wished it might be a pleasant
							comfortable talk, and advised them to take time and reflect to see if
							they could not make some other proposition, to which we may agree—
							Governor Barbour said he had not yet received any answer from <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Gaines</persRef>—but his Aid de Camp <persRef ref="butler-unknown3"
								>Butler</persRef> had admitted, that the last proposition made by
							the General at his last meeting with the Indians was to take the
							Chatahoochy for a boundary— It is strange—for the General had no
							authority to make it. But it changes the aspect of the subject— If he
							has given them encouragement to expect this boundary, we are under the
							stronger obligations to consider their claims— Governor Barbour still
							inclines strongly to take the Chatahoochy, and says that <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> told him he would prefer it
							rather than a recommendation to Congress to annul the Treaty as
							fraudulent and <persRef ref="meriwether-james">Merriwether</persRef>
							admitted to him that there was great convenience in a river for a
							boundary— Barbour’s second call was to say that <persRef ref="archer-s"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Arther</persRef> the
							Inspector General was dead, and to propose that <persRef
								ref="nourse-charles">Nourse</persRef> the late acting adjutant

							of a Letter which he wrote to the <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd</persRef> spoke on several

							him—and lastly of the proceedings on <persRef ref="porter-david"
								>Commodore Porter</persRef>’s trial— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Lathrop</persRef> and <persRef ref="rose-robert2">Rose</persRef> of

								>r</hi> Bailey spoke of several Resolutions, which he has offered in
							the House of Representatives, concerning Roads and Canals, and an
							Amendment of the Constitution— He said he had not shewn me those
							Resolutions before he offered them, on account of the imputations upon
							him heretofore, arising from his former relations to me in the
							Department of State— I told him that the discussion of his Resolutions
							might be useful, but I must in candour say that my opinions did not
							concur with them— I thought the power of making Roads and Canals, given
							by the Constitution; and then an Amendment asking the grant of that
							which was already granted; equally impracticable and useless— <persRef
								ref="vandeventer-christopher">Vandeventer</persRef> came for some
							papers relating to the Creek and Georgia controversy <pb type="ms"
								n="32"/><persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Dickins</persRef> brought me
							as I had requested a list of the Members of the Columbian Institute; and

								<persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> to the Society on the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January next— He spoke also of his own situation; his
							wish for a more lucrative place than that which he now has at the
							Treasury; and of his disappointment in the recent election of <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">Walter Lowry</persRef>, as Secretary of the
							Senate. Dickins said he had been not only disappointed but deceived by
							many of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>’s friends who had encouraged him to
							expect their votes for that office; and yet he could not account for the
							election of Lowry unless several of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef>’s friends had joined in voting for him.
							He then enlarged upon the services he had rendered especially during the
							last two years in the Treasury—intimating that he had really performed
							all the duties of the Secretary— And he added that he supposed I knew
							that he had been the medium of communication between the Treasury
							Department, and the President, after all personal communication between
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford had ceased— This fact had not before been known to
							me; and I told Dickins so— He said that a few weeks before the close of
							the Administration, some words used by <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had induced the latter to abstain
							thenceforward from coming to this house, or ever seeing M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe again— When M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard came in I asked him if this fact had been known to
							him— He said yes— That one day last Winter, on coming here on business,
							he found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe walking to and fro across
							the room in great agitation— That he told him Crawford had just left
							him— He had come to him concerning the nomination of certain Officers of
							the Customs, in Northern Ports— That Crawford recommended the nomination
							of several persons against whom M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe
							expressed several objections—that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, at last rose, in much irritation, gathered the papers
							together; and said petulantly; well—if you will not appoint the persons
							well qualified for the places, tell me whom you will appoint; that I may
							get rid of their importunities: M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe
							replied with great warmth; saying that he considered Crawford’s language
							as extremely improper, and unsuitable to the relations between them,
							when Crawford turning to him, raised his Cane, as in the attitude to
							strike, and said “you damned infernal old Scoundrel”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe seized the tongs at the fire-place
							for self-defence; applied a retaliatory epithet to Crawford and told him
							he would immediately ring for servants <unclear>himself</unclear> and
							turn him out of the house upon which Crawford beginning to recover
							himself said he did not intend and had not intended to insult him; and
							left the house— They never met, afterwards— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard does not recollect the precise day upon which this
							happened— I told him that if I had known it at the time, I should not
							have invited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford to remain in the
							Treasury Department— It resembles the Scene between <persRef

							which I thought Congress would eagerly catch at, without a corresponding
							zeal for increasing the duty as recommended on fine Cottons. I advised
							him not to be sanguine in expecting an increase of Revenue next year,
							proportional to the increase of this over the last— I remarked various

								<persRef ref="crogham-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							that of 75 Officers on the army list, there are not more than five from

							compensation for services during the late War— He said he had hitherto
							abstained from claiming it; from a sentiment of delicacy— But his
							circumstances were not now so prosperous as they had been, and he was
							disposed to demand, what was his right. He referred for precedent to

									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> spent a couple of hours with me this

							Judiciary, and the establishment of a new Executive Department, one of
							which is in his charge as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and the
							other, as Chairman of a Select Committee to whom that part of the
							Message has been referred in the House of Representatives— He says that
							the question in the Committee is between the appointment of two or of
							three additional Judges of the Supreme Court— I supposed two would be
							sufficient; and the number then being nine a positive majority of the
							Court would always be secured—which could never be certain if the number
							of judges were ten— Webster said that some members of the Committee and
							of the House were afraid of the consequences of taking Western Judges—
							Afraid of the judge-breaking temper now prevailing in some part of the
							western Country— I said that this Spirit was subsiding; and that men of
							sound principle, and determined integrity could be found in the western
							Country as in any other part of the Union—and I named as examples
								<persRef ref="white-hugh">H. L. White</persRef> of Tennessee, and
								<persRef ref="mclean-john2">J. M’Lean</persRef> of Ohio: to which he
							fully assented; and said he should urge his Committee to the addition of
							two new Judges; and would only agree to three if the Committee should
							positively so insist. With regard to the new Executive Department he
							said he had not yet called the Committees together; and he wished for
							some information— I said if it was possible in any manner to obtain this
							from Congress, it must be by a very short act expressing in very general
							terms the objects committed to it. The Internal Correspondence; the
							Roads and Canals; the Indians; and the Patent-Office. <pb type="ms"
								n="35"/>I referred him to the papers of <persRef
								ref="woodward-augustus">judge Woodward</persRef> on a home
							Department in the National Journal, but observed that was a plan, upon a
							scale much too large, for the approbation of Congress to being with— I
							have indeed no expectation of success with this Congress, for any such
							establishment; even upon the simplest plan— I invited M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster to come and spend the Evening with
							me, whenever it might suit his leisure and convenience.</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, who had caused inquiry
							to be made of the clerk of the House, who had given assurance that no
							such Resolution had been adopted— I had relied upon this information,
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer by a reference to the House’s
							Journal shewed that the Resolution had been adopted, and promised to see
							it carried into Execution. Mercer said he would send me some fresh
							Letters he had received complaining of the conduct of the <persRef
								ref="tait-charles">judge</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="armstrong-francis">Marshal</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="owen-george">Owen</persRef> of Alabama had told him he believed
							the charges to be true— He said also that he had forborne to speak upon
							the subject to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, because his Son in
							Law was one of the persons implicated in the transaction— <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">Rush</persRef> brought a list of the Directors of
							the Bank of the United States appointed by the Government every year
							since the commencement of the Institution— <persRef
								ref="jennings-jonathan">Jennings</persRef> came to enquire at whose
							recommendation <persRef ref="noble-noah">Noah Noble</persRef> had been
							appointed Receiver of Public Monies at Indianapolis— I told him by those
							of the whole delegation from Indiana, except himself, of the <persRef
								ref="ray-james">Governor of the State</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="vawter-john">Marshal Vawter</persRef> and many others— I read
							to him most of the Letters— He said Noble was well qualified for the
							Office, but there was dissatisfaction among the people of Indiana at his
								<pb type="ms" n="36"/>appointment, because he was a brother of the
								<persRef ref="noble-james">Senator Noble</persRef>, and a brother
							also to the <persRef ref="noble-lazarus">preceding Receiver</persRef>—
							He seemed somewhat surprized at the recommendations of <persRef
								ref="hendricks-william">Hendricks</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="test-john">Test</persRef>; but their practice in that State is
							to recommend or certify the qualification of every person who applies to
							them; and then each one by a private communication indicates his
							particular favourite— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay called to
							enquire respecting drafts of answers which he had prepared to a Letter
							from the <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor of
								Massachusetts</persRef> concerning the Eastern Boundary, and to one
							from the <persRef ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">French
							Minister</persRef>, concerning the arrest of deserting Seamen. He also
							mentioned a Resolution introduced into the Legislature of Kentucky by
								<persRef ref="crittenden-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crittenden</persRef>, and said <persRef ref="johnson-richard">R. M.
								Johnson</persRef> had told him of a long discussion, between

							1.23.24. “But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling

							both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” I
							had heard last Sunday afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s
							Church a modest and well written discourse on the first part of the same
							text—but this was an Athenasian Anathema, which the preacher concluded
							by telling his whole Auditory, that however they might flatter

							they would not believe that “we preach Christ crucified,” means that all
							the sins of all mankind past, present and to come, from the beginning to
							the end of time, have been, are and will be atoned for by the blood of
							Christ— When I sit and hear men, otherwise of good sense dwelling with
							intense interest and evident anxious sincerity upon such doctrines I
							muse upon the absurdities of the human intellect— We see however that
							men may believe it all, and be just and honest in the intercourse of
							life— <persRef ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef> called
							immediately after we had dined and spent the Evening with me— He still
							talks of closing the business of his Agency for the Massachusetts claim;
							that is leaving it unsettled and fixing himself down in the practice of
							the Law at New-York— He asked my advice concerning it, and I advised him
							to go there, on his statement of encouragement that he has received from
							friends there— He also told me that when the Commission for adjusting
							Claims upon Spain had been instituted under the Florida Treaty, he had
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe to appoint him one of the
							Commissioners— <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Crowell</persRef> called this morning, as I had desired <persRef

								<persRef ref="campbell-duncan">Campbell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="meriwether-james">Merriwether</persRef> were both Georgians,
							and acted much more as such than as Officers of the United States. Their

							exposition of their proceedings, criminating Crowell, <persRef
								ref="andrews-t">Major Andrews</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef>, and other persons, but
							very feeble as a vindication of themselves— I read over the parts of
							this Document which bore upon the conduct and character of Crowell and
							advised him to reduce to writing the substance of what he said to me, in
							refutation of their charges against him— He contradicts in positive
							terms many of the most important of their supposed statements of facts—
								<persRef ref="gurley-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Felch</persRef>, late a Chaplain in the Navy, who resigned to avoid
							a trial by Court Martial; and now pretends to claim a Court Martial, and
							that he did not resign. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay brought the
							account of the Capitulation of the Castle of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Juan D’Ulloa at Vera-Cruz— He mentioned also having had a
							long conference with <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron

								Russia</persRef> to interpose with the Spanish Government to induce
							their acknowledgment of the Southern American Republics, with a view to
							save the Islands of Cuba and Porto-Rico, from invasion and conquest— The
							Emperor has taken the subject for advisement; manifesting much
							satisfaction at the proposal’s being made to him, and a disposition
							rather friendly to it. Baron Tuyll is very earnest in the desire that we
							should in the interval interpose, to prevent the invasion; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay proposed writing to <persRef
								ref="salazar-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							been overlooked— Spoke something of directing the Canal to that City;
							thought it a much better site for a Navy-Yard than Washington, and was
							much averse to a territorial Government— I assured them of my kind and
							friendly dispositions, towards Alexandria— Judge Cranch took my
							acknowledgment of the Apthorp deeds— <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi

							an Inspector General of the Army, and appeared to be deeply disappointed
							when I told him that I had concluded to nominate <persRef

								Croghan</persRef>— The General repeated what he had before

							Inspectors General are as it were the eyes of the Commander in Chief,
							and that in all services, they are viewed as Officers to be specially
							designated by him. That he had no personal objection to Col<hi

							and was perfectly well qualified; but he is not now in the army, and the
							army would feel itself deeply wronged, if a person not of the army
							should be appointed to this Office. The General left me under great

						<p><persRef ref="trimble-david">Trimble</persRef> called to converse with me
							upon a Resolution of the House of Representatives adopted on his motion,
							calling for a copy of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>’s secret Message
							to both Houses of Congress of 18. January 1803—he said he had purposely
							added to the Resolution, a call for any other document relating to the
							same subject that I might think proper to communicate; because he said
							there were people in the Western Country who took great pains to
							represent me as unfriendly to the interests of that portion of the
							Union. That <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef> especially had
							been doing so, all the summer, and was still by his correspondence doing
							the same thing— That he Trimble had seen some papers of mine,
							particularly a despatch to <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton</persRef>, in the
							Negotiation concerning the N.W. Coast, which proved very different
							sentiments to be entertained by me, from those imputed to me by
							Benton—and he wished to give me an opportunity if I thought proper to
							send any such papers with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s
							Message— I thanked him for his good intention, but thought I could not
							with propriety send the despatch to Middleton with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s Message; which I read to
							Trimble. <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef> came to recommend <persRef ref="davis-john3">J. B.
								Davis</persRef> for an appointment as Secretary of Legation, and to
							speak again about his Resolutions for amending the Constitution, but we
							were again interrupted— <persRef ref="williams-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Williams</persRef> of Tennessee
							is to be nominated as Charge d’Affaires to the Federation of Central
							America— From one O’Clock till near five was the Cabinet Meeting upon
							the Affairs with the Creek Indians and Georgia— The letter from the
							Creek Delegation, finally refusing the cession of all their lands within
							the State of Georgia was read much desultory conversation was had upon
							the course to be pursued— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> said <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>
							of Georgia had told him yesterday, that he had infinitely rather that we
							should take a cession to the Chatahoochy, than that the Treaty should be
							sent to Congress, although as Representatives of Georgia they must
							protest against any thing short of the late Treaty— Governor Barbour
							recurred to his plan for incorporating the Indians within the States of
							the Union—ceasing to make Treaties with them at all; but considering
							them as altogether subject to our Laws— I asked him if he did not think
							there would be made question of the Constitutional Power of Congress to
							change so essentially the character of our Relations with the Indian
							tribes— He said he had no doubt there would; but that it would soon be
							unavoidably necessary to come to such a System— <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> said
							he thought it would be impracticable— That it was impossible to civilize
							Indians— That there never was a full blooded Indian who took to
							civilization— It was not in their nature— He believed they were destined
							to extinction—and although he would never use or countenance inhumanity
							towards them, he did not think them as a race, worth preserving. He
							considered them as essentially inferior to the Anglo–Saxon race, which
							were now taking their place on this Continent— They were not an
							improvable breed; and their <pb type="ms" n="41"/>disappearance from the
							human family will be no great loss to the world— In point of fact they
							were rapidly disappearing, and he did not believe that in fifty years
							from this time there would be any of them left— Governor Barbour was
							somewhat shocked at these opinions, for which I fear there is too much
							foundation— But the question was what should now be done— The
							observation suggested yesterday by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Forsyth gave the idea that the Secretary of War should write to the
							Georgia delegation, stating to them the refusal of the Creeks to cede
							their whole lands in Georgia, and their offer to cede to the
							Chatahoochy, and enquiring whether this would be acceptable to Georgia.
							It was supposed that the Georgia delegation would send an insulting and
							violent refusal for answer—but this at least will take from them
							hereafter—the power of reproaching us for not obtaining the cession to
							the Chatahoochy, when it was in our power, with the pretence that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth had distinctly though verbally
							given us to understand that it would be acceptable to Georgia— A
							treacherous reference to things said or pretended to have been said in
							private Conversations, has been much resorted to by the Georgians in
							this controversy. It was concluded that Governor Barbour should write
							this Letter— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Southard</persRef> shewed me the draft of a Bill to be
							presented by the naval Committee of the House, to establish a naval
							School. After ten O’Clock this Evening <persRef ref="taylor-john">M<hi

							enquired what hour it would be most convenient to me to receive them— I
							said I was at home after breakfast time, the whole day; that ten O’Clock

							Thomas wants an appointment of paymaster in the army for his Son in Law
								<persRef ref="hamtramck-john">Hamtramck</persRef>, and I have no

							offered very grossly the Department of State to M<hi rend="superscript"

							Correspondence beyond Sea, without danger of its being intercepted, and
							for which he desires a compensation. I had forgotten the receipt of this
							Letter but it was soon found— I asked the Bishop what compensation would

							censure of selling offices, an objection which he said he had intimated
							to the projector as likely to be made— I observed also that I had not
							the means of determining the value of the secret. He said it had been so
							disclosed to him, that he could form a tolerably correct estimate of its
							value— It might be useful in time of War to a Country possessing distant
							Colonies, but he believed could not be of much use to this Country under
							its present circumstances. <persRef ref="bradley-william2"

							supposed and told Meech that the nomination of <persRef ref="fisk-james"
								>Fisk</persRef> had been sent in to the Senate; but on enquiry I
							found it had not, and as Bradley expressed a wish that it might be

							in. Bradley said there were very heavy charges against Fisk, some of
							which he was afraid were true. But he had enjoyed greatly the confidence

							nomination from the line of the army— Insisting that in all services
							that Officer is always and peculiarly designated by the commanding
							General— That all the Officers of the army will consider it as a slight
							upon the army itself, and the result of unkind feelings towards them— I
							desired Taylor to say to General Brown that these impressions were
							entirely erroneous— That my feelings towards him and the army were
							altogether friendly. That I hoped to have in the course of the
							Administration some opportunity to give him an unequivocal proof of it—
							That the nomination first intended to have been made was forborne out of
							deference to his wishes; that if I had known that he took the matter so
							deeply to heart I would have asked the Secretary at War to reconsider
							his recommendation of Croghan. But it was now too late. He had made the
							recommendation in writing; it was on record at the War Department— I had
							promised and prepared to send it in— I could not change it now without
							justly incurring the imputation of wavering and indecision—taking the
							bias of the last person who may have access to me; and to be relied upon
							for anything— Taylor said he entirely agreed with me in this opinion,
							and would immediately report to the General my determination and the
							reasons upon which it is founded—</p>

								>Governor Barbour</persRef> who came in while we were conversing on

							Politics were to form no objection, I thought <persRef

							implicated in some degree of suspicion— Wurtz was a little discomposed

							Message, but not from that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson—
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> called this Evening, and told me, what occurred
							while they were sitting with closed doors. As a confidential message was

							presented a Memorial asking to be released from this judgment which he

							urge that <persRef ref="williams-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Williams</persRef> should be appointed Minister Plenipotentiary
							to the Federation of Central America, instead of Charge d’Affaires.
							Williams was a Senator from Tennessee, and two years since was
							superseded by the overpowering influence of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> who was chosen in his
							place— He has ever since been kept under the harrow in the State, by the

							Senate, some of his former associate partizans of <persRef

								Crawford</persRef>, have whispered to him that this Office of Charge
							d’Affaires is not of sufficient dignity for him, and that he is
							degrading himself by accepting it— General Van Rensselaer said he had
							agreed to mention this to me, and if the rank of the Mission could not
							be raised, to ask if I could not promise him something higher hereafter—
							I told the General that I should be happy to accommodate M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams, and to gratify him— But the
							nomination was made— If I could even nominate again to the higher rank,
							Congress would probably not increase the appropriation, and I could make

							Collection Law, I find reason to doubt the propriety of removing the
							Collector, at least for the present, and for believing that the chief
							responsibility for the losses by Thomson, ought properly to rest upon

								<persRef ref="findlay-william">W. Findlay</persRef> the Senator from

							Pennsylvania—which is now before them—and Findlay proposed that the
							nomination should be withdrawn; and his brother <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph Ingersoll</persRef> nominated in his
							place— At the bottom of this opposition in the Senate is <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham</persRef>
							of the House, who some time since sent me several papers proving a
							slight irregularity of practice by Ingersoll, in taking a fee <pb
								type="ms" n="48"/>from the Assignees of a Bankrupt, for obtaining an
							accommodation of time, for the payment of a debt due by him to the
							United States— When Ingersoll was renominated in 1822. this same affair
							was investigated by a Committee of the Senate, and after understanding
							it thoroughly the Senate confirmed the nomination— It is now revived as
							a political intrigue with a view to displace Ingersoll. When Ingham sent
							me the papers I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush to inform
							him that the nomination of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll had
							already been sent to the Senate, and that as that body had four years
							since confirmed the nomination of him with a full knowledge of this
							affair, I did not think it now a cause for withdrawing the nomination—
							Rush had given Ingersoll notice of the movements against him, and
							Ingersoll had sent him an explanation of the whole transaction, with
							documents which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had left with me and
							which he now took to shew them to Findlay—with a hope of satisfying him

								Goodsell</persRef> came upon I know not what project— <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef> to
							repeat the solicitations from Portland, for the pardon of <persRef
								ref="amedey-john">Amedey</persRef>. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes what I had done; but that I
							believed no sentence of Death had passed upon the man— <persRef
								ref="peter-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Peter</persRef> is a member of the House of Representatives from
							Maryland; and <persRef ref="dick-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dick</persRef> whom he introduced to me is his nephew— Mills gave me
							a printed copy of the Resolution offered by <persRef ref="branch-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch</persRef> to the Senate;
							declaring that the President of the United States has no right or power
							to appoint Ambassadors or Public Ministers, but with the advice and
							consent of the Senate; except in cases of vacancy which may happen
							during the recess of the Senate. It is preceded by a whereas the
							President of the United States did by his Message at the Commencement of
							the Senate, assert that Ministers would be commissioned to Panama,
							without submitting them to the Senate— And whereas though he did submit
							them to the Senate, he yet maintained the right of sending them without
							concurrence of the Senate— Therefore to guard against the precedent
							Resolved &amp;c— I told Mills that the preamble or whereas upon which
							the Resolution was founded, was a statement incorrect in point of
							fact—charging me with having asserted that which I never did assert— I
							said I considered the Executive competent to institute a new Mission and
							appoint Ministers during the recess of the Senate, but that when the
							Senate were in Session they must be nominated. <persRef
								ref="owen-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen</persRef> came
							to make some enquiry concerning a petition to Congress by a man name
								<persRef ref="robertson-unknown5">Robertson</persRef>, who he said
							was one of his Constituents, and which the House of Representatives <pb
								type="ms" n="51"/>by a Resolution two days since referred to the
							President of the United States— I said that besides the doubt whether
							the House alone could thus dispose of a petition addressed to the
							Congress, the reference itself to the President was a very unusual; I
							believed an unexampled thing— From respect to the House, I should
							preserve their Resolution of Reference with the documents, and endeavour
							to keep them choicely upon my files— Owen said he had thought it was not
							correct to make the reference to the President; and had told <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">M’Lane</persRef> so, the Chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means, by whom the Resolution of reference was
							offered; but he said he was sure there was no intention of disrespect in
							the reference—of which I was well assured— I told Owen I would send him
							the petition and documents to do with them as he pleased. <persRef
								ref="mckee-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Kee</persRef>,
							also of the House from Alabama called to visit me, and <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour</persRef>
							the Secretary of War, brought me all the papers relating to the claim of
								<persRef ref="king-wiliam">General King</persRef> to be restored to

						<!--This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>
							</date>and <hi rend="italic">Year.</hi> The life that I lead is more
							regular than it has perhaps been at any other period of my life— It is
							established by custom that the President of the United States goes not
							abroad into any private companies, and to this usage I conform— I am
							therefore compelled to take my exercise, if at all in the morning before
							Breakfast— I rise usually between five and six; that is at this time of
							the year from an hour and a half to two hours before the Sun— I walk by
							the light of Moon or Stars, or none, about four miles, usually returning
							home in time to see the Sunrise from the Eastern chamber of the house— I
							then make my fire, and read three chapters of the Bible, with <persRef
								ref="scott-thomas">Scott</persRef>’s and <persRef ref="hewlett-john"
								>Hewlett</persRef>’s Commentaries— Read papers till 9. Breakfast;
							and from ten, till five P.M. receive a succession of Visitors; sometimes
							without intermission—very seldom with an interval of half an hour— Never
							such as to enable me to undertake my business requiring attention— From
							five to half past six we dine; after which I pass about four hours in my
							chamber alone— Writing in this Diary, or reading papers upon some public
							business—excepting when occasionally interrupted by a visitor— Between
							eleven and twelve I retire to bed; to rise again
								<unclear>symbols</unclear> at 5 or 6 the next morning.</p>
						<p>The year has been the most momentous of those that have passed over my
							head— Inasmuch as it has witnessed my elevation at the age of 58 to the
							Chief Magistracy of my Country— To the summit of laudable or at least
							blameless worldly ambition— Not however in a manner satisfactory to
							pride, or to just desire— Not by the unequivocal suffrages of a majority
							of the People— With perhaps two thirds of the whole people adverse to
							the actual result. Nearly one year of this service has already past,
							with little change of the public opinions or feelings— Without disaster
							to the Country; with an unusual degree of prosperity public and private
