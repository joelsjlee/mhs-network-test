						<p><date>22. IV.</date> I walked as usual to my ordinary bathing place, and
							came to the rock where I leave my clothes a few minutes before sunrise—
							I found several persons there, besides three or four who were bathing;
							and at the shore under the tree a boat with four men in it, and a drag
							net— There was a large two-mast boat in the channel opposite the rock;
							at anchor; and a man on the shore who requested those in the two mast
							boat, to raise their anchor, and drop thirty or forty-yards down the
							stream, as they were in the way of the boat with the drag net which was
							going in search of a dead body. I enquired if any one had been drowned,
							and the man told me it was old <persRef ref="shoemaker-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Shoemaker</persRef>, a clerk in the
							Post-Office; a man upwards of 60 years of age, who last evening between
							5 and 6 O’Clock, went in to bathe with four other persons— That he was
							drowned in full sight of them, and without a suspicion by them that he
							was even in any danger— They had observed him struggling in the water,
							but as he was an excellent swimmer had supposed he was merely diving;
							until after coming out they found he was missing— They then commenced an
							ineffectual search for him which was continued late into the night— The
							man said to me that he had never seen a more distressed person <pb
								type="ms" n="880"/>than <persRef ref="shoemaker-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Shoemaker</persRef> last Evening—
							While the two mast boat was dropping down the stream and the other boat
							was preparing to go out with the drag, I stripped and went in to the
							river; I had been not more than ten minutes swimming when the drag boat
							started, and they were not five minutes from the shore when the body
							floated immediately opposite the rock; less than one hundred yards from
							the shore, at the very edge of the channel and where there were could
							not be seven foot deep of water— I returned immediately to the shore and
							dressed— a rope was tied round one of the arms; and the boat remained at
							the spot, till a blanket had been sent for, which was spread under the
							tree; the boat then returned to the shore drawing the body through the
							water, and it was lifted from the water and brought and laid upon the
							blanket and covered up. The only part of the body which had the
							appearance of stiffness was the arms, both of which were raised at the
							shoulder joints and crooked towards each other at the elbows; as if they
							had been fixed by a spasm at the very moment when they were to expand to
							keep the head above water— There was a dark flush of settled blood over
							the face, like one excessively heated, and a few drops of thin blood and
							water issued from one ear— There was nothing terrible or offensive in
							the sight; but I returned home musing in sympathy with the distressed
							Lady; and enquiring uncertainly whether I ought to renounce altogether
							my practice of swimming in the river— My conclusion was that I ought
							not—deeming it in this climate indispensable to my health—so that
							whatever danger there may be in the exercise, and that there is much
							danger, this incident offers melancholy and cumulative proof—there would
							be yet greater danger in abstaining from it, or in substituting any
							other effective exercise in its place— We are and always must be in the
							hands of God, and to him are indebted for every breath we draw.</p>

						<p><date>Day—</date> The whole month has been more intensely warm than I had
							ever before experienced. My rising hour has ranged from four to half

							three quarters of an hour to an hour and a half— Then read an hour—
							Breakfast between 8 and 9—and receive a succession of visitors till 4 or

							retire to bed between 8 and 9— Excepting the current business transacted
							by conference with the heads of Departments, the month may be said to
							have passed away in idleness— The affect of heat to debilitate body and
							mind is the more distressing when as has been the case with me, it is
							without apparent positive sickness, its continuance with little
							intermission, wears out the Spirits, and produces dejection and
							weariness of life, with nervous irritability, and a fermentation of the
							blood, bordering upon insanity— My baths upon which I have hitherto
							relied have partially failed this Summer; and I am at least for a time
