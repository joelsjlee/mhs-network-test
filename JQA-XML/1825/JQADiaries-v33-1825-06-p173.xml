						<p>Swam with <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> 3/4 of an hour
							against the tide, towards the bridge, but without reaching it— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> came to enquire, if I had heard further from
								<persRef ref="porter-david">Captain Porter</persRef>— While he was
							with me two copies were brought in of a pamphlet, which Porter has had
							printed, addressed to me, containing a part of the Correspondence
							relating to the affair at Foxardo, the precept convening the Court of
							Inquiry—some of the proceedings before it; a defence of Porters
							transactions in that affair; and sundry documents most of which were
							rejected by the Court as not competent evidence— The reading of this
							pamphlet again occupied the day so that I wrote nothing. Porter
							complains of being oppressed, and labours to divert the attention of the
							Public from the censurable part of his conduct, by representing his
							invasion of Porto-Rico as if he had gone there in the fresh pursuit of
							Pirates. This Publication itself after notice that he would be tried by
							a Court-martial, is an appeal from the Government to the People.
								<persRef ref="rhea-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rhea</persRef> of Tennessee called to visit me— Indulging perhaps a
							Rover’s disposition. He was more than twenty years a member of the House
							of Representatives with intervals once or twice when he lost his
							Election— He is a native of Ireland, and now at least four-score years
							of age— I asked him whether he would come again— He said he did not
							know— So that he will be a Candidate, if he sees any chance of
							succeeding. <persRef ref="mccorkle-william">M’Corkle</persRef> came for
							a subscription to a Bible of parallel texts— I told him that I would
							take a copy; but it has been a uniform practice of the President’s of
							the United States not to make subscriptions— <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef> the Adjutant General brought me Lists of the
							Commissions issued from the War Department which I have signed— <persRef
								ref="appleton-john">Appleton</persRef> has come to receive final
							Instructions for his informal mission to Naples. <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown</persRef>
							came on account of the absence of the <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Secretary of War</persRef>, to enquire if there was any thing
							concerning which I wished to consult him— I asked him why the Board of
							Officers, which was convened in February to decide upon the Question of
							Rank between Generals’ <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef>, had declined giving
							any opinion upon the point immediately at issue between them. He said
							the Report of the board had been that they could give no <hi
								rend="italic">useful</hi> decision in the case; which might be
							understood that they were so equally divided in opinion that their
							decision could not be useful, as advice to the Executive. I mentioned to
							him a Letter, I had received from <persRef ref="king-wiliam">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> William King</persRef>; claiming to
							be appointed Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> of one of the Regiments
							of Artillery, now vacant— He considers the question as resting between
							him and <persRef ref="bissell-daniel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Bissell</persRef>— Brown said that King was infinitely the better
							Officer of the two— King was tried in 1819. upon several charges, one of
							which was having given an order by which a Deserter, was put to Death
							without trial. He was found guilty of this charge, and sentenced to five
							years suspension. On the reduction of the army in 1821. he was left out
							of the new arrangement—and so was Bissell— In June 1820. King wrote two
							Letters to <persRef key="monroe-james">President Monroe</persRef>, full
							of invective against the Court which had tried him; against <persRef
								ref="parker-daniel">Parker</persRef> the then Adjutant General,
							against a Committee of the House of Representatives which had reported a
							Resolution requesting the President to strike King from the rolls of the
							army— These Letters he published six weeks afterwards prefaced with an
							Address to the People— He has now sent me a copy of this pamphlet, with
							a copy annexed of a third Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe, referring to the case of a <persRef ref="wyllys-john">Major <hi
									rend="italic">Wyllys </hi></persRef><pb type="ms" n="175"/>who
							in 1786. put to death three Deserters without trial; against whom some
							measures were at first taken by the Old Congress, but whom after some
							months they directed to be discharged. With these enclosures King now
							writes me a Letter claiming this appointment to the vacant regiment, and
							extremely abusive upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— His Letter
							is not positively disrespectful to me, but says he should have more
							confidence of succeeding with <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> or <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford</persRef>, both of whom had
							expressed opinions in his favour— I told Brown that as to the roughness
							of this address towards myself, it would have no influence in my mind
							against King; but his abuse of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe was
							not all propitiatory to me; nor could I reconcile to my feelings of
							humanity the order to put to death a deserter without trial. Brown said
							the general sentiment of the army was not much against this— He had a
							decided aversion to Bissell, who he said was a gambler, and had enticed
							many young officers to the same vice, and utterly ruined them— I shall
							decide on this subject after full deliberation and consultation.
								<persRef ref="shee-parke">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Shee</persRef> brought me a Letter of introduction from <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef>— He came to enter a
							Caveat at the Patent Office, for some invention which he has in embryo,
							to turn Mill wheels, which he attempted to explain to me, and which he
							thinks very important— <persRef ref="lee-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> H. Lee</persRef> came to ask the return of a Letter from
								<persRef ref="leigh-benjamin">B. W. Leigh</persRef> to him about
							titles of Honour in this Country, which he had some days since enclosed
							to me. He asked also for an original Letter from <persRef
								ref="lee-charles">General Charles Lee</persRef>, written in 1775 and
							an old document from a Committee of the Town of Boston in 1768. which he
							had sent me some weeks since, and now concluded to leave definitively
							with me.</p>

							came for Books for the Cony female Academy at Augusta, Maine, and will

								Tingey</persRef> came to inform me that there was a frigate to be
							launched at the Navy-Yard, and to be named. She had indeed been called
							the Susquehannah, but without any authority, and might be named
							otherwise— He said she must be launched either next Monday at five in

								<persRef ref="appleton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> J. J.
								Appleton</persRef> intimated a desire to have a regular commission,
							for his mission to Naples; but I explained to him the reasons for which
							we had determined to take a different course—apparently to his
							satisfaction. <persRef ref="niederstetter-ludwig">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Niederstetter</persRef> was presented
							to me by <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> as Chargé d’Affaires from the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">King of Prussia</persRef>; he was
							dressed in a full military Uniform, and made me a set Speech according
							to the Diplomatic usage of Ministers Plenipotentiary— It was longer than
							usual, but turned upon the ordinary topics; the friendly disposition of
							the King towards the United States; and his desire that the commercial
							Relations between the two Countries should as much as possible be
							promoted— He said he was directed to express the warm and grateful
							sentiments of his Government, at the kind feelings and sympathy which
							had been manifested here on the illness and decease of his predecessor
								<persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greuhm</persRef>; and he hoped I should be assured that he could
							faithfully execute the orders of his <pb type="ms" n="179"/>of his
							Sovereign, only inasmuch, as he should follow the example of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm by discharging the duties of his
							trust in a manner which should secure the approbation and esteem of the
							Government of the United States— My answer was short and entirely
							unpremeditated— That I received him with great pleasure, as the
							representative of the Prussian Government— That the relations between
							the two Countries had always been interesting and uninterruptedly
							friendly— That they had also been distinguished by the negotiation at
							two different periods of Treaties, in which the first examples had been
							exhibited to the world of national stipulations founded upon the most
							liberal principles of maritime and commercial Law— Of the first of those
							Treaties, it was one of the glories, that it had received the sanction
							and ratification of the <persRef ref="frederick-ii">Great
								Frederic</persRef>— It had been a part of the good fortune of my
							life, to have concluded with the Ministers of the present king the
							second Treaty; and I had during a residence of four years at the Court
							of the present king learnt to appretiate and to estimate his character,
							and that of his Nation, and to form attachments to them founded as well
							upon the personal kindness which I had invariably experienced from them,
							as upon the general impression produced by witnessing their merits— That
							in the friendly treatment which we had shewn to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Greuhm while he lived, and in the melancholy but feeling
							attentions at the time of his decease, we had born a most sincere
							testimonial to his excellent character and conduct, while paying that
							tribute of respect which was most justly due to his Sovereign— That the
							loss of him so immediately after his return to this Country, subsequent
							to a considerable term of absence, and when we had flattered ourselves
							with the hope of long enjoying his society, had been felt with deep
							concern— That I was well assured he, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Niederstetter would be governed by the same principles, which had
							attached us so warmly to his predecessor, and that I earnestly hoped he
							would have every motive to be satisfied with his residence in this
							Country. <persRef ref="brown-jacob">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Brown</persRef> conversed with me, concerning Letters from <persRef

								ref="leavenworth-henry">Leavenworth</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cumming-william">Cummings</persRef>, relative to the system of
							our intercourse and relations with the Indians. They were speculative
							and written some months since— I spoke also with Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown of a certain volunteer company of
							the District Militia, which voted to dissolve themselves, and then part
							of them attempted to form themselves into another company, and chose new
							Officers. Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown thinks this a very
							disorderly mode of proceeding which ought not to be sanctioned. There is
							also a certain question of rank between several of the Officers to be
							settled— After dinner I heard <persRef ref="caldwell-charles">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell</persRef>’s Lecture upon the
							organ of amativeness, which I thought more indelicate than
							philosophical— The weather was intensely warm, and I had no temptation
							to learn more either of phrenology or of Craniology— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell paid me some time after the
							Lecture an Evening visit— <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi

						<p><date>13. III:30.</date> I attempted to cross the river with <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> in a small canoe; with a view
							to swim across it to come back— He took a boat in which we had crossed
							it last Summer without accident— The boat was at the shore near Van
							Ness’s Poplars but in crossing the Tiber to the point, my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> who was with us thought the boat
							dangerous, and instead of going with us went and undressed at the rock,
							to swim and meet us midway of the river as we should be returning— I
							thought the boat safe enough; or rather persisted carelessly in going
							without due attention to its condition— Gave my watch to my Son. Made a
							bundle of my coat and waistcoat, to take in the boat with me. Put off my
							shoes, and was paddled by Antoine, who had stripped himself entirely
							naked— Before we had got half across the river the boat had leaked
							itself half full, and then we found there was nothing on board to scoop
							up the water and throw it over. Just at that critical moment a fresh
							breeze from the Northwest blew down the river as from the nose of a
							bellows. In five minutes time it made a little tempest, and set the boat
							to dancing till the river came in at the sides. I jumped over-board, and
							Antoine did the same; and lost hold of the boat, which filled with water
							and drifted away— We were as near as possible to the middle of the
							river, and swam to the opposite shore. Antoine who was naked reached it
							with little difficulty— I had much more, and while struggling for life;
							and gasping for breath had ample leisure to reflect upon my own
							discretion— My principal difficulty was in the loose Sleeves of my
							shirt, which filled with water, and hung like two 56 lb weights upon my
							arms— I had also my hat, which I soon gave however to Antoine— After
							reaching the shore I took off my shirt and pantaloons—wrung them out,
							and gave them to Antoine to go and look out for our clothes, or for a
							person to send to the house for others, and for the carriage to come and
							fetch me— Soon after he had gone, my Son John joined me having swum
							wholly across the river expecting to meet us returning with the boat—
							Antoine crossed the bridge; sent a man to my house for the carriage,
							made some search for the drifted boat and bundles, and found his own hat
							with his shirt and bracers in it, and one of my shoes. He also brought
							over the bridge my Son’s Cloathes with my watch and umbrella, which I
							had left with him— While Antoine was gone, John and I were wading and
							swimming up and down on the other shore, or sitting naked basking on the
							bank, at the Margin of the river— John walked over the
								<unclear>bridge</unclear>
							<pb type="ms" n="183"/>bridge home. The Carriage came and took me and
							Antoine home, half-dressed. I lost an old Summer coat, white waistcoat,
							two napkins, two white handkerchiefs, and one shoe. Antoine lost his
							watch, jacket, waistcoat, pantaloons and shoes— The boat was also lost—
							By the mercy of God our lives were spared; and no injury befell our
							persons. We reached home about a quarter before nine, having been out
							nearly five hours. I had been about three hours in the water, but
							suffered no inconvenience from it— This incident gave me a humiliating
							lesson, and solemn warning not to trifle with danger— The reasons upon
							which I justify to myself my daily swimming in the river did not apply
							to this adventure. It is neither necessary for my health, nor even for
							pleasure that I should swim across the river; and having once swum
							across it, I could not even want it as an experiment of practicability—
							Among my motives for swimming that of shewing what I can do, must be
							discarded as spurious, and I must strictly confine myself to the
							purposes of health, exercise, and salutary labour.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="brown-jacob">Brown— Gen<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi></persRef> I sent for him. Conversed with him on the
							proceedings of a Court-martial upon a soldier named <persRef
								ref="allison-joseph">Allison</persRef>, whom they sentenced to be
							shot for desertion twice— I told the Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
							that I could not approve this sentence— Death was too severe a
							punishment for desertion in time of Peace— This was my own opinion, and
							I believed so decidedly that of the Nation, that an execution for this
							offence would greatly shock the public feeling. Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown said there was no example of a
							capital punishment for desertion in time of peace. He complained that
							there was no adequate punishment for this offence, and lamented the
							abolition of stripes— He said that he had laboured earnestly to raise
							the moral character of the army to which end he believed a most
							efficacious expedient would be a judicious and impartial system of
							promotion from the ranks to subaltern office, and an increase of the pay
							of non-commissioned officers— He said also he had directed to recruit
							the army only from native Citizens of the Union; the foreigners being
							always the most troublesome and vicious part of the army.</p>
