						<dateline>Tuesday 1. February 1825</dateline>
						<p><date>1. VII. Tuesday.</date> I called this morning on <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M. Van Buren</persRef> S.U.S. from New-York;
							and told him that I believed the young man recommended by him for the
							appointment of Consul at Sant Iago of Chili, <persRef ref="winne-daniel"
								>Daniel Wynne</persRef> would be nominated; but perhaps not till
							after the election in the House— He said it had been reported yesterday
							at the Senate that they would in the course of the day, be sent in— I
							told him I had read his speech of yesterday on the piracy Bill; and
							thanked him for rectifying a mistake which had represented me as
							favouring the Section, which authorised on certain contingencies a
							blockade of the Ports of Cuba— He spoke to me of <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef>,
							his colleague; whose time expires with this Session of Congress, and who
							has declined a re-election— I supposed because he could not have been
							rechosen— Van Buren said that was the fact. He told me that King had
							shewn him a very interesting correspondence between <persRef
								ref="morris-gouverneur">Gouverneur Morris</persRef> and him about
							the Hartford Convention— Morris had pressed him exceedingly to join in
							that conspiracy; which he had firmly declined— I asked him if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King had ever spoken to him of the
							separation project of 1803–4. after the cession of Louisiana— He said
							no— I met <persRef ref="cuthbert-alfred">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cuthbert</persRef> there— At home <persRef ref="plumer-william2">W.
								Plumer</persRef> called to enquire if <persRef ref="evans-estwick"
								>E. Evans</persRef> could have a passage on board the
							North-Carolina— <persRef ref="rogers-thomas">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Thomas J. Rogers</persRef> formerly M.H.R. from
							Pennsylvania; who told me he had run away from Harrisburg to escape from
							a subpoena, upon the impeachment of a judge— <persRef
								ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef> called, and told me
							he thought the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would not
							make the nominations. <persRef ref="harris-unknown4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> of Boston came with
							Sullivan, and is an applicant for the appointment of Navy Agent there,
							about to be vacated— <persRef ref="boyd-john3">General Boyd</persRef>
							followed, and I have no doubt is in the same pursuit. At the Office—
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef>, came for
							the preparation of the papers called for by a Resolution of the House,
							of his Negotiations in the Netherlands. <persRef ref="sturgis-william"
								>William Sturges</persRef> came, and I mentioned to him the notes
							from <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef> respecting the
							case of the Pearl— He is to call again to-morrow— The Baron has made
							numerous enquiries at Boston; through the Russian Consul <persRef
								ref="eustaphieve-alexei">Eustaphieff</persRef>, and Sturges said it
							had been indirectly hinted to him, that he would do well to propitiate
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eustaphieff for a favourable report,
							which he had declined— <persRef ref="luckett-craven">Major
								Luckett</persRef>, <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Watkins</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="bolton-curtis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bolton</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="bates-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bates</persRef> of Boston were successively at the Office; the last,
							one of the competitors for the Navy Agency— I called at the President’s
							to enquire if he had decided upon the applications of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Evans, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bolton— He said the Secretary of the Navy would give M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Evans a Letter to <persRef
								ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef> who would give him a
							passage in the ship; and he desired me to examine further into the
							papers of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bolton. He then told me that he
							had determined not to make the nominations; excepting only the transfer
							of <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="appleton-john">J. J. Appleton</persRef>, from and to London and
							Madrid. He should leave the rest to his successor. He desired me to
							mention to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett, the high opinion that
							he entertained of his conduct and services, but gave me to understand
							that he should not nominate him as he had intended— He desired me not
							even to mention to Everett that he had intended to nominate him. This
							change in the President’s determination, from that of making the
							nominations <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the Election in the House to
							that of not making them at-all, would have surprised me, if I had not
							known that <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ingham</persRef>, M.H.R. from Pennsylvania, had been with the
							President this morning. The Servant who mentioned it said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><pb type="ms" n="67"/>Ingham came often,
							and always stayed long— Ingham is Chairman of the Committee to whom the
							Message relating to the President’s Accounts is referred. This is
							perhaps the occasion of his long visits, and gives him opportunities, to
							avail himself of them for other objects. I made no remark upon the
							President’s present determination; preferring first to reflect upon it.
							Watkins shewed me a Letter, he had this morning received from <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">J. M’Lean</persRef> the Postmaster General
							cautioning him against suffering any thing to appear in the National
							Journal favourable to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>. Watkins said he
							did not understand it—nor was it altogether intelligible to me— Watkins
							told me too that <persRef ref="little-peter">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Peter Little</persRef> had informed him he had written
							to me— I was at home, writing, the first part of this Evening: then went
							to the theatre and saw part of the Poor Soldier; and Tom Thumb. This
							part was performed by a dwarf named <persRef ref="stevens-joseph">Major
								Stevens</persRef>— Said to be twenty years old; and less than three
							feet high— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and the family were there. The house
							was well filled; but not crowded.</p>

						<p><date>2. VII.</date> Morning visits from <persRef ref="kidder-david"
								>David Kidder</persRef>, <persRef ref="longfellow-stephen">Stephen
								Longfellow</persRef>, <persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Enoch
								Lincoln</persRef>, and <persRef ref="cushman-joshua">Joshua
								Cushman</persRef>, all members of the House of Representatives from
							Maine. They had a circular Letter from the <persRef ref="parris-albion"
								>Governor of that State</persRef>, and several Resolutions of the
							Legislature concerning encroachments by the British from New-Brunswick,
							upon the territory in dispute between the two Countries, and
							depredations upon the timber— These members came to advise with me what
							was to be done: I advised them to address a joint-letter to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> requesting him to take such
							measures as were within the competency of the Executive of the United
							States, to arrest this mischief. I thought he would direct me to write
							to the <persRef ref="addington-henry">British Charge
								d’Affaires</persRef> here requesting him to interpose with the
							Government of New-Brunswick; and also to instruct <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>; to
							address a remonstrance on the subject— They appeared disposed to take
							this course— They enquired the state of the Negotiation with
							Great-Britain concerning the Boundary. I informed them that it was
							suspended to be resumed, and that all the Documents concerning it had
							been communicated confidentially to the Senate, and were thus in
							possession of the <persRef ref="chandler-john;holmes-john" type="multi"
								>two Senators</persRef> from the State— <persRef ref="wyer-edward"
								>Wyer</persRef> brought me three copies of a pamphlet upon the
							yellow fever by <persRef ref="washington-unknown3">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Washington</persRef> of this City.
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Joel R. Poinsett</persRef> brought and
							read to me a draught of several Resolutions which he intends to propose
							to the House as an individual member, relating to the Cuba Piracies—
							They were to call energetically upon the <persRef ref="vives-don"
								>Governor of Cuba</persRef>, to suppress the Society of the
							Mussulmanks; a notorious piratical association including as Poinsett
							says not less than a hundred thousand persons— He wishes to have these
							Resolutions adopted, and sent by the North-Carolina, to the Government
							of Cuba. He said he had no expectation that any thing would be done by
							the Committee of Foreign Relations; no two members agreed in opinion
							upon any of the measures heretofore proposed. I saw no objection to his
							Resolutions. <persRef ref="luckett-craven">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Luckett</persRef> introduced a <persRef
								ref="huston-felix">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Felix
								Huston</persRef> of Kentucky who has the project of joining the
							Greek Cause, and came for advice and a Passport. I knew not what to
							advise, without impairing my official neutrality; but referred him to
							persons better informed, and promised him a Passport. <persRef
								ref="dwight-henry">H. W. Dwight</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="tomlinson-gideon">G. Tomlinson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="bradley-william2">W. C. Bradley</persRef> were here
							successively; all intensely occupied with the approaching Election and
							all sangwine of an issue which will disappoint them. To me the
							alternatives, are both distressing in prospect, and the most formidable
							is that of success. All the danger is on the pinnacle. The humiliation
							of failure will be so much more than compensated by the safety in which
							it will leave me, that I ought to regard it as a consummation devoutly
							to be wished <pb type="ms" n="68"/>and hope to find consolation in it.
							Dwight spoke principally about <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Louis
								M’Lane</persRef>, who has talked with him much as he has with
							others: declining his fixed determination, never to vote for <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>; but giving no
							expectation that he will in any event vote for me— We were interrupted
							and Dwight said he would soon see me again. Tomlinson and Bradley were
							both concerned about the vote of Connecticut. <persRef
								ref="edwards-henry">H. W. Edwards</persRef> Senator from that State
							is devoted to <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, and through
							him to Jackson— The members from the State in the House are six, and
							were originally two, for Crawford, <persRef ref="barber-noyes"
								>Barber</persRef> and <persRef ref="stoddard-ebenezer"
								>Stoddard</persRef>; two for Calhoun, <persRef ref="whitman-lemuel"
								>Whitman</persRef> and <persRef ref="sterling-ansel"
								>Sterling</persRef>; and two for me, Tomlinson and <persRef
								ref="foote-samuel">Foote</persRef>— <persRef ref="lanman-james"
								>Lanman</persRef> the other Senator was for Crawford— The great
							majority of the People for me in the State, and the hopeless prospect of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, had induced Barber and
							Stoddard to determine and avow that they should vote for me— In this
							state of things Edwards the friend of Calhoun has been stimulating
							Barber and Stoddard to vote still for Crawford, so that the vote of the
							state may be divided and not count for me; and they have greatly been
							shaken by this process of Edwards— Bradley thinks Calhoun a complete
							master-piece of duplicity; and not much better of <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> as a subaltern, under his
							direction.— He told me of Letters from Calhoun to <persRef
								ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van Ness</persRef> and to others, when
							a Judge of the Supreme Court was to be appointed and a Secretary of the
							Navy; and said there were so many things of the same stamp, known to so
							many persons that Calhoun’s character was now pretty well understood— I
							called at the President’s with despatches from <persRef
								ref="allen-heman2">H. Allen</persRef> in Chili, and from R. Rush at
							London. The last answers to Letters from me of 27. Nov<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> last— The 68<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> day— Referring to the Conversation that I had with the
							President yesterday, I asked if I had understood him correctly that he
							had determined not to make the nominations to the vacant offices at-all—
							He said I had— I said I had understood the alternative was, that he
							should make them before or after the election. So far as I was
							personally concerned, I should prefer that even now he would make the
							nominations now, before the election rather than that he should omit to
							make them altogether. I had wished him to determine upon his choice now
							without making it known, but not leave the nominations as prizes to be
							held out by or to any one to purchase votes. Among the candidates whom
							he had mentioned to me were two members of Congress, one holding, the
							other supposed to influence votes— It would be difficult for the
							successor to nominate either of them especially, if the votes in
							question should be for him. The nominations belonged properly to his
							administration, and my wish was that it should be really his
							Administration to the last moment of its existence. If the election
							should fall upon me, I should therefore intreat of him as a favour that
							he would make the nominations as his own; and as he would have made them
							at any other period of his administration— If as was more probable,
								Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson should be chosen, I should
							of course have nothing further to say: but having no suspicion that he
							would anticipate his power of nomination by pledges, I presumed he would
							equally acquiesce in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s making the
							nominations. He said he would take this matter into full consideration;
							but he had already informed <persRef ref="elliott-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliott</persRef> of Georgia that he
							should not make the nominations before the election, and he could not
							now change that determination without fluctuation of Counsels— Thus it
							now rests— I attended this Evening the Theatre. Saw the Gamester—
							Beverley by <persRef ref="cooper-thomas2">Cooper</persRef>; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Beverley by <persRef ref="barnes-mary"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Barnes</persRef>, with the
							farce of family jars.</p>

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s ardent friends had told him in

								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown had been in H.R. and had heard
								<persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie’s</persRef> Speeches— He has
							lost his faith in <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun’s</persRef>
							sincerity; and still has hopes of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>. English came for his last Instructions which are
							not ready. Reed came to tell me that Webster will call upon me this
							Evening. Southard called for the papers of <persRef
								ref="kirkpatrick-jonathan">Kirkpatrick’s</persRef> complaint against
								<persRef ref="bennett-james">Bennett</persRef>—whom he wishes to be
							suspended or dismissed, and <persRef ref="ray-joseph">Ray</persRef> to
							be appointed in his place. Southard told me he would call upon me this
							Evening if he could—but he did not— Webster’s talk was about the
							Election— He read to me a Letter from <persRef ref="warfield-henry"
								>Warfield</persRef> of Maryland to him, concerning the Election, and
							asking advice of him with regard to his vote; and the draught of an
							answer which he had prepared and said he would send or not, as I should
							think proper. He said that <persRef ref="lee-john2">J. Lee</persRef>
							also of Maryland had consulted him too, and was under impressions
							similar to those of Warfield— Their concern was lest in the event of my
							election the federalists should be treated as a proscribed party.
							Webster’s answer to Warfield expressed entire confidence that I should
							be governed by no such considerations; and said that he should shew this
							confidence by his vote— It intimated a hope that the object of the
							Administration would be to promote harmony among the people and that
							this disposition would be marked by conferring some one prominent <pb
								type="ms" n="70"/>prominent appointment upon a person of that party—
							I observed that if that passage referred to the formation of an
							Administration, it would imply more than I could confirm— He said it did
							not—but to an appointment perhaps of a judge.— I said I approved
							altogether of the general spirit of his answer, and should consider it
							as one of the objects nearest to my heart; to bring the whole people of
							the Union to harmonize together— I must however candidly tell him that I
							believed either <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>
							or M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford would pursue precisely the
							same principle, and that no administration could possibly succeed upon
							any other— He said that <persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General Van
								Rensselaer</persRef> entertained similar Sentiments to his own, and
							by his advice would call on me at eleven O’Clock to-morrow morning.</p>

								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> had done. I answered
							him in the same manner, and as he said entirely to his satisfaction. He
							spoke of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Van Buren</persRef>, with whom he lodges, somewhat doubtfully—and
							also of <persRef ref="mclane-louis">L. M’Lane</persRef>. He says they
							have not yet abandoned all hope of the success of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>— That <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">A.
								Dickins</persRef> is the Messenger between them. That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford will not release them from the
							obligation of voting for him; though he thinks some of the Caucus men
							will vote for me at once— He mentioned to me <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-solomon">Solomon Van Rensselaer</persRef>, of
							Albany, as a very ardent supporter of mine; and I told him I thought
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren had been wrong, in the
							measures he took to prevent his appointment, as Postmaster at Albany.— I
							said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> van Buren, was a man of great
							Talents, and of good principles; but he had suffered them to be too much
							warped by party Spirit. At other times he had followed a more generous,
							and wiser policy, and I hoped he would ultimately return to it— A
								<persRef ref="carter-william">Captain Carter</persRef> just returned
							from the Pacific brought me despatches from <persRef ref="allen-heman2"
								>H. Allen</persRef>, at Sant Iago de Chili— As I was going to my
							Office I met <persRef ref="hay-george">George Hay</persRef>, who went to
							it with me, and asked me, whether I thought this explosion between
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kremer-george">Kremer</persRef>, would affect the Election— He
							premised that it was perhaps an improper Question; in which case I
							should not answer it. I said I did not know whether it would have any
							effect; nor, if any, what it would be— I did not know upon what facts,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kremer’s charges were founded. Hay
							said upon nothing but the inferences of his own muddy and contracted
							mind. He then added that he was not sorry for Clay whom he had always
							considered, as a mere political adventurer; and who had persecuted M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, with the most virulent rancour— He
							did not prolong this Conversation, which partook much of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay’s character— He is a warm partizan of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>, but wishes and
							supposes me to believe that he is an ardent friend of mine. I went to
							the President’s with a list of nominations to be sent in to the Senate
							next Monday. Among them was that of <persRef ref="izard-george">George
								Izzard</persRef>, as Governor of the Arkansas Territory— I told him
							that this was not one of the Offices, the nomination <pb type="ms"
								n="71"/>to which I had advised him to postpone. He said he had so
							understood me— That Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Izzard was a
							federalist; and he wished on his own retirement to give some token of
							his disposition to conciliate that class of our Citizens— He regretted
							that it had not been in his power to shew the same disposition more
							frequently in his appointments. He had gone as far as was possible,
							without forfeiting the Confidence of his own supporters, and thereby
							defeating the very object that he had at heart. I delivered to the
							President, the Letter I had written him yesterday upon the subject of
							the nominations to the foreign Missions; and told him that I wished to
							put it as a deposit in his hands, for a testimonial that I had not used
							these missions, to promote any purpose of my own. He took the paper, and
							said he would not communicate it to anyone. That he was aware of the
							extreme circumspection with which it was necessary for me, at this
							moment to act. That his own situation was also one of great difficulty—
							That his impression at the beginning of the present Session of Congress
							had been to leave these appointments to be made by his Successor, whose
							confidential officers the persons receiving them would be. He had been
							afterwards urged to make the nominations; but had yielded to the
							considerations presented by me, in which he had thought there was great
							weight, that those nominations could scarcely have been made at this
							crisis, without having some improper effect on the pending election— But
							in determining upon the postponement he had thought best to put it on
							the other ground; of leaving the appointments to his Successor, because
							that operating equally upon both could not be attributed to the
							influence of either. He said he had no doubt of my kind and friendly
							disposition to himself, and not the most distant suspicion that I had
							used, or would use those appointments for any electioneering purpose— On
							returning home, I found that my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> had arrived from Boston. In the Evening I went to
							the Theatre, and saw three Acts of the School for Scandal— <persRef
								ref="cooper-thomas2">Cooper</persRef> as <persRef
								ref="charlessurface">Charles Surface</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="barnes-john;barnes-mary" type="multi">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="sirpeterteazle">Sir Peter</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="ladyteazle">Lady Teazle</persRef>. With <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>

								ref="cousins-unknown">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cousin’s</persRef>, and afterwards to another at <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean</persRef>,
							the Postmaster General’s at Georgetown. Here there was much talk of the
							proceedings in H.R. this day on the demand of H. Clay and G. Kremer for
							a Committee of investigation— A vote of more than two to one for the
							appointment to-morrow of a Committee of seven by Ballot— There was an
							effort afterwards made to effect an accommodation which failed— <persRef
								ref="rogers-thomas">T. J. Rogers</persRef>, formerly a member of
							Congress from Pennsylvania, now here, was at M’Lean’s, and spoke to me
							with great uneasiness of this affair; assuring me that whatever the

							in it— I asked <persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef> to call

						<p><date>5. VII.</date><persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef>
							called this morning as he had promised— I reminded him of what he had
							told me of <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham’s</persRef> conversations
							with him respecting the Government of Arkansas; and of <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie’s</persRef> talk with him in Ingham’s
							chamber; and I asked him to put in writing the substance of all those
							Conversations— I said I did not ask him to do this for me; but for
							himself. I told him that all this would be history hereafter, and that
							those Conversations would be an important part of History. He said he
							regretted not having written them down at the time— I said it would have
							been better then; but the time being still very recent; little would now
							be lost of the substance; and the longer it should be delayed the less
							full and correct would the statement be— He said he would write it— The
							substance was that Ingham knowing Cook to be a Candidate <hi
								rend="italic">for </hi><pb type="ms" n="72"/>for the appointment of
							Governor of Arkansas; urged him to declare openly that he would vote for
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>, and intimated that
							he should then have the appointment— Cook says he offended Ingham by his
							answer to this proffer, and Ingham has said nothing of it since—
							M’Duffie’s argument was to the same purpose— That General Jackson’s
							election would depend upon his, Cook’s vote. That there was a moral
							obligation to vote for him who had the greatest number of electoral
							votes— That if I should be elected it would only be by <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> corrupt coalition with me—and that
							the People would be so disgusted with this that there would be a
							systematic and determined opposition from the beginning so that the
							Administration could not get along— It would be overthrown and he would
							be involved in its ruin— Cook says that <persRef ref="rogers-thomas">T.
								J. Rogers</persRef> last evening after the party at <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">M’Lean’s</persRef> came to Cook’s lodgings, and
							declared that if I should be elected Pennsylvania would cordially
							support my Administration. That he could answer for three Presses
							himself; and that before he left Harrisburg, <persRef
								ref="mowry-charles">Mowry</persRef> the State Printer there told
							him, it was nearly certain I should be elected, and he was d— glad of
							it. Cook says too that last Night when Ingham came home after the
							failure of the attempt to effect an accommodation of the affair between
							Clay and <persRef ref="kremer-george">Kremer</persRef>; he said the
							sword was drawn, and the scabbard thrown away— <persRef
								ref="tracy-albert">Tracy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef> were here this
							morning; and gave accounts of the attempt at accommodation— An apology
							was drawn up disclaiming any intention of imputing corruption to Clay,
							and declaring that he knew no fact, ascertaining that any bargain had
							been made; which Kremer professed himself ready to sign; and which Clay
							declared would be satisfactory to him. But Kremer after consulting the
							Pennsylvania delegation or that part of them by whom he is moved,
							declined signing the paper— Kremer is said to be an intemperate man; and
							to have acknowledged that he scarcely knew whether he had written the
							Letter or not— At half past eleven I attended at the Capitol the Meeting
							of the Commissioners of the sinking fund to make their annual report—
								<persRef ref="gaillard-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gaillard</persRef>, the President of the Senate pro Tempore, and
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, Secretary of the Treasury were
							present. The <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef> absent— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford received a note from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt saying that he was confined to the
							house by indisposition. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury to
							the board was read by me at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s
							request— The report of the board to the two houses of Congress was also
							read and then signed in triplicates— A slight error was detected in the
							Report of the board and corrected. The accompanying statements were
							read, with the exception of part of one of them; a list of payments by
							certain banks, which was long and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford said had been fully examined at the Treasury. The finances of
							the Country are in a very flourishing condition— On signing the papers,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford observed that he had yet so
							much rhumatism in the hand, that he wrote with difficulty— He had asked
							me to read the papers, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s note,
							as he could not easily read, himself. His speech is more distinct in
							articulation than it was. The business of the board occupied about an
							hour— I then went into the Senate chamber; it being Saturday the Senate
							were not in Session— The House of Representatives were engaged in
							balloting for a Committee of seven, upon the appeal of the Speaker, in
							his collision with George Kremer. I have always on this annual day for
							making the Report of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, passed two
							or three hours afterwards in the House <pb type="ms" n="73"

							this day from going in— I returned to my house, and afterwards attended
							at the Office of the Department. <persRef ref="sturgis-william">W.
								Sturges</persRef> called and had some conversation with me
							concerning his claim upon the Russian Government. He had sent me a reply
							to a paper of remarks delivered to me by the <persRef

							from <persRef ref="warfield-henry">H. R. Warfield</persRef> M.H.R. from

							see him this day: but it was too late. I dined with <persRef

						<p><date>6. IV.</date> Mistaking a bright moonlight for the dawn of day, I
							rose two or three hours earlier than my usual time— Employed the time in
							writing— Heard <persRef ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Post</persRef> at the Capitol—from Daniel 8.23. “And the God in
							whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not
							glorified.” The house was well filled— After the service, I called with
							my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> to visit <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>. I asked him to let <persRef ref="warfield-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warfield</persRef> know that I
							would be glad to see him at any time to-morrow morning before Noon at my
							house— He promised he would— We called also to see <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fuller</persRef>; but he was not at his lodgings. On returning home I
							found a despatch from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> of
							31. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> last mentioning an interview which
							he had that day had with <persRef ref="canning-george">G.
								Canning</persRef>; the British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, who
							informed him confidentially, that the British Government, had determined
							immediately to recognize the Independence of Mexico, Colombia, and
							Buenos-Ayres. I called at once on <persRef ref="salazar-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar</persRef>, the Colombian
							Minister, and read the despatch to him. Then took it to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, with whom I found <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">James Barbour</persRef> S.U.S. from Virginia,
							and <persRef ref="hay-george">G. Hay</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hay withdrew, and I read the despatch. Governor Barbour
							remarked that this was precisely the result that I had anticipated from
							the conclusion of a Treaty of Commerce by our Minister <persRef
								ref="anderson-richard">R. C. Anderson</persRef> at Bogota— I then
							called and visited <persRef ref="lafayette">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> la Fayette</persRef>, to whom I communicated the
							information contained in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s despatch.
							My Son George was with me at all these visits. I enquired at <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> for <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, but he was at
							dinner. Returning, I met <persRef ref="obregon-pable">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Obregon</persRef> the Mexican
							Minister, and informed him of the news from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush. Attended the afternoon service at <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>
							and heard him from 1. Peter 2.7. “Unto you therefore which believe he is
							precious.” a warm and honest exhortation to hold Christ as precious.
								<persRef ref="tracy-albert">A. H. Tracy</persRef> spent the Evening
							here; and T. Fuller about an hour of it. <persRef ref="brown-jacob"
								>General Brown</persRef> called twice at my house while I was out;
							and said he would come again about Sunset, but did not. Tracy spoke of a
							singular change in the mind of <persRef ref="morgan-john">J. J.
								Morgan</persRef>, now a confirmed vote for Jackson. He is very
							apprehensive that Virginia will be lost—of which I have scarce a doubt.
							He is however now confident of New-York, which I am not. Fuller is more
							sangwine. These fluctuations will soon be over. La Fayette shewed me a
							Letter to him, signed Elentharos, which he told me was from the <persRef
								ref="u">French Consul at Edinburgh</persRef>— Very friendly to him,
							and earnest for the Greeks. La Fayette himself is also ardent in their
							cause— <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> came in

							yesterday morning had a long conversation with the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>; and had distinctly told him
							his impressions of the present and recent conduct of <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>— He said the President had
							heard it with surprize— Brown himself is deeply affected by it— At the
							Office, he shewed me a Letter from <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose"
								>Ambrose Spencer</persRef> at Albany, whose election to the Senate
							hitches between the two Houses of the Legislature.— He was nominated
							without formal opposition by the House of Assembly; having however, only
							77 votes— In the Senate, he had from ten to twelve votes, with at least
							20 against him. These, so scattered their votes so that no nomination
							was made by the Senate, and they could not go into joint ballot. The day
							passed without completing the election, and now they must pass a Law to
							fix another day for the choice— Spencer writes Brown that my friends in
							the Senate concurred in this postponement, from an opinion that he was
							hostile to me, which he solemnly protests he is not. His professions
							have been constantly friendly. His manifestations of inclinations, and
							his actions so far as he has acted constantly adverse— This species of
							duplicity pervades the conduct of so many public men in this Country,
							that it is scarcely possible to know upon whom any reliance can be
							placed— Edwards came to enquire about the nominations to foreign
							Missions, and to urge the interest of <persRef ref="miller-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, who is recommended for that to Guatemala. I told him how
							the matter stood, and the doubt whether the nominations would be made by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe at all. And when he should
							finally determine, whether he would or would not make them I promised to
							give Edwards seasonable notice of his determination— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Warfield came upon the notice given him as
							I had yesterday requested, by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>— He said that he had
							not expressed his determination for whom he should vote in the House on
							Wednesday— His friends <persRef ref="carroll-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Carroll</persRef> of
							Carrollton, and <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Taney</persRef> of Baltimore had urged him to vote for
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, under an
							impression that if I should be elected, the administration would be
							conducted on the principle of proscribing the federal party— I said I
							regretted much that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll, for whose
							character I entertained a profound veneration, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Taney, of whose talents I had heard high
							encomium, should harbour such opinions of me. I could assure him, that I
							never would be at the head of any administration <pb type="ms" n="75"
							/>administration of proscription to any party—political or geographical.
							I had differed from the federal party on many important occasions, but I
							had always done justice to the talents and service of the individuals
							composing it; and to their merits as members of this Union— I had been
							discarded by the federal party, upon differences of principle, and I had
							not separated from one party to make myself the slave of another— I
							referred in proof of my adherence to principle against party, to various
							acts of my public life, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warfield
							declared himself perfectly satisfied with my exposition of my
							Sentiments. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vinton applied for
							collections of the public Congressional Documents, for the University in
							the State of Ohio. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington came to
							enquire whether I had received official accounts of the intention of the
							British Government to acknowledge the Independence of the South American
							Republics— I mentioned to him the purport of the despatch received
							yesterday from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> with which
							he appeared to be highly satisfied. I told him also that <persRef
								ref="fitzgerald-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fitzgerald</persRef> had declined accepting the mission to this
							Country—of which he had not been before informed. Baron Tuyll brought me
							an extract from a despatch received by him, concerning discriminating
							Tonnage duties in Russia— It was not known to him and we had much
							conversation concerning it. He had also a circular from <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef> written in August
							last; relating to a new levy of men at that time to recruit the Russian

						<p><date>9. VI.</date> May the blessing of God rest upon the event of this
							day— The second Wednesday in February; when the Election of a President
							of the United States for the term of four years from the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March next was consummated. Of the
							votes in the electoral Colleges there were 99. for <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef> of Tennessee, 84 for
							John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, 41. for <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">William Harris Crawford</persRef> of
							Georgia, and 37 for <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> of
							Kentucky. In all 261. This result having been announced on opening and
							counting the votes in joint meeting of the two Houses, the House of
							Representatives immediately proceeded to the vote by ballot from the
							three highest Candidates, when John Quincy Adams received the votes of
							13, Andrew Jackson of 7. and William H. Crawford of 4. States— The
							election was thus completed, very unexpectedly by a single ballot—
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef> gave
							me the first notice, both of the issue of the votes of the electoral
							colleges, as announced in the joint meeting, and of the final vote as
							declared. <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> followed him a few
							minutes afterwards— <persRef ref="bolton-curtis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bolton</persRef> and <persRef ref="thomas-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> the Naval Architect
							succeeded; and <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">B. W.
								Crowninshield</persRef>, calling on his return from the House to his
							lodgings at my house, confirmed the reports— Congratulations from
							several of the Officers of the Department of State ensued—from <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">D. Brent</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="ironside-george">G. Ironside</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="slade-william">W. Slade</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="king-josias">Josias W. King</persRef>— Those of <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, children, and family
							were cordial, and affecting; and I received an affectionate note from
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus
								King</persRef> of New-York, written in the Senate chamber after the
							event. On my return home <persRef ref="strong-james">James
								Strong</persRef> M.H.R. from New-York, came with some solicitude of
							enquiry concerning the obstacles to the election of <persRef
								ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose Spencer</persRef>, as Senator from
							that State in the place of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King. He asked
							if my friends considered Spencer as hostile to me. I said I believed
							they had considered him as favouring the election of Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson. He asked if I did not consider
							Spencer pledged at least, if elected, not to come with purposes of
							hostility to the Administration— I said I did not— He said Spencer was
							an honest man; and if he gave such a pledge would be faithful to it.
							After dinner the Russian Minister <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron
								Tuyll</persRef> called to congratulate me on the issue of the
							Election— I attended with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams the
							Drawing Room at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>—
							It was crowded to overflowing— General Jackson was there, and we shook
							hands. He was altogether placid and courteous— I received numerous
							friendly salutations. <persRef ref="webster-daniel">D. Webster</persRef>
							asked me when I could receive the Committee of the House to announce to
							me my Election. I appointed to-morrow Noon, at my own house— The
							Committee <pb type="ms" n="77"/>Committee consist of Webster; <persRef
								ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef> of Ohio, and <persRef
								ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> of Virginia— I asked <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">S. L. Southard</persRef> the Secretary of the
							Navy to call on me to-morrow morning at ten O’Clock— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Daniel Brent had called on me this
							morning, and said that <persRef ref="lee-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Lee</persRef> M.H.R. from Maryland had told him
							that he should at the first ballot, be obliged to vote for Jackson; but
							if the election should not be completed this day he would come and see
							me to-morrow Morning— He was disposed to give me his vote, but wished
							some explanation from me of certain passages of my Oration delivered on
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July 1821 which had been
							offensive to the Roman Catholics. I said I would very readily see and
							converse on this subject with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee;
							regretting that anything I had ever said in public should have hurt the
							religious feelings of any person. <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Watkins</persRef> came likewise and
							expressed much confidence in the issue that took place. But urging me,
							if it should be otherwise, and I should attend the Drawing room this
							Evening, to carry a firm and confident countenance with me, and
							remarking that a bold outside was often a herald to success— There was
							fortunately no occasion for this little artifice. I enclosed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King’s Note with a Letter of three
							lines to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, asking for his
							blessing and prayers on the event of this day; the most important day of
							my life, and which I would close as it began with supplications to the
							father of mercies, that its consequences may redound to his glory, and
							to the welfare of my Country. After I returned from the Drawing Room, a
							Band of Musicians came and serenaded me at my house— It was past
							midnight when I retired.</p>

							The Committee reported my answer to the House where it was read— M<hi

								Livermore</persRef> M.H.R. from New-Hampshire; anxious that <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Treasury— <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef>, had mentioned

							Baltimore— <persRef ref="wheaton-joseph">Joseph Wheaton</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="force-peter">P. Force</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef><persRef ref="sullivan-george"
								>G. Sullivan</persRef>. A conversation with whom yesterday, had been
							interrupted, and was now resumed— He said he would tell me what the
							Calhounites said— That if <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> should be appointed
							Secretary of State, a determined opposition to the Administration would
							be organized from the outset— That the opposition would use the name of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> as its head—
							That the Administration would be supported only by the New-England
							States—New-York being doubtful— The West much divided, and strongly
							favouring Jackson as a Western Man— Virginia already in opposition; and
							all the South decidedly adverse— The Calhounites had also told him what
							Administration would satisfy them—namely <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
								>Joel R. Poinsett</persRef>, Secretary of State, <persRef
								ref="cheves-langdon">Langdon Cheves</persRef>, Secretary of the
								Treasury—<persRef ref="mclean-john2">John M’Lean</persRef>, now
							Postmaster General Secretary of War, and Southard, of the Navy— I asked
							Sullivan with whom he had held these Conversations— He said with
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> himself and with
							Poinsett. I told Sullivan that I would some day call on him to testify
							to these facts in a Court of Justice— He said surely not. I insisted
							that I would, and told him that he would find it necessary under this
							threatened opposition of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun between
							him and me. That I had no doubt M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							in holding this language to him; intended it should come to me, and that
							its object was to intimidate me, and deter me from the nomination of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— That I had heard the same
							intimations from him through other channels, and in all probability at
							some future day some occasion would arise of necessity for proving the
							facts judicially, in which case I should certainly call upon him— He
							said he should certainly then refuse to answer— I said his refusal to
							answer would be as good for me, as the answer itself. He then said
							surely I would not call upon him to betray a private and confidential
							conversation which he had only told me to make me acquainted with all
							that he knew interesting to me at this moment. That in telling it he had
							already violated the confidence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun, who far from intending that it should be reported to me, had
							strictly enjoined it upon him to say nothing of it to any one. <pb
								type="ms" n="79"/>one. I said this altered the case; and he might
							consider my declared intention of calling on him to testify publicly to
							these facts as withdrawn— I nevertheless believed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had intended he should report to
							me his threats of opposition in the event of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay’s appointment, and believed that if he would ask
							Calhoun’s permission to communicate the substance of it to me he would
							give it— This conversation connected with <persRef ref="ingham-samuel"
								>Ingham’s</persRef>, and <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie’s</persRef> electioneering siege upon D. P. Cook, <persRef

								>Benton’s</persRef> screw upon <persRef ref="scott-john"
								>Scott</persRef>; with Poinsett’s recommendation to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> of Benton as Minister to
							Mexico, unfolds the system of opposition as formed by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun— It is to bring in General Jackson
							as the next President under the auspices of Calhoun— To this end, the
							Administration must be rendered unpopular and odious; whatever its acts
							and measures may be, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun avows
							himself prepared to perform this part— I am at least forewarned— It is
							not in man that walketh to direct his steps— <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">Joseph Anderson</persRef> first Comptroller of

								Fitzhugh</persRef> of Virginia; and <persRef
								ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major Vandeventer</persRef>, Chief Clerk
							of the Department of War— I was at the President’s and again repeated
							the request that he would make the nominations which had been postponed
							till after the Election. He said he would take it into consideration— I
							told the President I had invited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							to remain at the head of the Treasury Department; and shewed him the
							Letter I had received from him this morning in very friendly terms
							declining the offer— I then said that I should offer the Department of
							State to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay: considering it due to his
							talents and services— To the western Section of the Union, whence he
							comes, and to the confidence in me, manifested by their delegations—
							That for the Treasury and War Departments I should be glad to take his
							advice, and to consult him, with reference to other objects of public
							interest; if it would be agreeable to him. He said he would readily give
							me his opinions upon any subject as I should desire— That upon his own
							election he had consulted his Predecessor <persRef ref="madison-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>; he had then
							been very earnestly pressed with regard to the formation of his
							Administration, and by no one with more importunity than by <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>— That he had named
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison the persons whom he proposed
							to nominate, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison had fully
							approved them. I understood him as wishing that I would pursue the same
							course. <persRef ref="sturgis-william">W. Sturges</persRef> came to the

							yesterday a Note from <persRef key="clay-henry">H. Clay</persRef>
							requesting an interview, for which he appointed half past six in the
							Evening he then came and we had a conversation of about an hour— I then
							offered him the nomination to the Department of State. He said he would
							take it into Consideration; and answer me as soon as he should have time
							to consult his friends. I desired him to take his own time; but he
							promised if any thing should occur, requiring that he should hasten his
							answer he would upon my giving him notice of it answer immediately. He
							made light of the threatened opposition, and thought all the projects of
							that nature which have been announced were mere ebullitions of
							disappointment at the issue of the election, which would soon be
							abandoned— He said that as to his affair with <persRef

							conspiracy against himself. He could have proved that Kremer had

							a high opinion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay; but if I should
							offer him the Department, he hoped he would not accept it; and he
							believed it would be better if I should not offer it to him— General
							Brown wishes that <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef> should be the Secretary of State— I listened to
							what he said, and then told him I had already made the offer to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay. Brown’s next wish is that Clinton
							should be Secretary of the Treasury. The members of Congress all advise
							variously for the formation of a Cabinet; and many are anxious to be
							treated confidentially.</p>
