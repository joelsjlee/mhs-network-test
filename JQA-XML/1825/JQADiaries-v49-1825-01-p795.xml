						<p><date>13. VI:15.</date> I called this morning on <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">James Barbour</persRef> S.U.S. and asked him to
							return the long report of <persRef ref="rush-richard">R.
								Rush’s</persRef> Negotiation, and then move a call for it, and for
							the Instructions, under which the negotiation was conducted, in Senate,
							upon Executive business. He agreed to take this course. I spoke to him
							confidentially with regard to the approaching election; and told him the
							present condition of things, at which he appeared surprized. He repeated
							the unalterable determination of Virginia to vote in the first instance
							for <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, but her determination at all Events
							to vote for another than a mere military leader— Returning home, I met
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R.
								King</persRef>, who spoke of a proposition of <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">J. S. Johnston</persRef> to apply all the
							proceeds of Land sales to purposes of Education— He King thought of
							proposing that they should be applied to the emancipation and
							exportation of Slaves, with the consent of the Slave States. He said
							they would all consent, North of South-Carolina. After I came home
								<persRef ref="stull-j">J. J. Stull</persRef> Cashier of the Farmers
							and Mechanics Bank, at Georgetown, came to apprize me of <persRef
								ref="johnson-george">G. Johnson’s</persRef> having endorsed <persRef
								ref="ladd-joseph">Ladd’s</persRef> Notes to the Amount of 7000
							dollars, and enquiring if I was not responsible for Johnson. I told him
							no—I had never authorized G. Johnson to endorse any note, but had
							enjoined him always not to do so— I sent my son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> to take possession of all the Stock
							at the Mill, and the warehouse, which <pb type="ms" n="802"/>he did.
								<persRef ref="vernon-t">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vernon</persRef> paid me a visit, and <persRef
								ref="livermore-arthur">A. Livermore</persRef> M.H.R. from
							New-Hampshire, came to enquire how it happened that <persRef
								ref="humphreys-daniel">D. Humphreys</persRef> had been reappointed
							U.S. District Attorney, in that State, during the last Session of
							Congress; his former Commission as Livermore supposed having not expired
							till after the commencement of the present Session— I found on enquiry
							at the Office that the new Commission of D. Humphreys commenced on the
								22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of November last— <persRef
								ref="wingate-joshua">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Wingate</persRef> came to enquire for an answer to the petition of a
							man named <persRef ref="timmons-unknown">Timmins</persRef> for a
							remission of a penalty. He spoke also of the charges against <persRef
								ref="hill-mark">M. L. Hill</persRef>, and in case of his removal
							recommended a person named <persRef ref="swanton-john"
								>Swanton</persRef>— At the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>. He found the petition of Timmins, and a
							minute of <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hay’s</persRef>, upon it. I asked him if there would be a call of
							the Senate on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March which he
							said must be considered— I spoke to him in Confidence concerning the
							election, and said that whatever might be its result I should wish for
							his friendly Counsel after the event, and as far as he might be disposed
							to give it, before. I told him my present intention was in the event of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson’s</persRef> election, to retire. He spoke cautiously, but
							expressed a willingness to advise me so far as might be proper— He said
							he had at the eve of his first election been much beset—by none more
							than <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>— Hinted
							at <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay’s</persRef> resentments— At the uses made of his Letter to
								Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson, which he again declared
							he firmly believed he had never shewn to any one. He spoke also of
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, with moderation; but
							with a sense of injury. He read me his message upon Piracy, this day
							sent in. After my return to the Office, I had visits from <persRef
								ref="reed-john">J. Reed</persRef> of Mass<hi rend="superscript"
								>tts</hi> and <persRef ref="mcarthur-duncan">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> M’Arthur</persRef> of Ohio, members
							H.R. We had company to dine 4 Senators 16. members of H.R. and 2.
							others.</p>

						<p><date>14 V.</date> A rainy day: consequently not much interrupted by

								>l.</hi> Van Ness of my objection, and now proposed that the
							deposition should be taken at <persRef ref="williamson-basil"
								>Williamson’s</persRef> Hotel— I had already said that I withdrew
							altogether my objection to Van Ness, and now said I was entirely willing
							that he should come and join in taking my deposition at my own house—
							They went to Williamson’s, and at seven O’Clock returned with <persRef
