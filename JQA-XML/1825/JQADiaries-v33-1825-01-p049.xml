							on Monday or Tuesday. <persRef ref="jenkins-lemuel">Lemuel

								ref="seymour-horatio">Horatio Seymour</persRef> S.U.S. from Vermont
							in great concern about the Instructions, from the Kentucky House of
							Representatives to the members of that Delegation here, to vote for
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> as
							President. He is alarmed for its probable effect on the votes of all the
							Western States— I advised him to see and converse with <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R.
								M. Johnson</persRef> S.U.S. from Kentucky; who told me there was an
							Article in the Lexington Reporter, stating that it was said the
							Instructions had been given by the advice of one of the Senators of the
							State at Washington— And as it was known <persRef ref="talbot-isham"
								>Talbot</persRef> took no part in the election, the imputation was
							upon him, Johnson— But he solemnly protested that he had not written any
							such Letter; and intimated that the Instructions were given in
							consequence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s own partizans
							having taken so much pains to make me unpopular in the State; for which
							he believed they were now very sorry. Johnson professed neutrality
							between Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson and me; and said he
							should be well satisfied if either of us should be elected— <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whittlesey</persRef> M.H.R. of Ohio introduced a <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-unknown">cousin</persRef> of his of the same name,
							from Connecticut. <persRef ref="ironside-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ironside</persRef> came with a new Copy of my last
							Report to P.U.S. on two Resolutions of the Senate concerning the
							piracies, for me to sign— The former copy was mislaid at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and not sent with his
							message. <persRef ref="sullivan-george">G. Sullivan</persRef> came to
							talk about the Kentucky Instructions; and to ask if the bringing forward
							the Massachusetts claim in H.R. might not affect unfavourably the
							Presidential Election— I said it should be brought forward without any
							regard to the election whatever; and whatever its effect upon that might
							be. He said he had told <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> that would be what I
							should say: but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun advised that the
							claim should not be brought forward, if it would affect unfavourably the
							Election, and he himself thought the interest of Massachusetts was
							greater in the election than in the claim— I told him I believed the
							votes upon the election were already so fixed that the claim would have
							no effect upon that whatever. <persRef ref="raymond-daniel">D—
								Raymond</persRef> of Baltimore called: and mentioned to me the
							sudden death of <persRef ref="harper-robert-goodloe">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. G. Harper</persRef> there,
							yesterday morning— Harper but a few days since had published an Address
							to the public offering himself as a Candidate for the H.R.U.S. for the
								20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress to be voted for two years
							hence— <persRef ref="mckim-isaac">Isaac M’Kim</persRef>, M.H.R. from
							Baltimore came with young <persRef ref="hollins-unknown"
								>Hollins</persRef> for a claim appealed from the Havana to Spain—
							Wishing for the interposition of the Government in his favour— At the
							Office came <persRef ref="call-richard">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Call</persRef>, Delegate from Florida, who said he
							would recommend some person for District Attorney in the place of
								<persRef ref="steele-william">W. F. Steele</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="foot-samuel">S. A. Foot</persRef> M.H.R. from Connecticut,
							startled at the Kentucky Legislative Instructions. <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">J. Bailey</persRef>, somewhat affected in the same
							manner Said <persRef ref="barbour-john">J. S. Barbour</persRef> told him
							the Virginia delegation would vote for Jackson— The <persRef
								ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">Baron de Mareuil</persRef> came and
							noticed several errors in the translation of his Letter to me published
							in the newspapers respecting the authentication of certificates of
							origin by French Consuls in U.S. He enquired also if I had an answer
							from the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> to the enquiry whether the discriminating duties
							on French vessels and Cargoes had been reduced 1/4 on the <pb type="ms"
								n="50"/>first of October— I had received this morning the answer
							which I read to him, and the substance of which he requested me to
							communicate officially to him. He intimated a wish that I had informed
							him of my intention to publish in the newspapers the translation of his
							Letter to me; but said he had no objection to the publication, and that
							it was perhaps the most convenient mode of diffusing the information—
							Wyer called likewise at the Office— I dined at <persRef

						<p><date>17. VI:</date><persRef ref="bradley-william2">W. C.
								Bradley</persRef> M.H.R. from Vermont was here, and afterwards
								<persRef ref="plumer-william2">W. Plumer j<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi></persRef> of New-Hampshire much concerned about these
							Instructions from the Legislature of Kentucky. Bradley said he had seen
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> this morning, who told him
							the Resolutions, would confirm the majority of the delegation, in their
							determination to vote otherwise— But who spoke of the Event of the
							Election as exceedingly uncertain— Of Missouri and Illinois
							particularly, the votes of both the States being in single persons.
							Bradley said he had urged Clay to see me; but Clay had told him it was
							altogether unnecessary, that his course was fixed, and he should
							consider the elevation of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">the
								Hero</persRef>, as the greatest calamity, which could befall the
							Country. Plumer spoke again about <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef>; and his ambition to go as Minister to England;
							which I thought might be gratified hereafter; but not immediately.
								<persRef ref="lloyd-james">James Lloyd</persRef> S.U.S. came and
							mentioned that <persRef ref="patterson-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Patterson</persRef> of Baltimore had been
							appointed one of the Directors of the Bank of the United States, on the
							part of the Government; having already been chosen a Director by the
							Stockholders; which he thought was contrary to Law— At the Office,
							Letter from <persRef ref="cheves-langdon">L. Cheves</persRef>, and
							Journal of the Commissioners under the Slave-indemnity Commission— At
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>— Spoke of the
							special Call of the Senate on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							March— To look into the Precedents. Internal improvement— The President
							spoke of Bills now before Congress on that subject. I left many papers
							with him— But public business grows irksome to him, as he approaches the
							close of his Administration. I mentioned this to <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> whom I met, as I was returning home to dinner,
							and who stopped to give me papers relating to the quarrel between
								<persRef ref="bennett-james">Bennett</persRef> the Consul at
							Pernambuco and <persRef ref="kirkpatrick-jonathan"
							>Kirkpatrick</persRef>— He was himself unwell— The Commissioners to take
							my deposition in the case of <persRef ref="harris-levett"
								>Harris</persRef> vs <persRef ref="lewis-william">Lewis</persRef>,
							came again to my house this Evening. <persRef ref="cox-clement"
								>Coxe</persRef>, <persRef ref="ashton-henry">Ashton</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="dunlop-robert">Dunlop</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>— I answered the last
							Interrogatory, on the part <pb type="ms" n="51"/>of the Defendant Lewis,
							and declined answering the Cross-interrogatories, for the present, and
							until the 23. papers received by L. Harris at the Department of State,
							under a promise to return them shall be returned; unless the Court
							should decide that I am bound to answer them— It was suggested by one of
							the Commissioners that the Court had not the power to compel the
							production of the papers, and that if the Cross-interrogatories should
							not be answered the deposition would not be received— The opinions of
							the Court’s power to bring forth the papers were different— I said I
							should have declined answering the Interrogatories as well as the
							Cross-interrogatories, until the papers should be returned, had I not
							apprehended that the ends of Justice would have been thereby defeated.
							If the Court should reject my deposition, it would be their act; and not
							mine.— I observed however that there was time to ascertain from
							Philadelphia, whether the Court had or had not power to compel the
							production of the papers before it would be necessary to close the
							commission, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dunlop engaged to write
							to <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef>, and
							make the enquiry— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ashton remarked that
							the Courts of the United States had the power to compel Parties to
							produce papers, by a Rule issued from the Court. But the State Courts
							generally, in case of the refusal of Parties to produce papers could
							only admit Par<unclear>ol</unclear> Evidence to be given of their
							Contents. Cox said the Courts could refuse to take up the cause till the
							papers are produced, and <persRef ref="murray-william">Lord
								Mansfield</persRef> had done so. After finishing the answer to the
							Interrogatories, the Commission adjourned to meet again when notified by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dunlop— I then went to the Theatre,
							and saw the last Act of the new Comedy of Sweet-hearts and wives— The
							house was crowded— <persRef ref="barnes-john;barnes-mary" type="multi"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Barnes</persRef> were the principal performers— After
							the Play, Barnes sung two comic songs; and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Barnes related <persRef ref="collins-william"
								>Collins’s</persRef> Ode on the Passions, with appropriate Music.
							The farce was dull.</p>

							respected the Kentucky and Ohio Delegations, and concurred with what I

							came and we agreed to bring to a close the business of the Mills, as

							had left with me yesterday, of which <persRef ref="kirkpatrick-jonathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirkpatrick</persRef> wishes to
							take copies— I gave them to him— He then asked me some question
							respecting the Election; upon which I spoke to him with entire
							Confidence. I asked him, if he wished me so to speak to him, and he said
							he did— I told him of the present state of things, so far as it is known
							to myself— Of the present prospect that a majority of the friends of
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, would finally vote
							for me; but that the whole of this aspect may be changed from day to
							day. I mentioned the doubtful situation, both of the New-York and
							Virginia Delegations, and how they will be liable to be swayed, by the
							slightest incident which may occur between this and the day of election.
							And I informed him of the exertions made and making by <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">DeWitt Clinton</persRef>, both in the State of
							New-York, and with its delegation here to secure the election of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson</persRef>— Particularly that he had written to <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Van
								Rensselaer</persRef>, and spoken to <persRef ref="hayden-moses">M.
								Hayden</persRef>, to prevail on them to vote for him— I observed
							that he had an Agent here, acting for him as far as he could, and
							through whom I believed he had influenced the elections in New-Jersey—
							Southard said he had no doubt he had— He repeated that he himself had
							been deeply mortified at the result of the Election in New Jersey, <pb
								type="ms" n="52"/>and was sure that it did not express the voice or
							the feeling of the People of that State— He said that when he came into
							the Administration he had no particular regard for me. That his
							sentiment towards me was one of indifference: he had perhaps some
							prepossessions against me; but for the last twelve months he trusted I
							had no doubt of his friendly dispositions to me— I said I had not. Of
							the New-Jersey delegation he thought there were three in my favour,
								<persRef ref="matlack-james">Matlack</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="condict-lewis">Condict</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="swan-samuel">Swan</persRef> or <persRef ref="garrison-daniel"
								>Garrison</persRef>— I told him I had heard that vote of the State
							would depend upon <persRef ref="holcombe-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Holcombe</persRef>. I told him that from the Relations
							existing between us, I should need his friendly advice whatever the
							event of the election might be— That until very recently I had not
							expected it would be necessary for me to anticipate the event of my
							election as one for which it would be proper for me even to be prepared—
							Doubtful and uncertain as it now is, I must yet think of it, as of a
							contingency upon which I may be called to act— I should in that event
							rely upon his continuing in the Station which he now holds; and from the
							moment of the Election, and perhaps before should frequently want the
							assistance of his Counsel— He said that he should at-all times be glad
							to give it, and that he was glad I had made this communication to him—
								<persRef ref="everett-charles">Dr Everett</persRef> came and
							introduced <persRef ref="brook-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brook</persRef>, a son of <persRef ref="brook-unknown">judge

								ref="gardner-unknown5">Captain Gardner</persRef> came to renew the

							for an appointment as Consul in some Port of France— <persRef
								ref="mower-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mower</persRef> paid me
							a visit; but did not open, upon the subject of Politics— I was at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and he agreed to
							the form of a circular to the Senators, calling them to a meeting on the
							fourth of March next— In the cases wherein there has been no Election by

							fourth of March, I proposed to notify the sitting Senator, who may give
							the notice to the Executive of the State, to which the President
							assented— Spent the Evening with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

								Reed</persRef> M.H.R. from Massachusetts came, but finding company
							with me, promised to call again— Cook told me that some time since he
							had been informed by three persons of weight in the western delegations
							that they would all vote for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>— He had received also Letters from some of his
							warmest friends in Illinois, and of those who had been my warmest
							friends, advising him in that event to vote with the other Western
							members; as by standing out alone for me, he would only sacrifice
							himself, without serving me— But he was now satisfied that Ohio and
							Kentucky would vote for me—probably Missouri, and perhaps Louisiana. He
							should therefore be at Liberty to vote according to his own
							inclinations. He said he had been conversing with <persRef
								ref="scott-john">Scott</persRef> of Missouri, who was very well
							disposed, to go with the other Western delegations; but who had some
							grievances against me, about the appointments for printing the Laws, and
							about some Letter that I had written to one of the Printers. Plumer said
							that <persRef ref="mcarthur-duncan">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								M’Arthur</persRef> had intimated as advisable that the Delegation
							from Ohio, should have a meeting, determine upon their vote, and then
							that the members should without reserve signify their intentions, so
							that there might be no longer occasion to doubt concerning it— At the
							Office, <persRef ref="morris-unknown6">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>21. V:30.</date> Morning visits from <persRef ref="letcher-robert"
								>R. P. Letcher</persRef> of Kentucky, <persRef ref="scott-john">J.

								Reed</persRef> of Massachusetts, <persRef ref="mckim-isaac">I.

								R. Bradley</persRef> of Vermont, Members H.R. and from <persRef
								ref="tayloe-benjamin">B. O. Tayloe</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="force-peter">P. Force</persRef>. Letcher brought me a Letter
							from <persRef ref="robertson-george">G. Robertson</persRef> formerly a
							member of the House, now in the Kentucky Legislature; and he told me
							that Scott would call upon me this morning; and he mentioned the
							proceedings in the Kentucky Delegation, after they received what they
							call their Instructions. Scott came and gave me the list of the Printers
							whom he wished to have appointed for printing the Laws in Missouri— They
							were the same that had been appointed last year. Scott explained to me
							his causes of complaint against me, which consisted only in my having
							appointed several years since one Newspaper to print the Laws in
							Missouri, which was politically opposed to him. He appeared to be
							satisfied with the assurance that I gave him, that I had not in that or
							any other instance acted with intentions unfriendly to him; he spoke of
							the application to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							for the removal of <persRef ref="scott-andrew">his brother</persRef> as
							a judge in the territory of Arkansas, for having killed in a duel
								<persRef ref="selden-joseph">his Colleague</persRef> on the bench— I
							told him there was such an application, which had been made, as long
							since as last Summer. But as the President had not acted upon it
							hitherto, I thought he would not. Scott then proceeded to speak of the
							approaching Election, and said that he had made up his mind to vote with
							the other Western Delegations—but intimated that he should incur great
							opposition for it in his own State. He spoke of himself as being devoted
							entirely to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, and of his hope that he would be a member of the
							next Administration— I told him that he would not expect me to enter
							upon details with regard to the formation of an Administration, but that
							if I should be elected by the suffrages of the West, I should naturally
							look to the West for much of the support that I should need— He parted
							from me apparently satisfied. Reed came to speak about <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>Louis M’Lean</persRef>, and the federalists. His own disposition is
							favourable to me, but Webster is specially apprehensive that the
							federalists will be excluded from Office by me— I told Reed that I
							should exclude no person for political opinions, or for personal
							opposition to me. That my great object would be to break up the remnant
							of old party distinctions, and bring the whole people together in
							sentiment as much as possible. Bradley told me that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> had yesterday or the
							day before paid a visit to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, and they had been
							reconciled together; with mutual assurances that there had never been
							any <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> hostility towards each other. I have
							expected this movement, ever since the developement of the Western
							phalanx, and if as is highly probable, it brings all the Crawford force
							in the house to bear in favour of Jackson, it will be decisive of the
							Election. <pb type="ms" n="55"/>Bradley likewise told me that <persRef
								ref="mills-elijah">Mills</persRef>, was in favour of Jackson, and
							had written to Northampton to promote his cause: and that <persRef
								ref="edwards-henry">H. W. Edwards</persRef> the Senator from
							Connecticut instigated by <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							had been tampering with <persRef ref="barber-noyes">N. Barber</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="stoddard-ebenezer">Stoddard</persRef> Members from
							that State to vote for Jackson— They were originally for Crawford; and
								<persRef ref="sterling-ansel">Sterling</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="whitman-lemuel">Whitman</persRef>, originally Calhounites will
							also vote for Jackson—which could give him the State— Bradley said
							Barber had been with him, and expressed a willingness to vote for me,
							but an apprehension that I should turn out Law the Collector at New
							London, and some other reserve Officers, who have been for Crawford. I
							assured Bradley that I should turn out no person for his conduct or
							opinions in relation to the election— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’Kim read me a Letter to him from one of his Constituents at Baltimore,
							concerning the call for the Correspondence with the Netherlands,
							relating to claims. I told him the call was already made in a
							Resolution, offered by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster— <persRef
								ref="buck-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buck</persRef>
							M.H.R. came with an application for the release of a man named <persRef

							some explanation concerning the management of his paper. But he will
							call again, B. O. Tayloe came to enquire into the credit and solvency of

							much information. At the Office I received voluminous despatches from
								<persRef ref="allen-heman2">H. Allen</persRef>, in Chili, and
								<persRef ref="prevost-john">J. B. Prevost</persRef> in Peru— I
							called at the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, with an application
							for a Midshipman’s warrant for <persRef ref="buchanan-lloyd">Lloyd

								ref="boyd-joshua">Joshua Boyd</persRef>, whose name had by mistake

							and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>: and threatens if
							Force will not give way to him, to come here and establish a <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> paper— I told Force that if
							Niles meant by that any thing more than an empty menace, he would only
							seal his own ruin by the attempt. But it would secure the reappointment
							of Gales and Seaton for the printing of Congress, and in the Event of
							General Jackson’s Election as President, and Niles’s persisting to press
							for the printing, his, Force’s best Course would be to compromise with
							Gales and Seaton, and attempt to obtain it jointly with them. He thought
							they would not consent to this; nor did I suppose they would, unless
							they should find it necessary— <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">T.

								<persRef ref="ware-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry

							at Philadelphia on the same business— A Friend named <persRef
								ref="ruggles-unknown2">Ruggles</persRef> came to apply for the
							appointment of Collector at New-Bedford— He had left at the Office
							yesterday, and came and took away this day a Letter from <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J. Pearce</persRef> recommending him—
								<persRef ref="scott-john">J. Scott</persRef> of Missouri called to
							say that he had been under some apprehension from what he had said
							yesterday, that I might consider him as having been disposed <pb
								type="ms" n="56"/>to prescribe conditions or make bargains— I told
							him I had not so understood him, and that he had said nothing yesterday,
							that I had received in that sense— He said he had not meant to speak
							positively— He had not then, and had not now entirely made up his mind
							how he should vote; but his prevailing impression was that he should act
							with his friends— This apprehension that he had spoken yesterday too
							positively is characteristic— Scott means to vote with the strongest
							side. At the Office came successively <persRef ref="tracy-albert">A. H.
								Tracy</persRef>, <persRef ref="branch-john">J. Branch</persRef>
							S.U.S. from North-Carolina, <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi

							Tracy had not heard of the visit of General Jackson to <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>, but had observed the reviving Spirits of
							Jacksons friends in the house within the last two days. M<hi

								ref="turner-edward">Turner</persRef>, a purser in the Navy deceased,
							upon <persRef ref="broadbent-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Broadbent</persRef>, Consul U.S. at Messina— The same affair which
								<persRef ref="burton-hutchins">H. G. Burton</persRef> so long and so
							often applied about, when he was in Congress. Rebello came to make a
							proposition from the Brazilian Government for a Treaty of alliance,
							eventual, with the U.S. and to which on certain contingencies the
							Republican Governments of South-America, should also be parties. I
							desired him to send me the proposal in writing; to be laid before P.U.S.
							for consideration— He manifested great earnestness, for the appointment
							of a formal diplomatic agent from U.S. to Brazil, before the close of
							the present Session of Congress— I told him it might be postponed till
							the commencement of the next Administration— Quarles talked in a manner
							somewhat desultory, about the Election, and about Kentucky— R. M.
							Johnson came to enquire concerning the circular to the Senators to
							attend in the Senate chamber on the fourth of March next—for <persRef
								ref="rowan-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rowan</persRef> the
							new Senator from Kentucky— I told him the Letter had already been
							despatched to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rowan. Johnson spoke also
							of the Election, and said that Kentucky would vote for me 7 to 5. That
							Ohio would be for me, and he believed Scott of Missouri. That <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">Daniel Pope Cook</persRef> of Illinois would vote
							for Jackson, though much against his inclination— I asked him if he was
							sure. He said Cook had told him so a week ago. That Maryland, and
							Louisiana were claimed by both sides, but Virginia, North-Carolina and
							Georgia, would vote for Jackson. The Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							spoke under evident excitement, and with certainly good information— His
							enumeration is the most correct that I have heard of, and coupled with
							Scott’s second visit to me this morning, and with various other
							symptoms, disclosed within three days satisfies me to a certainty that
							the issue of the election will be against me— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thornton told me this morning that a friend of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Crawford had told him that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford would in no event continue in the

							Session— <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">Jesse B. Thomas</persRef> S.U.S.
							called and introduced a second son of <persRef ref="thomas-rebecca">his
								wife’s</persRef> named <persRef ref="hamtramck-john"
								>Hamtramck</persRef>. I had received yesterday a note from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, intimating his
							intention to make without delay the nominations for appointments which
							he has left hitherto for his successor— I called at the President’s and
							had some conversation with him on this point— I told him it would be
							impossible for him to make the nominations before the Election of
							President in the house, without having some bearing, or being supposed
							to have some upon the Election. And I read to him, a <hi rend="italic"
								>communicated</hi> Article in the Richmond Enquirer of Saturday,
							which I had no doubt was sent from this place, severely commenting upon
							the appointment of Members of Congress, and in a very arrogant manner
							warning him against the appointment of <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
								>Poinsett</persRef>, or of another member, as Minister to Mexico. He
							determined to consider of it further. He told me that he thought of
							nominating <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> as
							Minister to Spain—transferring <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A.
								Smith</persRef> to Madrid, as Secretary of Legation, and <persRef
								ref="appleton-john">Appleton</persRef> in the same capacity to
							London—and that he should nominate <persRef ref="izard-george">General
								Izzard</persRef> of South-Carolina, as Governor of Arkansas. I told
							him, I should be highly gratified with the appointment of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett to Spain— That I believed the
							transfer of Smith to Madrid <pb type="ms" n="58"/>and of Appleton to
							London would be the most proper arrangement that could be made, to do
							justice to all parties: and that I could have no objection to the
							appointment of Izzard as Governor of Arkansas. But I wished him to
							consider whether for his own sake rather than mine he had not better
							defer these nominations till after the Election, as I believed they
							would otherwise be suspected at least to have a bearing on that Event.
							After I returned from the President’s, <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> called at my
							Office. He spoke of the President’s views with respect to the
							appointments, and of the quarrels between <persRef key="rush-richard"
								>Rush</persRef> and Smith, and in which he said there was wrong on
							both sides— He spoke also of the case between the Consul at Pernambuco,
								<persRef ref="bennett-james">Bennett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kirkpatrick-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kirkpatrick</persRef>— He glanced at the Election, of which however
							he spoke with great reserve— There was a party, this Evening at <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A.

							engaged from six to near eleven O’Clock, in giving my answers to the
							Cross-interrogatories, under the Commission from the Supreme Court of
							Pennsylvania, in the case of <persRef ref="harris-levett"
								>Harris</persRef> and <persRef ref="lewis-william">Lewis</persRef>.

							to be annexed, before the Oath is administered to me— I gave these
							answers because the Courts decided that they had not the power to compel
							the production of the papers.</p>

						<p><date>25. VI.</date><persRef ref="sullivan-george">George

							whatever might be its effects upon the election: but I recommended to
							him to advise with the members, best acquainted with the temper of the
							house, whether the claim itself, would now have so fair a chance of
							success, as after the election— There is at this moment a very high
							state of excitement in the house, <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, but that the <persRef
								ref="crawford-susanna;jackson-rachel" type="multi">Ladies</persRef>,

								ref="mclane-louis">L. M’Lane</persRef> of Delaware, who told him
							they would overthrow the Capitol, sooner than he would vote for Jackson,
							but who professed an intention almost as decided, not to vote for me.
							The impression almost universal made yesterday was that the Election was
							settled in my favour; but the result of the Countermovement, will be the
							real crisis, and I have little doubt that will be decisive the other
							way. My situation will be difficult and trying beyond my powers of

								ref="rose-robert2">R. Rose</persRef> M.H.R. from New-York came for a

								Shriver</persRef> of the surveying corps. At the Office <persRef

							recommending M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warner, to M<hi

								<persRef ref="platt-charles">Platt’s</persRef> report of the origin

							The case appears upon this report very disadvantageously to Porter— I
							spoke of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> O’Brien’s enquiries whether a

							put the question, as to the propriety of his answering interrogatories,
							in the case of <persRef ref="harris-levett">Harris</persRef> vs <persRef
								ref="lewis-william">Lewis</persRef>— There was much conversation and

							further information would be taken upon the subject &amp; that if the
							Consul had harboured conspirators against the Spanish Government, while
							in pursuit of their objects, he would not be countenanced by us; but if
							he had merely afforded a momentary shelter, and hospitality to
							unfortunate fugitives from another Country, whatever their projects
							might have been there, I did not think it a matter suitable for
							representations calling censure upon him, from any foreign Nation. The
							Baron thought there were gradations of censure, some severe, some
							slight, and that the mere reception (accueil) of persons like the
							fugitives from Tarifa, might be considered as an indiscretion. I asked
							him to suppose they had escaped to this Country— Would representations
							against the reception of them have been proper? He thought there was a
							distinction between the cases, but said, as M<hi rend="superscript"

								>r</hi> Clay came in and sat with me a couple of hours, discussing
							all the prospects and probabilities of the Presidential election— He
							spoke to me with the utmost freedom of men and things— Intimated doubts
							and prepossessions concerning individual friends of mine, to all which I
							listened with due consideration. He was anxious for the conciliation of
							Webster and <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Louis M’Lane</persRef>, and
							expressed some jealousy as from Webster, of the persons by whom he
							supposed me to be surrounded— I told him the source of Webster’s

							which my overtures had been received by him, and my own high opinion of

								ref="hammond-jabez">Jabez B. Hammond</persRef> as being here to
							promote the views of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor

							critical. He is attacked with fury in the Newspapers for having come out

						<p><date>31. VII.</date> Card from <persRef ref="clay-henry">H.
								Clay</persRef> this morning in the National Intelligencer. <persRef
								ref="jennings-jonathan">Jon<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
								Jennings</persRef> M.H.R. from Indiana, introduced a <persRef
								ref="gregg-harvey">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gregg</persRef>
							from that State. Jennings told me that <persRef ref="hendricks-william"
								>W. Hendricks</persRef>, the present Governor, was elected to the
							Senate. <persRef ref="miller-daniel">D. H. Miller</persRef> M.H.R. from
							Pennsylvania brought a <persRef ref="robbins-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robbins</persRef>, who had an
							application for a Patent. <persRef ref="sullivan-george">G.
								Sullivan</persRef> came and told me that the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had returned from his visit
							to the Ship North-Carolina. That he was determined this day or to-morrow
							to make the nominations to all the foreign Missions— That <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> was to be appointed
							to Spain, or Mexico; and that <persRef ref="stokes-montfort">M.
								Stokes</persRef> of North-Carolina, was also to be appointed to a
							Mission— Sullivan afterwards called at the Office, and said that
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> were there— He had no doubt
							engaged in prevailing upon the President to make these nominations <hi
								rend="italic">now</hi>— I called at the President’s and found
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Calhoun and Southard with him,
							but they immediately withdrew— I delivered to him, two or three
							despatches received from <persRef ref="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>
							and the Letter last received from <persRef ref="mullowny-john">S.
								Mullowny</persRef>— I also read to him the Note received from
								<persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">S. Rebello</persRef>, Charge
							d’Affaires from Brazil, proposing an Alliance Offensive and Defensive,
							which he said must be declined— He soon began to speak however of the
							nominations, and said he believed he should send them immediately. I
							observed that I should be perfectly satisfied if he would determine upon
							his selection of the persons now, and propose the nominations, but I was
							convinced it would much increase the excitement already great and every
							day inflaming, if he should send in the nominations <hi rend="italic"
								>now</hi>, or before the Election— I asked him if he had been
							advised to this measure by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun— He
							said he had; and by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, by <persRef
								ref="elliott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eliott</persRef>
							S.U.S. from Georgia, and by <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef> M.H.R. from
							Virginia— I said that the motives of all these Gentlemen, or of those by
							whom they were instigated, were suspicions of me. Suspicions that I was
							using these vacant missions as lures to promote my own election in the
							House— They wished to take this weapon out of my hands. They were
							mistaken. The only person whom I wished to recommend to him, was one of
							those whom he proposed to nominate. I was willing he should fix all his
							nominations <hi rend="italic">now</hi>— It would disconcert no
							arrangements of mine, and I had no suspicion, that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> would use the
							suspension of them to promote <hi rend="italic">his </hi>election— The
							President had named, <persRef ref="dallas-george">G. M.
							Dallas</persRef>, <persRef ref="wheaton-joseph">Joseph
							Wheaton</persRef>, <persRef ref="garnett-robert">Garnett</persRef>, and
							M. Stokes, and <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef> as
							candidates for the Mexican Mission. He said he had proposed it to
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef> who had declined— I
							said I had objections to only one of these persons, and they arose from
							my belief of his incompetency to the trust of a Mission abroad— I named
							him and the President fully concurred with me in opinion. I spoke of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benton’s talents with respect, though
							after his violent and deadly feuds with Gen<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Jackson, had had within a few days come out for him. The
							President intimated that Poinsett had recommended Benton to him which
							resolves the whole mystery. The President thought that the agreement
							between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliott and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun proved that their opinion could
							not be founded on the same motive with reference to the election: and
							was utterly astonished when I informed him of the movements towards
							coalition between General Jackson and <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>— He had never heard of the visits exchanged
							between <persRef ref="jackson-rachel;crawford-susanna" type="multi"
								>their Ladies</persRef>, nor of the advances made between their
							friends to a concert of opposition to me. He told me that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had often spoken to him with the
							utmost severity of the character of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Jackson, in regard to moral principle; and that Jackson, had done <pb
								type="ms" n="65"/>the same of Crawford— That more than two years
							since Jackson had urged him very earnestly to remove Crawford from the
							Treasury— That he had then told Jackson, that Crawford had claims upon
							his forbearance and friendship, which he had perhaps upon no other man.
							That he had explained these to General Jackson, who admitted the force
							of them, and had not spoken to him upon the subject since. We had much
							more Conversation, in which the President appeared to be greatly
							shocked, at the idea of a coalition between General Jackson and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— He said it was horrible to think
							of— He said Elliott was the only man of the Georgia delegation who saw
							him in a friendly manner— That Elliott at the last Session of Congress
							had spoken to him with the deepest distrust of Calhoun, and when I told
							him that I knew Elliott had said the Georgia delegation would in the
							last resort vote for Jackson, he seemed scarcely to credit his own ears.
							He spoke of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s conduct respecting
							his Administration as he had done before— He thought that when two or
							three years since the violent opposition against the Administration was
							raised by Crawford’s friends, and apparently under his countenance, in
							disavowing that opposition he ought to have done some act, publicly to
							separate himself from them— I thought so too— But he said that in
							consequence of his former relations with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, he had treated him with uniform and unqualified
							kindness—instancing his permitting him the use of a fac-simile
							signature; and forbearing to appoint a temporary acting Secretary of the
							Treasury, upon the certificate of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s physicians that he was competent to discharge the duties of
							his Office— I said I approved this, and thought that as there had not
							been sufficient cause for him to remove M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, so there would not be sufficient Cause for his successor to
							remove him— The President said he had long supposed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun, were friendly to my election— I said I believed
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard was, but his situation
							neutralised him, or made him act counter to his wishes; and he was under
							extreme pressure to support the cause of General Jackson— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s case was different. His
							situation was peculiar; and so had been his conduct— I did not believe
							his wishes were favourable to me. The President said he would further
							consider the case of the nominations— After I returned to the Office,
							Sullivan, and <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">T. Fuller</persRef> were there— Fuller informed
							me that <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> had this day told
							him, that Georgia would vote for Crawford to the last— I attended the
							Theatre this Evening— Saw the Gamester— Beverley by <persRef
								ref="cooper-thomas2">Cooper</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Beverley by <persRef ref="barnes-mary">M<hi

							of the Irishman in London— Walk home with Sullivan— <persRef
								ref="addington-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addington</persRef> the British Charge D’Affaires was this morning
							at the Office, with a newspaper rumour from Europe that the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef> had declared that unless
							the United States would revoke the resignation of the South-American
							Republics he would revoke the cession of the Florida’s. I read to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington the despatch from <persRef

							contained ample refutation of the rumour.</p>
