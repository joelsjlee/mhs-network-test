							it undecided whether they were to pursue the Inquiry upon the second
							charge. Southard proposed to discharge them from the former precept, but
							to send them another precept to assemble again at the same time and

						<p>It was determined that Porter should be tried by a Court martial for the

							upon his tour home; to fetch his family— He asked me how long I would
							give him permission of absence; I told him at his own discretion; being
							sure that he would not lengthen it without necessity; and understanding
							of course that in case of any sudden emergency requiring his presence
							here, we could give him timely notice of it. He said he expected to
							return with his family about the middle of July— He had sent me a Letter
							to him from <persRef ref="brent-william">W. Brent</persRef>, member of
							the House from Louisiana, strongly urging the removal of <persRef
								ref="sterret-unknown">Sterret</persRef> the Naval Officer at
							New-Orleans, as a noisy and clamorous <hi rend="italic">reviler</hi><pb
								type="ms" n="148"/>reviler of the administration, who was concerned
							in a project of some worthless persons like himself to insult Brent,
							when he passed through New-Orleans at the Theatre, for his vote at the
							Election—which project however failed. And Brent’s Letter says that a
							vast majority of the people of Louisiana, are entirely satisfied with
							the election— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay also urged the removal
							of Sterret, and observed that with regard to the conduct of persons
							holding Offices at the pleasure of the President, the course of the
							administration should be to avoid on the one hand political persecution;
							and on the other an appearance of pusillanimity. That so long as the
							election was pending, every man was free to indulge his preference for
							any of the Candidates, but after it was decided no officer depending
							upon the will of the President for his place, should be permitted to
							hold a conduct in open and continual disparagement of the Administration
							and its head— I said these principles were undoubtedly correct; but
							there was some difficulty and great delicacy in the application of them
							to individuals. If the charge could be specifically brought home to
							Sterret of having concerted or countenanced a purpose of public insult
							to a member of Congress for the honest and independent discharge of his
							duty, I would not hesitate to remove such a black guard as unworthy of
							holding any public trust, whatever— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brent only mentions this as a design of Sterret’s, never carried into
							execution— And as a design it could scarcely be susceptible of proof.
							Should I remove Sterret by a mere executive fiat—he would consider
							himself injured and immediately demand the cause of his removal— To
							answer merely that it was the pleasure of the President, would be harsh
							and odious—inconsistent with the principle upon which I have commenced
							the Administration, of removing no person from Office, but for cause,
							and would lead to the inference that I was ashamed to assign the real
							cause— That real cause, an intention never carried into act, would
							scarcely justify the removal of a man from office in the public opinion—
							It would be thought to indicate an irritable, hasty, and vindictive
							temper; and give rise to newspaper discussions of which all the
							disadvantage would fall upon the Administration— Besides, should I
							remove this man for this cause, it must be upon some fixed principle,
							which would apply to others as well as to him. And where was it possible
							to draw the line? Of the custom house Officers throughout the union,
							four-fifths in all probability were opposed to my election— There were
							now all in my power, and I had been urged very earnestly and from
							various quarters to sweep away my opponents, and provide with their
							places for my friends— I can justify the refusal to adopt this policy,
							only by the steadiness and consistency of my adhesion to my own— If I
							depart from this in one instance, I shall be called upon by my friends
							to do the same in many: an invidious and inquisitorial scrutiny into the
							personal dispositions of public officers, will creep through the whole
							union, and the most selfish and sordid passions will be kindled into
							activity to distort the conduct and misrepresent the feelings of men,
							whose places may become the prize of Slander upon them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay did not press the subject any
							farther—</p>
						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Sigourney resides at Hartford,
							Connecticut, and is the Son, of <persRef ref="sigourney-charles">one of

								<persRef ref="sigourney-lydia">Miss Huntly</persRef>, an

							had deliberately decided against writing to Boyer, because it would be
							an acknowledgment of his Government: and I could not, at least so soon

						<p>Burr asks a suspension of the appointment of judge Grant, as Collector at
							Oswego, and recommends <persRef ref="easton-joseph">Joseph
								Easton</persRef>. Says he knows both well— That Grant was his
							partner in Law practice one year was of intemperate habits, and doubtful

							the return of revenue would be doubled within one year, from that place. </p>
						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Teackle came to renew his application for
							an appointment abroad; and told me he was going to pass a few weeks at
							Philadelphia— Weightman the Mayor of this City came with a Resolution of
							the Corporation to raise 40000 dollars by Lottery—10.000 dollars for
							each of the years 1822. 3. 4. and 5. The approbation of the Presidents
							to the act, is necessary for its validity, and I had doubts upon the
							Construction of the Law. It is the Act of incorporation of the City of
							15. May 1820. and provides that not more than ten thousand dollars shall
							be raised by Lottery in one year— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Weightman said there was a precedent, sanctioned by <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>, when President, which I desired him to send me. I
							told him I should take the opinion of the <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Attorney-General</persRef>, on the construction of the Law; and he
							said the Corporation would also consult their Counsel— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham brought me a list of the
							Land-grants signed by me, remaining at the Land-Office— Mentioned the
							propriety of appointing a Register at Cahaba; and the disposal of the
							Choctaw School-fund. The Power of acting for the President was
							heretofore given to the Secretary of War. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard by a Note asked for my decision upon the appointment of Grant
							as Collector at Oswego— I sent for him, and told him of the information
							given me by Burr; upon which without much relying upon it, I concluded
							to suspend the appointment, and let Grant be informed, that I considered
								<persRef ref="sage-nathan">Sage’s</persRef> Letter as not a positive
							resignation: without which I should <pb type="ms" n="150"/>should not
							make the appointment: and that there had been presented to me,
							objections to the appointment of Grant himself— The Court of enquiry
							upon <persRef ref="porter-david">Captain Porter</persRef> is still
							sitting; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard again expressed his
							belief that with regard to the transportation of specie Porter’s conduct
							would be fully justified.</p>
						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour had intelligence from <persRef
								ref="barbour-thomas">his father</persRef> who is convalescent. He
							spoke of a Mexican expedition against Cuba— Then of the very critical
							state of affairs between the State of Georgia and the Creek Indians.
							Brought me a Letter from the Agent <persRef ref="crowell-john"
								>Crowell</persRef>, of 27. April, complaining of the <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Governor of Georgia</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour said he would make a Report upon
							the question of Rank between Generals <persRef ref="gaines-edmund"
								>Gaines</persRef> and <persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef>.
							The correspondence between those officers was extremely acrimonious.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour’s opinion coincides with that
							of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>; decisively in
							favour of Gaines— The question ought to have been decided by the last
							Administration; but it was evaded by <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, on the pretence
							that it was merely an <hi rend="italic">abstract</hi> question! Scott
							however produced a private Letter from Calhoun to him, written when it
							was expected that the command of the army would be vacated by the
							decease of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown, and promising it in
							that event to Scott— Judge Grant came with a petition from Inhabitants
							of Sodus for appointment of <persRef ref="hill-ishmael">Ishmael D.
								Hill</persRef> as Light-house keeper, and with solicitations for
							himself as Collector at a Oswego— Says it is his only subsistence— I

						<p>These four Creek Indians called on me this morning before breakfast, with
							a Letter from <persRef ref="troup-george">Gov<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Troup</persRef> of Georgia, and a talk sent by him to
							certain other Creek Chiefs— The Letter which is in a style similar to
							that which the same personage used with <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, announced to me the
							murder of the Chief called <persRef ref="mcintosh-william">General
								Mackintosh</persRef>, which was confirmed by Chilly who narrowly
							escaped himself with his life. It was on Saturday the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month—that a party of about 400
							surrounded, and set fire to his house, and killed him, and another chief
							his next door neighbour— Troup charges <persRef ref="crowell-john"
								>Crowell</persRef> the Agent with having instigated this massacre,
							and vows revenge, with a Spirit as ferocious as ever inspired any Creek
							Indian— I told Chilly that I was deeply distressed at these melancholy
							tidings, and would do all that would be in my power for him: advising
							him to call upon the <persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary at
								War</persRef> to-morrow— I stopped myself at his house as I was
							going to Church, and he being gone out, left the papers with word that I
							would call again after Church— Heard <persRef ref="little-robert"
								>Little</persRef> 1. Corinthians 12.25: “That there should be no
							schism in the body.” from the purport of the discourse I should suppose
							there was some misunderstanding within his own congregation, or between
							him and them. I asked <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Bulfinch</persRef> to call at
							my house at Noon to-morrow. I again called at Governor Barbour’s house,
							and found him at home; deeply affected <unclear>at</unclear>
							<pb type="ms" n="151"/>at the intelligence from Georgia; thinking
							Governor Troup a madman, and very apprehensive of opposition— I desired
							him to confer with these Indians to-morrow morning; ascertain what they
							wished to have done; what disposable force may be directed to the
							threatened part of Georgia; and what answer should be given to Gov<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Troup.— At home I read <persRef
								ref="colman-henry">Colman</persRef> Sermon 9. upon the progress and
							prospects of the Gospel; then heard a Stranger at <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>
							from Acts 13.38.39. “Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren,
							that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:— And
							by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye
							could not be justified by the Law of <persRef ref="moses"
								>Moses</persRef>.” Here again was justification by faith— Read
							before and after dinner <persRef ref="johnson-samuel"
								>Johnson’s</persRef> Sermon 4. upon Charity; an occasional discourse
							delivered at Bath— Heard Little again in the Evening from Luke 13.20.21.
							“And again he said, whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?— It is
							like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till
							the whole was leavened.” On returning home I found at my door <persRef

							visits to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							has been paid without objection— I promised to refer the case to
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
								Brent</persRef>— Watkins spoke of a Letter from <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="hammond-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hammond</persRef> of Cincinnati, Ohio, written last October, and to
							be published with a Letter of comment by Hammond, in the National
							Intelligencer— It states Clay’s objections against voting for <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>— I doubted the expediency of the publication at
							this time; believing it totally useless for Clay himself who needs no
							justification with the Nation at large, and who could not by any
							publication <pb type="ms" n="152"/>publication at this time satisfy
							those, who are still dissatisfied— But it would bear an appearance of
							unkindness to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, who never will be
							a candidate again, and whom to expose now is to war with the dead—
							Watkins spoke also with bitterness of <persRef ref="wyer-edward"
								>Wyer</persRef>, who has abused him in the Washington City Gazette,
							and he told me of the manner in which Wyer refused the offer of going as
							a Messenger to England, with the appointment of <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> to
							the Treasury Department; and afterwards resented the employment of
								<persRef ref="watkins-william">Watkins’s son</persRef> upon the same
							business. <persRef ref="graham-george">G. Graham</persRef> came to speak
							of the Choctaw school fund. Has found at the Bank, the papers relating
							to the Stock standing in the name of P.U.S. for the Seneka’s. <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							had given him Graham while acting Secretary of War, and to his

								Calhoun</persRef> as his Successor, and by him was assigned to
								<persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major Van de Venter</persRef>,
							as Chief Clerk of the Department. But part of the fund is in Stock which
							was redeemed last year, and not having been reinvested, the interest
							upon it has been lost. This shews still further the necessity of
							providing some regular system of accountability for the investment of
							the money, and the payment of the Dividends— <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governour Barbour</persRef> came in, while I was
							conversing with Graham on this subject— It was new to him— He will
							enquire concerning the state of the annuity to the Seneka’s— He had seen
								<persRef ref="mcintosh-chilly">Chilly Mackintosh</persRef>, and the
							other Creek Chiefs. They charge <persRef ref="crowell-john"
								>Crowell</persRef> the Agent with having refused the Mackintosh
							party rations at the Council Meeting, and insinuate that he instigated
							the other chiefs to the murder of Mackintosh. I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour to bring them to some specific
							charge against Crowell, which he might be called to answer— He proposes
							to send a trusty special sub-agent, to carry an answer to the <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, who threatens on
							the part of that State, immediate acts of violence for retaliation or
							protection—to inform the Governor of Georgia, that the United States
							never have interposed, and cannot interpose in transactions of internal
							feuds in an Indian tribe—that the messenger go to the upper Creeks, and
							inform them of the horror with which we have received the information of
							these outrages: to warn them against further violence; advise them to
							return to their homes, and give them permission to send a deputation
							here next winter as they have requested— I approved of these measures,
							but am persuaded they will be insufficient; and apprehend this massacre
							is only the signal for a ferocious Indian War; bursting upon us like a
							thunderbolt. I requested the Secretary of War to ascertain and let me
							know, what military force we could bring to bear immediately upon the
							menaced borders of Georgia— <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">C.
								Bulfinch</persRef> came as I had requested; and we viewed with
								Gov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Barbour the designs and models,
							for the premium. I desired Bulfinch to tell <persRef ref="elgar-joseph"
								>Elgar</persRef> that I declined deciding which design should have
							the premium; believing that no one of them was entitled to it. But as I
							was unwilling merely upon my own opinion to decide against all the

						<p><persRef ref="watkins-tobias">Watkins</persRef> brought me the Letter of
								<persRef ref="hammond-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hammond</persRef> of Cincinnati to the Editors of the National
							Intelligencer, and the Extracts from <persRef key="clay-henry"
								>Clay’s</persRef> Letter to him written last October stating
							objections to a vote for <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— There were several
							erasures from the extracts: of passages which Watkins had thought it
							would be advisable to omit— This confirmed me in the opinion that it
							would be better not to publish it, at all— The passages erased were of
							no consequence in themselves but as they would give a handle for
							cavillers— Watkins gave me also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">H. Niles</persRef>, in behalf of <persRef
								ref="rodney-thomas">T. M. Rodney</persRef> with whose appointment as
							commercial Agent at the Havana, he wishes that his recommendation
							yesterday of <persRef ref="simonton-john">Simonton</persRef> may not
							interfere. <persRef ref="mcintyre-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> M’Intyre</persRef> was a man of whom I had no knowledge
							but who came to borrow 200 dollars— I gave <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> several papers for reference to the Departments
							both of the Treasury and the Navy. The Court of Inquiry have made a call
							for Documents which make it a matter for consideration whether the
							Correspondence between the Navy Department and him of the last year
							should not be laid before them— <persRef ref="porter-david"
								>Porter’s</persRef> conduct was then so dissatisfactory to <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President Monroe</persRef>, that he declined
							seeing Porter, and but for his previous services would then have brought
							him to a Court-Martial— But as no measure was actually taken against him
							then it seems unfair to make <pb type="ms" n="154"/>to make his conduct
							then a subject of censorial inquiry now— I gave Southard the opinion of
								<persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter Jones</persRef> upon the proposed
							City Lottery, and asked him to write to The <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Attorney General</persRef> who is at Baltimore, asking his opinion
							of the legality of this quadruple Lottery and also to give me his own—
							On examination of the precedent cited by Jones, it does not bear him out
							in his argument. Southard’s first impression was like mine that the Law
							does not give the President the power to approve such a Lottery. The
								<persRef ref="cowles-salmon">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Salmon Cowles</persRef> came twice for a Subscription for Alma
							College, at New Athens, Harrison County Ohio— <persRef
								ref="bainbridge-william">Captain Bainbridge</persRef> introduced a

								Payne</persRef>, son of late <persRef ref="payne-william">M<hi

							was to leave the City to-morrow Morning— <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Governor Barbour</persRef> had further Letters from <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Governor Troup</persRef> of Georgia; with
							enclosures leading to the expectation that within three days from the
							time when they were written a hostile incursion of Creek Indians into
							Georgia, was thought inevitable. Barbour had prepared an answer to
							Troup’s first Letter, which has now become unsuitable. <persRef
								ref="mcintosh-chilly">Chilly Mackintosh</persRef> has made written
							specific charges against the <persRef ref="crowell-john">Agent
								Crowell</persRef>, and presents various claims for protection and
							indemnity— Referring to the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of
							the Treaty of Indian Springs, which contains a promise of protection,
							very insidiously introduced and the purport of which was certainly not
							considered by the Senate when they advised to the ratification of the
							Treaty— I directed that Crowell should be suspended from the Agency, and
							called to answer to the Charges of Governor Troup and of Mackintosh— In
							the mean time that a special temporary agent should be appointed— That
								<persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> should be
							consulted and <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef>
							ordered to repair to the neighbourhood of the Creek Territory and to
							wait there for Instructions. No report yet from Crowell— The instant we
							begin to move, the want of money is felt; the means of the Executive are
							so limited; and the aspect of War is so menacing, that I know not how we
							shall avoid the necessity of calling Congress together in the midst of
							Summer— Rodney and <persRef ref="purviance-unknown">Purviance</persRef>
							both came to obtain the appointment of commercial agent at the Havana:
							they were both here together; Rodney with <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">S. Pleasonton</persRef>, and Purviance with
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">D. Brent</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="mountain-john">Mountain</persRef> afterwards came with T.
							Randall, to solicit the same office— D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Watkins came afterwards with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard; to
							ask an order upon the Navy Department, from me for the payment of about
							9000 dollars, due to the <persRef ref="johnson-unknown6">Widow</persRef>
							and Administrator, of a <persRef ref="johnson-unknown7">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef>, a Purser in the
							Navy, who is herself at the point of Death. The account is adjusted, and
							the balance due to Johnson acknowledged; but it is charged upon a
							contingent appropriation before 1824 which is exhausted— There is no
							fund from which the payment can be made; and the question is whether I
							could transfer the payment of it to any other appropriation— I thought I
							could not but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard took the papers to
							consult the Laws concerning transfers of appropriation, according to
							which I am definitively to act. <persRef ref="elgar-joseph"

							necessary, of the four companies at Pensacola, and to take command of
							the Georgia Militia, to be called out, if required— The difficulty is to
							provide for the expence, for which great responsibility must be assumed,
							and we are to consult further. I told <persRef ref="rodney-thomas"

								ref="bomford-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Bomford</persRef> and <persRef ref="king-charles2">King</persRef>
							came to examine the designs and models for the Tympanum, and thought

									rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef>, corrected some of
							the Books having been already procured.</p>
						<p>With <persRef ref="brown-jacob">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Brown</persRef> I had a long Conversation, upon the prospects of a
							War, with the Creek Indians. He remarked upon the extreme violence of
								<persRef ref="troup-george">Governor Troup</persRef>; but observed
							that an Indian war, might be an object of profitable interest to the
							State of Georgia. He spoke of <persRef ref="gaines-edmund"
								>Gaines</persRef> as a very fair, honourable and virtuous man, but
							somewhat excitable; entertaining sentiments of strong aversion to the
							Indians, and perhaps liable to be influenced by some indiscreet persons,
							connected with him— Among the rest he mentioned his <persRef
								ref="butler-robert">Aide de Camp Butler</persRef>, who was recently
							with him here; a near connection of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson’s</persRef>, and who behaved so improperly to
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>— Brown said he had written to Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Gaines on the subject, and hoped M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had been mistaken in the opinion that
							Butler had purposely withheld his hand from him in my antichamber. I
							said I hoped it would prove so; thinking it very unjustifiable conduct
							in Lieutenant Butler, if intended by him.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef>, the Russian
							Minister came at one O’Clock. Gave me thanks for the communication to
							him of the Instruction to <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton</persRef> relating to the
							State of the War between Spain and her continental American ex-Colonies.
							He spoke in terms of high commendation of this measure; and said that
							without being able to anticipate, what the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> determination upon it may be; he is quite sure
							that it will be received and treated by him, with great consideration,
							and as an act equally marked by moderation, candour and friendly <hi
								rend="italic">feeling</hi><pb type="ms" n="157"/>feeling towards him
							on the part of the United States. He said he was very desirous that
							there should be time for this measure to have its full effect, and
							observing in the newspapers a Proclamation of <persRef
								ref="santaanna-antonio">General Santa Ana</persRef>, of Guatemala,
							for an expedition against the Island of Cuba, he hoped the Government of
							the United States would exercise their influence with those of
							South-America, to suspend any such movement at this time, the result of
							which might much increase the difficulties of the pacification which was
							so much to be desired— He also enquired if he might communicate to the
							Russian Ambassadors at Paris and London, <persRef
								ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef> the substance of the
							Instruction to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton. It was possible
							especially that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pozzo di Borgo, upon
							receiving the information, might even before the Instruction would reach
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, give some hint, and
							exercise some influence at Madrid, which might prevent any counteraction
							there to the purpose intended by it. I answered the Baron, that I had
							been glad to have an opportunity of manifesting my Sentiments towards
							him, by the confidential communication of the Instruction to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton— This has been sent upon the
							special emergency of the times, since the annihilation of the Spanish
							force in Peru: from a full confidence in the moderation and magnanimity
							of the Emperor, and from the conviction that his power might now be most
							efficaciously interposed to restore, and preserve the Peace of the
							world. It was apparent that the Spanish dominion was annihilated on the
							American Continents— The Castles of Callao and of San Juan d’Ulua, were
							the only two spots of which they retained possession; both besieged, and
							incapable henceforth of affording the means of offensive operations to
							Spain— But Cuba still remained in her possession, and was a post of
							annoyance both against Mexico and Colombia. Released from the necessity
							and occasion of employing their armed force upon their own territories,
							they <hi rend="italic">must</hi> naturally look to Cuba, as a stronghold
							of their Enemy, an attack upon which by them was an essential part of
							their defence of themselves— But neither Mexico, nor Colombia, were
							desirous of atchieving the conquest of Cuba, with a view of annexing it
							to themselves. From its situation and the character of its population it
							could only prove an useless and insupportable burden to them. Neither
							were the United States desirous of making it a part of their
							confederation. But the island was at their doors; they could not suffer
							it to be transferred from Spain to any other European Power; nor could
							they willingly see it conquered either by Mexico or Columbia— These
							sentiments of ours were known to the Governments of those two Republics,
							and were not disapproved by them. We should dissuade them from the
							expedition against Cuba, for the present— But we must treat with them as
							independent Nations, and while Cuba and Porto-Rico were held by Spain,
							as stations from which to organize expeditions against them, we can
							neither demand nor expect that they should abstain from hostile
							enterprizes against those Islands in their turn. Cuba was to the United
							States an object of paramount commercial importance— The capital
							employed in the trade was greater than that with all the dominions of
							France: the tonnage employed in it nearly equal to that with
							Great-Britain— We were content that it should remain in its present
							Condition, under the dominion of Spain, but <hi rend="italic"
								>enjoying</hi><pb type="ms" n="158"/>enjoying a free trade with us.
							If the Emperor Alexander should present these Considerations to Spain,
							founded as they are upon a most important interest of Spain herself, we
							cannot doubt that they would prove efficacious; by preserving to Spain
							two Islands immensely valuable to her; by restoring general peace; and
							by accomplishing an arrangement adapted at once to the interests of all
							the European and all the American Powers— I consented that he should
							communicate to Pozzo di Borgo, and to Count Lieven the substance of the
							Instructions to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton; but requested
							both for the safety of the conveyance, and to give me an opportunity of
							letting <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brown</persRef> at Paris know that the Russian Ambassador there
							would have this information, that he would send this despatch by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King who is to sail from New-York the
							first of June— He readily agreed to this, and said he would communicate
							to me a copy of his despatches to the Ambassadors on this subject.</p>
						<p>On leaving the Baron I found <persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour</persRef> the Secretary of War
							in my Cabinet. He had this morning received intelligence of the decease
							of <persRef ref="barbour-thomas">his father</persRef> at the age of 90.—
							The importance of the public despatches also received this morning had
							alone induced him to come out. He had further Letters from the Governor
							of Georgia, with enclosures of false and fabricated intelligence; and
							two Letters of 2. and 6. May from the <persRef ref="crowell-john">Agent
								Crowell</persRef>. <persRef ref="littleprince">The Little
								Prince</persRef>, an eminent Creek Chief told Crowell that the
							Massacre of <persRef ref="mcintosh-william">Mackintosh</persRef> was
							only the Execution of a Law of the tribe, and disclaimed all intention
							of hostile designs against any white man— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Barbour had a draft of Instructions to Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Gaines, to which he proposed to add a Supplementary Letter, in
							consequence of these advices from Crowell. Major Andrew is to be sent
							off as a special Agent to-morrow, with a contingent power to suspend
							Crowell if necessary; for in his second Letter this Agent expresses an
							apprehension that he might be charged by his Enemies in Georgia, with
							being accessary to the Slaughter of Mackintosh, and most solemnly
							disclaims having had any knowledge of it. I thought it would therefore
							be a harsh measure in this state of things to suspend him positively,
							and might have a bad effect upon the Indians themselves, and urge them
							to desperation, when they might otherwise be restrained— I thought it
							advisable also that Gaines’s authority to act by hostile measures should
							be expressly limited to the protection of the Georgia frontier, or to
							the event that the Indians who slew Mackintosh should continue embodied
							and continuing their outrages upon the other party— Governor Troup’s
							measures have been exceedingly hasty and intemperate—
								<unclear>symbols</unclear>
							<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> S.N.T. came in while M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Barbour was with me, and we had consultation as to the mode
							of placing money at the disposal of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Gaines— The sum to be limited to 100000 dollars and to be furnished by
							drafts on the Collector at New-York. He had some written observations of
								<persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef> on it, which
							he left with me. He also read a very long Letter from <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>,
							who is at Baltimore, in favour of the three founderies which furnish the
							Ordnance, against the proposed advertisement for contracts by
							under-bidding. Barbour had ordered the advertisements to issue
							to-morrow. After Wirt’s Letter was read, and much conversation
							concerning it, I thought it best to suspend the advertisement for
							further Consideration, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour will
							order accordingly. Southard had likewise received <pb type="ms" n="159"

							give countenance and encouragement to Agriculture— The Exhibition is to
							be the first and second of June— The best exhibitions on the first; and
							the distribution of the Premiums which they wish the President to make
							is on the second— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour had not
							received his invitation. I had received mine, and had delayed answering

							their Exhibition— To gratify this wish, I must give four days of my
							time; no trifle of expense, and set a precedent for being claimed as an
							article of exhibition at all the Cattle shows throughout the Union— From
							Cattle-shows to other public Meetings for purposes of utility, or
							exposures of public Sentiment the transition is natural and easy—
							Invitations to them would multiply from week to week, and every
							compliance would breed the necessity for numerous excuses and apologies—
							Finally this is no part of my duties; and some duty must be neglected to
							attend to it— Seest thou a man diligent <hi rend="italic">in his</hi>
							business?— I answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Skinner, declining
							the invitation. Governor Barbour proposes to go; and thence to the
							examination at West Point—to Boston—Portsmouth—and perhaps to Portland—
							The question about the purchases of Ordnance recurred again. I made
							several enquiries, as to the prices of the Articles furnished by the

						<p>through Baltimore. Phillips was for coming with him to Washington, and
							intends to publish a pamphlet— He told D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Waterhouse, that if <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson</persRef> had been President
							he would have been restored to the service. That he had shewn him all
							his papers and the General said it was a perfectly clear case in his
							favour. I told the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that I had expected
							Phillips would publish a pamphlet, but it would not aid his cause— I
							declined restoring him to the service, on the ground that the President
							had no lawful power to restore an officer once dismissed— But on the
							merits of the case I should have come to the same conclusion— I had
							ascertained that his statement was essentially incorrect in point of
							fact—and even if true shewed that he ought to have been dismissed.
							Phillips told Waterhouse that while Secretary of State I had assured him
							that the decision depended entirely upon the President; which he thought
							inconsistent with my decision now— But in saying that the decision
							depended upon the President my only meaning was that I, as Secretary of
							State had nothing to do with the matter— That it was the President’s
							power and duty to decide upon his memorial; but not that he must or even
							could decide it in his favour. This morning D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Waterhouse called and left with me some manuscripts of his
							own writing, in which he undertakes to prove that the <persRef
								ref="pitt-william">Earl of Chatham</persRef> was the author of the
							Letters of Junius— The Doctor proceeded also upon his pilgrimage to
							Monticello. <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Southard</persRef> came with some papers concerning a
							dismission and restoration to the Service, of <persRef
								ref="rodgers-john">Captain Rodgers</persRef> in 1801. Phillips had
							written to ask copies of these papers which on a first search had not
							been found, but which have since been found. There is a Letter from
								<persRef ref="smith-robert">R. Smith</persRef> Secretary of the Navy
							to Captains <persRef ref="campbell-unknown">Campbell</persRef> and
							Rodgers in 1801. declaring them dismissed in consequence of the
							reduction of the Navy, and about nine months after another Letter to
							Rodgers addressed to him as a Captain in the Navy still. And no
							explanation of this seeming inconsistency. Southard said he recollected
							Rodgers’s having told him, that such a Letter had been written to him,
							but recalled by an express so that he had never received it. Southard
							asked if copies of these papers should be furnished to Phillips as he
							demanded— I thought they should— But that Rodgers as soon as possible,
							and Robert Smith, who in 1801. was Secretary of the Navy in the mean
							time should be enquired of to explain the facts relating to the apparent
							dismission and restoration of Rodgers. Southard left with me several
							papers from <persRef ref="renshaw-james">Lieut<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Renshaw</persRef> Commanding the Naval Station at
							Gosport, complaining of certain newspaper charges against him for having
							sold some old scrap iron at private contract instead of by auction— He

							for payment of the indemnities stipulated in behalf of certain

							contained the Treaty in both languages, as it was concluded. <persRef

								Southard</persRef> brought me a copy of the papers relating to the

							Southard asked if the original papers which Phillips delivered with his

							to him— As he wants them for his publication I <pb type="ms" n="167"/>I
							advised Southard to return them; retaining certified copies of them—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard left with me likewise
							various papers of complaint against a <persRef ref="brown-unknown18"
								>Captain Brown</persRef> of a Revenue Cutter and a minute of the
							disposal of the annual appropriation of the 6000 dollars, contingent at
							the Treasury Department— The appropriation for the year was made on the

							more than 1600 dollars of the last years appropriation, was all absorbed
							within about 500 dollars before the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							March— There was also a Letter from <persRef ref="cushman-hercules"
								>Hercules Cushman</persRef> Collector at Dighton concerning his
							resignation— <persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> came with a
							person from Vermont who has had goods stolen from him at New-York, he
							came here in <unclear>support</unclear> of the thief, having an officer
							of the State of New-York with him— They met the man yesterday between
							this and Baltimore, and brought him here; where after examination before
							a magistrate he was committed— Some of the stolen goods were found upon
							him— The sufferer now wishes that the thief may be delivered up to the
							New-York, to be taken for trial to that State, where the theft was
							committed. This cannot be done without a demand from the Executive of
							the State— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson came at noon, and I
							had a long confidential conversation with him, chiefly upon the Affairs
							of South-America— I told him what had been the course of our
							communications with the Mexican and Columbian Ministers, and of the
							Instructions to our <persRef ref="middleton-henry">Minister at S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg</persRef> to propose the
							interposition of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef> to prevail upon Spain to recognize the South
							American continental powers, and thereby secure the continued possession
							of Cuba and Porto-Rico. I proposed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Anderson, that he should attend the projected Congress of Ministers at
							Panama—to which he readily assented— He thinks that Mexico inclines to
							obtain possession of Cuba, and Colombia of Porto-Rico. He asked if I had
							thought of giving him a colleague for the Congress. I said my own
							inclination was to have but one Minister there; the object of the
							Meeting being to consult, deliberate and report rather than to contract
							any positive engagements. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

							to have two Comissioners, and had mentioned <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin’s</persRef> name for one of them— But Congress would
							consider the expense as an object of some moment and I thought one
							Commissioner would be competent to the duty. Something had been said of
							holding the meeting next October, but we doubted whether it could to any
							useful purpose assemble so soon. If however it should then be held, he
							could attend it when proceeding upon his return to Colombia, and I hoped
							he would be ready to go by the first of September— He thought he should—

								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Gov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cass</persRef>, to stay the proceedings. I made some remarks upon
							the Leases of the lead-mines, which had been left for my approbation,
							one or two of which were found to be not regularly executed. <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> spoke of some question made by the <persRef

							requisitions for warrants upon the Treasury, drawn by <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">D. Brent</persRef> as chief Clerk of the

								ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

								ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef>. It now extends to other objects; but the

							Southard said <persRef ref="force-peter">Force</persRef> had spoken to
							him of <persRef ref="porter-david">Captain Porter’s</persRef> intended
							pamphlet; in which he proposes to publish his correspondence with the
							Navy Department, and the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry; not
							appearing at-all to suspect that he is to be tried by a Court-Martial. I
							asked Southard if he was not ready to have him arrested— He said the
							charges were not yet prepared; but would be in the course of two or
							three days— But he said he could write this day to Porter, and give him
							notice that he would be arrested upon Charges, which I desired him to
							do. Southard had also a private Letter of distressing importunity for
							employment from <persRef ref="forbes-james">James G. Forbes</persRef>,
							with several recommendations of him; I told him I had advised Forbes to
							leave his recommendations at the Department and go home. That his case
							was a very hard one; having been rejected by the Senate upon a
							nomination of the <persRef key="monroe-james">late President</persRef>,
							through the means of secret accusations, which he had no opportunity of
							meeting. I said I should be glad to employ Forbes, if an opportunity
							should present itself; but I knew of none at present. I likewise
							mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard the complaint
							relating to the sale of the Scrap-iron at Norfolk, and told him I was
							not entirely satisfied with <persRef ref="renshaw-james"
								>Renshaw’s</persRef> account of that affair. All our experience goes
							to shew the danger of petty abuses and malversations creeping in at our
							Navy-Yards— The enquiries hitherto had issued in official justification
							of the parties accused, but with considerable dissatisfaction upon the

								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church from John 6.67.68.69. “Then
							said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?— Then <persRef
								ref="peter">Simon Peter</persRef> answered him, Lord, to whom shall
							we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure,
							that thou art that Christ the Son of the living God.” The discourse had
							no particular reference to the day; but reminded me that I had heard
							many years since, a Sermon of Sherlock’s upon a part of this text read.
							(6. July 1806. at Cambridge) <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> came home with us, and
								<persRef ref="thornton-william;thornton-anna" type="multi">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> paid us a visit— The Doctor has so far recovered
							as to go out, but still complains— I read <persRef ref="colman-henry"
								>Colman’s</persRef> Sermon 12. upon self-examination. Heard in the
							afternoon <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, from Ephesians 2.11.12. “Wherefore remember that
							ye, being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called
							uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh
							made by hands.— That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens
							from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the Covenants of
							promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker applied all this to a part of his
							own auditory. He seems some times to be frightened at his own
							denunciations— I read <persRef ref="johnson-samuel"
							>Johnson</persRef>—Sermon 6. upon Pride: and in the Evening heard
								<persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef> from Philippians 1.27. “Only let your conversation
							be as it becometh the gospel of Christ.” On returning home I had not
							strength to write and immediately retired to bed.</p>

								Fürst</persRef> the medalist came this morning, and I sat to him
							about half an hour to take a profile of my face, with a pencil on paper,
							from which he is to engrave it on the die for the medals to be
							distributed to the Indians. In about ten days the die will be so far

							engrave in the antique costume. In the medals for the Indians the bust
							is in the modern dress. <persRef ref="freeman-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman</persRef> came with the
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> on a
							visit. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard mentioned that a vessel
							was now ready to be stationed upon our North-eastern Coast for the
							protection of our fishermen, and he was about preparing Instructions for
								<persRef ref="parker-foxhall">Captain Parker</persRef> who would
							command her; and he enquired where she ought to be directed to cruize— I
							referred him to the documents communicated to the House of
							Representatives, relating to the complaints of the fishermen last
							Summer, and to the complaints against them— I read to him the Article
							concerning the fisheries in the Convention with Great-Britain of 1818—a
							copy of which Article I advised him to give with his Instructions to
							Captain Parker— And I recommended that he should direct Captain Parker
							first to go to Eastport, and advise with the Collector there to cruize
							along the coast of Nova-Scotia, in the gulph of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Lawrence, and along the Coast of Labrador; making Eastport
							his point of departure, until the month of October. I gave him also a
							Copy of my pamphlet on the fisheries and the Mississippi, where he
							expected to find information which might be useful to him in drawing <pb
								type="ms" n="170"/>drawing up his instructions. <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> came very warm upon having heard that <persRef
								ref="porter-david">Captain Porter</persRef> had been informed that
							he would be arrested and tried by a Court-martial, and told me the
							Commodore wished to know whether it would be only upon the affair at
							Foxardo, or whether other charges were to be included. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson began by appealing very solemnly
							to the old, and uninterrupted confidential relations between himself and
							me— Then entered upon a review of the transactions of Porter during the
							last two years, with strong prepossessions against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard the Secretary of the Navy— He
							talked of the extraordinary excitement which the arrest and trial of an
							Officer so high in the public confidence, would produced and enquired if
							I had come to the determination to try him, after a full examination by
							my self of the whole Correspondence— Intimating a suspicion, that I had
							been influenced to the measure by Southard— I recognized fully the old
							confidence to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson appealed,
							and told him, first that he was mistaken in supposing M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard was hostile to Captain Porter,
							and that it was a great mistake of Captain Porter himself, which was
							leading him into trouble— Secondly that the determination to try Porter
							had been taken against the advice and opinion of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard; but with the unanimous advice and opinion of the
							other members of the Administration— He said Porter complained that the
							Court of Inquiry had rejected some papers which Porter had sent to the
							Secretary of the Navy as Evidence that Foxardo was a piratical place,
							and asked if I had seen them. I said I had seen them all—that they were
							of no consequence, and the Court had also rejected evidence furnished by
							the <persRef ref="salmon-hilario">Spanish Charge d’Affaires</persRef>,
							and sent to them by the Secretary of the Navy. That the Report of the
							Court of Inquiry, upon that part of the subject was entirely honourable
							to Captain Porter; and the charges against him on the Court-martial
							would be confined to the affair at Foxardo, unless I should direct an
							additional charge for his insubordinate and insulting Letters to the
							department, to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef> and to me. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Anderson expressed a vehement aversion to this, though he
							admitted the Letters were very exceptionable and said he had told Porter
							so. I read to him Porter’s Letter to me of 11. April, which I told him
							had affected me the more because it was written and sent and received by
							me on a Sunday— He acknowledged it was very wrong but still urged, and
							rather intreated that it should not be produced to a Court Martial— I
							said it probably would not— I had never shewn it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard— If I had, I knew not what he
							would have done, but if I were in his situation, and the President
							should receive and shew me such a Letter, I should see in it a necessary
							alternative; either that the writer of the Letter should be tried by a
							Court martial for writing and sending the Letter, or that I should
							resign my Office— It was but the other day that <persRef
								ref="vandyke-alexander">Midshipman Van Dyke</persRef> was tried by a
							Court Martial, and sentenced to be dismissed from the Navy, for <hi
								rend="italic">writing</hi> a Letter to the Secretary of the Navy,
							barely asking to be removed from the ship— It was not even proved that
							he had sent the Letter— Justice was the same for a Midshipman and an
							Admiral—and if the highest Officer in the Navy could insult with
							impunity the Head of the Department under which he served, there could
							be no justice in punishing a Midshipman for insulting <hi rend="italic"
								>him.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson agreed that I had
							been kind and indulgent to Porter, in withholding <hi rend="italic"
								>this</hi><pb type="ms" n="171"/>this Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard; but as to the affair of Foxardo,
							said it was a subject of international Law, upon which a Court-martial
							could not decide—unless upon a charge of having violated Instructions— I
							said I did not see why a Court Martial should be incompetent to decide
							upon a Violation of the Law of Nations, or of the Constitution of the
							United States, as upon a breach of the Articles of War; but if they were
							not competent they would say so, and then the duty of the Executive
							would be to perform his duty upon their decision— I disapproved the
							invasion of the Island of Porto-Rico; but from respect for his character
							and services, would not express that disapprobation in an arbitrary
							manner— I would first give him the benefit of a trial by his Peers, and
							of whatever they should decide in his favour he should have the
							advantage. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Anderson finally agreed that
							this was all right, and that I could not with propriety do otherwise;
							but asked how if Porter should follow the example of <persRef
								ref="macdonough-thomas">M’Donough</persRef>, and acknowledge that he
							had been wrong— I said that would change the whole aspect of the affair.
							In that view of things there might be room for considerations of
							indulgence—but Porter himself had shut the door upon them; by the tone
							of defiance and insult which he had hitherto maintained— Claiming honour
							and reward for that which demanded reprobation. The change must come
							from himself and with reference to his own interest. He M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson might in his discretion make such
							use of the closely confidential remarks I had now made to him as he
							should think proper; and as the Articles of Charge have not yet been
							prepared, I should not decide upon them till I should hear again from
							him— <persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cutts</persRef> came and introduced <persRef ref="thomas-unknown4"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas</persRef> of New-York,
							formerly of Massachusetts a visitor of from curiousity. <persRef
								ref="carbery-thomas">Captain Carbery</persRef> came to renew his
							application for an appointment, of which he represents himself to be
							distressingly in want— <persRef ref="weightman-roger"
								>Weightman</persRef> the Major, brought a Resolution of the
							Corporation, for raising by Lottery the sum of ten thousand Dollars,
							which I approved— The Commissioner of the Public buildings <persRef
								ref="elgar-joseph">Elgar</persRef> brought a new design for the
							Tympanum of the Capitol, drawn by <persRef ref="persico-luigi"

								<persRef ref="bomford-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Bomford</persRef> and <persRef ref="king-charles2">C. B.
								King</persRef> were here— I made some remarks upon this design, and
							he proposed to me to ask M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Persico, and
								<persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bulfinch</persRef> to call upon me to-morrow to converse with me on

						<p><persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">Bulfinch</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef> came at one O’Clock, and we
							discussed the new design; which was a personification of U.S. standing
							on a throne leaning upon the Roman fasces surmounted with the cap of
							Liberty, with Justice at her right hand, blindfolded, holding the
							suspended balance, and in the other hand an open scroll; and <persRef
								ref="hercules">Hercules</persRef> at her left seated on a corner of
							the throne, embracing the fasces, and emblematical of strength— To which
							were added separately drawn, and to fill up the space, Plenty seated
							with her Cornucopia, in one Corner, and Peace, a flying Angel extending
							a garland of Victory towards America with one hand and bearing a palm in
							the other. These two last figures I advised should <hi rend="italic"
								>be</hi><pb type="ms" n="172"/>be discarded—as well as the Roman
							Fasces, and the Cap of Liberty. The Hercules had also too much of the
							heathen mythology for my taste, and I proposed to substitute in his
							place a figure of Hope with an Anchor, a scriptural Image; indicating
							that this Hope, relies upon a Supreme disposer of Events— Which Hope, we
							have as an Anchor to the Soul, sure and stedfast— Instead of the fasces,
							I proposed a Pedestal with 4. July 1776 inscribed in its base, and 4.
							March 1789. on its upper Cornice. The whole design then would represent
							the American Union, founded on the Declaration of Independence, and
							consummated by the organization of the general Government under the
							federal Constitution, supported by Justice on the past, and relying upon
							Hope in Providence for the future. Persico objected that all the figures
							of the group would be females, and thought there should be at least one
							male figure. However he is to make a drawing of the Design and we shall
							examine it— <persRef ref="hooe-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hooe</persRef> of Alexandria came with a Petition for the pardon of
								<persRef ref="ware-betsey">Betsey Ware</persRef>, a coloured woman
							at Alexandria convicted of Burglary, and sentenced to death— The day
							appointed for her Execution is next Friday— I signed her pardon. She has
							also been convicted upon two or three Indictments for Larceny; the
							punishment for which is not capital— <persRef ref="ironside-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ironside</persRef> brought me the
							Proclamation of the Treaty with the Republic of Columbia, which I
							signed. <persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barbour</persRef> the Secretary of War, came with a Letter from
								<persRef ref="crowell-john">J. Crowell</persRef> the Agent with the
							Creek Indians; who is convinced that they will commit no act of violence
							or hostility unless instigated by further violence from <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Governor Troup</persRef> of Georgia. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour had received also another
							insulting Letter from Governor Troup which he thought it best to leave
							unanswered— I mentioned the new demand of <persRef ref="lomax-mann"
								>Major Lomax</persRef> that his claim to rank over <persRef
								ref="burd-john">Major Bird</persRef>, should be submitted to a board
							of Officers. Barbour advised to postpone the subject, until there shall
							be a full cabinet: and that then the other questions of the same kind
							left unsettled by the late Administration should be considered
							altogether. He spoke also of the claim for allowance of double rations,
							by <persRef ref="parker-daniel">D. Parker</persRef>; and the
							inconsistencies of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun’s</persRef> partialities and animosities against
							Parker; who he said had at least for the present abandoned this claim— I
							mentioned the irregularities in the execution of the Missouri Lead-mine
							leases and Bonds, which I thought should be corrected. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour goes to-morrow, to attend the
							Cattle Show near Baltimore; and thence to the Examination at West-Point,

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date. -->
						<p><date>Day.</date> Entering upon a new course of life, momentous not alone
							to myself, and specially responsible to God—to my Country, and to
							mankind, I have intensely felt my obligation to devote all my time and
							all my faculties to the discharge of my duties. To this end I have
							endeavoured to make a regular distribution of time which I have been
							however enabled but very imperfectly to execute— The ordinary day during
							the Month has been generally like that of April. My rising hour between
							four and six— But the bathing Season has come, and the heat of Summer;
							which renders it necessary to transpose my hours of exercise from the
							afternoon before dinner, to the morning before breakfast— This I have
							done for the last three days; taking two Morning hours for bathing and
							swimming in the Potowmack. My Diary has been more steadily kept up; yet
							not without negligent interruption— Incessant and distractingly various
							occupation continues to fill the space between Breakfast and dinner; and
							most of the Evenings are wasted in idleness, or at the billiard table, a
							resource both for exercise and amusement— I now generally retire to bed
							between nine and ten.</p>
