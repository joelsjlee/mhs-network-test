						<p>I advised <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> to

						<p>I read the first draft of the Message which took me about an hour and a
							half— There was some conversation as to the mode of discussing its
							topics. It was observed that Remarks of a general nature might occupy
							this day; and at the next Meeting, Friday at one O’Clock, it should be
							read again by Paragraphs. Governor Barbour objected to the whole
							concluding recommendations on the subject of internal improvements—and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thought there was much force in
							his remarks. The consideration of this however was postponed—but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay objected to a sentiment expressed
							relating to the claims of our Citizens upon France, and several other
							European Governments— After stating that the justice of the claims on
							France was undenied and undeniable; and that reparation for them had
							long been sought in vain, I stated that the United States would be fully
							justified in resorting to their own force for redress— But that force
							instead of obtaining redress was more adapted to aggravate than to
							repair such wrongs: and that our policy would be to persevere in urging
							the claims until Justice for them shall be obtained, but explicitly
							without resorting to force, or committing any hostility. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay insisted that this would be
							equivalent to a total abandonment of the claims— He was for recommending
							the issuing of Letters of Marque and Reprizals; which he insisted would
							not be war; or at least for intimating to Congress that that measure
							would hereafter be advisable, if France should continue to disregard the
							Representations of our Minister— To this measure or any thing like it
							Governor Barbour was quite averse— He thought Reprizals, even special
							Reprizals would be War, or certainly lead to War— That these claims,
							though considerable, were of long standing— That nobody in this Country
							had the remotest idea of going to War for them— That excepting among the
							claimants there was not much excitement concerning them; and that to
							talk of going to War for them would excite more surprize than
							approbation— He said that he as chairman <pb type="ms" n="14"/>chairman
							of the committee of Foreign Relations of the Senate had proposed in a
							Report to use expressions far short of this which were yet deemed too
							strong—and he deeply deprecated War— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							proposed three alternatives— To recommend reprizals immediately. To
							recommend them prospectively and contingent— And to say nothing about
							them— He would like the first the best—but either better than my
							abandonment of the claims, as he thought it would be generally
							considered to be. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush inclined to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard expressed no opinion at the Meeting; but after it, on my
							enquiry said he thought the recommendation against the use of force
							should be omitted—</p>

							The suggestion that we ought in no event to resort to force, to obtain

						<p>This was the deputation of Creek Indians who now came merely to take

							After shaking hands with them all; and when they were all seated; I told
							the Interpreter to say to them, that I was glad to see them; and happy
							to meet them all in good health; safe here after their long Journey— I
							had heard some of them had met with an accident on the way, and had
							taken hurt. I hoped not seriously. The interpreter explained this—and
							Opothle Yoholo the Speaker of the Nation, and first Chief on the
							deputation answered for them all— Said some of them had met an accident
							by the oversetting in the Stage, and had been hurt— But they were now
							well; and another part of the deputation were coming on— I said I was
							glad they were coming, hoped they would arrive soon, and that we should
							all meet in friendship.— He said they were glad to be here, as things
							had happened which had frightened them, and they hoped that now all
							would be well again— I said that was my desire— I had also heard of
							things that displeased me much; but I expected that they would arrange
							matters with the Secretary of War to the satisfaction of all. <pb
								type="ms" n="16"/>After refreshments had been carried round, the
							Secretary of War, enquired if there was any thing further that they
							wished to say— Opothle-Yoholo answered not for the present nor until the
							other part of the deputation shall arrive— They all shook hands with me
							again and took leave— They are almost all good-looking men— Dressing,
							not as the Cherokees entirely in our Costume; but somewhat
							fantastically— But their countenances, and especially that of
							Opothle-Yoholo was remarkable by a dark and settled gloom.</p>

						<p>The adjourned Cabinet Meeting followed immediately after the departure of
							the Indians— The first question was upon the whole of the concluding
							division of the Message, as projected— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> desired that the whole
							of it might be read again— I read it— Governor Barbour then withdrew his
							objection to it as a whole; but he and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay persisted in objections to many detached parts of it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay wished to have the recommendations of
							a National University; and of a new Executive Department struck
							out—almost everything relating to the Patent Office; and the final
							enumeration of all the purposes of internal improvements for which I
							asserted that Congress have powers— I agreed to give up, all that
							relates to the Patent-Office; and upon discussion, most of the
							particular objections were abandoned— The University M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said was entirely hopeless—and he
							thought there was something in the Constitutional objection to it— For
							it did not rest upon the same principle as internal improvements or the
							bank— I concurred entirely in the opinion, that no projects absolutely
							impracticable ought to be recommended—but I would look to a
							practicability of a longer range than a single Session of Congress—
								<persRef ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef> had
							recommended the Military Academy more than ten years before it was
							obtained— The plant may come late though the seed should be sown early—
							And I had not recommended a University— I had only referred to
							Washington’s recommendations, and observed they had not been carried
							into effect— The new Executive Department, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay said was of most urgent necessity. No one knew it
							better than he—yet he was sure there would not be twenty votes for it in
							the house— He did not believe there would be five— I said it was not
							very material to me whether I should present these views in the first or
							the last Message I should send to Congress— They would not suit any
							other—but in one of them I should feel it my indispensable duty to
							suggest them— There is this consideration for offering them now— That of
							the future I can never be sure— I may be not destined to send another
							Message— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush very earnestly urged the
							communication at this time— And Clay said he was anxious that almost the
							whole of what I had written should go— He himself was fully convinced
							that Congress had the powers—but he had no doubt that if they did not
							exercise them, there would be a dissolution of the Union, by the
							Mountains. The result of all was that Barbour very reluctantly withdrew
							his objection to the whole topic— That Clay approved of the general
							principles, but scrupled great part of the details— Rush approved nearly
							the whole; and Southard said scarcely anything— Thus situated the
							perilous experiment must be made— Let me make it with full deliberation
							and be prepared for the consequences— Governor Barbour read an answer
							which he had written to the enquiries of <persRef ref="king-charles"
								>Charles King</persRef>— It denies his having charged <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef>
							with having been concerned in the year 1786. in a project to send for
								<persRef ref="henry2">Prince Henry</persRef> to come over to be the
							King of this Union, and gives some account of the debate in Senate, in
							which this project was alluded to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							thought the denial that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour had
							intended in the debate to implicate King was not sufficiently explicit,
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour thought he could not make it
							more so— I had also <pb type="ms" n="17"/>received a Letter from Charles
							King on this subject. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that he
							wrote the Speech of Vice-President <persRef ref="clinton-george">George
								Clinton</persRef>, which he delivered in Senate, upon giving the
							casting vote against the renewal of the old Bank of the United States—
							He said it was perhaps the thing that had gained the old man more credit
							than any thing else that he ever did. He had written it; but under M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton’s dictation; and he never should
							think of claiming it as his composition— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard had left with me papers concerning two refractory Midshipmen.
								<persRef ref="vandyke-alexander">Van Dyke</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mooers-john">Mooers</persRef>; both of whom I advised him to
							order immediately to Sea— He mentioned to me the Death of <persRef
								ref="macdonough-thomas">Captain M’Donough</persRef>, and enquired
							whether any honorary notice of him should be issued from the Navy
							Department— There had been for <persRef ref="perry-oliver"
								>Perry</persRef> and <persRef ref="decatur-stephen"
								>Decatur</persRef>; but had been omitted in other cases of Officers
							of the same rank— I thought the compliment due not to rank but to
							individual character; and wished it might issue for M’Donough.</p>
