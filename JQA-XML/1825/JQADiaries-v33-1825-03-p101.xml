						<p><date>3. VI.</date> This day closed the Second Session of the Eighteenth

							own Service of eight years in the Office of Secretary; the bustle of
							preparation for the new Condition upon which I was to enter— The

							curiosity— The anxieties of an approximating crisis; and above all the
							failing and threatening state of my wife’s health. The stream of

						<p>Most of the renominations had been already made by M<hi

							principle of change, or rotation in office, at the expiration of these
							Commissions. Which would make the Government a perpetual and
							unintermitting scramble for Office.— A more pernicious expedient could
							scarcely have been devised. The Office of Marshal, for the District of

							re-nominated by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— There was no

							of Collector at Providence, if appointed to it, in the place of <persRef
								ref="coles-thomas">T. Coles</persRef> whose Commission is expiring.
							He intimated that Coles was personally incompetent, but that no one
							would take the responsibility of complaining against him. Great interest
							was made against the reappointment of <persRef ref="mclane-allen">Allen
								M’Lane</persRef>, Collector at Wilmington, Delaware; and two persons
							were strongly recommended for his place; there were complaints against
							him, but of a character altogether indefinite. I determined to
							renominate every person, against whom there was no complaint which would
							have warranted his removal; and renominated every person nominated by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, and upon whose nomination the
							Senate had declined acting. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe,
							always acted on this principle of renomination— I did not this day send
							nominations for the Missions to Great-Britain, or to Mexico; nor of a
							Chargé d’Affaires to Sweden— The first I leave open some days, at the
							earnest request of some of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton’s</persRef> friends, for the
							possible chance that he may reconsider his determination. I wait for the
							decision of the Senate upon the nomination of C. Hughes, to vacate his
							place at Stockholm; and I concluded after much deliberation to offer to
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Joel Roberts Poinsett</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, the nomination of Minister to Mexico— I accordingly sent
							for him this morning and made him the offer— It had been made to him by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, early during the late Session
							of Congress, and declined upon Considerations, most of which do not now
							apply. He made however now two objections—One that upon his vacating his
							Seat in Congress, a very troublesome and unprincipled man, would
							probably be chosen in his place— The other that he had recommended to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe another person for the mission
							to Mexico— I knew who this person was— It was <persRef
								ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef> a Senator from
							Missouri, who from being a furious personal and political enemy of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson</persRef>, <hi rend="italic">became </hi><pb type="ms"
								n="107"/>became about the time of this recommendation, a partizan
							not less ardent in his favour— I now told Poinsett, that with regard to
							the consequences of his vacating his Seat in Congress, I could form no
							judgment, having little knowledge of the state of Politics at
							Charleston, and no acquaintance with the person who might be his
							Successor; but that if he should decline, I should not offer the mission
							to the person whom he had recommended to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe— He asked time for consideration; and promised to give me a
							definitive answer to-morrow— Among the numerous visitors of this day to
							take leave was <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>, who
							recommended <persRef ref="king-charles">Charles King</persRef> for the
							appointment of Collector at New-York in the Event of a vacancy— Blunt
							asked nothing for himself, but suggested as expedient policy the
							employment of young men— In my solitary walk before dinner, I met
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> walking in front of his own door; and told him I
							had offered the Mexican Mission to Poinsett— After dinner I went to the
							Capitol to attend the second Lecture of <persRef ref="owen-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen</persRef> of Lanark, but it was
							postponed till Monday Evening— After returning home I called upon
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus
								King</persRef> at his lodgings at Williamson’s— His term of Service
							as a Senator expired on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and he had
							declined a re-election, intending to retire from the Public Service— He
							leaves the City to-morrow Morning to return home— I told him of the
							nominations I had made; and that I had omitted that for the mission to
							England, at the earnest desire of some of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clinton’s friends— But I said the reason assigned by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton for declining the appointment was
							in my opinion one which he could not <hi rend="italic">reconsider</hi>,
							nor had I any expectation that he would— I therefore asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King, if <hi rend="italic">he </hi>would
							accept that mission? His first and immediate impulse was to decline it—
							He said that his determination to retire from the public service had
							been made up, and that this proposal was utterly unexpected to him. Of
							this I was aware; but I urged upon him a variety of considerations to
							induce his acceptance of it— The general importance of the Mission, in
							my estimation not inferior to that of any one of the Departments— The
							special importance to the States of New-York and of Maine; of certain
							interests in Negotiation with Great-Britain— His peculiar qualifications
							for the conduct of those Negotiations. His duty to the Country; not to
							refuse Services so important, and for which perhaps no other individual
							would be so well suited— The Satisfaction which the appointment and his
							acceptance of it would give to the federal party throughout the Union—
							The tendency that it would have to heal our divisions, and harmonize the
							feelings of the People— The opportunity which <hi rend="italic">he
								</hi><pb type="ms" n="108"/>he would afford me of promoting this
							reconciliation of parties, and at the same time of proving by my example
							the sincerity of the Sentiments avowed in my address— I dwelt with
							earnestness upon all these motives, and apparently not without effect—
							He admitted the force of them and finally promised fully to consider of
							the proposal before giving me a definitive answer. On returning home, I
							found <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">B. W.
								Crowninshield</persRef> who came to take leave— Going to-morrow.
							Long conversation with him.</p>

								Macon</persRef> came as a Committee to inform me that if I had no
							further Communication to make to them they were ready to adjourn— To
							which I answered that I had no further Communication to make— On
							receiving the report of their Committee they immediately adjourned
							without day. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Macon said he must be at the
							Steam boat for Norfolk at 4 O’Clock— My visitors of this day were

							and for the purpose of Congratulation. They had requested the

							made me a short complementary speech which I answered with equal
							brevity— The French Minister made none. General Izzard was going to
							Philadelphia— He seemed <hi rend="italic">not</hi><pb type="ms" n="113"
							/>not satisfied with the appointment of Governor of Arkansas, which he
							observed he had neither desired nor expected. He would accept it
							however, in the hope that he would be remembered hereafter, for a
							mission abroad— This was what his friends had recommended him for, and
							to which he thought himself entitled, for his own services, and those of
								<persRef ref="izard-ralph">his father</persRef> during the
							revolutionary War and since— The Comptroller, Anderson observed that
							when he took the objection to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard’s
