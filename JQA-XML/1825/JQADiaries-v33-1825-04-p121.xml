							at one time the representative of my Country at the Court of
							Great-Britain, I had been enabled fully to appretiate the friendly
							dispositions of the British Government; and it mentioned in terms of

							It was merely an assurance, that his personal wishes had been altogether
							favourable to my Election in preference to all the other
							Candidates—particularly as he had supposed, that if the Election had
							fallen upon another, I should not have continued in the Department of
							State. I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington, to assure his
							Government that I had received with sensibility this Communication— That
							I considered it among the most fortunate circumstances of my Life, that
							I had been instrumental, first in restoring Peace between our two
							Countries; then in adjusting important concerns of Navigation and
							Commerce between them by Conventions, which had promoted harmony and
							friendly intercourse, afterwards by my residence for two years as the
							Minister of the United States in England, and finally for eight years as
							a member of the late Administration— That it had been one of my
							Predecessors most ardent wishes to cultivate a good understanding with
							Great-Britain— That concurring with that desire, it would still
							influence my conduct. The policy of the Government would remain the
							same— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan when he should arrive would
							be very cordially received. The character given of him by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning would ensure him a welcome, and I
							hoped he would have every reason to be satisfied with his residence
							here. And I took this occasion to say that whatever his own destination
							was to be, no person could by his conduct make himself more acceptable
							than he had done— If he was to remain here, we should be gratified; if
							he should leave us we should regret the loss of him, and hope that he
							would go only in the line of promotion— He was much pleased with this
							testimonial, and said he had never been any where more kindly treated
							than here. I desired him to thank M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							for the friendly expressions of his private Letter; and to say that I
							had before been indebted to him for obliging attentions, which were well
							remembered, although the acknowledgment of them had been neglected by
							me— I alluded to his having sent to me through <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> a
							copy of one of his Speeches— I added that as a manifestation of my
							earnest wish for harmony with Great Britain, I had selected for the
							Mission to that Court, as he was no doubt aware <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">a person</persRef>, who had already been many years
							in England in that capacity, and who had been always advantageously
							known, and much esteemed <pb type="ms" n="135"/>esteemed there— Finally
							I desired him to express the great satisfaction which I had felt, and
							with the concurring sentiment of this Nation, at the determined stand
							taken, recently by his Government in recognizing the Southern Nations of
							this Hemisphere. It was delightful to find Great-Britain openly and
							explicitly pledged in support of liberal principles of National
							Independence, and the more so, as we were well informed the taking of
							that step had produced a crisis, requiring at once all the firmness and
							Prudence, which any Statesman could display— He said he would not fail
							in the proper manner to communicate to his Government these remarks—

							the army— In the case of Lomax and Burd, the rank having been settled
							during the suspension of the rules of promotion upon the reduction of
							the army in 1821. The General thinks it ought not to be unsettled. The
							claim of Baker he thinks just. In the army Register of this year that
							Officer was displaced by an arbitrary act, and the date of his
							Commission set down as about two years later than it had really been
							issued— I told General Brown I should certainly correct this procedure;
							and not permit the repetition of it. Brown spoke in high terms of
								<persRef ref="eustis-abraham">Abraham Eustis</persRef>, and said he
							thought he should be brevetted.</p>

							enclosed copy of an answer received by him from <persRef
								ref="canning-george">G. Canning</persRef>, which has put him out of
							his wits with exultation— His Letter is a Dissertation to prove that the
							whole Science of Diplomacy consists in giving Dinners—and Smith thinks
							that our Diplomatic appointments have not strengthened the
							Administration— Clay wishes to hasten his return to Kentucky; and has
							had pressing invitations to receive Public Dinners on the road— I
							advised him not to decline them— He spoke with great bitterness of the
							appointment by <persRef ref="mclean-john2">M’Lean</persRef> the

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Since my removal to the
							Presidential Mansion, I rise about five— Read two Chapters of <persRef
								ref="scott-thomas">Scott</persRef>’s Bible and Commentary, and the
							corresponding commentary of <persRef ref="hewlett-john"
								>Hewlett</persRef>— Then the morning Newspapers, and public papers
							from the several Departments— Write seldom, and not enough— Breakfast;
							an hour from nine to ten— Then have a succession of visitors, upon
							business, in search of place, Solicitors for donations; or for mere
							curiosity, from eleven, till between 4 and 5. O’Clock— The Heads of
							Departments of course occupy much of this time. Between four and six I
							take a walk of three or four Miles. Dine from about half past five till
							seven, and from dark till about eleven, I generally pass the Evening in
							my chamber, signing Land-grants or Blank Patents; in the interval of
							which for the last ten days, I have brought up three Months of Arrears
							in my Diary-Index— About eleven I retire to bed. My Evenings are not so
							free from interruption as I had hoped and expected they would be; nor
							have I the prospect of methodising the distribution of my time to my own
							Satisfaction— There is much to correct, and reform, and the precept of
							Diligence is always timely—</p>
