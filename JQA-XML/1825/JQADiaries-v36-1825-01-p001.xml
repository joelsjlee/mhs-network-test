							for a subscription to a methodist episcopalian church at Bridgport
							Connecticut. <persRef ref="forrest-richard">Richard Forrest</persRef>,
							brought me, to authenticate an Act of Congress, granting to <persRef
								ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef> a sum of two hundred
							thousand Dollars and a township of Land. a joint Committee from the two
							Houses were appointed to communicate to him this Act, and ask his
							acceptance of the grant; and they presented him the authenticated copy
							of the Act, this morning— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Navy called to make some enquiries on business, and told me he
							should not attend at the dinner. He has recently lost a <persRef
								ref="southard-john">child</persRef>. At Noon I went with my Sons
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> drawing room, which was

							did not go, nor <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth
							Adams</persRef>, who was also unwell: nor <persRef ref="hellen-mary"
								>Mary Hellen</persRef>— At the Drawing room I presented to the

									>r</hi> Rebello</persRef>, the Brazilian Chargé d’Affaires,
								<persRef ref="riveria-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							introduced to me, at the Department of State. <persRef
								ref="letcher-robert">Robert P. Letcher</persRef> a member of the
							House of Representatives from Kentucky, asked me if I should go to the
							Department after the Drawing-room. I said I should. He said he would
							call there, and did. He told me he had received from home many Letters
							lately and several this morning— That the members of the Kentucky
							Legislature would in their private capacities and not by Legislative
							Act, recommend to the members from the State in the House, to vote for
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> as
							President, and popular meetings to pass Similar Resolutions had been and
							would be got up— But I might rely upon it they would have no effect. The
							vote of Kentucky in the House was fixed and unalterable. He spoke of the
							difference between <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> and me, as giving concern to some of the
							members of the delegation, and intimated a wish that I should have some
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, upon the subject.
							I told him I would very readily, and whenever it might suit the
							convenience of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay. I merely read the
							despatches and Letters that came by the mail and signed a few official
							papers at the Office. <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"

							I attended the dinner given by the members of both Houses of <pb
								type="ms" n="2"/>Congress to General La Fayette, at <persRef
								ref="williamson-basil">Williamson’s</persRef> Hotel— It was attended
							also by the President. About 150 members of the two houses were present;
							and about thirty Officers of the Government Civil and Military. There
							were sixteen regular toasts; after which the President; General La
							Fayette, and most of the invited guests retired to the rooms of <persRef
								ref="hayne-robert">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hayne</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="gardner-unknown4">Miss Gardner</persRef>. I came home about 9.
							in the Evening, and our family party soon after retired. A Storm of
							rain, afterwards turning to Snow, continued through the day. The
							President’s Administration was toasted, to which he answered by a short
							address of thanks— General La Fayette answered also very briefly the
							toast to himself— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay made a speech
							about <persRef ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> and the cause of
							South-America, and seemed very desirous of eliciting speeches from me
							and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>— He told me that he should be glad to have with me
							soon, some confidential conversation upon public affairs; I said I
							should be happy to have it whenever it might suit his convenience. At
							the beginning of this year,there is in my prospects and anticipations a
							solemnity, and moment, never before experienced; and to which unaided
							nature is inadequate.</p>

							generally more correct than those of most others who converse with me—
								<persRef ref="thornton-william">Doctor Thornton</persRef> was here

							of accusatory matter against <persRef ref="stewart-charles"
								>Stewart</persRef> late Commander of the Squadron and against
								<persRef ref="prevost-john">J. B. Prevost</persRef>— Stewart is

							cannot defend himself. Is it proper <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to
							communicate the Correspondence to Congress—and excite public prejudice
							against the one or the other—perhaps both— The unanimous opinion was
							that it is not. As the resolution was offered by <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">S. D. Ingham</persRef>, a friend of Stewart’s it
							was suggested that perhaps it had been at his own desire— But it was
							thought that made no difference— Prevost’s Letter of June last to me was
							read; which he concludes with announcing his determination to retire, as
							soon as a Successor should be sent out to him— I was directed to write
							to him, giving him the President’s leave to return to the United States;
							and it was deemed advisable that there should be an investigation of his
							conduct. I was requested also to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ingham, and ascertain from him the object of his Call— The President

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason</persRef>, formerly of

							hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”— This discourse was not
							uneloquent, but the learning and morality, and instructiveness of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little’s Sermon was more satisfactory to
							me— In the interval between the two Services I visited <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tracy-albert">A. H. Tracy</persRef>. They are speculating upon
							the approaching event still without conclusive materials for judgment. I

								<pb type="ms" n="7"/>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay came at 6.
							and spent the Evening with me, in a long Conversation explanatory of the
							past, and prospective of the future— He said that the time was drawing
							near, when the choice must be made in the House of Representatives, of a
							President, from the three Candidates presented by the electoral College.
							That he had been much urged and solicited with regard to the part in
							that transaction that he should take, and had not been five minutes
							landed at his lodgings, before he had been applied to, by a friend of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef>, in a manner so gross that it had
							disgusted him— That some of my friends also, disclaiming indeed to have
							any authority from me, had repeatedly applied to him directly or
							indirectly, urging considerations personal to himself as motives to his
							course— He had thought it best to reserve some time his determination to
							himself. First, to give a decent time for his own funeral solemnities as
							a Candidate; and secondly to prepare and predispose all his friends to a
							state of neutrality between the three Candidates who would be before the
							House, so that they might be free ultimately to take that course which
							might be most conducive to the Public Interest— The time had now come,
							at which he might be explicit in his communication with me, and he had
							for that purpose asked this confidential interview— He wished me as far
							as I might think proper to satisfy him with regard to some principles of
							great public importance, but without any personal considerations for
							himself— In the question to come before the House, between <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and myself, he had no hesitation
							in saying that his preference would be for me. </p>
