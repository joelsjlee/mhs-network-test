							adjournment to Monday the last day of this month; upon which some debate
							was had; and the subject subsided, untill next Monday.— There was little
							business to do and the adjournment took place early— Sitting by the

								ref="giles-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="smith-israel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Israel
								Smith</persRef>, on the subject of Impeachments— During which
								<persRef ref="randolph-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> John
								Randolph</persRef> came in and took part in the discussion— Giles
							laboured with excessive earnestness to convince Smith of certain
							principles, upon which not only <persRef ref="chase-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chase</persRef>, but all the other
							Judges of the Supreme Court, excepting the one last appointed must be
							impeached and removed. He treated with the utmost contempt the idea of
							an <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> Judiciary— Said there was not a
							word about such an Independence in the Constitution, and that their
							pretensions to it were nothing more nor less than an attempt to
							establish an Aristocratic despotism in themselves.— The power of
							Impeachment, was given without limitation to the House of
							Representatives; the power of trying Impeachments was given equally
							without limitation to the Senate; and if the Judges of the Supreme Court
							should dare, <hi rend="small-caps">as they had done</hi>, to declare an
							Act of Congress, unconstitutional; or to send a Mandamus to the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, <hi
								rend="small-caps">as they had done</hi>, it was the undoubted right
							of the House of Representatives to impeach them and of the Senate to
							remove them, for giving such opinions, however honest or sincere they
							may have been in entertaining them— Impeachment, was not a criminal
							prosecution; it was no prosecution at all— The Senate sitting for the
							trial of Impeachments was not a Court, and ought to discard and reject
							all process of analogy to a Court of Justice. A trial and removal of a
							Judge upon Impeachment, need not imply any criminality or corruption in
							him— Congress had no power over the person, but only over the Office—
							And a removal by Impeachment, was nothing more than a declaration by
							Congress to this effect— You hold dangerous opinions, and if you are
							suffered to carry them into effect you will work the destruction of the
							Nation— <hi rend="italic">We want your Offices</hi>; for the purpose of
							giving them to men who will fill them better.— In answer to all this,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith only contended that <hi
								rend="italic">honest error of opinion</hi>, could not as he
							conceived be a subject of impeachment— And in pursuit of this principle,
							he proved clearly enough the persecution and tyranny to which those of
							Giles and Randolph inevitably lead— It would, he said establish a <hi
								rend="italic">tyranny over opinions</hi>, and he traced all the
							arguments of Giles to their only possible issue of rank absurdity— In
							all this Conversation I opened my lips but once, in which I told Giles
							that I could not assent to his definition of the term Impeachment. It
							was easy to see that Giles was anxious about Smith’s vote on the
							impeachment of Judge Chase— His manner was dogmatical, and peremptory—
							Smith’s was not merely mild, and hesitating, but continually conceding
							too <pb n="117" type="ms"/>too much, and to use an expression of
								<persRef ref="burke-edmund">Burke</persRef>, “above all things
							afraid of being too much in the right.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Smith has so often express’d these opinions that the friends of Judge
							Chase flatter themselves he will vote for an acquittal on the trial— But
							though in this instance his opinions are undoubtedly correct, I have no
							confidence in his firmness— His opinions were correct on the impeachment
							of <persRef ref="pickering-john2">Judge Pickering</persRef>— But his
							vote abandoned them— Indeed Giles’s doctrines are very natural
							inferences from those upon which that case was decided, and I never can
							have any confidence in the resolute integrity of those, who shrunk from
							the convictions of their own Consciences at that Time. It is obvious
							that on Smith’s principles, Chase must be acquitted; for the Articles of
							Impeachment contain no charge, which indicates corruption, or turpitude—
							So that Smith and Giles were really trying the Judge over the fireside—
								<persRef ref="mathers-james">Old Mathers</persRef> the door-keeper
							saw this so plainly, that after they were gone he said to me “If all
							were of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles’s opinion, they never need
							trouble themselves to bring Judge Chase here.”— I perceive also that the
							Impeachment system is to be pursued, and the whole Bench of the Supreme
							Court to be swept away, because <hi rend="italic">their Offices are
								wanted</hi>— And in the present State of things I am convinced it is
							as easy for M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> John Randolph and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, to do this as to say it.— This
							evening part of the family went to <persRef ref="mason-john">M<hi

						<p><date>24. </date>The rules of proceedings in cases of Impeachments,
							reported by <persRef ref="giles-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Giles</persRef>, were again taken up this morning. <persRef
								ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> had made a motion last Thursday, for an Amendment,
							which Giles and several others had opposed— It was not then decided, the
								<persRef ref="burr-aaron">Vice-President</persRef> having stop’d
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley after he had spoken twice to
							his motion; and was rising to speak a third time— The rigorous rule of
							Senate, allows a member to speak only twice to the same motion; but it
							is not always insisted on— The Members express’d a desire to hear M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley, but he was piqued, at the check
							given him, and quitted the house— He has not been in since; being
							detained at his lodgings by a severe cold, as I am informed.— I
							therefore moved that the subject might be postponed untill he could
							attend— But M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, insisted upon taking
							it up now; and of course my motion to postpone was rejected— Giles then
							offered to postpone, or to put the previous question upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley’s Amendment; but this, the
							Vice-President declared to be not in order— The question on it was
							therefore immediately taken, and it was negatived— Among the rules
							reported, was the form of the Oath to be taken by the President and
							members, previous to the trial, and also the form of the Oath to be
							taken by witnesses— The rule directed that the Oath to be taken by the
							President, should be <hi rend="italic">administered by the
								Secretary</hi>— And this part of the Report was adopted, without any
							objection by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, or any other person—
							But the words <hi rend="italic">in open Court</hi>—and this <hi
								rend="italic">Court</hi>, were in the reported Rules, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles moved to <pb n="118" type="ms"/>to
							strike them out, on the ground that the Senate, sitting for the trial of
							an Impeachment, is not <hi rend="italic">a Court</hi>. His only reason
							for this is that the Constitution in giving them the power to try
							impeachments does not expressly style them a Court; and he is for
							avoiding all <hi rend="italic">constructions</hi> of the Constitution
							and adhering to the letter— His <hi rend="italic">motive</hi>, for this
							antipathy to the term <hi rend="italic">Court</hi>, is that the Senate
							in their proceedings on this and the future Impeachments which he
							meditates, may be absolved from all the rules and principles, which
							restrain and bind down <hi rend="italic">Courts of Justice</hi>, to the
								<hi rend="italic">practise</hi> of Justice.— He wants for his
							purpose Liberty, unbounded as the Sea, and to obtain it, his first
							expedient is to discard and reject the idea, that our proceedings ought
							as nearly as possible to conform to the proceedings of a Judicial Court—
							But it appears he was not aware, that his theory may be turned against
							himself, and stop us short in the progress of our Impeachment, for want
							of <hi rend="italic">authorities</hi> to proceed, instead of letting us
							loose from all the barriers that shelter Innocence, in the forms of
							judicial Courts— However it was vain to urge any objection against his
							motions to strike out the word Court, and it was in two instances struck
							out accordingly.— But the rule which reported the form of the Oath to be
							taken by witnesses, had not said by whom it should be administered—upon
							which I moved to insert the words “by the Secretary”— This immediately
							gave rise to a long debate— <persRef ref="jackson-james2">General
								Jackson</persRef>, at first opposed my motion, on the ground that
							the words were <hi rend="italic">unnecessary</hi>—as the Secretary would
							swear the witnesses <hi rend="italic">of course</hi>. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles took very different ground, and not
							only denied the Secretary’s power to administer the Oath of course, but
							the power of the Senate itself to authorize their Secretary to
							administer an Oath at-all— He therefore proposed the expedient of
							sending for a common Magistrate to come and administer all the Oaths—
							But it was soon discovered, that unless the Senate, sitting for the
							trial of Impeachments possess’d the powers incidental to judicial
							Courts; they had no more power to issue Writs, Summonses and Subpoena’s,
							than to administer Oaths; and also that all the proceedings last Winter
							against <persRef ref="pickering-john2">Judge Pickering</persRef> were
							unconstitutional, and he has not been legally removed— The longer the
							debate continued the deeper M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles and
							his party, got involved in difficulty— They could not vote with me
							against him; for that would have been treason to the party— They could
							not vote with him against me, without check-mating their own
							impeachment— Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Jackson, who at first had
							opposed my amendment, now came round and advocated it with his customary
							warmth; and finally proposed himself, a mere variation in its
							phraseology, to which I instantly consented, and it was carried by a
							large majority.— In this debate, the President suffered M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles to speak three times, without
							checking him, as he did M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley last
							Week— Indeed his partialities to Giles have been frequent and obvious
							this Session— His impartiality at the last Session was exemplary and
							without exception— But there is a key to every thing— The Vice-President
							is under an Indictment by a Grand-Jury for murder— And Giles drew up and
							circulated an address to the <persRef ref="bloomfield-joseph">Governor
								of New-Jersey</persRef>, requesting him to stay the prosecution.— I
							presented this day a bill in favour of Invalids of the Revolutionary
							War; which was read once, and pass’d to a second reading.— <persRef
								ref="white-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White</persRef>
							did not call up his motion for adjourning over the Week; and the Senate
							adjourned to Wednesday.— As the ground was covered with Snow, I rode to
							the Capitol on Horseback; and on my return home, about the middle of the
							avenue was thrown from my horse, with little hurt to myself— This is a
							second broad hint to me, not to ride this horse any more— I think I
							shall not call for the third— I saw <persRef ref="cranch-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cranch</persRef> this morning.— The
							Circuit Court for the District, this day commenced its Session— I pass’d
							the Evening in examining the Journals of the old Congress, respecting
							Half-pay, Commutation and Invalids.</p>

						<p><date>28. </date>The Senate this day met in their Committee-Room; owing
							to the arrangements making in the Hall— Several Bills at the second
							reading were Committed to select Committees of 3 and 5. Among the rest,
							the Bills for the Articles of War; and for regulating the clearance of
							armed merchant vessels— <persRef ref="mitchill-samuel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill</persRef> presented a
							memorial against this last from the chamber of Commerce at New-York,
							which he moved to have printed; but contrary to universal practice, this
							was refused; by a majority of one—13 and 12.— The Bill itself will pass
							by a very small majority.— After Senate adjourned, I met the Committee
							on the invalid Bill— We came to no decision— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>, and three of her
							Sisters called for me at the Capitol— I went with them into the lobby of
							the House of Representatives, where they made a very short stay— Came

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day—</hi></date> As the last Month.</p>
						<p>The year which this day expires, has been distinguished in the course of
							my life, by its barrenness of Events— During its first three, and last
							two months I was here attending my duty as a Senator of the United
							States— The Seven intervening months were past in travelling to and from
							Quincy, and in residence at <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> house there— The Six months spent at Quincy, were
							not idle— Indeed I have seldom in the whole course of my life been more
							busily engaged— I gave some attention to agricultural pursuits; but I
							soon found they lost their relish, and that they never would repay the
							labour they require. My studies were assiduous and seldom interrupted. I
							meant to give them such a direction, as should be useful in its
							tendency; yet on looking back, and comparing the time consumed with the
							knowledge acquired, I have no occasion to take pride in <hi
								rend="strikethrough">my</hi> the result of my application— I have
							been a severe Student, all the days of my life— But an immense
							proportion of the time I have dedicated to the search of knowledge, has
							been wasted upon subjects which can never be profitable to myself or
							useful to others.— Another source of useless toil, is the want of a
							method properly comprehensive and minute, in the pursuit of my
							enquiries— This method has been to me a desideratum for many years; I
							have found none in books; nor have I been able to contrive one for my
							self. From these two causes, I have derived so little use from my
							labours, that it has often brought me to the borders of discouragement,
							and I have been attempted to abandon my books altogether— This however
							is impossible—for the habit has so long been fixed in me, as to have
							become a passion, and when once severed from my books, I find little or
							nothing in life, to fill the vacancy of time— I must therefore continue
							to plod, and to lose my labour; contenting myself with the consolation,
							that even this drudgery of Science, contributes to Virtue, though it
							lead not to wealth or honour. In respect to my family, it has pleased
							Heaven, to extend peculiar favour to me during this year. <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">My Parents</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-john2;adams-george">children</persRef> have all been
							preserved to me, though my mother’s state of health has often occasioned
							me much anxiety.— My own Health has been indifferent, but not bad— My
							property has remained at a stand; and my political Prospects, have been
							daily declining.— On the whole I ought to conclude the year, with the
							sincerest Gratitude to Heaven, for the blessings with which I have been
							indulged.</p>
