							this afternoon, a few hours before we arrived; and one is to sail
							to-morrow, but stops at Newport, and will of course be detained there a

						<p><date>18. </date>At 5 this morning, we left Providence in the Stage,
							travelling a road over which I had never been before.— We breakfasted at
							Scituate, in Rhode-Island; and entering the State of Connecticut shortly
							after, dined at Norwich, and arrived just at dusk, at New-London— The
							distance from Providence is 56 miles— The roads rough, and rocky;
							indifferently kept up, though charged with turnpike tolls— Of the
							Passengers who came with me from Boston, one only came on beyond
							Providence, and terminated his journey at Norwich— Others took the
							vacant places, but I had only two fellow passengers on entering
							New-London, and they are to go no further— I put up with the Stage at
								<persRef ref="u">Frink’s</persRef>: the same house, at which we
							pass’d a day, when we came in here in the Providence Packet last year. I
							find myself again disappointed of a passage to New-York by water— There
							are four packets that ply regularly between this place and that— Two of
							them are at New-York, detained by the present winds, and the other two
							sailed last Night with a company of English and German Passengers, who
							were coming from London to New-York in an American vessel—the
								Iris—<persRef ref="u">Captain Skinner</persRef>; but landed at
							New-London in a Pilot-Boat, from fear of impressment, by one of the
							British frigates cruizing upon our Coast.— We had a bad day for
							travelling— Rain &amp; Storm all the Morning. but an excellent Wind for
							Water Passage to New-York.</p>

						<p><date>19. </date>I left New-London at 5 this morning, alone in the Stage—
							Cross’d Connecticut River at Saybrook, where I breakfasted— A very

							were soon after joined by a young Englishman, and two Germans, of the
							Company landed from the Ship Iris— In the course of the day, we pass’d
							by several others of them— We dined at Guilford, and arrived at
							New-Haven before Sun-set— I went immediately with the Passengers from
							England down to the wharf, to enquire again for a water-passage to
							New-York, but was again unsuccessful. There are twelve regular Packets,
							which sail between this and New-York— They depart every evening, each in
							its turn— But if either of them lose its turn, by not being here when
							the day comes, it must wait untill its turn comes round again— Such is
							the case with that which was to have sailed this Evening— It is still
							detained by head-winds at New-York— To-morrow Evening another will go;
							but as this would detain us here the whole day, we concluded to continue
							in the Stage— Lodg’d at <persRef ref="u">Nicholls’s</persRef>, an
							indifferent house— I met here an old Lady who resides at Jamaica-Plains,
							near Boston, and told me of all her acquaintance there— We had a very
							fine day for travelling, and the roads are generally good— The distance
							from New-London to New-Haven is 48 Miles.</p>
