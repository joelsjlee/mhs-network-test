						<p><date>2. </date>This was the return day, on the summons to <persRef
								ref="pickering-john2">John Pickering</persRef>, Judge of the
							District of New-Hampshire, to answer to the Articles of Impeachment
							against him.— The Senate met at ten O’Clock.— I called up my motion made
							on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of January, to declare that “any
							member of the Senate having previously acted and voted on a question of
							Impeachment as a Member of the House of Representatives, is thereby
							disqualified to sit and act, <hi rend="italic">in the same case</hi>, as
							a member of the Senate, sitting as a Court of Impeachments.” The
							resolution was negatived yeas 8. nays 20. When I made the motion there
							were three members in this predicament—<persRef ref="smith-samuel2"
								>Samuel Smith</persRef> of Maryland, <persRef ref="condit-john">John
								Condit</persRef> of New-Jersey, and <persRef ref="bailey-theodorus"
								>Theodorus Bailey</persRef> of New-York— Since that time, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bailey has resigned his seat. And
								<persRef ref="armstrong-john">John Armstrong</persRef>, who had been
							appointed by the Executive of New-York, during the recess of the
							legislature to supply the place of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>, has been appointed by the legislature instead of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bailey— The same Legislature also
							appointed John Smith to take the place of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Clinton, and he has taken his seat— <persRef
								ref="smith-john10">John Smith</persRef> of New-York was also a
							member of the house of Representatives when M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Pickering was impeached, and voted for the impeachment. So
							that there are still three members of the Senate in that situation— When
							the question on my proposed resolution was put, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Condit, and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> John Smith of
							New-York desired to be excused from voting and were accordingly excused—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Samuel Smith however declared that
							he <hi rend="italic">had</hi>
							<pb n="71" type="ms"/>had no idea of resigning his right to vote, and
							therefore said <hi rend="italic">No</hi>.— Some rules of proceedings
							were adopted— The Court of Impeachments was opened, and the House of
							Representatives informed, that the Court was ready to proceed to the
							trial; <persRef ref="mathers-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Mathers</persRef> the Serjeant at Arms being previously sworn to his
							return, that he had served the summons upon Judge Pickering. The
							managers for the House of Representatives appeared, and took the seats
							assigned them— John Pickering was called three times, and did not
							appear— The <persRef ref="burr-aaron">President</persRef> then stated
							that he had received a letter from <persRef ref="harper-robert-goodloe"
								>Robert Goodloe Harper</persRef> enclosing a Petition from <persRef
								ref="pickering-jacob">Jacob S. Pickering</persRef>, son of Judge
							Pickering; the letter and petition were read, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Harper appeared, and stated that he had no authority to
							appear, and did not appear for John Pickering; but he submitted to the
							Court, whether he should be permitted to advocate the petition of Jacob
							S. Pickering— This petition alledged that John Pickering, the Judge was
							insane at the time when the acts charged against him were stated to have
							been committed, and had been ever since and still remained in the same
							State— That he had several depositions to prove the fact— That the age
							and infirmities of his father made it impossible for him to be brought
							here, at this inclement Season— That the Judgment, which he was accused
							of, was not contrary to Law, though not the result of reason; and prayed
							for a postponement of the trial, that the Judge might be brought in
							person before the Court— The managers from the House of Representatives
							objected against M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harper’s being admitted
							to support the petition, he having expressly declared that he had no
							authority to appear in behalf of John Pickering, the person impeached—
							On this question the members of the Court retired to their
							committee-room, and after some consultation, being desirous to
							deliberate further returned, to the Senate-room, and informed the
							parties that when they shall have come to a decision, they will give
							information of it, to the House— The Court and Senate were then
							adjourned.</p>
						<p>I dined with <persRef ref="mason-john8">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							agreement upon the question; which was adjourned till Monday 11.
							o’clock— The dispositions and the principles advanced on this occasion
							are painful to reflect upon— The most persevering and determined

								<persRef ref="chase-samuel">Judge Chase’s</persRef> friends come and

							the purpose of discussing the resolution was rejected; nine members
							voting for it; the rule requires one third, which of 29 present, is 10.—

							resolution; so as to get rid of all the reasons alledged in it— I
							objected against any motion to strike out part of an offered resolution;
							because such motion was itself debate; and contrary to the rule— At
							length M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> John Smith of Ohio, wanted to put
							a question as to the meaning of a part of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> White’s Resolution— And in order to make that inquiry, a
							second motion was made to clear the galleries— Smith now voting for it,
							gave the casting turn; the necessary number of one third— The galleries
							were cleared, and a short discussion of the Resolution was had— The
							extreme Injustice, of judging an insane man, as a guilty one; of
							sentencing unheard, a man who could not be present at this time without
							imminent hazard of his life, of precipitating decision without
							necessity, was urged; M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Anderson and most
							of the members in the majority, all the time manifesting the most
							extreme impatience to open the doors and stop all further debate— At
							length, rather than continue the discussion, he waved his motion to
							strike out part of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White’s resolution,
							and said he was ready to meet it— But M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Nicholas said he should move that it <hi rend="italic">might not be

							shall be decided by <hi rend="italic">yeas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

							o’clock— <persRef ref="pickering-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Pickering</persRef> returned me, as I had desired, my
							last yesterday’s letter with the enclosed plan of a declaration;
							observing that on further consultation it was thought best to avoid such
							a step, and rest our opposition upon the regular discharge of our duty—
							I was of the same opinion— After the Court met, they were to determine
							the form of the question whether <persRef ref="pickering-john2">John
								Pickering</persRef> was guilty or not— And also the form of the
							Judgment, for in the same character of proceedings which has marked
							every thing done, since the manifestation of the displeasure of the
							Managers of the House of Representatives, the Court had fixed the time
							for pronouncing Judgment, <pb n="75" type="ms"/>before they had settled
							the question, guilty or not— It appeared to me very doubtful, whether
							the facts <hi rend="italic">alledged</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
								>proved</hi> in the first three Articles amounted to impeachable
							offences. And particularly whether the mere refusal of a Judge of an
							inferior Court, to allow an appeal, which the party claiming it can
							assert and sustain before the superior Tribunal, notwithstanding such
							refusal, can be an injury either to an individual or the public— I
							stated to the <persRef ref="franklin-jesse">President</persRef> my doubts on this subject; that I had not had
							the time necessary to examine the subject, and enquired whether I might
							put a question whether either of the Articles constituted an impeachable
							offence.— He said no; the only question to be put was that of guilty or
							not guilty on each Article separately.— <persRef ref="white-samuel2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White</persRef> of Delaware,
							moved that the question should be put in this form “Is John Pickering,
							Judge of the District of New-Hampshire, guilty or not guilty of High
							crimes and misdemeanors, as charged in the<space/>Article of Impeachment—
							Several other forms of question were proposed; and the galleries
							cleared, for discussion— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White’s form of
							question was taken from that adopted on the trial of <persRef
								ref="hastings-warren">Hastings</persRef>; But was here rejected, for
							the purpose of keeping out of sight the questions of Law implied in the
							terms “High crimes and misdemeanors”— The form adopted, was Is John
							Pickering, District Judge for the District of New-Hampshire, <hi
								rend="italic">guilty</hi>, as charged in the Article— And the
							answers to be <hi rend="italic">aye</hi> or <hi rend="italic">no</hi>—
							This form by blending all the law and facts together, under the shelter
							of general terms put at ease a few of the weak brethren, who scrupled on
							the law, and a few who doubted of the facts— The same address, saved
							their consciences the uttering the word <hi rend="italic">guilty</hi>;
							which as applied to a man deprived of his senses, shocks the feelings
							even of those who had submitted to pronounce him so in the fact— Some of
							them knew the <hi rend="italic">word</hi> would stick in their throats,
							though they were prepared for the thing— The next thing to agree upon,
							was the Judgment; the time fixed for pronouncing it was past— The
							Managers, and indeed the whole House of Representatives were at the door
							waiting; a form was proposed, Shall John Pickering, District Judge
							&amp;c be removed from Office; to be put <hi rend="small-caps"
								>if</hi> the vote of guilty, aye or no, should be <hi
								rend="strikethrough">in his favour</hi> against him— This form was
							agreed to, in the midst of confusion, and with the precipitation now
							become habitual— The whole House of Representatives came in; with their
								<persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">Speaker</persRef> at their Head— The
							Managers took their Seats— The President declared the Senate were ready
							to pronounce Judgment:—when <persRef ref="wright-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright</persRef>, who sat before me
							looked back, and said he should call to have the <hi rend="italic"
								>record of the District Court</hi>, <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, <hi
								rend="italic">on which the first Article of Impeachment was
								founded</hi>.— I, with some surprize; and with a countenance perhaps
							of some contempt, at this endeavour to bias votes at that moment, only
							said “Evidence! now!”— He saw his motive detected— The record
							undoubtedly proved the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">that the</hi> alledged in the first Article—of
							restoration of the vessel— But the question of Law, and the Judge’s
							state of mind, could not appear— On my barely saying those words, He
							coloured in crimson to the eyes, and with an appearance of rage, said—“I
							don’t understand you Sir— I wish you would treat me with decency, in
							this house”— I answered “Sir, it is always my intention to treat you
							with decency”— He turn’d to the President, and called for the <pb n="76" type="ms"
							/>record to be read— The <persRef ref="otis-samuel">Secretary</persRef>
							accordingly began to read the record, which was long— Before he had got
							half through, <persRef ref="jackson-james2">General Jackson</persRef>
							rose and said it was altogether out of order, and called for the reading
							of the first Article of Impeachment— Wright rose, and said “<hi
								rend="italic">there was something at the conclusion of the
								record</hi>.”— However, the call for the Article of Impeachment was
							repeated; and the President ordered it to be read— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright’s conclusion of the record
							therefore was not read, and his hopeful project failed. The question of
							“guilty,” aye or no, was taken separately on the four articles, after
							each article read. 19 yeas, and 7. nays. on each article— Then on the
							question of removal. 20 yeas and 6. nays. <persRef ref="wells-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wells</persRef>, saying that
							although he believed the man not guilty, yet the competent majority
							having found otherwise he voted for the removal— The Court was then
							adjourned, indefinitely— After the adjournment, I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wells, that the grounds upon which I
							voted on the last question, against the removal, was that the whole
							proceedings had been contrary to Law, and that he was not legally
							convicted— I said I had for some time doubted in my own mind, as to what
							my vote ought to be in that question, but that finally that was the
							conclusion I had drawn— He told me that he had not fully reflected on
							the subject, and believed that mine was the correct opinion— N.B. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> White and <persRef ref="dayton-jonathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dayton</persRef>, withdrew from
							the Court and did not vote— On the ground, as they alledged of the <hi
								rend="italic">irregularity in the proceedings</hi>.— <persRef
								ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> did the same—perhaps from the same cause; and
							probably to avoid separating from his party.— <persRef ref="stone-david"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Stone</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="armstrong-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Armstrong</persRef> likewise absented themselves; owing I presume to
							the same doubts of the regularity of proceedings; and the same aversion
							to quit their party— I would gladly have done the same— Not, for fear of
							quitting my party; for before Heaven, I have not suffered a party
							thought to intermingle with my judgment in the case— But to bear the
							loudest testimony against such a course of proceedings— However on full
							deliberation, I thought my true line of duty, was to remain at my post,
							and discharge myself conformably to the special oath I had taken—</p>
						<p>After the adjournment of the Senate, I went in to the House of
							Representatives, where a vote pass’d to impeach <persRef
								ref="chase-samuel">Judge Chase</persRef> of High Crimes and
							Misdemeanors.— I pass’d the Evening at home—idle— A great part of the
							family sick.</p>
						<p>On the impeachment of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering, there
							are two remarks which have impress’d themselves on my mind, with
							peculiar force— The subserviency of the Senate, even when acting as a
								<hi rend="italic">Judicial Court</hi>, to a few <hi rend="italic"
								>leading members</hi> of the House of Representatives— And the
							principles assumed, though not yet openly avowed, that by the tenure of
								<hi rend="italic">good behaviour</hi>, is meant an active continual,
							and unerring execution of Office— So that insanity—sickness,—any trivial
							error of conduct in a judge, must be construed into misdemeanors,
							punishable by <hi rend="italic">impeachment</hi>— The fact of the first
							remark, coupled with the principle, assumed by the last, I think must
							produce important consequences to this Union.</p>
