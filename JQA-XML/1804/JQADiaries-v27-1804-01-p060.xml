							against many laws, many usages, many opinions, and many prejudices,

								>material</hi> objection against them— On the day when they were

							great care to come and take his seat again; so as to be there for the

							voting, as <hi rend="italic">not having heard the discussion</hi>. He
							was accordingly excused, but yesterday and to-day he has voted for the

							his votes on the <hi rend="italic">5</hi> and <hi rend="italic">3</hi>
							questions gave the most decisive demonstration of his views— However as
							the loss of his concurrence takes off half the force of the few
							federalists left, I cannot pursue opposition to any effect without his
							support.— I therefore barely took the yeas and nays at this reading
							without making any observations <pb n="63" type="ms"/>on the bill

								Pickering</persRef>, and had a very full and free conversation, with
							him on the subject of my resolutions and the Louisiana bills.— I
							represented to him the importance of harmony between us, and told him
							that as I found the measures, which I intended to have opposed to the
							utmost of my power, appeared to have his approbation, I should stop
							short in the career of my opposition, to avoid every appearance of
							controversy with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>— For that however ready and
							willing I am to contend with the ruling majority, I felt the importance
							of preserving unanimity with him, both as it respected ourselves and our
							Constituents— I also asked him what clause or Section of the
							Constitution it was, under which he conceived Congress have the power to
							pass these Laws— He answered me, that he was sensible of the importance
							of our agreeing together in our measures, and regretted when he thought
							it necessary to vote differently from me. That in this instance as to
							the abstract principle of the Law of Nations, as I quoted from <persRef
								ref="vattel-emer">Vattel</persRef>, <hi rend="italic">I was
								certainly right</hi>; and that there was no particular clause of the
							Constitution which gave Congress the power, unless possibly it might be
							the clause enabling them to <hi rend="italic">provide for the general
								welfare</hi>— But as a point of expediency, it would be imprudent to
							give the people of Louisiana an option to submit to our government or
							not, and that as to the natural rights of men they always were
							disregarded in Cessions of this kind— Such are M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Pickering’s reasons for disapproving my opposition to these
							two Laws— He abandons altogether the ground of <hi rend="italic"
								>right</hi>, upon both questions and relies upon what is <hi
								rend="italic">expedient</hi> in opposition to the right— I told him
							I was satisfied as to the object of my inquiries, and that from
							deference to him, and to avoid the appearance of contending with him, I
							should urge my opposition on these bills no further, except so far as
							merely to record my votes— He said he was afraid it would be attributed
							to an obstinate determination to oppose every thing, if he continued to
							oppose the measures for the Government of Louisiana, and that however
							desirous he was to be in harmony in me, he could not sacrifice his
							opinions— This conversation has finished opening to me M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering’s heart and his understanding—
							Another remark I made was that he conversed with the most perfect
							freedom on the subject of the Treaty of limits with Great-Britain, and
