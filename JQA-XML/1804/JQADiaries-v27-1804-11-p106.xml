								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson was asked by one of his own
							partizans, what had been the cause of their variance— He assigned as a
							reason, that Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Walker had defrauded him
							in some pecuniary, transaction— This was reported to Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi> Walker, who immediately sent Jefferson a
							challenge, by <persRef ref="lee-henry2">General Henry Lee</persRef>—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson, confessed to Lee, that he
							had assigned a pecuniary fraud by Walker, as the cause of the rupture in
							their friendship— That this allegation was entirely without foundation,
							but given for the sake of concealing the real cause; the wrong he had
							done to Walker— But he declared himself ready to give M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Walker any satisfaction he could justly
							require— Lee then exacted of him to write Walker a letter acknowledging
							all these facts, and recanting the slander he had uttered against him,
							which letter M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson accordingly
							wrote— It was also insisted on by Lee, and acquiesced in by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson, that the substance of this
							satisfaction should be made public; but in such manner as might be most
							accommodating to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson— This humble,
							confessing and recanting letter to Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
							Walker has been heard of, and a copy of it is now in possession of
								<persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">Major Thomas Pinckney</persRef> of
							South Carolina.— Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Walker had been
							informed that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy was desirous of
							having a copy of it, and this letter is in answer to that request— He
							consents that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy shall have such a
							copy, on condition that he will not give any copy from it, and that it
							shall not be printed— He says that as M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jefferson has not yet pointed out the manner, in which the satisfaction
							given by him should be made public, he should be indulged with further
							time.— That perhaps he (Walker) might eventually be compelled to publish
							the whole correspondence; but he wished to reserve to himself the
							judgment as to the propriety, and the time for this— That in such case
							he should mention several additional Circumstances now known to few, and
							which very much <hi rend="italic">aggravated the turpitude</hi> of
							Jefferson’s <hi rend="italic">transgression</hi>— Such as that his
								<persRef ref="walker-thomas">(Walker’s) father</persRef>, had been
							Jefferson’s guardian and patron— That he himself and Jefferson had been
							bred together in the greatest intimacy as children— Had been classmates
							at College; came forward in public life together, untill Jefferson went
							to France; and that Jefferson was himself a married Man, when he made
							this assault on the chastity of his friend’s wife.— Such is the
							substance of this letter from Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Walker
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy, which ascertains facts that
							have often been denied by Jefferson’s partizans, as the slander of his
							enemies— After coming home, I pass’d the remainder of the day, in
							writing; a review of <persRef ref="cranch-william">M<hi

							young-ladies, with <persRef ref="hellen-walter">M<hi rend="superscript"

							on his Cloaths. He says they must get him down to a plain frock Coat, or
							the boys in the Streets will run after him, as a sight— I asked if he
							had brought his <hi rend="italic">Imperial</hi> Credentials, and was
							answered he had. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson then turned
							the Conversation towards the French Revolution; and remarked how <hi
								rend="italic">contrary to all expectation</hi>, this great <hi
								rend="italic">bouleversement</hi> had turned out— It seemed as if
							every thing in that Country for the last 12 or 15 years, had been <hi
								rend="small-caps">a dream</hi>, and who could have imagined that such
							an <hi rend="italic">ebranlement</hi>, would have come to this— He
							thought it very much to be wished, that they could now return to the
							Constitution of 1789, and call back, <hi rend="italic">the Old
								Family</hi>.— For although by that Constitution the Government was
							much too weak, and although it was defective, in having a legislature
							only in one branch, yet even thus it was better than the present form,
							where it was impossible to perceive <hi rend="italic">any limits</hi>. I
							have used as near as possible his very words—for this is one of the most
							unexpected phases, in the waxing and waning opinions of this Gentleman
							concerning the French Revolution.— He also mentioned to me the extreme
							difficulty he had in finding fit characters for appointments in
							Louisiana; and said he would now give <hi rend="italic">the
								Creation</hi>, for a young Lawyer of good abilities, and who could
							speak the French language, to go to New-Orleans, as one of the Judges of
							the Superior Court, in the Territory— The Salary was about 2000 dollars—
							He had been very lucky in obtaining one such <pb n="111" type="ms"
							/>Judge, in <persRef ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Prevost</persRef> of New-York, who had accepted the appointment, and
							was perfectly well qualified; and he was in extreme want of another— I
							could easily have named him a character fully corresponding to the one
							he appeared so much to want— But if his observations were meant as a <hi
								rend="italic">consultation</hi>, or an intent to ask whether I knew
							any such person I could recommend, he was not sufficiently explicit—
							Though if they were not, I know not why he made them to me— He further
							observed that both French and Spanish, ought to be made primary objects
							of acquisition in all the educations of our young men— As to Spanish it
							was so easy, that he had learn’d it, with the help of a Don Quixote lent
							him by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cabot</persRef>
							and a Grammar, in the course of a passage to Europe, on which he was but
							19 days at sea. But M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson tells
							large Stories— At table he told us that when he was at Marseilles, he
							saw there a <persRef ref="bergasse-henri">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Bergasse</persRef> a famous manufacturer of wines, who
							told him that he would make him any sort of wine he would name, and in
							any quantities, at 6 or 8 sols the bottle— And though there should not
							be a drop of the genuine wine required, in his composition, yet it
							should so perfectly imitate the taste, that the most refined
							Connoisseurs should not be able to tell which was which— You never can
							be an hour in this man’s company without something of the marvellous
							like these Stories— His genius is of the Old French School— It conceives
							better than it combines— He shewed us among other things a natural
							History of Parrots in French, with coloured plates very beautifully
							executed.</p>
