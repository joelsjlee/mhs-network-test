                        <p>I begin the new year as I closed the old one with praise and prayer to
                            God— With grateful thanksgiving for the past—with humble supplication
                            for the future— Physical Nature never was more kindly adapted to the
                            enjoyment of man in commencing the year, than it was, this day—at this
                            place— The close of the last year was serene, mild, and beautiful.— The
                            entrance of the new annual portion of everlasting ages was yet more
                            auspicious and cheering.— The morning, noon and night of it was
                            delightful.— I rose an hour and a half later than my time—but closed
                            before breakfast the diary of the departed year. From ten till 3
                            O’Clock, an uninterrupted stream of visitors, absorbed the time, and
                            exhausted my patience— It is generally meant in kindness, always in
                            civility—and for a succession of 15 years since I left the Presidents
                            house, has greeted me in still increasing numbers. Among the visitors of
                            this day were some of the bitterest political enemies, North and South,
                            that I have in the world— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina—
                                <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="hale-john">Hale</persRef> of New-Hampshire were of the
                            number;—and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Jared
                                Ingersoll</persRef> the cunningest, and most treacherous cat of them
                            all.— Holmes however could not cover his sore with Court Plaister— He
                            made a merit of his visit by saying he had come to see me,
                            “notwithstanding the sword of <persRef ref="orlando"
                            >Orlando</persRef>.”— A dash of ridicule that I cast upon him for his
                            hectoring bravadoes of battle against the abolitionists— An hour of
                            argument he could answer with blustering sophistry— An unpregnable
                            syllogism with rodomontade, but Durindana cut so deep that he will never
                            recover from the wound— Of all weapons in debate sarcasm is the lethalis
                            arundo— Immediately after I got disengaged from the throng, about 3, I
                            walked to <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Madisons</persRef> house and paid her a visit— Found with her
                            several ladies: of whom were <persRef ref="legare-mary">Miss
                                Legaré</persRef>, sister of the <persRef ref="legare-hugh">late
                                Attorney General</persRef>: <persRef ref="u;u">two misses
                                Bryant</persRef> daughters of <persRef ref="bryan-eliza">another
                                sister</persRef> and <persRef ref="payne-anna">Anna Payne</persRef>
                            who live with her— I spent the evening in my chamber, writing to
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and received a mail
                            of Letters and Newspapers, into the last of which I dared not look and
                            had time to read not more than half of the first when eleven O’Clock
                            came, and I must to bed— I have piles of Letters unanswered and which I
                            never shall find time to answer. To morrow recommences the struggle
                            which for me can terminate only with my life— May the Spirit from above,
                            in life and death sustain me!</p>

                            him stating that receipts from him and the other heirs of <persRef

                            had been sent to me, with authority to recieve the money and deliver the

                                >r</hi> Johnson that I would give him immediate notice if I should.
                            At ten I met the Committee on the revisal of the rules— Present Adams,

                            <persRef ref="davis-john8">Davis</persRef> and <persRef

                            once attended the Committee. Before the Quorum was formed this morning,
                            Beardsley told me that he thought the house would not confirm the vote
                            of the Committee to strike out the gag rule, and he intimated that Davis
                            of Indiana had changed his opinion and would move to reverse the
                            decision of the Committee— But Davis did not attend— The members
                            present, after a final cursory revisal of the whole report, instructed
                            me to present it, this day to the house—and to move that it be printed
                            and made the order of the day for this day week.— I told Beardsley that
                            the action of the house upon the gag would depend entirely upon the
                            perseverance of the 27. members of the New-York delegation; and that I
                            was told the Richmond Enquirer had threatened that if they did
                            persevere, <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren’s</persRef> claim to
                            the Presidency would be forfeited— He admitted the fact and said that he
                            hoped the members would not be moved by any such consideration— Two or
                            three weak minded men might be. In the house the instant after the
                            reading of the journal Charles J. Ingersoll moved a suspension of the
                            rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to
                            take up the bill to refund <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
                                >Jackson’s</persRef> fine— I asked permission of the house to
                            present the report on the revisal of the rules—that it might be printed
                            and made the order of the day for next Tuesday— Charles J. coolly said
                            “you can make your report[”]—but <persRef ref="reding-john"
                                >Reding</persRef> of New-Hampshire objected; and the house by a vote
                            of more than two thirds went into Committee and took up the Jackson fine
                            bill— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> at the close of
                            his fragment of an hour, was cut off in the midst of an unanswerable
                            argument against the bill, and now followed the foulest and filthiest
                            shower of slander upon the long since deceased <persRef

                            since the festival of the Harpies in the Æneid—till <persRef

                            the house did not immediately adjourn.</p>

                        <p>When <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> moved yesterday, the
                            Committee on the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> fine to
                            rise it was for the purpose of having a full fresh morning hour to
                            disgorge his bilious venom against the Whigs and his sycophancy to
                            Jackson, on the house— When the committee rose I again presented the
                            report of the Committee on the revisal of the rules and moved that it
                            should be printed, and made the order of the day for next Tuesday— There
                            was a disorderly, tumultuary opposition to receiving the report; but the
                                <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> did receive it, and
                            stated the question of printing and assignment— <persRef
                                ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South Carolina called for
                            a division of the question— There were Slave answers of no; but the
                            Speaker without heeding them pronounced the printing, and took the
                            question of assignment, merely by rising—he declared 63 for and 65
                            against the assignment and pronounced it rejected— I and many others,
                            believed he had miscounted and that the real majority was for the
                            assignment.— I was about to call for a count by tellers, but <persRef
                                ref="elmer-lucius">Elmer</persRef>, chairman of the Committee of
                            Elections, had contested the floor with me, for a motion that the
                            Committee should be allowed to employ a clerk— The instant the Speaker
                            announced the decision against the assignment, Elmer got the floor, and
                            made his motion— <persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef>, a
                            member of the Committee, opposed it; and <persRef ref="carroll-charles2"
                                >Charles H. Carroll</persRef> started up, and commenced a storm
                            against the Committee, for neglect of duty in not reporting upon the
                            contested seats of the general ticket members.— He was called to order
                            repeatedly for irrelevancy, and decided by <persRef
                                ref="beardsley-samuel">Beardsley</persRef>, in the Chair as Speaker,
                            to be out of order, but persevered, till the clamour for order was
                            growing to a brawl— Jones the Speaker crept in, and Beardsley out of the
                            chair— Carroll was still vociferating, in spite of the decision that he
                            was out of order— Elmer, to silence the charge against the Committee of
                            elections, of neglect of duty, withdrew his motion for a clerk, and a
                            Slaver moved to adjourn— Carroll insisted that Elmer could not withdraw
                            his motion, nor the other member move to adjourn, while he was on the

                            appealed; but the Speaker put the question, and the house adjourned.— I
                            walked home and spent the evening at my writing table; answering a

                            into the debates of the Virginia Convention upon the Constitution of the

                            here. Ingersoll and Cave are indefatigable— The rules were suspended by
                            a vote of more than two thirds— The Jackson fine-bill was turned adrift
                            till further order and the call for Resolutions not to be debated now,
                            commenced— A question was immediately started whether under a call for
                            Resolutions, members could introduce bills of which they had given
                            previous notice— The Speaker decided first that they could not, and then
                            that they could. And a goodly number of abortions were thus ushered into
                            being— The Speaker began with Maine— When he came to Massachusetts I
                            offered first a call upon the <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of
                                the Treasury</persRef> for the present condition of the Smithsonian

                            lying over a day, and without opposition— I then asked leave to offer
                            another Resolution, which was tacitly granted. It was a call on the

                            rules. There was much chicanery to exclude the reception of this
                            resolution. All this failing <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Boyd</persRef>
                            moved to lay it on the table— The house refused by yeas and nays 80 to
                            87— The question then was direct on the reconsideration; but the Speaker
                            was averse to putting it— <persRef ref="davis-john8">Davis</persRef> of

                            and Beardsley urged to postpone the question of reconsideration, till
                            the close of the call for resolutions, with an understanding that it
                            should then be immediately taken— It was clear that if I insisted on
                            taking the question on reconsideration now, it would fail, and I
                            consented to the postponement. The call for Resolutions continued.
                                <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> offered one to instruct

                            moved the previous question— The whigs indulged him with a second, and
                            then rejected his Resolution by yeas and nays 57 to 112— John Campbell
                            offered a Resolution to appoint <persRef ref="mccormick-william"
                                >M’Cormick</persRef> Post-master to the house; but the Northern
                            Slavers had pounced upon their prey, and forced down the throats of
                            their Southern accomplices an order that the house would elect a
                            Postmaster to morrow— So the Speaker declared Campbell’s motion out of
                            order. He then modified it into a resolution, to rescind the order for
                            electing the Postmaster to-morrow—but it availed him nothing— <persRef

                            is; that the Northern phalanx of the Slavo-democracy, dragoon the South
                            in the distribution of the spoils, in return for their sale of the
                            freedom of their constituents in the Slave-market as the Dutch traders
                            to Japan, purchased the privilege of dealing for spices by trampling on

                                >select Committee on the Massachusetts Resolves</persRef>, all of
                            whom met this morning in the room of the Committee of Commerce, and when
                            that Committee met, passed into the room of the Committee on the
                            Militia— I moved that the Committee should take minutes of their
                            proceedings, and that when any member should present any resolution or
                            motion in writing the question upon it should be taken if he desired
                            it.— Which was agreed to and Joseph R Ingersoll consented to keep the
                            minutes at my request. I then moved the two Resolutions, which I asked
                            the Committee to instruct their chairman to offer to the house
                            instructing the Committee to enquire and ascertain as far as may be
                            practicable the number of owners of Slaves, and the amount of the
                            chattel property represented in the house Gilmer insisted upon taking
                            immediately the question upon the motion submitted by him at the last
                            meeting in writing that the amendment to the Constitution proposed by
                            the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts ought <hi
                                rend="small-caps">not</hi> to be recommended— I first moved as an
                            amendment to that resolution to strike out the word <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> and then moved to postpone the consideration of it to
                            discuss my Resolutions looking for calls for information and to give
                            time for argumentative reports on both sides to be prepared and
                            submitted to the Committee and then to the house if so decided by the
                            committee— The question on postponement was carried by vote 7 to
                            2—Gilmer and Burt only voting no— Gilmer then invited me to state
                            candidly my views in support of the amendment proposed by the
                            Massachusetts Legislature, which I did in a very summary
                            manner—disclaiming all intention of saying any thing offensive to any
                            member of the committee compelled as I was to state the feelings of my
                            constituents under their sense of the wrongs endured by them resulting
                            from the Slave representation in Congress— Burke and Gilmer said
                                <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> had contended that the
                            Slaves should be represented equally with the whites— But that was in
                            the confederation of States without any representation of the people—
                            Garrett Davis suggested that if information of the number of owners of
                            Slaves, and of the amount of their value was to be sought—similar
                            information of the number of other proprietors and of the value of other
                            property would be equally necessary. From this I dissented no other
                            property being represented in Congress— The Committee adjourned to next
                            Tuesday at 10. O’Clock.</p>

                        <p>In the house a bad example was introduced of
                            dispensing with the reading of a large portion of the journal— The call
                            of the States for Resolutions was immediately resumed— <persRef

                            a reconsideration of the yesterday’s vote rejecting <persRef

                            he offered a substitute expressed in such generality as to mean
                            nothing—whether this was to ridicule Black or for a cunning affectation
                            of simplicity, it did not suit the anti-tariff Slavers, and <persRef
                                ref="saunders-romulus">Saunders</persRef> moved to lay the motion of
                            reconsideration on the table, which was carried without division— Then
                            came up <persRef ref="mcdowell-joseph">M’Dowell’s</persRef> resolution
                            upon which the previous question had been called yesterday when the
                            house adjourned— The previous question was now carried 81 to 31. and the
                            resolution rejected by yeas and nays 84 to 102— <persRef
                                ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> then offered a Resolution for
                            the establishment of a new Committee of Commerce among the States.— This
                            is included in the report of the Committee on the Rules—but Vinton
                            believes the Report will be rejected by the house as I suppose it will—
                            A multitude of other resolution was offered carving out business for the
                            house, to consume time far beyond the first Monday of next December—
                                <persRef ref="dawson-john2">Dawson</persRef> of Louisiana offered a

                                Ingersoll</persRef> was utterly disconcerted at the declaration of
                            the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> that this was a
                            resolution requiring a vote of two thirds to be carried, and looked
                            oppugnation but finally concluded to take his seat. <persRef

                            that the House now proceed to execute the order of the House directing
                            the election this day of a Postmaster of the house— As this was a
                            departure from the call for Resolutions proceeding under a suspension of
                            the rules I supposed it would require a vote of two thirds to be
                            carried. The Speaker decided that a majority would suffice— I appealed,
                            and the decision of the Speaker was sustained 114 to 58. The house
                            proceeded to the election. 5. candidates were nominated—at the first

                                >members</persRef> of the select Committee on the copy right bill
                            introduced by Charles J. Ingersoll and the Memorial of the Booksellers
                            for an international copy right law presented by me. A bare Quorum of
                            the Committee dotted in the margin met this morning in the chamber of
                            the Committee of foreign Affairs and conversed upon the subject of copy
                            right internal and external. The conversation was general, and I offered
                            some suggestions as to the natural right of literary property, to the
                            principles of which as entertained by me, Ingersoll immediately declared
                            his dissent— His principles are radically depraved, and never can
                            harmonize with mine— Winthrop the chairman was very desirous that I
                            should assume the duties of that office and prepare a report, and
                            Leonard of New-York city expressed the same desire— But I declined for
                            want of time, and because to take from Winthrop even at his own request
                            his office of chairman would savour of presumption— The Committee
                            adjourned to this day fortnight the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> In
                            the house, the call for Resolutions was resumed— The territories only
                            remained to be called— <persRef ref="yulee-david">Levy</persRef> the
                            delegate from Florida, abused the indulgence of the house in relaxing
                            the rule which allows a member to offer only one Resolution or one
                            series of Resolutions on the same subject at a time—offered six
                            Resolutions which were at once adopted—six which were lain over one day,
                            and ten bills, which were referred to several committees. I required
                            that the bills should be read by their titles and then enquired of the
                                <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">clerk</persRef> how many of them there
                            were Levy answered 8 or 10. I enquire again how many? he answered ten— I
                            said we should certainly adjourn in May The instant the call for
                            Resolutions was closed. C. J. Ingersoll moved to suspend the rules to go
                            into Committee on the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>
                            fine bill— I appealed to the good faith of the house on the pledge under
                            which I had consented to postpone the question of reconsideration the
                            case of the Report on the rules, that the question should be taken
                            immediately after the call for resolutions— The <persRef
                                ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> said that there certainly had
                            been such an understanding, but the Gentleman from Pennsylvania had the
                            right to move the suspension of the rules, and if two thirds of the
                            house should sustain him it must be so— I protested against this
                            decision, and appealed from it.— Ingersoll exploded with a volley of
                            insolent billingsgate upon me, and finished by withdrawing his motion to
                            suspend the rules— The question of reconsideration was taken by yeas <hi

                            <pb n="191" type="ms"/>and nays, and carried 102 to 78. Ingersoll <hi
                                rend="strikethrough">then</hi> after some other squirming had moved
                            to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table— I objected to his
                            motion, as not in order; the last action of the house on the subject,
                            having been a vote rejecting that same motion to lay the motion for
                            reconsideration on the table. After enquiring as to the fact, and
                            ascertaining it The Speaker decided that Ingersoll’s motion was not in
                            order— The question then was upon my original motion reported from the
                            Committee to assign next Tuesday as a special order for considering the
                            report— I enquired if it would be in order for me to withdraw that
                            motion, and move to consider the report <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. The
                            speaker said it would not. <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
                                Johnson</persRef> enquired if the motion would be in order to make
                            the report the special order for Tuesday The Speaker said that in the
                            opinion of the chair it would— I demanded the yeas and nays, despairing
                            of the success of my motion— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
                                >Dromgoole</persRef> moved to recommit the report, intimating that
                            after his return from the Christmas holidays he wanted to have something
                            to do with it— I called him to order—he persisted in his motion, and the
                            Speaker who five minutes before had decided that it would not be in
                            order for me to move to take up the report for consideration now,
                            decided that Dromgoole’s motion to recommit the report was in order and
                            debateable.— I said that was precisely what I desired—but five minutes
                            before, the Speaker had decided that it would not be in order for me to
                            move to take up the report now—a true sample of the Speakers
                            impartiality— <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of Georgia,
                            now exploded—declared he would vote for the <hi rend="strikethrough"
                                >amendment</hi> motion to recommit, and moved an amendment to
                            it—that the Committee should be instructed to re-instate in the report
                            the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or gag-rule, and then he launched
                            out onto a furious invective and defiance of the committee for
                            emasculating the rules of the house— The debate was now fairly under
                            way. <persRef ref="davis-john8">Davis</persRef> of Indiana; asked to say
                            a word to set himself right; as he feared he had been the innocent cause
                            of some of the difficulties of the house in this case.— He had always
                            voted in concession to the South against rescinding this rule, but he
                            had always disapproved it and believed it impolitic and unwise— If
                            therefore the report should be recommitted he should ask to be excused
                            from serving any further on that Committee. <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"
                                >Gilmer</persRef> made a last abortive attempt to stave off the
                            report by a point of order when a long debate ensued in which <persRef

                            but the Secretary was not there— In one of the Apartments of the
                            building there were three or four members of the Institute, with the New

                            Summer, he had seen on the book of unclaimed dividends the name of

                        <p>and as joint executor of my father’s will I received and receipted for a
                            check on the cashier of the Bank of the Metropolis for that sum— I had
                            not time to receive the money at the Bank, but hurried to the house
                            where I expected Charles J. Ingersoll would start again his motion to

                            trouble of making the motion to choke off the debate on the rules, by
                            deciding that henceforth that debate would only be in order during the
                            morning hour. A decision like most of those of John W. Jones deeply
                            tainted with Slavery— Upon this decision <persRef ref="duncan-alexander"
                                    >D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan</persRef> of Cincinnati
                            took the floor and occupied three fourths of the hour with a plausible
                            but so far as relates to the real point at issue an ambiguous speech— He
                            came out sufficiently clear and explicit against the rule— Assuming the
                            same ground as <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hamlin</persRef> of Maine,
                                <persRef ref="davis-john8">John W. Davis</persRef> of Indiana, and
                                <persRef ref="clingman-thomas">Clingman</persRef> of North Carolina
                            did yesterday of the Constitutional and unalienable right of petition—
                            But from this he quickly flew off into a bitter invective upon the
                            abolitionists and upon the negro race. Affirming without qualification
                            the inferiority of that race to that of the whites— Insisting that of
                            all countries on the face of the earth Africa was the only one where
                            Christianity after being once introduced has never been able to take
                            root— And alluding in a tone of ridicule and buffoonery to the physical
                            conformation of the negro maintaining that no length of time or change
                            of climate can change their complexion, their woolly head, their flat
                            nose or their crooked leg or splay-foot; and their effluvia. The Slavers
                            were highly delighted with this vulgar slang, and chuckled much when the
                            Doctor pointing directly to me asked what my opinion on this subject was
                            and intimated that I owed it to my own character, and to the country to
                            answer his question— I took no notice of it, and after he concluded his
                            speech he came round to my seat and asked me in a mild and friendly
                            manner if I intended to answer his question— I said yes—but not on this
                            debate, for I considered all that part of his speech as irrelevant to
                            the question before the house, and if I attempted to answer it, I should
                            in three minutes of time be called to order for irrelevancy, and the
                            Speaker would pronounce me out of order for irrelevancy— But that on
                            some proper occasion, I would if the house would let me, answer him to
                            his heart’s content.— He asked in a still more pointed manner a question
                            of <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> with the intention
                            of injuring him and <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>—
                            Giddings did answer him, sportively, but to his utter confusion— As soon
                            as he finished <persRef ref="brown-aaron">A. V. Brown</persRef> of
                            Tennessee took the floor, but the morning hour expired in ten minutes
                            and the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union
                            upon the Jackson fine bill, which was debated till near 5. O’Clock when
                            the Committee rose and the house adjourned— <persRef

                        <p>The concert last Evening was for the benefit of the poor, at the Assembly
                            rooms—the old Theatre, in the Louisiana avenue— It was almost entirely
                            Italian music of the recent Operas, closing with the Liberty song of the
                            Puritani, wretchedly performed— An English song of a maniac lover was
                            sung and performed on the piano by an amateur named <persRef ref="u"
                                >Drayton</persRef>, a silly but celebrated novelty to me. <persRef

                            with sundry screams and contortions of the face, nearly convulsive— This
                            morning I attended with <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H.

                                Tustin</persRef> preached from 2. Timothy 3.16 [“]All scripture is
                            given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
                            reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” He gave out
                                <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> hundredth psalm, and
                            read it by two lines at a time, setting the tune of old hundred after
                            requesting volunteer assistance from the auditory to carry him through—
                            The Sermon was a glorification of the Scriptures, well sustained with
                            the exception that it conceded too much to the infidel scoffer by
                            admitting that there was much to be said on his side of the argument,
                            and laying the main stress of his plea for christianity on the
                            consideration that it is <hi rend="italic">safest</hi> to believe— He
                            gave a historical summary of the time at which this epistle to <persRef
                                ref="timothy">Timothy</persRef>, and the circumstances under which
                            it was written, and an outline of the general purport of the Letter with
                            some notices of Timothy, the person to whom it was written, and of the
                            intimate and affectionate relations between <persRef ref="paul"
                                >Paul</persRef> and him.— After the service was over M<hi

                            and introduced him to me, at my seat— And he asked me if I recollected
                            the baptism of a <persRef ref="mason-maria">child</persRef> at Leesburg
                            when I was there with <persRef ref="lafayette">General La

                                Monroe</persRef>, in August 1825. I said I remembered it well: and
                            that the impression of it was the more vivid on my mind from the fact
                            which I had heard that the child then baptised under circumstances
                            apparently so auspicious, died that same night— He said it was true— On
                            my way home I called and left a card at <persRef ref="slidell-john">M<hi

                                <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Thomson</persRef> of Mississippi moved
                            a suspension of the rules for a motion to cease all debate in Committee

                            fine bill, at 4 O’Clock this afternoon, and to take the question on the
                            amendments and report the bill to the house— This is the formula for
                            suppressing all debate, and was carried by yeas and nays 116. to 54. a
                            more than two thirds vote— Thomson then moved his resolution to smother
                            debate, and take the Bill out of Committee at 4 p.m. this afternoon—
                                <persRef ref="pratt-zadock">Pratt</persRef> of New-York moved as a
                            substitute for Thomsons motion a resolution to stop debate and take the
                            bill out of Committee in two hours, with a long preamble stating that
                            the Legislatures of 17 States representing a population of 15 out of the
                            17 millions of the People of the United States had demanded the
                            restoration of this fine; and then enumerating one by one the 17 States
                            and the population of each of them and concluding that therefore the
                            debate on this bill should cease in two hours and the question upon it
                            be taken this day— Thompson accepted this as a modification of his own
                            resolution, excepting that he adhered to his own limitation of the time
                            to 4. O’Clock, to which Pratt acceded; and the resolution was carried—
                            Thompson then moved to go into Committee of the whole, and it was done;

                            about the first principles involved in this case and not much about the
                            facts, but he did cut up the malignant sycophantic declamation of

                            so that there was scarcely a shred of them left. His manner is cool
                            firm, unhesitating, with conscious mastery of his subject, his voice
                            clear and strong, his elocution neat and elegant, with a swelling vein
                            of sarcastic humour which more than once made the hall ring with shouts

                            dog shakes between his teeth a dead rat, when his hour expired and
                                <persRef ref="brown-aaron">A. V. Brown</persRef> took the floor, and
                            from that time with the exception of a short quarter of an hour for
                            Severance, the Jackson trumpeters blew till they brayed like Jackasses
                            till 4. They passed the bill and closed the day with a triumphal drunken
                            bout at the Apollo Hall, toasting and crepitating with a cannon in the
                            Street till long after midnight.</p>

                        <p>The Select Committee on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts
                            had adjourned to meet this morning at ten in the room of the Committee
                            of Commerce— They gathered one by one, till about half past ten when
                            they formed a quorum; and waited another half hour for <persRef
                                ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> who keeps the
                            minutes, and whom I found in Session with the Committee of Ways and
                            Means. The members of our Committee were all present but we found on the
                            mantle piece a scrap of paper which the door keeper of the room desired
                            me to look at— There was written on it Resolved that this room is wanted
                            for the Committee of Commerce, every day except those days when it is
                            occupied by the Naval Committee— This was a mere effusion of petty spite
                            from <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>, now chairman of the
                            Committee of Commerce; and the manner of notifying us was as ingenious
                            as the Resolution itself was courteous. But it put upon me the
                            responsibility of finding a room for our committee to meet in.— Our
                            meeting this morning was short— <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"
                                >Gilmer</persRef> pressed hard for the question on his resolution
                            that the amendment proposed by the Resolves of the Legislature of
                            Massachusetts ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be recommended— I
                            consented to take the question upon my proposed amendment to strike out
                            the word <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, and the vote upon it was 6 to 3.
                            against striking out— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="morse-freeman">Morse</persRef> and myself only voting for
                            it— I then moved to postpone the question on Gilmer’s Resolution to take
                            up my two Resolutions that the chairman be authorised to move the house
                            for instructions to the Committee to ascertain as far as may be
                            practicable the number of the owners of Slaves and the value of the
                            property in Slaves— The postponement was carried— Gilmer opposed my
                            first resolution on the ground that the Committee, had already by their
                            Commission from the house authority to obtain the information, desired
                            by my Resolution—whereupon I modified my resolution into a motion that
                            the Committee authorise the chairman to obtain this information, which
                            suited Gilmer palate no better than the other proposition— But noon
                            arrived and the Committee adjourned to Thursday morning ten O’Clock— In
                            the house <persRef ref="summers-george">George W Summers</persRef> took
                            his seat— The first half hour was eliminated as usual, by disorderly
                            motions for preference in business among which was one of <persRef
                                ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> which I could not
                            prevail on myself to oppose, but which after all he could not carry; and
                            then the whole hour was consumed in chicanery to stave off the
                            discussion of the report on the rules— Dilatory motion after motion
                            wasted time till a motion was made to lay the whole subject on the
                            table—rejected by yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>But the hour was gone. The
                            house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union

                        <p>In the National Intelligencer of this morning there was a notice that
                                <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge William Cranch</persRef> my
                            first cousin, the intimate friend of my childhood and youth, now for
                            more than forty years a judge and chief Justice of the United States
                            Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, one of the best of the race
                            of man was by severe illness unable to attend his court, now in Session—
                            At the door of the Patriotic Bank I met his Son <persRef
                                ref="cranch-william2">William</persRef> and enquired how he was. He
                            answered in deep dejection that he was very low with a pleurisy fever of
                            which they feared the issue— I asked if I should call at his house, I
                            could see him He answered with some hesitation that he believed I could—
                            I went immediately to his house where I found his Son <persRef
                                ref="cranch-john">John</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="greenleaf-william">William C. Greenleaf</persRef>— William
                            Cranch came in while I was there— They thought it best I should not see
                            him, as he was in a wandering state of mind, had been much agitated by a
                            visit from <persRef ref="bulfinch-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef>, and his two physicians, <persRef

                                ref="may-john2">May</persRef>—had recently left him, and directed
                            that he should be kept as quiet as possible— I concluded to call again
                            to morrow, and went over immediately to the Capitol, and having at the
                            Patriotic Bank, entered as Executor of <persRef
                                ref="johnson-thomas-baker">T. B. Johnson</persRef>, a check from
                                <persRef ref="dyer-robert">R W Dyer</persRef> for<space/>and as
                            Administrator of my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> an
                            order on the Hotel company Stock at Frederick Maryland for<space/>and
                            received at the Washington Bank 60 dollars for a quarter’s interest due
                            the first of this Month. In the house the Rules were suspended by a vote
                            of more than two thirds to receive undebatable resolutions and calls on
                            the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, and heads of
                            Departments for information— Upwards of two hours were consumed in this
                            process, which I patiently endured knowing that I could now have but one
                            hour a day for the report on the rules, at any rate— As soon as these
                            crudities were digested I called for the business of the morning hour
                            and the jugglery commenced to choke off the consideration of the report—
                            The motion pending was to postpone the consideration of the report for
                            two weeks, which the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> had
                            decided could be decided by a bare majority of votes. <persRef
                                ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> now moved an amendment;
                            that it should be made the special order of that and every succeeding
                            day till the report should be gone through— The Speaker decided that
                            this amendment would require a vote of two thirds— But <persRef
                                ref="clinton-james">Clinton</persRef> withdrew his motion to

                            remainder of the hour in a speech for the recommitment and instructions—
                            The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union, upon the references of the Presidents message and adjourned about
                            4— Fall of Snow.</p>

                        <p>Going to the Capitol this morning I called at <persRef
                                ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef> house to enquire how
                            he was, and if I could see him; and was told that he was no better than
                            yesterday and was asleep— I met the Committee on the Resolves of the
                            Legislature of Massachusetts in the chamber of the Committee of
                            Manufactures, of which, yesterday I had by negotiation with the <persRef

                                >All the members of the Committee</persRef> were present: but M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Morse was at least an hour tardy— My
                            modified motion that the chairman be instructed to enquire and ascertain
                            as far as may be practicable the number of owners of Slaves in the
                            several States and territories of this Union and in the district of
                            Columbia, was earnestly debated. Gilmer struggling to strangle it by a
                            motion of amendment proposing to request the chairman, and each member
                            of the committee be requested by the<space/>day of<space/>to ascertain and
                            report any information which may be thought pertinent to the subject of
                            enquiry— I agreed to accept this inserting before the general my special
                            subject of enquiry the number of Slave owners and Sample moved to insert
                            those words as an amendment to Gilmer’s amendment, which was carried 5
                            to 4. Davis voting upon this question, with Sample Giddings Morse and
                            me— Gilmer, Burke, Burt and Ingersoll voting against us— The blank was
                            filled with the first of February, Gilmer alone voting against it, and
                            then the resolution as amended was carried by the same vote as my
                            special object of enquiry, the number of Slave owners. My second
                            resolution was then debated— Ingersoll moved to strike out some of the
                            descriptive words, which was carried by his own vote, and then my
                            resolution as amended was carried, Gilmer Burke and Burt only voting in
                            the negative— Gilmer then moved that the journal of the Committee be

                            moved an amendment “with the final reports of the Committee”— My

                            then the resolution as amended was adopted by an unanimous vote— The
                            Committee then adjourned to the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of
                            February at 10 O’Clock. In the house the rules were suspended to receive
                            reports of Committees which would occasion no debate; and under this
                            order <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>, Chairman of the
                            Committee on the District of Columbia, reported a petition from Lockport
                            New-York, for a revision of the Laws of the District of Columbia with
                            the unanimous opinion of that Committee that it came within the
                            gag-rule, and should be returned, to the member who presented it, and he
                            moved the previous question— I thought it was one of the petitions
                            presented by me, and protested against the report of the Committee <pb
                                n="199" type="ms"/>Committee— The petition had been presented by
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings but was in substance the
                            same with several others presented by me— Campbell to suppress all
                            debate, in presenting the report had moved the previous question—
                                <persRef ref="hunt-washington">Hunt</persRef> of New York moved to
                            lay the report and petition on the table; and that the petition be
                            printed— This motion was rejected by yeas and nays, 51 to 118. a vote
                            which shows of what stuff forty of the members who have voted to rescind
                            the rule are made— I attempted to shew the direct falsehood of the
                            report— The Speaker stop’d me, by saying that the previous question had
                            been called and was not debatable. I then moved that the report be laid
                            on the table The Speaker said that motion was not in order, having just
                            been rejected by the house I said the motion was not the same, that
                            having been to lay the report and petition on the table and to print the
                            petition— Mine being to lay the report on the table— He said I might
                            have moved a division of the question— It was now too late— Giddings
                            raised a point of order which after some discussion the Speaker
                            dismissed it by saying— The chair overrides the point of order—the
                            previous question was carried, 83 to 36 and the report was adopted, by
                            yeas and nays 118 to 60— The whole transaction was a signal example of
                            the tyranny of the rule; and of the instability of popular assemblies,
                            affected by sudden impulses, and cramped in the freedom of speech—
                            Immediately after this exploit the report on the rules was taken up with

                            was arrested in the midst of a sentence by the expiration of the morning
                            hour, and the call for the orders of the day— Both these Speakers were
                            under deep agitation. Rhett, eloquent pathetic and full of absurdities
                            Bidlack, swelling with emotions, which he had neither compass of mind
                            nor fluency of language to express and groaning between the upper and
                            nether millstone of servility to the South and terror of his
                            constituents. The house then went into Committee of the whole on the

                        <p>As I went this morning to the capitol I stop’d at the house of <persRef
                                ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch</persRef> and enquired of his
                            condition— His Son <persRef ref="cranch-john">John</persRef> came to the
                            door, and said he was yet in a situation very critical, but with rather
                            more favourable symptoms than the two preceding days. Before I left my
                            house this morning <persRef ref="farrar-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Farrar</persRef> a young man from Vermont came to ask of
                            me a certificate of his qualifications for a teacher; on the authority
                            of strong certificates to that effect from <persRef ref="slade-william"

                            about my life and adventures for upwards of an hour. <persRef

                            a land surveyor under Governor Wilson of Ioway— He had a voluminous

                            was about to publish and for which he was soliciting subscriptions. I
                            said that when it should be published I would perhaps take a few copies—
                            At the House among the trashy and intrusive abortions of business that
                            are daily usurping the place of the morning hour, <persRef

                            deficiency in the last years appropriation for the relief and protection
                            of American Seamen— I objected, and said there would be ample time for
                            the passage of this bill, after the expiration of the morning hour— I
                            called for the order of the day—whereupon <persRef

                            of the Union— I asked for the yeas and nays, but they were refused— The
                            house by a vote of more than two thirds went into Committee, <persRef

                            then again called up the report on the rules, and <persRef

                            but as they were now divided he was afraid he must leave them and vote

                        <p>I called twice this day at <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge
                                Cranch’s</persRef> house first on my way to the Capitol, when I was
                            informed that his condition was still extremely critical, but thought by
                            his two physicians, <persRef ref="sewall-thomas">Doctors

                            favourable than it had been for two preceding days— He is now in perfect
                            possession of his mind, but was asleep and I would not disturb him— I
                            saw his son <persRef ref="cranch-christopher">Joseph Pearce</persRef>
                            who with his sister <persRef ref="cranch-elizabeth">M<hi

                            My second call was after the adjournment of the House, when the judge
                            was awake and I saw him— He was weaker than he had been in the morning,
                            in a high fever, and seemed to entertain no hopes of recovery, but was
                            calm and collected, full of gratitude to God for numberless blessings
                            that he has enjoyed, through a long life, and ready to appear in the
                            presence of his maker. He was much affected at seeing me grasped my hand
                            with strong pressure at meeting and parting, and thanked me for the
                            cheering words with which I endeavoured to revive his spirits— At the

                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings</persRef>, claimed as a

                            violent attack, and false charge against him, published in the Globe of

                            set their faces against allowing Giddings to make any explanation— The
                                <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> decided that it was not
                            a privileged question; which made it necessary for a two thirds vote to
                            enable Giddings to defend his character against a cowardly assassin in a
                            Newspaper published by the Printers of the House— <persRef
                                ref="schenck-robert">Schenk</persRef> moved a suspension of the
                            rules for that purpose— The vote was 92 to 57. and the affirmative not
                            carrying two thirds, Giddings was deprived of the freedom of Speech in
                            self defence before the house— It was curious to hear several of the
                            subterraneans vote against his having leave to explain and when they
                            found the vote in his favour, change their votes to have the appearance
                            on the record of having voted to hear him— <persRef

                        <p>I attended public worship this morning, in the Hall of the house of
                            Representatives, with my nephew <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull
                                Adams</persRef>, and my granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"

                                <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef> house and
                            they went in, to make enquiry of his state.— He was better, but still in
                            imminent danger. The preacher at the Capitol was the <persRef
                                ref="denison-charles">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Charles W.
                                Denison</persRef>, Chaplain of the Boston Bethel Union, and Editor
                            of the Sheet Anchor, and his discourse was on the moral improvement of
                            Seamen— He took for his text, if, he said any text was necessary, Isaiah
                            60.5.—the latter part of the verse—[“]because the abundance of the sea
                            shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the gentiles shall come unto
                            thee.” The style of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Denison’s oratory is
                            colloquial, fluent and lively— The burden of his discourse was the
                            importance of the Seamen as a distinct class of men, in human Society—
                            He spoke of their influence upon the happiness and the morals of the
                            rest of mankind—of the dangers and hardships incidental to their
                            profession—of the generosity which is their peculiar and characteristic
                            virtue—of the reckless profusion which is their besetting sin; and of
                            the looseness of their moral principle which admonish those whose charge
                            it is to teach the lessons of virtue to their fellow creatures, to use
                            their utmost exertions to train them in the paths of virtue, and rally
                            them to the standard of religion.— He told several familiar anecdotes
                            pathetic and amusing, illustrative of the manners, and habits and
                            propensities of Sailors, and named several distinguished men who have
                            risen to honour and renown from the station of common sailors, among
                            whom was <persRef ref="dana-richard2">Richard H. Dana</persRef>, the
                            author of two years before the mast. He spoke much of himself as the son
                            of a <persRef ref="u">professional mariner</persRef>, and of a family
                            chiefly of Seamen; and familiar with the manners, usages, opinions and
                            sentiments congenial to the lives and fortunes of seafaring men— After
                            the service was over, <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley</persRef> the chaplain came

                            was to prevail upon the Government to take for the use of the Navy-Yards
                            a large subscription to a Sailor’s Newspaper of which he is the Editor;
                            called the Sheet-Anchor. Philanthropy ending as usual in a job— I had a

                        <p>On my way to the Capitol this morning I stop’d at <persRef
                                ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef> house, and was
                            informed by his son <persRef ref="cranch-john">John</persRef> that he
                            was so much better that they had now warm hopes of his recovery— In the
                            house <persRef ref="relfe-james">James H. Relfe</persRef> of Missouri,
                            moved to suspend the rules, for a motion to discharge the Committee of
                            the whole from the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> resolution offered
                            by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, for parceling out to
                            Committees the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message;
                            at 3. O’Clock this afternoon— Ten of Wise’s Resolutions had been adopted
                            in as many minutes in Committee, but had not been reported to the house.
                            The 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> opened the wide field of
                            controversy on the question of internal improvements and has been
                            debated now for nearly a month without seeming to approach a
                            termination— Last Friday an attempt was made to take it out of Committee
                            by the gag-process which failed. I then proposed that when the house
                            should next take up in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union
                            the partition message, they should report to the house in part the
                            resolutions which they have adopted leaving the rest to be further
                            discussed in Committee— This was accordingly done, and on Saturday the
                            first ten of Wise’s Resolutions were reported to the house— Relfe
                            however was impatient to dispose of the 11<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> the apple of discord—the internal improvement of the
                            Western waters and the Mississippi— Hence his motion to suspend the
                            rules but it failed by Tellers 71 to 60— Next came a motion by <persRef
                                ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> to reconsider a resolution
                            offered by Patterson to riddle all the pigeon holes of the general
                            Post-Office for information—to reduce the rates of Postage, and to
                            abolish the franking privilege— This is a notion which has recently
                            taken possession of the brains of the Northern Postage payers, and they
                            are clamorous for reduction of the rates, and for the abolition of the
                            franking privilege— In the debate of this day, the most important
                            question of the concern was not touched at-all— The subject was
                            postponed till to morrow— The states, were called through for
                            Resolutions, and was prolific of yankee notions— I offered a call on the
                            President for the correspondence with the government of Texas,
                            concerning the complaint of <persRef ref="houston-samuel">President
                                Houston</persRef>, that our troops had broken up their <persRef

                            Objection was made to my Resolution, and it lies over. <persRef
                                ref="black-edward">E. J. Black</persRef> gave notice that when the
                            bill for organizing the Oregon territory shall come up, he will move an
                            additional section for the provisional annexation of Texas to the United
                            States— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> introduced a
                            bill to repeal the duties on Salt and the fishing bounties, and moved a
                            reconsideration of a resolution looking to an appropriation for removing
                            snags from the Mississippi river.</p>

                            whose person I did not recollect. At the house, there was a remarkable
                            developement of a new phasis in the conflict of internal improvement—
                            The day before yesterday came the intelligence from S<hi

                            called the Shepherdess from New-Orleans struck a snag within 3 miles of
                                S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis, and sunk instantly with the
                            loss of from 40 to 100 lives— <persRef ref="thomasson-william"
                                >Thomasson</persRef> of Kentucky, yesterday took advantage of this
                            incident to move an instruction to the Committee of Ways and Means, to
                            report a Bill making an appropriation for removing obstructions in the
                            Mississippi and its tributary rivers— Thomasson made a pathetic speech
                            about the disaster of the shepherdess, and his resolution passed without
                            opposition, but <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>
                            afterwards moved a reconsideration of it, and brought up again the same
                            interminable dispute about the constitutional power of Congress, which
                            has been already drained to the dregs in Committee of the whole on the
                                <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> message— <persRef

                            resolution of instructions, not to the committee of Ways and Means, but
                            to the Committee of Roads and Canals— Stewart plunged into the Tariff
                            and the Presidential election question and charged <persRef

                            improvements beyond the powers of Congress.— Stewart worried out his

                            spend money for the improvement of the Mississippi, but of no other
                            river. His authority was the Ordinance for the Northwestern

                        <p>My Catarrhal cough has returned upon with fresh severity.— I went to bed
                            at Midnight and soon after three this morning was roused by a fit of
                            coughing, for relief from which I was obliged to leave my bed for a few
                            minutes, after which I returned to it, and broken sleep till six— I sent
                            for <persRef ref="thomas-john7">Doctor Thomas</persRef>; stated my case
                            and asked his advice— He prescribed 3 pills a day—Morning Noon and
                            Night. I went to the Capitol this morning at 11; and borrowed from the
                            Law Library, the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> volume of <persRef

                            appropriation, and called for the previous question, which was carried,

                        <p>Immediately after the reading of the Journal we had in the house one of
                            those amiable exhibitions of good nature which the chattel
                            representation are so much in the habit of displaying— The Colonization
                            Society had obtained the use of the hall, and had held a meeting there
                            last Tuesday evening. Not having finished their business then they
                            adjourned their meeting to this evening; but the Speaker was scrupulous
                            about the exercise of his power to dispose of the Hall, and insisted
                            that Society must again obtain the use of the Hall, by vote of the
                            house— Before there was a Quorum formed, <persRef ref="irvin-james"
                                >Irvin</persRef> of Pennsylvania, moved that the Society should have
                            the use of the Hall— <persRef ref="black-edward">Edward J.
                                Black</persRef> of Georgia objected, saying that he regarded them
                            all as abolitionists— Irvin explained and moved a suspension of the
                            rules to enable him to offer the Resolution— The question was first
                            taken by rising 76 in favour of suspending the rule—less than 20 against
                            it, but no quorum voting— Black persisted in his purpose— A call of the
                            house was moved and refused—a call of the yeas and nays was made and
                            refused. At last a member moved to adjourn, and called the yeas and
                            nays— This brought the house to— On the motion to adjourn the vote was 1
                            to 158. Then on the motion to suspend the rules the vote by yeas and
                            nays was 127 to 47. and the Resolution was adopted without an adverse
                            voice— A full hour was consumed in this miserable chicanery by Black and
                            it is a sample of his daily manifestations of temper— There was some
                            discussion of a resolution offered by <persRef ref="patterson-thomas2"
                                >Patterson</persRef>, from Rochester, New-York, of enquiry upon the
                                <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Postmaster general</persRef>
                            concerning the abuses of the franking privilege, the reconsideration of
                            which had been moved— It was finally laid ov<unclear>er</unclear> for debate— There are
                            many memorials and petitions calling for a reduction of the rates of
                            postage, and the abolition or restriction of the franking privilege, but
                            it is apparent that neither the Postmaster general nor the Chairman of
                            the Committee intend to make any change— An hour of debate was allowed
                            upon the report on the rules, occupied by <persRef ref="cobb-howell"
                                >Cobb</persRef> of Georgia to finish his speech and by <persRef
                                ref="hudson-charles">Charles Hudson</persRef> to commence his— Then
                            Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef

                            came in, after the Committee had adjourned— Absent <persRef

                            waiting for a quorum Winthrop read a long memorial from <persRef

                            and Justice of an international copy-right Law. Black came in a little
                            before 11. stayed but a few minutes and said he wanted to make a Report
                            against the Bill— The Committee adjourned to this day fortnight, the
                                2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February—after agreeing that
                            Winthrop should report a Resolution to print Capen’s Memorial and five
                            or six additional Sections which Ingersoll proposes as amendments to his
                            bill— In the house <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef> Chairman
                            of the Committee of Claims moved a suspension of the rules for the
                            reception of reports from Committees such as would give rise to no
                            debate which was carried against my remonstrance, and several reports
                            were received, among which was that of R. C. Winthrop for printing Nahum
                            Capen’s Memorial which was adopted. I enquired of <persRef
                                ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> chairman of the Committee on
                            Post-Offices and Post-roads, whether that Committee would report a Bill
                            to reduce the rates of Postage, and if so when it might be expected. He
                            answered that the Committee had taken the subject into consideration,
                            but had come to no conclusion, concerning it: nor did he know when they
                            would report but probably in the course of a few weeks— The debate on
                                <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole’s</persRef> motion to
                            recommit, the report on the rules and Black’s amendment to instruct the

                            resumed, and <persRef ref="hudson-charles">Hudson</persRef> finished his

                        <p>Nearly three hours of my time extinguished by sleep refreshing to the
                            time worn, care worn, diseased and exhausted body, but at the expense of
                            the active energies of the Soul— I am pressed with the task of preparing
                            the minority report for the Committee on the Resolves of the
                            Massachusetts Legislature so that I find it almost impossible to keep up
                            this Diary with the current of Time— I had hoped this morning for some
                            leisure to make progress in this work, but I had only time for a call at
                            the Bank of the Metropolis for my book, which I had left there to be
                            balanced, when the hour summoned me to the house— <persRef
                                ref="hughes-james2">Hughes</persRef> of Missouri offered a
                            Resolution to instruct the Committee on the Territories to enquire into
                            the expediency of reporting as soon as possible a joint resolution
                            requesting the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to give
                            notice to the British Government that after 12 months the Government of
                            the United States will annul and abrogate the Convention of 6 September
                            1827. <persRef ref="williams-henry4">Williams</persRef> objected to this
                            resolution that there was already one of the same import referred to the
                            Committee of foreign affairs— The yeas and nays were called and refused
                            on the motion to suspend the rules; but the resolution was rejected—
                                <persRef ref="wentworth-john2">Wentworth</persRef> of Illinois
                            presented a Memorial against the annexation of Texas to the United

                            there was any danger that England should get Texas; they were willing
                            the United States should have it in preference— <persRef

                            President’s Message. I remonstrated against this claiming the morning
                            hour for the discussion of the report on the rules; but in vain— The
                            majority of the house are playing a game of fast and loose with me on
                            this subject, and desert me whenever any opportunity is afforded them so
                            to do— They went into Committee of the whole, <persRef

                            about the western waters, and in struggles to refuse <persRef

                            scandalous and insolent attacks of <persRef ref="weller-john"

                            used to deprive him of this privilege; and when granted he replied under
                            continual interruptions and calls to order, from the majority and
                            repeated insults and defiances to fight from <persRef

                            the Smithsonian bequest, to a select Committee was amended by <persRef

                        <p>Light snow, all the morning. I attended public worship at the Capitol,
                            where the <persRef ref="edwards-justin">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >d.</hi> Justin Edwards</persRef> said to be from Boston
                            preached a discourse upon the sanctity of the Sabbath, from Mark 2.27.
                            “The Sabbath was made for man.”— This question about keeping the Sabbath
                            holy, as a day of rest is one of the numerous religious and political
                            excitements which keep the free people of this union in perpetual
                            agitation.— They seem to be generated by the condition of the country—in
                            a state of profound peace— There are in this country as in all others a
                            certain proportion of restless and turbulent spirits, poor, unoccupied,
                            ambitious, who must always have something to quarrel about with their
                            neighbours— These people are the authors of religious revivals— They
                            formed in the days of <persRef ref="washington-george"
                                >Washington’s</persRef> administration the germ of the Jacobin
                            clubs— During the last War with Great Britain, they generated the
                            Washington benevolent Societies and Peace Societies. In later times,
                            they have bred the Masonic and anti-masonic Societies the Temperance
                            Societies, the, Colonization, abolition and anti-Slavery Societies, and
                            they are now beating the drum and blowing the trumpet for a holy Sabbath
                            Society— A numerous Convention is already advertised to promote the
                            cause, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards has come to preach for
                            it in the Representative Hall— After announcing his text he said that
                            the word Sabbath meant <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, and that it was one
                            of the ten commandments written by the finger of God upon stone, as Laws
                            for all men, that after every six days of labour there should be one day
                            of rest.— He dwelt exclusively upon the commandment, which he said was a
                            law of nature for man and for beast who could perform more labour enjoy
                            more health and live longer upon six days of labour, and one of rest
                            than upon seven successive days of labour— His illustrations were
                            numerous and his zeal intense and evidently sincere; but he took no
                            notice of the exposition of the true meaning of the commandment when his
                            own disciples were charged with the violation of it— <persRef

                            and gave out and sung the hymn— After the service I returned the visit

                            record, and yet make progress in my report to be ready before the first
                            of February, I was this day belated half an hour in my attendance at the
                            house— I found it in Session— It was the day for the reception of
                            petitions, and the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> who had
                            begun with the Territory of Ioway had already reached the State of Ohio

                                >Garret Davis</persRef> had promised a minority report— <persRef

                                >Giddings</persRef> presented several anti-slavery and
                            abolition-petitions; among the rest one from 381 citizens of Hampshire
                            County, Massachusetts, praying Congress by law to prohibit the officers
                            of the United States from assisting to arrest persons suspected of being
                            fugitives from Slavery There was much fluttering among the Slavers The
                            Speaker decided that this petition was not within the 25<hi

                            the yeas and nays— <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Saunders</persRef>
                            attempted to raise the question of reception, but the Speaker said it
                            was too late— <persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jameson</persRef> enquired if
                            laying the appeal on the table would carry the petition with it— The

                            there was just such a petition referred to the Committee on the

                            to lay that on the table— This is the wooden nutmeg form of rejecting a
                            petition, without refusing to receive it— The question to lay on the
                            table was lost 85 to 87 and then the question to receive was lost 85 to
                            86. In the interval between the two takings of yeas and nays Freedom
                            lost two votes Slavery gained one, and the majority was changed—

                        <p>I had received last evening a note from <persRef ref="goodloe-daniel"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel R Goodloe</persRef> of
                            North-Carolina requesting an interview with me for which I appointed ten
                            O’Clock this morning. He came accordingly with a manuscript of 26 folio
                            pages, of which he said he was the author which he was desirous of
                            publishing in a pamphlet; and of which he wished me to give my opinion.—
                            He pointed out to me a page or two, which I read, and which contained
                            the essence of his Essay, and left the manuscript with me, to call again
                            to morrow— I promised to read the manuscript in the interval, and to
                            give him my opinion of the expediency of publishing it— A <persRef
                                ref="hannahshusband">poor Negro</persRef> came in a state almost of
                            distraction, to implore me to save <persRef ref="hannah">his
                                wife</persRef> from being sold away. I asked him how I could do
                            that? He said by purchasing her myself; for 400 dollars— I told him that
                            was impossible. The poor fellow went away in despair— Two Young men, one
                            named <persRef ref="mcrae-charles">M’Rae</persRef>, and the other
                                <persRef ref="hamilton-archibald3">Hamilton</persRef>, came with a
                            Letter of introduction from <persRef ref="palfrey-john">John G.
                                Palfrey</persRef>, now Secretary of the Commonwealth of
                            Massachusetts. The Letter is dated at Cambridge, and they were students
                            at the Law School there— Immediately after the reading of the journal,
                                <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>
                            chairman of the Committee of foreign affairs instantly moved a
                            suspension of the Rules to receive Reports from Committees— <persRef
                                ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> suggested to him to
                            confine his motion to one hour, to which he readily assented— Their
                            object was to supersede the debate on the rules and smuggle it out of
                            the way. I knew it would be in vain to oppose the movement directly and
                            the suspension was carried without opposition— <persRef
                                ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of
                            Commerce asked from that Committee, leave to employ a Clerk— Half an
                            hour of piddling debate and the motion laid on the table. C. J.
                            Ingersoll reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs against a
                            Resolution offered by <persRef ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale
                                Owen</persRef>, and referred to that Committee—to request the
                                <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to give 12 months
                            notice to the British Government that we will abrogate the agreement of
                            mutual occupation of the Oregon territory— The report of the Committee
                            is that it is inexpedient for Congress to take any action whatever upon
                            the subject at present— No sooner was the Resolution of the Committee
                            read than Owen came out with a set speech against it, and as the hour
                            drew to a close when he moved a second suspension of the rules to go
                            into Committee of the whole on the Union, for him to continue his
                            speech—this barely failed for want of two thirds 111 to 63. I called the
                            order of the morning hour— <persRef ref="saunders-romulus"
                                >Saunders</persRef> finished and <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"

                            entertained. And I candidly made to him some remarks on what I thought

                            expired. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Campbell of

                                Goodloe</persRef> came again this morning and had further
                            conversation with me concerning the publication of his manuscript. He
                            had yesterday written me a note requesting to see me again on the
                            subject, and brought with him this morning a couple of pages, which he
                            thought would supply the deficiency which I thought necessary to
                            complete his Essay.— I thought there was still something wanting, but
                            that his work was ingenious; his views in some respects new to me, and
                            well worthy of publication— <persRef ref="brown-thomas2">Brown</persRef>
                            the poor man for whom at the last Session I had procured the passage of
                            a bill in the house, which failed in the Senate, came with a copy of the
                            Bill, and of the Report of the Committee of the house in his favour,
                            came to request that I would call it up again in the house, which I
                            promised to do—and did— On my way to the house I stop’d at the Patriotic
                            Bank, and found that my draft on the Frederic Hotel Stock had been paid,
                            and was credited, with a small charge at Frederic for collection to me
                            as Executor of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Thomas B.
                                Johnson\</persRef>, at the Patriotic Bank— As I do owe a credit to
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s estate, I left it thus
                            charged though received as administrator to my son <persRef
                                key="adams-john2">John</persRef>, whose Estate is indebted to me. At
                            the house immediately after the reading of the journal, I called for the
                            order of the day— But <persRef ref="elmer-lucius">Lucius Quintius
                                Cincinnatus Elmer</persRef> accidental chairman of the Committee of
                            Elections, presented a report on the contested election of <persRef

                                ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef>, closing with a Resolution
                            declaring Gilmer duly-elected.— He moved that the report should be
                            referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and
                            printed— And he moved that the Memorials presented to the Committee on
                            their first meeting by both parties should be printed— Goggin is said to
                            be sick at home— His friend <persRef ref="newton-willoughby">Willoughby
                                Newton</persRef> objected to the printing of his memorial because it
                            rested on a state of facts which Goggin had reason to believe true, but
                            disproved by subsequent evidence. The motive for printing it now, being
                            to prejudice the public mind against Goggin at home—in his own district.
                            This gave rise to an acrimonious debate of 3 hours, the result of which
                            was by yeas and nays to order the printing of both memorials, and also
                            of the testimony. <persRef ref="schenck-robert">Schenk</persRef>
                            obtained leave to make a minority report on the same case— I then
                            struggled to get up the report on the rules, But the house refused to
                            take them or any thing else up and adjourned— <persRef

                            dollars, of unclaimed dividends on United States stocks, standing on the
                            books in the Office of Register of the Treasury, standing in the name of

                            deceased, but who had been the last survivor of the assignees of Lane

                                ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef> was involved and
                            whose assignment was by then finally assigned to Ward N. Boylston—
                            Alfred Latham referred Charles D. Lewis to Petty Vaughan who
                            consequently sent this power to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis
                            and me, and agreed if we should recover the sum of 979 dollars, M<hi

                            prize—he had demanded 25 per cent— I went immediately to the Register’s
                            Office with the power from Petty Vaughan—the entry on the books was
                            immediately found and I received a check on the Bank of the Metropolis,
                            for 979 dollars 78 cents— They retained at the Office the power from P.
                            Vaughan. These transactions furnish a theme upon which I would gladly
                            comment, but I must go ahead— In the house <persRef

                            whole day’s debate, by calling on the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
                                >Speaker</persRef> to turn out of the house <persRef
                                ref="sergeant-nathan2">Nathan Sargent</persRef>, Reporter for the
                            United States Gazette of Philadelphia under the signature of Oliver
                            Oldschool, for what he charged to be a false report, but which was an
                            exactly true report of the scene in the house last Tuesday—when he asked
                            the question whether I was the author of the Massachusetts Resolutions
                            of last Winter against the Slave Representation, and without answering
                            him I turned away and called for the yeas and nays.— Ingersoll made no
                            motion, and there was no question before the house—and when called on to
                            specify the part of the report which he charged with falsehood—he said,
                            the whole— I declared to the house that the motive imputed to me by the
                            reporter for not answering the question was true—that I did consider the
                            question as a piece of impertinence, and therefore did not answer it—
                            After three hours of debate, without any question before the house, and
                            numerous struggles to get rid of it, baffled by the joint partiality and
                            imbecility of the Speaker, it was at last disposed of by a large vote of
                            indefinite postponement. I then called up the report on the rules; but
                            the house would not second me. It was postponed till to-morrow—and the
                            house adjourned. <persRef ref="king-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            upon his character, in which, afterwards <persRef ref="wise-henry"

                            edging him on, had knocked down beaten and wounded another Reporter and
                            Letter writer, named <persRef ref="u">Shriver</persRef>, for a Report in
                            the Baltimore Patriot of Weller’s infamous treatment of <persRef
                                ref="stewart-andrew">Stewart</persRef> last week— And some days
                            before, <persRef ref="jones-john9">Jones</persRef> the Speaker had
                            displaced <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Leavitt</persRef> from the place assigned to him. The simple truth
                            is that the ruffians of the house cannot bear the exposure of their
                            villainies by the press, and they combine with the Speaker to silence or
                            smother its voice.— In the midst of the Babel talk of Charles J.
                            Ingersoll yesterday <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>
                            offered a new rule, that no Reporters shall be admitted within the Hall,
                            except those for the city papers— That was not in order, but he gave
                            notice that he would offer it this day, which he did— <persRef
                                ref="black-edward">Edward J. Black</persRef> of Georgia, moved as an
                            amendment a rule for the appointment of Reporters to be Officers of the
                            house; and prescribing in ridiculous detail what they shall report— The
                            Speaker did not favour either Cave Johnson’s or Black’s resolution; the
                            object of both of them being to strangle the freedom of debate in the
                            house and of the press out of it— Wise presented his minority report
                            from the Committee on the Rules—signed he said by two members—(himself
                            and <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef>—) The report was
                            ordered to be printed— Charles J. Ingersoll wanted to say something
                            about this minority report, but was not permitted. The report on the
                            rules was taken up; <persRef ref="wright-joseph">Joseph A.

                            support of it.— The house went into Committee of the whole on private
                            bills, and passed one into the house; besides debating nearly an hour
                            whether certain bills on that calendar were private or public bills.
                            Then followed a long debate on a bill, reported by <persRef

                            Snowy day—</p>
                        <p>After the plenteous, indulgence of gastronomy of yesterday’s dinner, and
                            the liberal disposal of the evening at the amateur charity concert, I
                            rose this morning with the Sun, less troubled with my cough, more
                            refreshed and more vigorous than I have been for many days. S<hi

                            months undergoing repairs was this day first reopened for public
                            worship, and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                John Adams</persRef>, with her daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
                                >Mary Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H.
                                Adams</persRef> attended the morning service there— I rode to the
                            Hall of the house of Representatives, and there heard <persRef
                                ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley</persRef>
                            the Chaplain of the house, preach from Romans 10.10. “For with the
                            heart, man believeth unto righteousness: and with the mouth, confession
                            is made unto salvation”— He said he should confine his remarks to the
                            first clause of the verse, and his discourse would be on Faith— The text
                            was extremely well selected— The idea that Faith commences in the heart
                            and terminates in righteousness presents a new view of the subject,
                            prolific of illustration— If I can ever find the time I will write a
                            second Lecture on Faith—in elucidation of this view— That Faith is
                            always an impulse of the heart, and that its tendency is always to a
                            virtuous conclusion— Apply the principle to belief in the existence of
                            God—to the immortality of the Soul, and to the doctrines of
                            Christianity— All this tends to righteousness— But apply it to the
                            divinity of Jesus Christ, to the Trinity; to transubstantiation to the
                            doctrine of an infallible head to the church—in all this there is no
                            tendency to righteousness— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley did
                            not take this view of his text— His sermon was very short and
                            superficial rather telling his auditory what Faith is not, than what it
                            is— He said that mere belief in Christ, and even in his religion was not
                            Faith—for the devils believe and tremble &amp;c— The hall was very thin,
                            and there was a light snow, which continued through the day and cleared
                            off in the evening— After dinner, I attended at the Presbyterian Church,
                            where <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Knox</persRef> preached, I believe from Romans 13.11 “And that,
                            knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep”— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox is earnest and impressive— He gave
                            notice that the communion would be administered next Sunday in the
                            afternoon— <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            my fingers, so as to disable them for writing, without extreme
                            difficulty— Time still sweeps along— How shall my record keep pace with
                            him?</p>

                        <p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilchrist</persRef> came
                            to make enquiries about the claims and the bequests and the deeds of
                            land by <persRef ref="stokes-john">John Stokes</persRef>, and his
                            collateral kindred with which I have been so often, and so uselessly
                            conversant for the last ten or twelve years, and I gave him all the
                            information upon the subject which my Memory could furnish— It appears
                            that one of the Stokes’s has undertaken to give conveyances of the land,
                            for which he has received equivalents, and the validity of which is
                            under investigation— <persRef ref="brown-thomas2">Brown</persRef> the
                            claimant of military bounty land was also here, and I told him that his

                            Session were before the Committee of invalid pensions— At the house, the

                            and ending with Maine— One of the first was by <persRef

                        <p>I am yet cramped by the continuance of the cold, somewhat abated by the
                            ascent of the thermometer to the temperature of snow— Between the
                            preparation of my report on the Massachusetts Resolves, and keeping time
                            with my daily record the labour is more than Herculean, and my
                            correspondence is almost entirely suspended— Five days in the week the
                            Report of the Committee on the rules is the first business in order to
                            be transacted in the house; and if I were to be absent one day when it
                            would be called up, it would be laid upon the table without redemption—
                            When I call it up scarce a day passes but some dirty trick is devised to
                            postpone the taking of the question— This day <persRef

                            subject till to-morrow, against which I remonstrated in vain— I hear it
                            said that they intend to keep off the question upon the rules till after
                            my report upon the Resolves of the Massachusetts Legislature— This
                            policy is a hint for the modification of mine.— The house went into
                            committee of the whole on the state of the Union <persRef
                                ref="campbell-john7">John Campbell</persRef> in the chair, upon the
                            bill reported by <persRef ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef>
                            from the Naval Committee, authorising the <persRef ref="henshaw-david"
                                >Secretary of the Navy</persRef> to transfer 200000 dollars from one
                            head of specific appropriation to another— Say from pay to repairs of
                            ships.— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> led off an
                            opposition to the bill, seconded by <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
                                >Hopkins</persRef>, and then by <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
                                >Barnard</persRef>— An Amendment, and an amendment to the amendment
                            were moved; till it called up <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>,
                            in aid of Parmenter— Wise delivered a dissertation upon the usefulness
                            and glory of the navy; with a general panegyric upon its officers, and
                            especially upon the midshipmen and passed midshipmen, all of whom he
                            pronounced fully qualified to be Admirals. All which was mere whip’d
                            syllabub— The amendment, and amendment to the amendment were both
                            rejected, and the bill was reported to the house, when it was ordered to
                            be engrossed—the question upon its passage came up; and a motion to
                            adjourn prevailed— I had a long evening visit from <persRef

                        <p>The cold continues, and with it my difficulties to keep pace in writing
                            with time— I brought up my diary, but fall into arrears with my report
                            on the Massachusetts Resolves—the subject as usual widening as I
                            proceed. <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
                                Connell</persRef> was here this morning to request once more my aid
                            to get through the bill for the relief of the <persRef
                                ref="blight-julia;crary-cornelia;ludlow-mary">heirs</persRef> of
                                <persRef ref="fulton-robert">Robert Fulton</persRef>—a desperate
                            concern. <persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lewis Johnson</persRef> came, and I returned to him the three
                            receipts of <persRef ref="thaxter-norton">Norton Quincy
                                Thaxter</persRef> for the three checks on the Merchant’s Bank, which
                            I have not yet found time to enclose to him— I hurried up to the Capitol
                            to be there at the meeting of the house— The report on the rules was
                            immediately taken up, and <persRef ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew
                                Johnson</persRef> a new member from Tennessee made an hour speech in
                            support of the gag-rule. and especially abusive upon me. So they all
                            are.— I am compelled not only to endure it with seeming insensibility,
                            but to forbear so far as I can restrain myself from all reply— This man
                            took at once the ground that Congress have no power to abolish Slavery
                            in the District of Columbia, because the Legislatures of Virginia and
                            Maryland had no such power before their cessions of the two parts of the
                            district to the United States— All the arguments of the speech were upon
                            a level with this.— When he finished <persRef ref="mccauslen-william"
                                >William C. M’Causlen</persRef> took the floor—but the hour had
                            expired and there was a call for the orders of the day.— But <persRef
                                ref="burke-edmund4">Edmund Burke</persRef>, moved that the <persRef
                                ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> should be directed to adjourn
                            the house at two O’Clock— There was some objection made and he withdrew
                            his motion— Another member renewed it, and it was adopted without
                            opposition— It was to allow members to attend the obsequies of <persRef
                                ref="reding-rebecca">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Redding</persRef>, wife of <persRef ref="reding-john">John R.
                                Redding</persRef> another of the spurious members from
                            New-Hampshire— I went in to the Library to look into the <persRef
                                ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef> papers. They had only one copy
                            of the work there, and that was in use by <persRef ref="rhett-robert"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhett</persRef>. They borrowed
                            it for me for five minutes, and I found in two of the volumes, the
                            Leaves doubled down ready to my hand; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Rhett could not spare the book, and on my way home I stop’d at <persRef
                                ref="taylor-frank">Taylor’s</persRef> and bought the book. <persRef
                                ref="munro-isaac">Isaac Munro</persRef>, with <persRef
                                ref="proud-john">John G. Proud</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">his
                                Son</persRef>, brought me a gold headed cane, with a flattering
                            Letter from the banner <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>
                            Committee at Baltimore— I was extremely grateful for the Letter and the
                            compliment but declined accepting the cane.</p>
