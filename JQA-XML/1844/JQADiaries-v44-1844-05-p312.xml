                        <p>A copy of the Treaty for the annexation of Texas with all the
                            correspondence communicated with it, printed in confidential secresy for
                            the use of the Senate, by some treachery was conveyed to the table of
                            the Editor of the New-York Evening Post—and they have been all
                            published— Letters from <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>,
                                <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin van Buren</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef>, all
                            concurring in the injustice and impolicy of annexing Texas at this time
                            to the United States have been published within the last five days, and
                            the reading them has consumed so much time, that my diary runs again
                            into arrears, and my head into confusion.— This was the day of the first
                            whig convention at Baltimore to nominate Henry Clay as their candidate
                            for the Office of President of the United States for four years from the
                            fourth of March next, and to agree upon a Candidate for the Office of
                            Vice President— They met accordingly 275 in number from the 26. States,
                            equal to the Constitutional number of the two houses of Congress; and
                            what never has happened in either house of Congress, the whole number
                            from every State was present— <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose
                                Spencer</persRef> of New-York was President, and Henry Clay of
                            Kentucky was unanimously nominated as their Candidate for President. At
                            the fourth time of voting viva voce they fixed upon <persRef

                            called here this evening and gave us this information received from
                            Baltimore by the Telegraph— I stop’d at <persRef ref="haas-philip"
                                >Haas’s</persRef> shop this morning at the request by Letter of

                                Lambden</persRef>, to have a full length Daguerrotype likeness of me
                            taken, to assist M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lambden to finish his
                            Portrait of me— Haas was not ready for me this day, and I promised to
                            call again to-morrow— At the house there was a motion pending to cease
                            debate on the tariff bill and take it out of the Committee of the whole
                            on Wednesday the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— <persRef
                                ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> moved as an amendment to
                            substitute Monday the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> lost by yeas and
                            nays 23 to 101. The resolution was then adopted without a division.—
                            This and the two following days had been assigned for the District
                            business— But <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> chairman
                            of the District Committee is absent from indisposition and by general

                            tariff were substituted instead of the present days. The tariff bill was
                            further debated in Committee of the whole by <persRef

                        <p>I was up once or twice in the course of the Night— There was much
                            commotion in the city of delegates to the ratification Convention this
                            day at Baltimore. I finally rose at four, and soon after five, <persRef

                            to proceed thence on a Western tour to Cincinnati, Louisville, S<hi

                            and western New-York. My son has been with us only four days, and I feel
                            as if it were a final parting— Yet I cherish the hope that we shall meet
                            again within two months at Quincy.— I called at the Office of the
                            National Intelligencer and gave to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi

                                Addicks’s</persRef> newly published French grammar, and requested
                            him in her behalf, to notice it on the Newspaper, which he promised to
                            do. About a month has passed since I received from M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Addicks, a letter, with two copies of her
                            book one as a present to me, and requesting me to deliver the other to
                            the Editors of the Intelligencer, and she desired my opinion upon her
                            book, and a puff from the Intelligencer— I neglected to answer her
                            Letter, till yesterday there came a second Letter of more than female
                            resentment, and reproach— It spurred me on to deliver the copy <unclear>to</unclear> the
                            Editors of the Intelligencer— I stop’d next at <persRef
                                ref="haas-philip">Haas’s</persRef> office, and he took one

                            and beclouded and the light was not propitious, and I promised if it
                            should be better to morrow morning to call again— At the house there was
                            a bare quorum to do business, without failure— <persRef
                                ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> moved a reconsideration of
                            the vote assigning the first three legislative days after closing the
                            debate on the tariff bill, to the business of the District of Columbia—
                            But the debate on the question of reconsideration was postponed— The
                            bill from the Senate for reducing the rates of Postage, limiting and
                            regulating the franking privilege, and for preventing frauds on the Post
                            office was referred to the Committee on Post-Offices and Post roads— The
                            Committees were called for reports— Then, Committee of the whole on the

                            of March next. The nominating convention consisted of 275 members, each
                            State having a number equal to that of her representation in the two
                            houses of Congress The nomination was unanimous, adopted by exclamation
                            and with shouts of unbounded enthusiasm— Yesterday the convention
                            numbered thousands—perhaps tens of thousands, and the ratification was
                            as unanimous and enthusiastic as the nomination. All this day a
                            succession of the delegates from sundry States, visiting Washington
                            before their return home were introduced to me in the house, and about
                            20 of them called on me at my house in the Evening— On my way to the
                            house I stop’d again at <persRef ref="haas-philip">Haas’s</persRef>

                        <p>The stream of visitors, returning delegates from the Baltimore
                            conventions is yet copious and unabated. many of my old acquaintances
                            come to shake hands with me as they pass, and many others ask to be
                            introduced to me for the same purpose. Their names are seldom pronounced
                            by their introducers so that I distinctly hear them, and their names and
                            their persons slip alike from my memory, the moment they part from me.
                            But they consume time, and multiply subjects of excitement tending to
                            distraction— At the same time the Treaty for the annexation of Texas to
                            the United States, with the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
                                >President’s</persRef> message transmitting it to the Senate and the
                            accompanying documents, prematurely published, and the conflicting
                            opinions of the leading men of the Union, disclosed in Letters and
                            speeches at public meetings, all indicate the immediate crisis of a
                            great struggle between Slavery and Freedom throughout the world— I must
                            retire from this contest, or perish under it probably before the close
                            of the present year, or even of the present Session of Congress— The
                            issue is precipitated by its bearing on the approaching Presidential
                            election. It is John Tyler’s last card for a popular whirlwind to carry
                            him through, and he has played it with equal intrepidity and address. He
                            has compelled <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> to stake their last chance

                            forced himself upon the whole democracy as their exclusive candidate for
                            the Presidency next December.— I called this morning at the Bank of the
                            Metropolis, and deposited there <persRef key="adams-charles2">my

                                >Hopkins</persRef> in the chair upon the tariff bill, and <persRef

                            the democracy, howling and bullying at the tariff of duties levied on
                            the planter and farmer to put into the pocket of the manufacturer, and
                            raving at the abominable doctrine of protection <persRef

                            details in support of it— The slack tide of debate then came— No one
                            started for the floor. <persRef ref="seymour-david">David L.

                                >Duncan</persRef> disputed his right and claimed the floor to

                            floor, but he gave it up and withdrew his amendment— Duncan was not
                            ready and moved the Committee to rise. Adjourned after 2. Evening Music

                        <p>I attended public worship alone this morning at the Hall of the house of

                            The hall was crowded and I had some difficulty, in obtaining a seat— The

                            President of Yale College. His text was from Hebrews 11.27—“for he
                            endured, as seeing him who is invisible”— The first part of the verse
                            is—[“]By faith he (<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>) for sook Egypt,
                            not fearing the wrath of the king.”—was not part of the text but after
                            some slight reference of the application of the text to Moses the main
                            discourse was a delineation of the character of the man who <hi
                                rend="italic">endures</hi> as seeing him who is invisible— It was
                            deeply impressively eloquent and solemn. After the close of the service,

                            western New-York, whom I saw last October at Canandaigua one of the most

                            convention— He was going to dine with his representative <persRef

                                ref="carroll-william">his brother’s</persRef>— After dinner at the

                            Dwight, from Matthew 11.28. “Come unto me all ye, that labour and are
                            heavy laden, and I will give you rest—” A sermon more affecting and
                            solemn than that of the morning— The division was first into the
                            invitation—the classes of mankind, to whom the invitation was addressed,
                            and the promise to those who will come, and secondly, the several
                            classes of the labouring and heavy-laden to whom the invitation was
                            addressed—the heavy laden with cares—with sorrows—with sin—each of these
                            furnished varieties of specification deeply pathetic—cares for personal
                            wants—for support of families; for the well being, health, conduct and
                            good name of children— Sorrows—all the ills that flesh is heir to—
                            Disease of body and of mind—reverses of fortune— Loss of children and of
                            friends. Sins—the grievous burden of a wounded conscience— Loss of
                            reputation—open transgression, and the reproach of the world— Come unto
                                <hi rend="italic">me</hi> says the blessed Jesus, to all these
                            sufferers, and I will give you rest.— How tender—how affectionate! how
                            altogether lovely!— And will you not accept this invitation?— This was
                            the final appeal—urged with prevailing power. To me it was emphatic
                            warning—would that its effects could have been permanent upon my Soul.—
                            The heart was edified by the exhortations of these discourses—but the
                            conduct remains unchanged— <persRef ref="child-david">David Lee

                        <p>Last Saturday the report signed— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.
                                Calhoun</persRef> Secretary of State was received by the house, upon
                            the Resolution adopted at my motion on the 26<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> of February last, enquiring whether any gross errors have
                            been discovered in the census, as corrected at the Department of State
                            in 1841—<unclear>. . .</unclear>— The report, is at once insulting to the house, evasive
                            of the enquiry and false by equivocation— The journal of the house this
                            morning referring to the report declared that it stated that no gross
                            errors had been discovered— I moved to strike out those words from the
                            journal, for the report does not deny the existence of the errors but
                            taking advantage of a blunder in the copy of the Resolution sent to the
                            Department substituting 1843 for 1841. to evade a direct answer to the
                            Resolution affecting to deny the existence of a census corrected in
                            1843. and that after the correction of 1841 there has been no
                            re-examination of the census and no material errors discovered— My
                            motion started a debate very soon arrested by a motion from <persRef
                                ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> for the previous question; and
                            with great difficulties obtained the yeas and nays which were 32 and
                            126— I then moved a suspension of the rules to refer to a select
                            committee the report from the Secretary of State, with instructions to
                            enquire into the fact of the errors of the Census, and report thereon to
                            the house— The <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> said there
                            was already a motion to suspend the rules, which was made by <persRef
                                ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> to go into the Committee of the
                            whole on the state of the Union to take up the Tariff Bill— But <persRef
                                ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M. Saunders</persRef>, claimed a
                            privileged right to report in part from the select Committee on the fray
                            between <persRef ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="rathbun-george">George Rathbun</persRef>. He said that it would
                            occasion no debate, but he counted without his host. As to the quarrel
                            between White and Rathbun they reported only the testimony of 34
                            witnesses— No resolution.— As to the case of <persRef

                            pistol, and wounded <persRef ref="wirt-john">Wirt</persRef> the
                            policeman The committee had no doubt of the power of the house to punish
                            him for the contempt, but they thought it most expedient to turn him
                            over to the judicial tribunals, and reported a resolution to that
                            effect, which was adopted. As to the third charge upon the Committee to
                            report a Bill or Resolution for punishing or repressing disorders in the
                            house for the future, they were not ready to report as yet—and he moved
                            to lay the report and testimony on the table and print; and he moved the
                            previous question— The report was however not satisfactory to M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> White moved to recommit the report, which
                            raised a rancorous debate of four hours, after which the debate was
                            postboned to next Thursday week, and the report and testimony to be
                            printed— Then at 4 Committee of the whole Union, <persRef

                            speech and moved the Committee to rise and the house adjourned— Evening

                            Committee this day; but the Speaker’s decision was sustained— The
                            skirmishing continued till near half past 12. and <persRef

                            fragment of an hour for his solemn stupefactions— At one, the voting on
                            the amendments commenced and continued three long hours, most of the
                            amendments offered being rejected, but some of them adopted— At last the
                            Committee rose and reported the Bill, and <persRef ref="mckay-james"

                            the floor.— Barnard said he wanted to prove that this was not a revenue
                            Bill, and would not yield the amount of revenue indispensable for the
                            Government and there was much negotiation against a previous question
                            before Saturday afternoon but no pledge obtained— In the midst of the
                            parley an adjournment was moved and carried— <persRef key="clay-henry"

                        <p>A new subject of political excitement is opening upon this country, the
                            extent and duration of which it is impossible for me to foresee, but
                            which must have great influence for good or evil (God grant it may be
                            for good) upon the future history and fortunes of this Union— It is a
                            deadly feud between the Native american poor population, and the Roman
                            Catholic Irish multitudes gathered in the city of Philadelphia— The
                            animosities between these two classes of people have been fermenting in
                            all our atlantic cities for several years, and have been much aggravated
                            by the pernicious factious influence of these Irish Catholics over the
                            elections in all the populous cities.— The reaction of the native
                            American population effected a total revolution in the recent election
                            of the City Government of New-York— They have now broken out in furious
                            riots at Philadelphia, where from the first of this week a succession of
                            bitterly exasperated mobs, have destroyed multitudes of human
                            lives—dwelling houses, schools and churches, unrestrained by the
                            Government of the City or of the State.— At the house this morning
                            immediately after the reading of the Journal <persRef ref="potter-emery"

                            been sick at home from the commencement of the Session and never taken
                            his seat.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter is himself a young man
                            not much accustomed to public speaking— He gave as usual a short
                            biographical eulogy upon the deceased who was one of the self-made men
                            who compose the great majority of the rulers of this country— He was 56
                            years old—born in Adams County Pennsylvania, of <persRef

                            wilderness of Cayuga County, New-York— Served as a Militia Officer in
                            the last War with England—twice elected a member of the New-York
                            Legislature Removed to Huron County Ohio in 1837. and in 1843 was
                            elected to this 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress from a
                            District, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter said opposed to him in
                            politics—owing no doubt to an opposite vote divided between two whig<hi

                            mere plurality carries the election— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Potter moved the usual honorary neurological resolutions which were
                            adopted without further remark, including the adjournment of the house.
                                <persRef ref="root-erastus">General Root</persRef> came and brought
                            to my seat a Letter containing a statement of the application of his

                            reported from the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to
                            the house, the league of Slavery and besotted democracy, which rules the
                            house and the land, dared not spring the previous question upon the
                            debate. They wanted an hour speech from <persRef ref="mckay-james"

                            a member of the minority of that Committee claimed an hour to discuss
                            the bill, as a measure of revenue— There was some dirty chicanery to
                            deprive Barnard of the floor, but M’Kay in order to reserve for himself
                            the last word, yielded the floor to Barnard, who in a speech full to the
                            point demonstrated the utter absurdity of the bill as a measure of
                            revenue— M’Kay replied feebly, and in a tone of voice so low that the
                            house could not hear him—but he killed his hour— Cullom moved the
                            previous question— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>

                                ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> had moved a reconsideration,
                            with a view to take up his bill for holding up the Presidential election
                            on the same day throughout the Union. The question of reconsideration
                            was taken by yeas and nays, on a motion of <persRef ref="campbell-john7"
                                >Campbell</persRef> chairman of the Committee on the District to lay
                            it on the table. Carried 83 to 78.— Committee of the whole on the state

                            in a consumption moved to take up the bill to extend the Charters of the
                            District Banks— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> first
                            objected to this and proposed to take up the Senate’s bill to recharter
                            the banks—but that has not yet passed the Senate. Cave Johnson still
                            insisted upon taking up some other bill— After no small chicanery, to
                            decide whether the bill was or was not taken up Cave Johnson prevailed
                            to take the question by tellers and it was decided not to take it up 77
                            to 80. The bill taken up, was that providing for the insane asylum in
                            the District of Columbia; whereupon an excursive debate sprung up and
                            continued nearly three hours, and which terminated by changing from a
                            bill to provide for an asylum to a mere appropriation to pay the board
                            of the insane of the district now at Baltimore. The bill was then laid
                            aside, and afterwards reported to the house and a bill in substance to
                            abolish imprisonment for debt in the District of Columbia, was next
                            taken up and started another debate which continued till past 4. and
                            then the Committee rose and the house adjourned— At the request of

                            members of Congress recently deceased, and chiefly with reference to
                                <persRef ref="moore-heman">Heman Allen Moore</persRef>. A succession
                            of Strangers however occupied the Speakers chair on Sunday mornings—when
                            it was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley’s turn, until this day
                            when he gave the promised discourse to a very thin auditory. <persRef

                            Tinsleys text was from Amos 4.12—“prepare to meet thy God.” an awful
                            admonition— The whole chapter is a terrible denunciation of divine
                            judgments against the kingdom of Israel, for disregarding his
                            chastisements and not returning to him— There was very little
                            application of the discourse to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore or
                            of any other of the recent sufferers except <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"
                                >Thomas W. Gilmer</persRef> whose virtues were again commemorated,
                            and whose hapless fate was again deplored. Every dispensation of heaven,
                            gracious or afflictive should operate as exhortation to wise and
                            righteous action, but human ignorance and error make no account of them
                            or give them a wrong direction— I dare not attribute the sudden and
                            violent death of one man to a special retributive Providence any more
                            than the natural and easy death of another.— Our heavenly father causeth
                            his Sun to rise and his rain to fall alike upon the Evil and the Good,
                            nor is perhaps sudden and instantaneous death more a token of divine
                            wrath than the lingering tortures of dissolution by slow disease— Before
                            dinner we had a visit from <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Clay</persRef>, to take leave—
                            In good health— He goes to-morrow for his home at Ashland in Kentucky.—
                            His prospects of election to the Presidency are at this time brighter
                            than they have ever been before, and I sincerely believe his success
                            desirable for the best interests of the Country. There was again no
                            service this afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church—
                            I attended at the second Presbyterian, and heard <persRef
                                ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> from
                            Matthew 25.21. [“]His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and
                            faithful servant; thou has been faithful over a few things, I will make
                            thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” M<hi

                            of a new presbyterian church at some village in Maryland, with symptoms

                            the Pennsylvania avenue. An hour and a half exhausted his patience and
                            mine, and I promised him another hour to-morrow morning— At the house
                            this was the alternate Monday assigned by the rules of the house for the
                            reception of Petitions, but since the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>

                            two special orders for this day—one the joint Resolution from the Senate

                            morning I deposited the bills at the Bank of the Metropolis and
                            immediately after, purchased of <persRef ref="corcoranandriggs">Corcoran

                            They sent me the certificate in the course of the day. From half past 9

                            of the red river. <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> moved
                            to cease debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
                            upon the Washington City charter Bill at 1/2 past 12 O’Clock this day,
                            carried without opposition— There was then a sharp struggle by Campbell
                            to get the District Bank Bill from the Senate into Committee of the
                            whole in which he finally succeeded, but could not get it taken up
                            there. <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, <persRef

                                >Burke</persRef>, trip’d him up in his oft repeated motions to take
                            it up. Burke once moved to lay it on the table—lost by yeas and nays 70
                            to 94. but in Committee of the whole, where the yeas and nays cannot be
                            taken, three successive motions to take it up were lost taken by
                            tellers, with a quorum present, a majority of them voting to take up the
                            bill, and a portion of the minority purposely not passing through the
                            tellers; and thereby balking a quorum vote— A call of the house was
                            moved, but refused— Campbell kept his temper, and carried sundry other
                            district bills, first through the Committee of the whole on the state of

                            adjourned, without acting upon any of the reported bills— The three days
                            devoted to the consideration of District business have passed away, and
                            the only bill of much importance to the District or the Country has been
                            excluded from consideration by the party tactics of Cave Johnson, Weller

                            Massachusetts— He came last evening with an introductory and
                            commendatory Letter from <persRef ref="storrs-richard">Rev<hi

                                Storrs</persRef>— I was not then at home. He called again this
                            morning, and told me he had come here to apply to the bureau of supplies
                            for the navy Department to obtain a contract to furnish several thousand
                            pair of shoes for the navy. But he found it was too late— Others had
                            preoccupied the ground, and as the contract must be given to the lowest
                            bidder at whatever price he should offer to deliver the shoes they would
                            offer to deliver them at two cents a pair lower— He should be obliged to
                            take a subcontract as he had been the last year upon which the original
                            contractors had realized enormous profits, and he little or nothing.
                            They had contracted to deliver the shoes at 1 dollar and 10 cents a
                            pair, for which he had been obliged to take 87 1/2 cents— They were to
                            furnish them this year at 90 cents a pair, and the quality of the shoes
                            must be more than proportionally debased— I met again the Committee on
                            the Smithsonian bequest—the <persRef

                                >same members</persRef> present as yesterday. The Report of the
                                <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>
                            evades all explanation of the manner how the fund was almost entirely
                            invested in bonds of the State of Arkansas, upon which no interest has
                            been paid except in other bonds of the same State, and upon which for
                            more than two years no interest has been paid at-all— How to make the
                            fund now available for any appropriation by Congress to the purposes of
                            the testator, was the question first discussed, and upon which the
                            Committee came to no result.— Then I read the Bill reported by the
                            select Committee on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1842,
                            and after some conversation the Committee adjourned to next Monday 10.
                            O’Clock. for the Chairman consulting with judge French to prepare some
                            specific measure to be discussed for report to the house— In the house I
                            moved a suspension of the rules to present a Memorial from the American
                            statistical association, on the errors in the printed 6<hi

                            in the affirmative would have carried the two thirds— He refused to
                            vote, and said if he did vote it would be in the negative— After some

                            fisticuffs and the whole subject was laid on the table— The Eastern

                        <p><persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was very unwell
                            all day yesterday and had a very disturbed night— The last evening was
                            of the calm summer sultry heat, the most insupportable to me of this
                            climate, and disabled me totally for writing and for all action mental
                            or bodily— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Hawley</persRef> paid us an evening visit, convalescent from a fit
                            of severe indisposition. He conversed rationally and piously upon his
                            own condition, approaching the last stage of life, and made many remarks
                            more applicable to me than to himself. I went this morning to the house,
                            with a hope that they would devote this day to the consideration of
                            private claims which for several weeks have been totally neglected.— I
                            entered at the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">clerk’s</persRef> table the
                            Memorial from the American statistical Association, with direction to
                            refer it to the select Committee on Statistics. The chairman of that
                            Committee <persRef ref="pratt-zadock">Zadok Pratt</persRef> promised me,
                            that they should report upon it to the house— But the Slave Oligarchy
                            will yet prevail to suppress this document. In the house <persRef

                                >White</persRef> had yesterday cast reflections upon his report,
                            which he considered as reflections upon him, and he demanded an
                            explanation— White said nothing, and the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
                                >Speaker</persRef> told Saunders that this was not a privileged
                            question— The only good thing done by the house was at the motion of
                                <persRef ref="seymour-david">David L. Seymour</persRef>, to transfer
                            from the Committee of the whole house to the Committee of the whole
                            house on the state of the Union, the house bill N. 7. extending the
                            widows revolutionary pensions. <persRef ref="dean-ezra">Dean</persRef>
                            insisted upon going into committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union to take up the Navy retrenchment Bill, but <persRef
                                ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef> called loudly for the orders of
                            the day, on private claims and I conjured the house to give one day to
                            mercy—in vain. Deans motion was almost unanimously rejected— The house
                            went into Committee of the whole on private Bills— The Speaker called
                            John White to the Chair; but he said he had an engagement elsewhere. The
                            Speaker then gave the chair to <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave

                            sprung a debate, which soon became sharp pointed— David L. Seymour to

                            a vain and heartless struggle the Committee rose and reported no quorum—
                            At one O’Clock the house adjourned over to Monday at 11. I went to the
                            chamber of the Committee of manufacturers and wrote till 4— Then

                                >Columbus</persRef> and the Indian girl were yesterday taken from
                            their boxes and hoisted upon the pedestal at the left summit of the
                            flight of steps to the eastern central entrance to the Rotundo of the
                            Capitol— The workman had been two days in raising the two statues, and
                            as I left the Capitol yesterday to come home I saw them fully exposed—
                            Soon after dinner Persico came to my house, almost convulsed with
                            agitation to tell me that the statues were up, and was quite mortified
                            when I told him I had seen them.— He was anxious to have been the first
                            to announce to me the memorable event and he was going to announce it to
                                <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef>, and the

                            wanted also to shew me the statues, and hear what I should think of
                            them, and I agreed to meet him there Monday morning— <persRef

                            the private claims, and had chiefly hers in view— But they could not
                            keep a quorum, and adjourned over to Monday— I despaired of all private
                            claims before the house for this Session.— I took the papers relating to
                            the claim of interest on the public debt due to the Administrator of

                            was engaged with another person— I told him the substance of my remarks—
                            He said he would re-examine the case, and call and see me at my house
                            before making his final decision.— I called at the Department of State,
                            and spoke with the Secretary John C. Calhoun 1. On the application for
                            Documents from the Government of New Brunswick, requested by Letter from

                            points; and answered like a true slave-monger on the third. He writhed
                            like a trodden rattlesnake, on the exposure of his false report to the
                            house, that no material errors have been discovered in the printed
                            census of 1840—and finally said that where there were so many errors
                            they balanced one another, and led to the same conclusion as if they
                            were all correct— Calls, by <persRef ref="johnson-lewis">Lewis

                            Minister of a Baptist church in Salem Massachusetts, would preach in the

                            him, but the hall was not yet in order, and no public worship could be
                            held there.— I returned immediately, and at the second Presbyterian
                            Church heard <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Knox</persRef>, preach from Hosea 6.4. “O <persRef ref="ephraim"
                                >Ephraim</persRef>, what shall I do unto thee? O <persRef

                            goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew, it goeth away.”
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox remarked upon the extraordinary
                            stirring vivacity of the style of the scriptural prophets—in no instance
                            more remarkable than in this text— Ephraim and Judah, are the two
                            kingdoms— The book of Hosea extends over a period of 60 years from 784
                            to 724. before Christ, and is cotemporaneous with that of <persRef
                                ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>.— Throughout the Book;—the sins of the
                            two Peoples in punishment for which the judgments of God are denounced
                            consist first of idolatry, figured under the name of adultery, and
                            whoredom an imagery carried through the whole of the old testament, from
                            the departure out of Egypt to the restoration of Jerusalem and the
                            building of the second temple— The divine mission of Hosea is of a
                            character so revolting that it requires Faith almost superhuman to be
                            reconciled to— The prophet is commanded by the word of the Lord to
                            commit a disgusting crime The narrative cannot be read with decency; and
                            yet the book is a code of the purest morality, and the tenderest
                            affections. What can be more compassionate than these apostrophes to
                            Ephraim and Judah? What more thrilling than the likening of their
                            goodness to the morning cloud and the early dew— M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>I had prepared a draught of a Bill, making an appropriation of 700,000
                            dollars from the treasury; to assume the annual interest on the <persRef

                            and then the consideration of the motion to print was postponed till

                            in, by a separate bill— The Post-Office appropriation Bill was
                            afterwards taken up, and the amendment to abolish the special agents of
                            the Post Office Department was rejected 73 to 81. Then the fortification

                        <p>The meeting of the select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest was fixed
                            for this morning at half past 9. but the only members who attended
                            except myself were <persRef ref="brengle-francis">Brengle</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="french-richard">French</persRef>— I read my draught of
                            a preliminary bill to appropriate a sum sufficient to make the fund
                            immediately available for application to the purposes of the <persRef

                                >r</hi> French who without hesitation approved it— I have therefore
                            the consent of a majority of the Committee to report it, but I was not
                            ready with my report— It was agreed therefore that when my report is
                            ready, I shall call a meeting of the Committee for their final action

                            in part— At the motion of <persRef ref="slidell-john">John
                                Slidell</persRef> of New-Orleans the reading was superseded without
                            objection, before it was half concluded— A bad practice; because it
                            precludes the correction of errors which are frequent and often
                            important— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson’s</persRef> motion
                            to reconsider the order for printing the documents reported by the

                            Louisiana Land claims shall cease on Thursday next at 4 O’Clock P.M.

                            reported to the house, without objection, and one to which I objected
                            too late. I appealed from the decision of the chairman, but on failure
                            of a quorum withdrew my appeal— Sundry motions to adjourn over to
                            Wednesday and to Tuesday next, all of which failed.— After dinner the

                        <p>A day of extreme summer heat. In the hall of the house of
                            Representatives, <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Tinsley</persRef> preached from Luke 15.18— “I will
                            arise and go to my father” he took no more of the parable for his text;
                            but this was enough to let into his commentary the whole story of the
                            prodigal son—an inexhaustible fountain of the tenderest affections of
                            the human heart. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley threw himself on
                            the indulgence of a very small auditory observing that he was much
                            indisposed and had hoped to have obtained assistance to supply his
                            place, but had been disappointed. He spoke without notes, with
                            sufficient fluency, but with little effect— I never hear a discourse
                            upon this parable without being reminded of that of <persRef
                                ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne</persRef>.— The general analogy which
                            makes the prodigal the impersonation of all mankind in their relation to
                            their maker, appeals to the bosom and to the conscience of every
                            individual— The essence of the Christian religion considers every man as
                            a sinner, and repentance as the condition of salvation— The creed
                            requires the belief that the atonement of Christ is the price of
                            salvation, and that doctrine was enforced this afternoon at S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church, by a Stranger who read the
                            Evening service for Whitsunday, and preached from Ephesians 2.8 “For by
                            grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the
                            gift of God: 9. Not of works, lest any man should boast.” The doctrine
                            that man cannot save himself by good works is harsh and hard to believe,
                            but the doctrine taught by the parable of the prodigal Son is that
                            Salvation is secured by repentance and Faith. Good works are the
                            necessary and indispensable sequel to sincere repentance—in ceasing to
                            do evil we learn to do good—good works are the proofs of repentance, but
                            they are parts of the relations of man with his fellow man; not with
                            God— They can have no merit in his intercourse with God—nor give to man
                            the right to boast. While the preacher this afternoon was discoursing on
                            this theme a sudden heavy thunder gust and shower came up, and there was
                            one flash and clap so instantaneous that it might well it well have
                            discomposed the equanimity of his nerves but did not— He only took
                            occasion from it to notice how the life or man was liable to be cut off
                            in an instant <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> and

                        <p>This was the day on which the two democratic conventions to nominate
                            candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United
                            States, for four years from the fourth of March next were held at
                            Baltimore— And also a Convention to nominate a candidate for the office
                            of Governor of Maryland— By the new invention of the Electro-magnetic
                            telegraph of <persRef ref="morse-samuel">professor Morse</persRef>, the
                            proceedings of these bodies throughout the day were made known here at
                            the Capitol, and announced as soon as received in manuscript bulletins
                            suspended to the wall in the Rotundo. I gave an hour’s sitting to

                            dragged heavily along— About 70 members chiefly of the democratic
                            majority were absent at Baltimore, yet enough remained to controul the
                            action of the house, and dictate what should be done— <persRef

                            insisted upon a call of the yeas and nays to ascertain the quorum in the
                            house 110 and 19. Adjourned at 3.— I went into the Senate chamber and
                            heard <persRef ref="rives-william">William C. Rives</persRef> close a

                        <p>The Summer heat prematurely coming upon me, as did the winter cold, from
                            the day of my departure, last October (25) from my home at Quincy,
                            disqualifies me, more and more from day to day for all useful action.— I
                            gave an hour’s sitting again to <persRef ref="cranch-john">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Cranch</persRef> and <persRef

                                Bingham</persRef>— It was to have been the last, but they requested
                            one more. At the house, there was a Quorum of 135 members in attendance,
                            under the dominion of <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef>,
                            unable to make a majority for his mischievous purposes, but sufficient
                            to defeat any purpose of good by withholding votes necessary to make a
                            Quorum— His course was—1. he moved to go into Committee of the whole on
                            the state of the Union, to take up some pet measure of his own. His
                            motion failed— Other motions were made to go into Committee which he
                            defeated. <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef> moved to take up
                            the private bills, unobjectionable, reported to the house, last
                            Saturday— Weller, said no—he would take up no private bill in the
                            absence of his friend from Tennessee—<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
                                Johnson</persRef>—the scourge of all claimants. At last <persRef
                                ref="seymour-david">David L. Seymour</persRef>, carried a vote to go
                            into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, with a view to
                            take up the widows pension bill— <persRef ref="white-john6">John
                                White</persRef> was chairman of the Committee When the motion was
                            made to take up the Bill, Weller called for a division— The votes were
                            three to one for taking up the Bill, but Weller and his gang by not
                            voting at-all prevented a quorum vote. Tellers were called— Four times
                            over the count was repeated, and no quorum voted. The last count shewed
                            81 to 29. requiring only one vote more to make a quorum.— Weller at the
                            issue of every count insisted that the Committee should rise and report
                            no quorum to the house— He finally prevailed, and it being evident that
                            no business could be done, the house between one and 2 adjourned— I had
                            an hour of conversation with <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D.
                                Barnard</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> and other
                            whigs, impatient to impeach <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef>
                            for his manifold usurpations, and violations of the Constitution, which
                            I dissuaded as impracticable, or a cracked gun barrel fit only to
                            explode in the hand of him who would use it. The electro-magnetic
                            telegraph, at the east-end of the Capitol was all day reporting every
                            half hour the proceedings of the Conventions at Baltimore. The Tyler
                            Convention adjourned without nominating a Vice-President. The Democratic
                            National Convention adopted the two thirds rule and balloted 7 times
                            between Van Buren and Cass without coming to a choice. After dinner I
                            walked round the President’s square— We had evening visits from <persRef

                        <p>It is impossible for me to describe the anxieties, under which my soul is
                            oppressed, and which I am compelled to suppress, with reliance only upon
                            superior power to relieve me from them— And with no hope of other relief
                            than from the close of life, and the transition to another state of
                            existence— The deepest of my afflictions is the degeneracy of my
                            Country, from the principles which gave her existence—and the ruin
                            irreparable of them all under the transcendant power of Slavery and the
                            Slave representation.— This morning I gave another hour to <persRef

                            nays on the passage of a bill to require the execution of bonds by
                            Collectors of the Customs, before taking the oath of Office—to ascertain
                            if there was a quorum present— The vote was 126 to 1. nays. The
                            consideration of the Report of the Committee of Elections, on the

                            rose and said he proposed to make a speech about the Tariff— Objection
                            was immediately made to his proceeding on the ground that any thing he
                            could say upon the tariff would be irrelevant— The chairman after some
                            hesitation so decided, from which decision Stewart appealed— The vote on
                            the appeal was 54 to 4. Not within sight of a Quorum— The Committee
                            rose, and before 2 the house adjourned— I walked home— The democratic

                            adjourned, with a solemn protest of one of the delegates from the State
                            of Missouri against the whole proceedings, and a declaration that
                            Missouri would not confirm them— In the house a joint Resolution for
                            taking sundry inventories of public property, and a catalogue of the
                            document library of the house, was introduced by <persRef
                                ref="pratt-zadock">Zadok Pratt</persRef>, and after some discussion
                            referred to the joint Committee on the library of Congress— I moved to
                            add a consideration of the expediency of printing a 10<hi
                                rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of the U.S Laws— Pratt declined
                            accepting my amendment—his resolution was adopted— And mine was received
                            and passed in the form of a Resolution, requiring the <persRef
                                ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk of the house</persRef> to have a tenth
                            volume of the Laws published. Committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union, <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> in the chair.
                                <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> attempted to call
                            up the District Bank Bill, by appealing to the sympathies of the members
                            by stating that he wanted to go to Philadelphia to take medical
                            advice—but in vain— The widow’s pension Bill was taken up, and after two
                            or three more speeches for the warriors of the west, <persRef
                                ref="davis-garrett">Garret Daviss</persRef> motion to pension them
                            and its rider were rejected and the bill was laid aside to be reported
                            to the house— The Louisiana land title bill was then debated, till 4
                            O’Clock, when it had been ordered that the bill should be taken out of
                            the Committee—sundry amendments were proposed, but as soon as a question
                            arose upon which a division was called there was no quorum voting, the
                            Committee rose, and the house adjourned</p>

                        <p>I finished the draught of a Report from the select Committee on the
                            Smithsonian bequest, but in the process of preparing it changed my
                            purpose from the design of reporting two bills, to that of including the
                            whole subject in one— At the house I presented by leave of the house a
                            petition of<space/><persRef ref="tarr-a">Tarr</persRef> and 179 citizens of
                            Pennsylvania, native americans, praying for an alteration of the
                            naturalization laws to require of 21 years of naturalization, residence
                            for the admission of foreigners to the political rights of native
                            Americans— The petitioners not one of whom is personally known to me
                            requested me in presenting it to the house to give my opinion upon its
                            merits— This required of me a painful operation, for I do not approve
                            the change of the Law petitioned for and know that an odious colouring
                            will be given to the mere presentation of the petition— But I did not
                            feel it becoming in me to refuse to present the petition, nor yet to
                            shrink from the avowal of my opinion against it— I therefore presented
                            the petition, stated the facts and said as the petitioners had chosen to
                            call for my opinion, I felt myself obliged to say that I could not
                            support its prayer— I moved its reference to the judiciary committee.

                            moved to lay it on the table which was carried by yeas and nays 128 to
                            26. <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>
                            voted first no, and after the close of the call changed his vote. The
                            Senate this morning concurred with the joint Resolution from the house
                            to close the Session on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this
                            month— <persRef ref="newton-willoughby">Willoughby Newton</persRef>
                            presented a report from the minority of the Committee of elections
                            presented a report on the contested election between the <persRef
                                ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> and <persRef ref="botts-john"
                                >Botts</persRef>—both the reports come to the same conclusion that
                            Jones was duly elected. There was some argument that there was no
                            question left for debate; but after some discussion it was finally
                            concluded to postpone the consideration of the Resolution till next
                            Thursday, and that Botts should if he desired it be heard at the bar in
                            support of his claim— The motion to print the voluminous testimony in
                            the case was laid on the table.— <persRef ref="vance-joseph"
                                >Vance</persRef> made a motion to take up the bills on the private
