						<p><persRef ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham</persRef> the British Minister called on me
							this morning and I had a long and very free conversation with him, not
							upon his negotiations here, of which no mention was made either by him
							or me— He seemed anxious to know whether a special Session of Congress
							would be called as has been much rumoured but recently as if by
							authority denied— Immediately after the rejection by the Senate of the
							annexation Treaty <persRef ref="henderson-james">Henderson</persRef> who had come post-haste as Minister
							Plenipotentiary to sign it started post haste back it was said to
							prevent the abandonment of the project by the Texians, and to negotiate
							a popular movement there, still to cram down the annexation— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham, that I had seen with great
							pleasure in the Parliamentary papers of 1839 and 40. lent me by <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef>, the avowal by <persRef ref="temple-henry">Lord Palmerston</persRef> in a
							despatch to <persRef ref="ellis-charles">Lord Howard de Walden</persRef> that to promote the abolition of
							Slavery throughout the world was a fixed and settled system of the
							British Government.— I had seen in the same papers the negotiations with
							all Europe and all America, especially with the <persRef ref="gregory-xvi">Pope</persRef> and the <persRef ref="ahmad-i">Bey of
								Tunis</persRef> all tending to the same result— I told him of the visit of <persRef ref="andrews-stephen">Andrews</persRef>
							the Texian and of <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef> to me before they went to England last
							Summer— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrews had communicated his
							designs to me, and I had expressed to him my doubts of his success. I
							had expressed the same doubt to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan,
							and told him I thought the British Government would in this case
							sacrifice their principles to their policy— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lewis Tappan without authority from me had apprized Lord
							Aberdeen of this opinion of mine, and <persRef ref="gordon-george">Lord Aberdeen</persRef> had protested
							against it but it had proved correct— The abolition of Slavery in Texas
							without war or bloodshed had been completely within the power of Great
							Britain, but her Government had failed to carry out their own
							principles.— They disclaim and concede too much. They parry carte and
							tierce to avoid the issue tendered them, and which they must meet— This
							was not the general character of English diplomacy. It was usually bold,
							open, explicit, stubborn— I could not perceive it in Lord Aberdeens
							disavowals nor in <persRef ref="elliot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Elliots</persRef> recent
							Letter to <persRef ref="houston-samuel">President Houston</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham
							took no offence at what I said, and spoke with much caution and reserve
							in return— He seems afraid of the English principles themselves, and
							fearful that the use of them would be to put edge tools in the hands of
							children— I called at <persRef ref="dyer-robert">Dyer’s</persRef> auction room— At the Patriotic Bank, and at
							the Office of the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk of the House</persRef> where I was furnished with a copy
							of the native American Memorial of <persRef ref="tarr-a">A. De Kalb Tarr</persRef> and 179 others with
							the names— I met <persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef> there, and he asked me to take him home to
							<persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fullers</persRef> hotel—which I did— He afterwards brought me a bust of <persRef ref="nelson-john">John
							Nelson</persRef>, the present Attorney General, to look at his Visits from <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p>The heat by the thermometer has abated but the sultriness of the
							atmosphere keeps me still in a state which seems to myself like
							suspended animation. I sent this morning two blue chests N. 11. and 14.
							with the chest containing the documents of the 2<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> and 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sessions of the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, to Georgetown where they were
							ship’d in the Brig William L. Jones <persRef ref="davis-samuel">Samuel R. Davis</persRef>, Master, for Boston—
							I made out with the help of <persRef ref="adams-mary4">my granddaughter Mary Louisa</persRef> my account as
							Executor of the Will of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Thomas B. Johnson</persRef>, and took it to the judge of
							the orphan’s court. <persRef ref="causin-nathaniel">Nath<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> P. Causin</persRef>— He
							examined the vouchers and admitted them all, after at first objecting
							that a promissory Note for 150 dollars should have been sworn to by <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">M.
							A. Giusta</persRef>. He concluded to pass it without requiring the oath. I left my
							account and vouchers, upon which the Register <persRef ref="noah-edward">Edward N. Noah</persRef> is to make
							the Statement of the account in the form practised at the Office, and in
							which it is passed by the judge— I have kept the accounts at the
							Patriotic Bank, where I found this morning a balance in my favour on my
							Executor’s account of 626.63. which I drew in bills of the Bank— On
							re-examination of the account that I had delivered, an omission of four
							items with which I should have charged myself—two of them were on my
							bank book, but had escaped my attention— The other two were notes
							protested at the bank, and taken out and delivered to <persRef ref="dyer-robert">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dyer</persRef> for collection. I called yesterday
							and this day at Dyer’s auction room, but he was not there.— I visited
							also <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Force</persRef> to enquire about the
							delivery of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Volume of the American
							Archives, but only ascertained where I must enquire further— Force had a
							bound copy of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of the
							American Archives; but they are not yet generally bound for delivery.
							And there is yet a 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume to complete
							the fourth series, extending only from the 19<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of April to 1774 to the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of July 1776— He proposes then to take up the 3d and the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> series conjointly— I despatched my
							answer to <persRef ref="curtis-thomas2">Thomas W. T. Curtis</persRef> of Rye New Hampshire and returned to him
							the mutilated copy, in <persRef ref="frazier-mary">Clara’s</persRef> hand-writing of my vision— Did she give
							it away before her death? or leave it to <persRef ref="u">her sister</persRef> or <persRef ref="sargent-daniel">her husband</persRef>? why
							should I enquire? <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here this evening— There was a light
							thunder shower yesterday and a heavy shower without thunder this
							afternoon.— I took a short walk at evening twilight, but the weather is
							so languishing that I barely made out to finish a short note, for
							publication with my closing list of petitions for this Session— The note
							is on the memorial of <persRef ref="tarr-a">A. de Kalb Tarr</persRef>, and 179 native Americans, which
							on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of May the house laid on the
							table and on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June took up and
							referred to the judiciary Committee.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis Johnson</persRef> came to enquire if I had
							again spoken to the <persRef ref="mcculloch-james">first comptroller of the Treasury</persRef> concerning the
							remnant of claim of the heirs of <persRef ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>— I told him I had been at
							the Comptroller’s Office to see him but he was not there— I proposed to
							go there again on Friday— He proposed that <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fendall</persRef> should go with me, to which I assented, and he will
							request M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall to call on me at 10.
							Friday morning.— I settled accounts at <persRef ref="kinchy-paul">Kinchy’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="clagett-darius">Clagett’s</persRef>. Saw <persRef ref="dyer-robert">R. W.
							Dyer</persRef> who told me he had received the money on <persRef ref="u">Milburn’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Turner’s</persRef>
							notes and would send it to me in the course of the day— I received at
							the Bank of Washington 90 dollars for the quarter’s interest on the
							Washington Corporation 6. per Cents.— Then at the Orphan’s Court, I
							added to my statement of account with the Estate of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Thomas B. Johnson</persRef>
							the 4 items which had been omitted, and took it to have it adjusted in
							conformity with the account as stated by the <persRef ref="noah-edward">Register</persRef> to which he then
							swore me.— At the Patriotic Book, I exchanged three of their 100 dollar
							Bills for an order upon the Bank of America in New-York. Then at the
							Office of the National Intelligencer I left with <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gales</persRef>, my closing list of Petitions, presented by me to the
							House at the recent Session of Congress, with a Note upon the Memorial
							of <persRef ref="tarr-a">A. de Kalb Tarr</persRef> and 179 citizens of Pennsylvania, praying for an
							alteration of the naturalization Laws, so as to require 21 years
							residence for admission to the rights of suffrage; and a copy of the
							Memorial itself with the names of the signers and the endorsements of
							the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk</persRef> shewing the first and second disposal of it by the house.
							Gales promised that the whole should be published in the Intelligencer
							on Saturday Morning, and I desired him to send me half a dozen copies of
							that day’s paper.— Gales said there was a new phase of the Texas
							question— Some new suspicion of British interference to abolish Slavery
							in Texas, prompted by <persRef ref="walsh-robert">Robert Walsh</persRef>, now turned into a hack slave-driver,
							in one of his Letters published in the Intelligencer. There had been two
							Cabinet Meetings and it was the meerest chance that there had not been a
							call for an extra Session of Congress.— He said that <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> was
							now here again.— He attended a whig meeting at Albany, a few days after
							the close of the Session of Congress; and there declared himself opposed
							to the annexation of Texas now and at any time— He is now at <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef>
							Hotel, and was hesitating whether to come out immediately with a
							publication in the Intelligencer, or to wait till his return to South
							Carolina— Gales told him there was no moment like the present moment and
							furnished him with several documents that he wanted; and he is now
							writing for publication— I walked after dinner half way to the race
							ground and back— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> is confined to the chambers and my own
							condition is not much better— I began this evening an answer to <persRef ref="wingate-j">J.
							Wingate</persRef> about the statistical memorial, but shall not have time to
							finish it before I return to Quincy, and who knows what will occupy me
							there?— The blunders of the census and their consequences call for the
							bow and the shaft of <persRef ref="ulysses">Ulysses</persRef>, and I have nothing but the telum im belle,
							sine ictu of <persRef ref="priam">Priam</persRef>.</p>

						<p>Independence day 68.</p>
						<p>I had received from the Committee of arrangements of the Philodemic
							Society of Georgetown College an invitation to attend at 1. O’Clock P.M.
							this day at the delivery of an Oration by one of its members, and at an
							entertainment given by the faculty of the College, and the Society— One
							of my reasons for remaining in this city after the close of the Session
							of Congress till this day shall be past, was to escape from all the
							celebrations to which I was or might be invited; the noise and bustle
							and excitement and ranting of this day having become irksome to me. I
							intended nevertheless to attend this oration and entertainment at the
							Georgetown College, but my driver took an holiday for himself and
							disappointed me— I was however well pleased with my disappointment,
							passed the day very quietly at home till close upon Sunset when I
							strolled out for an hour, and on returning stop’d at <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison’s</persRef> and took leave of her for the
							summer— Morning and evening visitors, as by the margin; chiefly military
							Officers, who had been in grand costume to pay their devoirs to the
							<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>— The wedding visit last Saturday and that of Independence day
							came so close together that the attendance this day was thin— Captain
							Tyler and <persRef ref="tyler-julia">his bride</persRef> are the laughing stock of the city. It seems as if
							he was racing for a prize banner to the nuptials of the mock heroic— The
							Sublime and the Ridiculous.— He has assumed the war power as a
							prerogative; the veto power as a caprice; the appointing and dismissing
							power as a fund for bribery, and now under circumstances of revolting
							indecency, is performing with a young girl from New-York the old fable
							of January and May.— I wrote this day a Letter to<space/><persRef ref="barnes-wd">Barnes</persRef> and <persRef ref="tarr-a">A. de
							Kalb Tarr</persRef> in answer to that which they addressed to me with the memorial
							calling for alteration of the naturalization laws— It took all the
							leisure of the day and when written was too long. The native Americans
							are falling into the blunders of the abolition Societies. They have an
							excellent cause which they will ruin by mismanagement— The Native
							Americans, like the anti-masons will have a momentary and limited
							success; but the staff will break in their hands and lay them in the
							dust. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> has been several days unwell, and is confined to the
							chambers— Rather unwell myself.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall</persRef> called on me at 10 this morning,

							before yesterday <hi rend="strikethrough">was</hi> installed as

							M’Culloh</persRef>; and to urge the allowance of the remnant of claim for interest
							on the accounts of <persRef ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>— His objection was that <persRef ref="key-francis">Francis S. Key</persRef>,
							the Counsel for the claim, now deceased had chosen to have it settled
							without advancing this demand, and that it was now too late to go behind
							that settlement— He offered however to refer it again to the present
							<persRef ref="nelson-john">Attorney General John Nelson</persRef>; but intimated that his opinions with
							regard to the allowance of claims were far less indulgent than those of
							his predecessor the late <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Hugh S. Legaré</persRef>— I went to the Capitol to return
							to the Congress Library all the books that I had borrowed there, but
							found it closed; the days of keeping it open during the recess of
							Congress being Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday instead of Tuesday and
							Friday as I had supposed— I left the books with <persRef ref="french-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> French</persRef> of the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">House Clerk’s</persRef> Office who promised to have them
							returned to the Library to-morrow— I took a few further Articles of
							Stationery, and the third Volume of the American Archives to complete my
							set.— French promised to send me to Quincy the remaining sheets of the
							Journal as they shall be delivered from the printers, and the diplomatic
							correspondence with Spain from 1816 to 1819 not yet printed— I called at
							the orphans court, and enquired of the <persRef ref="causin-nathaniel">judge</persRef> respecting the distribution
							of the balance remaining in my hands of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thomas B. Johnson’s</persRef> property undevised; being according to the statement
							of the <persRef ref="noah-edward">Register</persRef> and to which I was sworn by him 492 dollars<space/>cents—
							The judge said it must be distributed between the <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;frye-carolina;smith-catherine-johnson;hellen-adelaide;boyd-harriet">five surviving sisters</persRef>
							in equal portions, with a sixth equal share to be divided between the
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary;hellen-johnson">two surviving children</persRef> of the eldest sister the first <persRef ref="hellen-ann">M<hi

							of <persRef ref="pope-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pope</persRef> living, by the statute of
							distributions no part of the property comes to her— M<hi

							dined and spent the day at <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye’s</persRef>— My

							Revised my Letter to <persRef ref="barnes-wd">W. D. Barnes</persRef> and <persRef ref="tarr-a">A. De Kalb Tarr</persRef>, and struck out of
							it a whole page of red pepper very palatable yesterday, but flat, stale
							and unprofitable to day. Examined M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye’s
							account, and drew up a petition to the judge of the orphan’s Court,
							stating the balance of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s

							yesterday— At the Office of the National Intelligencer, I took 6 copies
							of the paper of this day, containing my closing list of Petitions,
							presented by me at the recent Session of Congress to the house of
							Representatives, with the note upon the memorial of <persRef ref="tarr-a">A. de Kalb Tarr</persRef> and
							179 citizens of Pennsylvania, praying for alteration of the
							naturalization Laws. I enclosed one of these papers in my Letter to <persRef ref="barnes-wd">W.
							D. Barnes</persRef>, and A. de Kalb Tarr; and one to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, for the long Letter
							of <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> against the
							annexation of Texas, and the annexation Treaty.— I met M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson at the Intelligencer Office, and
							had a long conversation with him and <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gales</persRef>, on the subject— Thompson is a South-Carolina planter, owner of
							100 Slaves, and religiously believes that Slavery was made for the
							African race and the African race for Slavery.— He opposes the
							annexation of Texas on Southern grounds as a Southern man— So did
							<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>—so did <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>. So did <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef>, all now rabid annexationists—
							Thompson will be converted like them. He knocks down <persRef ref="walker-robert">Walker</persRef>, <persRef ref="wilkins-william">Wilkins</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> with their own Maul. But he smuggled through Congress
							the acknowledgment of Texas, prematurely— He is as cunning as four
							yankees, as sly as four quakers, and just now admires the People of
							Massachusetts too much.— I hope his Letter will be eminently useful at
							the present crisis, and devoutly pray that he, and <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef>, and the
							Princeton gun, may be instruments for the deliverance of my Country.</p>

						<p>A new protestant Episcopal church has been built in our neighbourhood,
							called the Church of the Epiphany, under the charge of the <persRef ref="french-john">Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> John W. French</persRef>, who was chaplain to the
							house of Representatives at the special Session of Congress in 1841. and
							since then has preached some time in Georgetown, and later here in
							Washington, till he has gathered a flock and become their pastor perhaps
							not in the most regular order of apostolican succession— They have not
							even waited for the consecration or dedication of the church, which is
							yet unfinished, but in which he performed publish worship for the first
							time, this day.— He read the morning prayer with the litany and short
							communion for the fifth Sunday after Trinity— He preached from Psalm
							122.1. “I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of
							the Lord.”— It was an elaborate and regular dedication sermon, in which
							he enumerated all the reasons which a Christian has for being glad when
							he is summoned to go into the house of the Lord— The blessing of
							constant and faithful attendance upon public worship— This is a subject
							upon which it becomes a man to be distrustful of his own motives. The
							pleasure of attending upon the ordinances of religion may be an impulse
							of self righteousness, any thing but virtue. Attendance upon public
							worship for the purpose of homage to our own maker is the bare
							performance of duty—for the purpose of receiving instruction and reproof
							is just and reasonable; for the purpose of seeing and being seen of men,
							is vanity and hipocrisy, for mere curiosity, is idleness; and for the
							purpose of carping upon the performances of the preacher is an abusive
							exercise of faculties given for self improvement and gratitude to God—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French preached without notes. There
							is no pulpit, and he came from behind the desk with frequent exhibition
							of his person—his gesticulation was graceful; his elocution fluent, his
							delivery earnest and impressive— He gave notice that he would administer
							the communion the next Lord’s day, but did not add the usual exhortation
							of the episcopal prayer-book to partake of it. After dinner at Saint
							John’s church, <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the evening
							prayers for the same day and preached from Psalm 119.18. [“]Open thou
							mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things, out of thy law”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne is a very acceptable preacher— <persRef ref="cutts-richard2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts</persRef> and his daughter <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary</persRef> spent part of

						<p>One of the greatest dangers in this world to a man’s moral honesty is the
							possession of money belonging to others. The temptation to use it as his
							own, is perpetually recurring; and when thus used it becomes at once a
							debt and a privation of the means of paying it— In my ordinary concerns
							I have upon an average three calls for money every day— If I have money
							of others at hand, and none of my own, it is so convenient to borrow for
							the present payment that the future call to refund is overlook and debt,
							burdensome debt is unwarily contracted— On making up my first account of
							the Execution of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas B. Johnson’s</persRef>
							Will, I found a balance of 503 dollars 27 cents in my hands undevised—
							But the practice at the Orphan’s Court is that the <persRef ref="noah-edward">Register</persRef> makes up the
							account in his own way; and he accordingly made out my account, with a
							balance of 492:78. to which he put me upon oath— I gave him notice that
							the balance of my own statement was larger, and that I should credit the
							Estate for the difference in my second account— To disburden myself as
							far as possible of this balance I concluded to pay off the portions due
							to all the heirs now here, for which purpose I exchanged the order from
							the Patriotic Bank on the Bank of America at New-York, which I had taken
							for 300 dollars and took one for 100 dollars, and the other 200 dollars
							in bills of the late banks of this City— I drew also the remaining
							balance of 58.43. of the deposit for <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								John Adams</persRef>.— I then called on <persRef ref="hellen-adelaide">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adelaide
							Hellen</persRef> at her house, paid her 80 dollars, and took her receipt. Then on
							<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> at the paymaster general’s
							office—paid him 160 dollars for the portions of <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Frye</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> for

								wife</persRef>, of <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>, and of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
							Adams.— There remains now only that of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Boyd, which I cannot yet obtain— And I still owe 100 dollars to my wife
							and 140. to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams.— I returned to
							the Department of State The two Volumes of Instructions to Ministers of
							the United States in Europe, and two printed Volumes of English
							diplomatic collections which I had borrowed last Year. I enquired of
							<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> if any answer had yet been
							received about the papers to be obtained from the Province of
							New-Brunswick— None— While I was with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun, he received a Note from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> requesting his immediate
							attendance at a Cabinet Meeting, about the horrible and bloody riots at
							Philadelphia— At the War Department I requested the re-entrance of the

							take copies of them, carried them with the vouchers to the <persRef ref="causin-nathaniel">judge of the

							Boyd</persRef> for the final settlement of the Estate—and the fulfilment of my
							trust as the executor of the Will— At the Patriotic Bank, I balanced my

							62.50, for <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> on the Bank of America at New-York— I called at the

								>r</hi> Gales</persRef> nor <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> was there— I
							returned home and occupied the remainder of the day in packing up for
							departure— Though I have ship’d three chests of books and papers to go
							round by water, and take two trunks with me chiefly filled also with
							papers, I leave behind a number sufficient to fill another large chest,
							and among them many which I shall most urgently need— My projects of
							employment for the remainder of the Summer and the next Autumn weigh
							heavily upon my spirits; with a deep apprehension that I shall fail to
							carry all or any of them into useful execution; and a profound
							conviction that the time for my departure is at hand, and that the
							preparation for closing all my accounts with this world cannot much
							longer be delayed— I had received a Letter from <persRef ref="burnet-jacob">Judge Jacob Burnet</persRef> of
							Cincinnati, Ohio and one from his son <persRef ref="burnet-george">G. W. Burnet</persRef>, who is going to
							Europe, for the benefit of his health— They ask for Letters of
							introduction; a request of the import of which the most intelligent
							people of this country have not the most distant conception— I wrote for
							M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnet two short Letters, to <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>, and to our Consul at London, <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Thomas Aspinwall</persRef>— We further
							postponed our departure till the afternoon of to-morrow, to go no
							farther to morrow than Baltimore— The riots in the City of Philadelphia
							between the Native Americans, and the Irish Roman Catholics, have blazed
							up into a civil War, with this most extraordinary result that the
							Catholic Irish are invariably the first aggressors, and the civil and
							military authorities, are bandied in shooting down the Natives— In the
							course of Sunday Night and before day light yesterday morning; not less
							than 30 Native Americans and 8 or ten militia men were killed in battle
							array— There has been much mismanagement in the measures of the
							authorities to subdue the insurrection— <persRef ref="cutts-richard">Richard</persRef> and <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> were here
							this Evening, and <persRef ref="jesup-mary;jesup-lucy">two of the daughters</persRef> of <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">General Jesup</persRef>— The heat of the

							establishment survives, in charge of <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>— The heat kept us from
							strolling. I met <persRef ref="semmes-benedict">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Semmes</persRef> in the reading

							<persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief Justice Taney</persRef> and in the event of an adverse decision by him,

						<p>I enter this day on the 78<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year of my age;
							and but for a blessed dispensation of almighty God, it would have been
							the last day both of my own life, and of that of my dear and ever
							<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">beloved wife</persRef>. We both escaped as if by miracle, and neither of us
							unhurt— I rose this morning at <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> in Baltimore, before the Sun,
							and after journalizing the day for yesterday, sent for <persRef ref="phelps-amos">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> A. A. Phelps</persRef>, and had a long conversation
							with him concerning <persRef ref="torrey-charles">Charles T. Torrey</persRef> in prison here upon a charge of
							enticing away Slaves from a Citizen of Maryland; and demanded by the
							<persRef ref="mcdowell-james">Governor of Virginia</persRef> to be delivered upon a charge of the same crime in
							that State— I enquired, what was the punishment for that crime in the
							two States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phelps said imprisonment at
							the discretion of the court, not exceeding 20 years.— I asked the
							opinions of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallagher</persRef> on Slavery. I
							enquired if other, and more employed to argue the whole case before the
							<persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">chief Justice</persRef> as the Circuit judge and then before the Supreme Court of
							the United States— He said that <persRef ref="johnson-reverdy">Reverdy Johnson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="mcmahon-john">M’Mahon</persRef> had been
							mentioned. I thought that sound opinions on the subject of Slavery, and
							an undaunted spirit to assert and maintain them were indispensable
							qualifications for any person selected for that argument, and I
							recommended that the counsel might be specially requested to study and
							refer freely to the case of the <persRef ref="somerset-james">Negro Somerset</persRef> in <persRef ref="howell-thomas">Howell’s</persRef> State Trials
							to the case of the Antelope in <persRef ref="wheaton-henry">Wheaton</persRef>, and to my Review of it in the
							argument for the Amistad captives— To <persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin’s</persRef> argument in that same case; and to <persRef ref="scott-william">Lord Stowell’s</persRef> decision in
							the case of the <persRef ref="grace">Slave Grace</persRef>, and I said that having a great personal
							regard for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torrey I should happy if I
							could furnish his counsel with any information which might be useful for
							his defence.— We left Baltimore at 9. A.M in the train of Cars for
							Philadelphia, which city we reached about 4 in the afternoon, and found
							yet in amphibious state between mob and martial Law— We concluded to
							proceed immediately to New-York. At 5 in the afternoon we left Walnut
							street wharf in the Steamer New Philadelphia and came to Bristol 20.
							Miles—there landed, and proceeded in the train of Cars through Trenton,
							New Brunswick, Elizabethtown and Newark to Jersey City— The Sunset
							between Trenton was glorious, equal to anything I ever beheld— As I
							witnessed the departing luminary, and the peace and quiet and felicity
							of all around me, I thought of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> and Trenton, and the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December 1776 and a feeling of
							inexpressible joy, filled my Soul— Between 10 and 11. we alighted from
							the cars on an unrailed floor, raised about 4 feet above the ground.
							walking on this floor, dark as midnight, I stept unawares off the floor,
							and pitched over, and drew my wife, whose arm was linked in mine over
							after me. Blessed be God neither neck nor limb of either of us was
							broken— We were enabled after an hour of delay to cross the ferry to
							New-York, and reached the Aston house before midnight.</p>

						<p><date>12. V.30. </date>Friday</p>
						<p>The sensation which I suffered last night by the shock of my own fall,
							instantly succeeded by that of <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> was such as I never in my life
							experienced before, and which I have no words to describe; while falling
							I had the distinct idea that I was killed— A shriek from my wife, and
							the consciousness that she too was killed had in it a thrill of horror
							of which I knew not that the human frame was susceptible. My fall was so
							disposed that my left hip first met the earth tip’d me over upon the
							right side and laid me sprawling, but neither my head nor my body struck
							the earth— I instantly rose, feeling pain only on the hip and that not
							severe—but the terror for my wife, no pang of death could surpass. She
							had fallen forwards. Her cloathing had protected her from any shock to
							the body, but her left wrist was sprained and the recoil from the ground
							struck her breast; broke the glass of the breastpin, and slightly
							bruised a spot on the upper side of her chin below the lip. She had
							fainted and was senseless. Several men came to our assistance— They took
							her up and carried her into one the house sheds of the railroad company
							where were benches to sit upon. A physician was sent for, but as she
							soon came to and appeared not to be much hurt that order was
							countermanded— The other passengers had crossed the river in the
							Steam-ferry boat, and that boat in about half an hour returned. My wife
							had then so far recovered that she was able to be led to the boat; we
							crossed the river, and a hack took us to the Astor house. They gave us
							two bed-rooms on the first floor, and before midnight we were lodged for
							the Night, still unknowing how much we were injured but grateful that
							our lives and limbs had been spared— After a restless and agitated Night
							my wife felt the pain of the blow on the breast more than last Night—
							The skin was not broken on my hip but the bone was painful and sore, and
							a spot on my hip and thigh as large as a common dinner table plate is
							crimson with extravasated blood. It was bathed with vinegar, but as it
							did not pain me much I walked out—called upon <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lewis Tappan</persRef>, and had some conversation with him respecting
							the case of <persRef ref="torrey-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torrey</persRef>. At the Bank of
							America, I received in its bills 262.50 on the orders from the Patriotic
							Bank at Washington— At the door of the Bank I met <persRef ref="sedgwick-theodore3">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sedgwick</persRef> with a passing salutation— On
							returning to the Astor house, the inflammation upon my hip was so
							exasperated as to produce spasms in the calf of my leg— I was obliged to
							lie down, and to have the part rubbed with cold vinegar— After an hour
							of rest I took a Cab and went to N. 122 Bleecker Street where I found
							<persRef ref="marchant-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward S. Marchant</persRef> Portrait Painter.
							He had charged me 200 dollars for copies of two small profiles of
							<persRef ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>— I objected to this price and offered

						<p>Before I left the Astor house yesterday, <persRef ref="wainwright-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and did not see him—the second I met him in the passage just as <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">the
							ladies</persRef> were leaving the house to go on board the Steamer— I had time but
							to shake hands with him and part— The case was the same with <persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> De Windt</persRef>, who was in the city, from cedar
							grove, and is publishing a book. <persRef ref="parker-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis Tappan</persRef>. They are raising a

							Sedgwick’s</persRef> Veto, of the Evening Post in pamphlets; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker wants a commendatory Letter upon
							the pamphlet from me addressed to him. I declined, but took the proposal
							for consideration— At dinner at the Astor house, I sat next to <persRef ref="may-samuel">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel May</persRef> of Boston who was going to
							Saratoga— At 5 P.M. The Steamer Rhode-Island, <persRef ref="thayer-s2">Captain S. Thayer</persRef> left the
							Battery pier— N. 1— The Cleopatra, for Norwich loosening from the other
							side of the pier at the same moment— We took the lead little more than
							the length of the boat and held it till the darkness of Night parted
							us.— The weather was of the most exquisite beauty of Nature— We had
							about 300 fellow passengers, not one of whom did I see that I knew. Mary
							said she met and held conversation with <persRef ref="lloyd-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							James Lloyd</persRef> of Boston. We had two State-rooms, each with two berths— I
							had scarcely time to remark how the bark cleaved the glassy surfaced
							waters of Long-Island Sound Sunset past 7. By dark, about 9. I turned in
							to my berth—steeped my senses in forgetfulness, and at half past 12 the
							bell sounded Stonington in ten minutes. We landed from the boat,
							scrambled an ascent into the Cars— Sat a full and tedious half hour;
							perhaps three quarter, waiting for the transportation of the baggage
							from the boat to the train of cars— Started at half-past one— Crossed
							the river by daylight, before Sunrise to Providence— Entered the new
							train of Cars, and as the Clocks had struck six—alighted at the Depot at
							the foot of Boston Common— We engaged the Carriage from the United
							States Hotel— Breakfasted at that house; and at half past eight this
							morning landed at my own house in Quincy; blessing divine providence
							that we are once more safe at home, though snatched as burning brands
							from the fire. <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">daughter</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4;adams-arthur">four Sons</persRef> were with us in

							sleepless Nights that they soon retired to bed. I walked up the hill and
							dined with my Son and his family. I limp with considerable difficulty
							and some pain. Afternoon visit from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Neither <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> nor myself can yet ascertain the extent to which we have
							been personally injured by that terrific fall of Thursday Night, on
							alighting from the Cars at Jersey City. The shock upon her nerves jar’d
							her whole frame, and suspended all consciousness and animation for
							nearly ten minutes— The stroke upon the breast broke the glass of the
							breast pin, and the stricture on the breast is yet sore and feverish.
							She kept her bed all day yesterday; last Night and this day till
							evening. She sent for <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef> who came,
							and applied leeches to her breast; from which she obtained some relief.
							The suffusion of blood on and around my left hip looks frightful—the
							pain is slight and passing away, but the cords of the leg are growing
							stiffer, and make me limp. I rode to and from Meeting, both parts of
							this day. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached in the forenoon
							from 1. Corinthians 12.21. “And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have
							no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.”
							This is in substance the old Roman Fable of <persRef ref="lanatus-agrippa">Menenius Agrippa</persRef>, which I
							suppose <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> borrowed from his familiar acquaintance with Roman history.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt noticed as one of the striking
							characteristics of the Scriptures, that they deliver instruction, in the
							form of parables and fables— He noticed especially those of <persRef ref="jotham">Jotham</persRef> to
							the men of Shechem, and those of <persRef ref="nathan">Nathan</persRef> to <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>— They are undoubtedly
							among the most impressive parts of the Bible; narrative enlists the
							imagination—narrative takes hold of the sympathies, and strikes its
							roots into the Memory— It exercise all those faculties too in the
							process of composition, and is by all odds the most difficult part of
							writing— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts discourse was an argument
							upon the mutual dependence of all the members of a community upon one
							another, and he closed with an illustration of his own, introducing a
							dialogue of self-glorification and disparagement, between the roots and
							leaves and blossoms of trees, which will leave the whole sermon fresh on
							my memory, and keep in preservation the didactic parts. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon discourse was from
							Philippians 4.8. [“]Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,
							whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
							things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
							good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think
							of these things.” A general exhortation to truth, justice, honesty, a
							modification of honesty, purity, another, loveliness, and good
							report—virtue and praise— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt considered
							these several specifications in succession— He has improved much in his
							mode of delivery, using much more action, and animating his discourse
							even to vehemence. None of our Ladies attended public worship; and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles Adams</persRef> was confined at home this
							afternoon. Charles passed the evening here. My mind was not sufficiently
							settled to enable me to devote all the day to the most suitable
							occupations—</p>

						<p>The fall at Jersey city, is yet severely felt, both by <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and by
							myself; and still we know not how long and how far it will continue to
							be felt.— She is better this day; but still confined to her chamber. I
							am yet lame, and crippled, for walking. Patience, Resignation and
							blessing for the escape of us both from heavier calamity is the dictate
							of duty. In other respects, I luxuriate with delight in the tranquility
							and indolent repose of home— But indolence is waste and loss of time—
							This fable of <persRef ref="lanatus-agrippa">Menenius Agrippa</persRef>, stole upwards of hour of my time, in
							hunting for it, first in <persRef ref="livius-titus">Livy</persRef>, where, by the Index to the Bipont Edition
							Vol 13. I found it Book 2.32. and then in <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> <persRef ref="coriolanus-gaius">Coriolanus</persRef>, where
							it is charmingly dramatised in the first Scene— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> paid me a visit this afternoon; and brought back the
							first Volume of <persRef ref="warton-thomas">Warton’s</persRef> History of English Poetry; which belongs to the
							Adams town Library. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt had borrowed
							the 3. Volumes last autumn with the intention of preparing a course of
							Lectures on English Literature— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
							retains the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> volumes of Warton, but has not accomplished his purpose of
							preparing a course of Lectures on English Literature. Well executed it
							would be a work of great usefulness; but it would be too large—too
							complicated— Warton’s history refers only to a very small fragment of
							the subject. It is the History of English Poetry from the close of the
								11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the commencement of the
							eighteenth century, from 1100 to 1700. It comes not even down to the
							school of <persRef ref="warton-thomas">Queen Ann’s</persRef> age— It is preceded by two Dissertations— One upon
							the origin of romantic fiction in Europe; and the other on the
							introduction of learning into Europe— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt remarked that Warton’s subject does not embrace Shakespear, and
							although he does not wholly overlook the drama, he treats it very
							superficially— I observed that it would be difficult to give much
							interest to English Literature before the age of <persRef ref="elizabeth-i">Elizabeth</persRef>, but that a
							philosophical disquisition upon the genius and characters of the
							cotemporaries Shakespear, <persRef ref="spencer-edmund">Spenser</persRef> and <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef> would be rich in results— I
							spoke also of my published remarks on Shakespears <persRef ref="juliet">Juliet</persRef>, <persRef ref="kinglear">Lear</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="desdemona">Desdemona</persRef>, and <persRef ref="hamlet">Hamlet</persRef>: and lent him a volume of miscellanies containing
							my replication upon the character of Desdemona— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> came this
							afternoon, with four Deeds from the Trustees of <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Nicholas Boylston’s</persRef>
							Estate of lots of land in Charlestown—one to <persRef ref="hall-andrew">Andrew Hall</persRef>, two to <persRef ref="whitten-jw">J. W.
								Whitten</persRef> and one to <persRef ref="adams-edward4">Edward Adams</persRef>—to be executed— I went with him this
							Evening to <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef> to execute
							and acknowledge them before him as a Justice of Peace; but he said that
							although his commission had been renewed since it had expired; he had
							not taken the Oaths under the new Commission, and was therefore not
							qualified to take the acknowledgment of Deeds: so that we were obliged
							to defer the Execution to some other time— M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Soon after I rose this morning it began to sprinkle, so lightly that for
							nearly an hour I thought it a mere transient shower; but it continued
							and increased to a moderate steady rain till between 2 and 3 afternoon
							when it held up without clearing off— I was confined to the house by the
							weather and by my lameness. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was very sick, last night and all
							this day— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned home to dine. He and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
							wife</persRef> passed a short evening here— My time is never tedious when I have
							my books around me; but there are so many and upon subjects so
							different, like baits upon a bundle of fish hooks, that I make after
							all, no profitable use of my time. After bringing up the arrears of this
							diary I commenced writing an address to my Constituents to give them an
							account of my conduct in the discharge of their trust— But precisely
							because this was the first and most burdensome task which I had imposed
							upon myself for the first moments of leisure at home, I found it
							insupportably irksome, and barely commenced and abandoned it— <persRef ref="lanatus-agrippa">Menenius
							Agrippa</persRef> and his fable occurred to me again and looked for and found it
							in <persRef ref="wrangham-francis">Wrangham’s</persRef> <persRef ref="langhorne-john">Langhornes</persRef> <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef>, and there I was referred to <persRef ref="dionysiushalicarnassensis">Dionysius
							Halicarnassensis</persRef> for the most detailed account of the whole story. This
							I am yet to examine— I looked into the first volume of <persRef ref="warton-thomas">Warton’s</persRef> history
							of English Poetry; found myself wading into deep waters, and for fear of
							losing my foothold immediately withdrew.— The charm of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon</persRef> was
							irresisible— I took up the first volume of his works in 5. quarto
							volumes—London 1765. and began upon his Life by <persRef ref="mallet-david">David Mallet</persRef>— I mean to
							pursue this steadily: a few pages every day. So strange a person—the
							wisest—greatest—meanest of mankind— Is there not instruction in every
							incident of such a man’s life— I see his relations with his father, <persRef ref="bacon-nicholas">Sir
								Nicholas Bacon</persRef> Lord keeper—with <persRef ref="elizabeth-i">Elizabeth</persRef> and <persRef ref="james-i">James</persRef>—with the <persRef ref="cecil-william">Cecils
									father</persRef> and <persRef ref="cecil-robert">son</persRef>, with <persRef ref="devereux-robert">Essex</persRef>, and <persRef ref="coke-edward">Coke</persRef>, on the winding Staircase of human
							affairs. A short portion of this was a dose for meditation— After dinner
							in rummaging over the chests of old pamphlets which I would assort in
							some order, I pounced upon a collection of Documents numbered 155. dated
							Department of State April 15. 1818. and marked as referred to in the
							Report of the Secretary of State of the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							March, accompanying the message to the House of Representatives of that
							date— This pamphlet contains the whole correspondence of the Negotiation
							of <persRef ref="pinckney-charles2">Charles Pinckney</persRef> and <persRef ref="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef> with the Spanish Government at
							Aranjuez from January to May 1805. concerning the claims of the United
							States founded on the Louisiana Treaty— P. 15 of this pamphlet marks the
							first assertion of our claim to the perdido, and the Bravo—page 20.
							proposes an article for adjustment of the boundary—p. 88. <persRef ref="cevallos-pedro">Don Pedro

							Bank, the order of the Bank of the Metropolis at Washington upon the
							Merchant’s Bank at Boston— We went into the adjoining burying yard,
							where the family tomb has now my name now carved on a granite stone in
							advance over its iron doors.— There are already the remains of ten

							the granite side wall, there are spaces for two, marble tablets on which

							only son of my great grand father, whose funeral from my father’s, now

							<persRef ref="fiske-moses">Moses Fiske</persRef>, died 24. July 1708 and was buried in this tomb, but her

							<persRef ref="marshall-john3">Fairfield’s</persRef> journal, published in the Appendix to <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef> two century discourses. She was the
							mother of my great-grandfather— During the remainder of the day I was
							idling. Resumed the reading of <persRef ref="mallet-david">David Mallet’s</persRef> life of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon</persRef>; which
							as it proceeds excites more and more of curiosity— The degree of his
							obsequiousness and servility to <persRef ref="elizabeth-i">Elizabeth</persRef> and her favourite Essex, and
							his subsequent treachery and cruelty to <persRef ref="devereux-robert">Essex</persRef>— Then the baseness of his
							submission to <persRef ref="james-i">James</persRef> and to <persRef ref="villiers-george">Buckingham</persRef>— His venality and corruption as
							Chancellor and his ignominious abandonment of self-defence upon his
							trial—with his transcendent Genius, his overruling passion for the
							liberal arts and the advancement of Science, and his indefatigable
							application to studious labour there is a combination of qualities
							equally astonishing and painful. Unbounded admiration and heart
							sickening contempt; how can they be entertained at once for one and the
							same person? We had evening visits from the <persRef ref="waterston-robert">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Albans</persRef>, by <persRef ref="mallet-david">David Mallet</persRef>, prefixed to the
							Edition of his works in 5 volumes Quarto.— And I began the perusal of
							his works.— This man was a prodigy and a paradox— He should be studied
							as a Chronometer or a steam-engine should be studied— As a piece of
							moral and intellectual mechanism. Why did I not so study him fifty years
							ago? and of what use will it be for me to study him now? Indulgence of
							curiosity— A longing thirst for knowledge— A refuge from the sickening
							realities of life, and desponding anticipations of the future, may
							perhaps carry me through this undertaking. The general reflection upon
							the life of Bacon is the melancholy aspect of great vicissitudes of
							Fortune— His transcendent talents, rapacious ambition, and disgusting
							sycophancy combined to raise him to the pinnacle of opulence, of honours
							and of power. The causes of his downfall were his connivance with
							briberies practiced by his servants, and with whom he shared the
							plunder— But <persRef ref="james-i">James the first</persRef> himself, and his minion <persRef ref="villiers-george">Buckingham</persRef> were
							deeply implicated in the charges upon which he was convicted, and it was
							more of their sins than of his own that he bore the penalty— James
							remitted successively all the parts of the sentence against him, and
							although he had been declared incapable of holding any office of trust
							whatever, he was yet summoned to the first Parliament of <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles the
								first</persRef> in 1625— It does not appear that he attended— He died at the <persRef ref="howard-thomas">Earl
							of Arundel’s</persRef> house in Highgate on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of April 1626. at the age of 64.— He was married after the age of 40,
							but never had a child and <persRef ref="bacon-alice">his wife</persRef> survived him 20 years— After the
							remission of his fine he was severel pinched with penury and his
							supplicatory Letter to the king for relief is agonizing.</p>

						<p>Two young men, one named <persRef ref="u">Salisbury</persRef> from New-York, and the other <persRef ref="u">Nelson</persRef>
							from Boston, came out for mere curiosity to see the house— They were
							going away without enquiring for me, but I went out and spoke to them
							Salisbury said he had come from New-York, to see Boston on Bunker’s
							hill, and this house. I had also friendly visits from <persRef ref="whitney-john3">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> John Whitney</persRef> and <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Josiah Brigham</persRef>— I walked before dinner to the Post Office to
							despatch 3 letters and for exercise— But my thigh bone is yet sore, and
							the sinews are strained by walking— The extravasation of blood has
							spread downwards to the calf of the leg, and laterally to the left side
							of the loins, looking dark and threatening— The confinement to the house
							is tedious; I endeavour to cheer it by reading and travelled this day
							through the two Books of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Francis Bacon</persRef>, of the Proficience and
							advancement of Learning—human and divine— The work is dedicated to <persRef ref="bacon-francis">king
							James the first</persRef>, and its introduction inspires a mingled sentiment of
							admiration of the boldness and grandeur of the design, which it
							announces, and of heart ache at the depth of degradation to which it
							sinks in servile adulation with which it besmears the king— It is
							presented as in the Nature and analogy of a free will offering from a
							worshiper to his Deity, alluding first to the daily sacrifices, and the
							occasional oblations of the Levitical Law—to which he likens the
							faithful performance of the duties of his official employments, and then
							proposing a voluntary superaddition of tribute appropriate to the
							transcendent learning of the king the wisest the greatest the most
							perfect monarch that ever sat upon a throne— And this was James the
							first! And this unparalleled royal learning should not only prove the
							glory of the then present age, but should be transmitted down to after
							ages as an imperishable monument for the benefit and admiration of
							Mankind— And this work was not the consummation of that mighty purport
							itself—but a mere outline of a plan to turn the royal cogitations to its
							atchievement— The stupendous magnitude of this undertaking; the courtly
							cunning ingenuity and meanness of suggesting it to the king as if it was
							an enterprize of his own, the lofty consciousness of its sublimity, and
							the sly implied disclaimer of it, as any thing more on the part of the
							author than a mere speculative hin to be moulded into form and substance
							are all deserving of profound meditation—of more than I can give.— He
							proceeds then to enumerate and to refute the objections against
							learning.— Of Divines— Of Politicians— As arising from the Fortunes,
							Manners, or Studies of Learned men— He discusses the Diseases of
							Learning, the peccant humours, which have not only given impediment to
							the proficience of Learning but have given also occasion to the
							traducement thereof— And he closes the book with a copious and cheering
							exhibition of the dignity of Learning—a theme upon which I follow him
							with delight.— The style is a continuous, and perpetual citation of
							classical and scriptural quotations. I rode this afternoon, with the
							<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;adams-abigail4;hellen-mary">Ladies</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-arthur">little Arthur</persRef>, as a substitute for exercise.</p>

						<p>Rain again, all the former part of this day, which together with my sore
							limb confined me to the house. <persRef ref="cole-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cole</persRef> is
							the Editor of a weekly journal, called the Boston Cultivator—and came to
							invite my subscription to the paper, of which he left one of last
							Saturday as a sample— I declined for the present alledging the multitude
							of Newspapers which I daily receive, as more than I know what to do
							with. We had some conversation about farming, of which he agreed with
							me, that a man absent eighth months of the year from his farm could know
							very little— In the Boston Newspapers of this morning, I noticed that
							the Brig William L. Jones, <persRef ref="davis-samuel3">Captain Davis</persRef>, arrived yesterday from
							Georgetown, and I sent <persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> with a waggon to Boston, and he brought
							out the three chests of books and papers, which he had ship’d on the
								2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this month— I made some progress
							in reading <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef>, on the advancement of Learning. Finished the first and
							began the second book— In the dedication to <persRef ref="james-i">king James</persRef>, gross as his
							adulation is, it is not random praise— He extols him for four specific
							virtues—a virtuous <hi rend="italic">disposition</hi>, a virtuous <hi
								rend="italic">ambition</hi>—a virtuous observation of the Laws of
								<hi rend="italic">marriage</hi>, and a virtuous and most Christian
							desire of <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi>— These were real virtues of
							James’s character, and they are genuine king-becoming graces.— and it is
							piteous to reflect that with all these virtues and with all that
							learning for which he was not less famed, his character as a king and as
							a man is universally despised— He was weak—</p>
						<lg><l>Fallen Cherub—to be weak is miserable, doing or suffering—</l></lg>
						<p>For the fulsomeness of the flattery, I was seeking some excuse and it
							occurred to me that in monarchical Governments, this beplastering of the
							mighty man is conventional and formal; like your humble servant at the
							close of a Letter, or the greetings of acquaintances, and mere
							strangers, professing to be very obsequious to each other—meaning of
							course nothing of what is said— In the argument for the advancement of
							Science, I thought the objections, with which he began against it, were
							so frivolous, and trivial that they scarcely deserved the trouble of
							answering them. There is however something more forcible in the
							catalogue of the diseases of learning.— <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume</persRef> speaks contemptuously of
							the style of Bacon— Its most remarkable character to my mind is the
							copious and original turn of his thoughts, with the incessant quotations
							from the bibles and from the Greek and Latin Classics.— I was not
							entirely satisfied with the life of Bacon by <persRef ref="mallet-david">Mallet</persRef>; and took up that of
							the Biographia Britannica, which is somewhat longer.— But the mode of
							writing with a load of Commentary always interrupting the narrative is
							intolerably tedious and incompatible with that <hi rend="italic"
								>unity</hi> which should be the first Law of written
							composition.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was very sick all night, and I rose at 3. to light a lamp— She
							was confined this day till the Evening to her bed— I thought my wound
							was healed, till on walking to Meeting, I found it far otherwise— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached from Romans 12.21. “Be not
							overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” This text naturally
							introduced some disquisition upon the nature of good and evil, and the
							old perplexing enquiry why a Supreme Almighty creator, wise and good
							permits the existence of <hi rend="italic">evil</hi>— A question which
							can never be solved— The Book of Genesis in its account of the Creation
							says, that in the process of the six days work, God surveyed it in
							successive parcels, and saw that it was <hi rend="italic">good</hi>.—
							But good for what? good for whom? Good and evil are relative terms, but
							their relation is not to action but to sufferance— Creation is an act of
							power— Neither good nor evil to the Creator. Neither good nor evil to
							the created inanimate—good and evil have reference only to sensation—
							Sensation is individual, and what is good to one may be evil to another—
							Life, is enjoyment, and therefore is good; but unless we were commanded
							to love God, I see no reason by the Law of Nature why it should be
							required. But the meaning of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef> in
							this passage is to advise the forgiveness of injuries— It is the
							concluding verse of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of the
							Epistle to the Romans, the summary of the whole doctrine of Christianity
							for this world— If there existed of the whole body of the holy
							scriptures nothing but this 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter to
							the Romans, it would form the text of the most perfect religion that was
							ever devised upon Earth— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave notice
							that immediately after the service of the afternoon, there would be an
							meeting of the members of the Church for the election of a Deacon, in
							the place of the late <persRef ref="savil-samuel">Deacon Samuel Savil</persRef>. This was the first indication
							that I received of the death of Deacon Savil; of that of <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon William
							Spear</persRef> I had received advice some months since— I rode home, and to and
							from meeting this afternoon. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> came
							out from Boston, and dined and spent the day with us. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s text for his afternoon Sermon was
							from John 18.38. “<persRef ref="pontiuspilate">Pilate</persRef> saith unto him, What is truth?” He observed
							that perhaps Pilate put this question in a jeering Spirit; but he would
							suppose that of those who now heard him discourse some would with deep
							anxiety and sincere piety put to themselves often the same question,
							what is truth? And the conclusion to which after varied arguments he
							urged them to come was that Truth consisted in the firm conviction of
							the existence and omnipotence of God, of the immortality of our own
							Souls, and our responsibility beyond the grave— He closed with a very
							pathetic appeal to the hearts of his hearers upon this subject— The
							meeting of the members of the church for the choice of a deacon was held
							immediately after the service— The election was by ballot. The number of
							votes 28. of which 26 were for <persRef ref="baxter-george">George Baxter</persRef>. He was present and upon a
							call from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt enquiring if he accepted

						<p><date>22. IV. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>A day wholly uninterrupted by visitors; and much though not entirely
							confined to the house— The contusion upon my thigh bone is yet sore, and
							the flesh over it swollen; and it is angered by the exercise of walking—
							The extravasation of blood has discoloured the whole length of the
							thigh, and descended by the knee pit quite to the calf of the leg,
							creeping round at the same time upon the groin— All round the injured
							spot the surface of the skin is recovering its natural colour. But
							directly over the spot there is swelling, induration, heat, and slight
							pain to the touch. I have had some apprehension of internal suppuration;
							and <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef> who examined the part on
							Sunday advised the application of leeches. Without examination, he
							repeated the advice this morning, but a diminution of the menacing
							symptoms, encouraging a hope of recovery by the vis medicatrix Naturae,
							I postponed receiving the visit of the leeches till tomorrow. I rode
							after dinner with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef>, and
							<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> youngest boy <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef> round through Milton; and occupied the
							rest of the day, with the second book of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> advancement of
							learning, and with the life of Bacon, in the Biographia Britannica— The
							second book on the advancement of learning opens with a brief stimulant
							of flattery to <persRef ref="james-i">king James</persRef>, reminding him of the peculiar inducement to
							him to illustrate his name and reign by the advancement of knowledge for
							the benefit of after ages, inasmuch as he has progeny of his own, and a
							prospect of more, while his immediate predecessor <persRef ref="elizabeth-i">Elizabeth</persRef>, was a
							sojourner in the world, in respect of her unmarried life— He then
							proceeds to consider what had been undertaken and performed by kings and
							others for the increase and advancement of learning. Genius
							invents—talent combines, skill marshals, and judgment separates ideas—
							In embracing the whole compass of human knowledge, Bacon begins by
							dividing it into parts, and presents in a table the General Distribution
							of human knowledge— “The parts of human learning have reference to the
							three parts of Man’s Understanding which is the seat of learning;
							History to his <hi rend="italic">Memory</hi>, Poesy to his <hi
								rend="italic">Imagination</hi>, and Philosophy to his <hi
								rend="italic">Reason</hi>—[”] The subdivisions of this
							classification are desperately numerous and complicated and after
							enumerating them he specifies upon each separate part of the system
							those which had, and those which had not before that time been
							sufficiently explored by human labour. It is not a little extraordinary
							that with such a range of intellectual power, he should have rejected
							the <persRef ref="copernicus-nicolaus">Copernican</persRef> system of Astronomy, though he acknowledges that it
							accounts for all the apparent movements of the Heavenly orbs.— My
							progress in the reading of the life is slow, and painfully laborious by
							remarking the gigantic intellect and the moral obliquity combined in the
							character of this man.— The union of Power and of Virtue is so
							delightful in contemplation, that I shrink from the demonstration how
							far it was from being realized in the person of this great bad man— The
							present age is prolific of the depravity if not of the greatness.</p>

							which I sent by <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> last week to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>Sargent</persRef>. But <persRef ref="bowditch-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch</persRef> the Lawyer is of opinion that the

							of his subdivisions of the Sciences has already crowded my Memory into
							confusion— I should need a close study of a week to embrace them all,
							with discrimination— He advises the study of the Mathematics for a
							bird-witted child—that is who has not the faculty of attention— I feel
							dismally the want of this faculty, and believe that I ought to enter
							upon a course of Mathematics. The Life in the Biographia is more

						<p><persRef ref="spear-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spear</persRef> is an itinerant lecturer for an
							Anti-Slavery Abolition Society, and he came with a copy of my Letter to
							<persRef ref="loring-thomas2">Thomas Loring</persRef> of 8. August 1842. in which it is stated that the Slaves
							of this Union were then represented in the National House of
							Representatives by 25 members, and enquired whether this was the fact
								<hi rend="italic">now</hi>. I told him that the statement made upon
							the apportionment, by the census of 1830. when the house of
							Representatives consisted of 242 members. But that the present
							apportionment is fixed by the census of 1840— The house consisting of
							223 members— The standard of apportionment 70680.— The numbers of Slaves
							2,487,213— The standard gives one representative for 117800 Slaves, or
							21 members and a decimal fraction of 113. for the whole number— But as
							an element of power, the whole delegations from the Slave holding
							States, and each member represents the whole Slave-holding interest, and
							the whole mass of Slave owners— The number of their members therefore is

						<dateline>Quincy Thursday 25 July 1844</dateline>
						<p><date>25. IV. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>I had promised <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, to go
							into Boston this morning, to consult with him and <persRef ref="bowditch-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch</persRef> about the sale of the Boylston
							Estate in School Street, and I have examined <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ward Nicholas Boylston’s</persRef> Will to ascertain the extent of the
							limitation of the powers of the Executors to dispose of the real Estate—
							I find the words of the will are—the Estates which belonged to <hi
								rend="italic">my Ancestors</hi> shall be the last sold. Now the
							Estate in School Street belonged to <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef> the third of the
							name in lineal descent including the first emigrant from England in
							1636— He was not an ancestor of Ward Nicholas, but his uncle—brother to
							his mother <persRef ref="hallowell-mary">Mary Hallowell</persRef>, and Son of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas4">Thomas Boylston</persRef> and <persRef ref="boylston-sarah">Sarah
							Morecock</persRef>.— This Thomas was the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Son of
							the first emigrant <persRef ref="boylston-thomas5">Thomas</persRef>. I find these particulars in a genealogical
							table compiled by <persRef ref="brooks-alexander">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> A. S. Brooks</persRef> 28
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1827. and copied by me 13.
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1839. A question remains whether
							the Estate in School Street was purchased by the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Thomas Boylston, or descended to him from his father. In
							the latter case, it comes within the limitation of the authority to
							sell— This question can be settled only by the title deeds.— I wished
							also to go in to Boston to attend the monthly meeting of the
							Massachusetts Historical Society But about Sunrise it began to sprinkle
							and I waited till near 9. O’Clock hoping that it would hold up—instead
							of which it came to a steady rain— I countermanded the order for the
							carriage, and passed the day without going beyond the yard— My reading
							was so desultory, and my attention so distracted that I retain nothing
							that I read— I had well nigh forgotten my Letters to <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">T. Aspinwall</persRef> for <persRef ref="burnet-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Burnet</persRef>— I finally
							enclosed them in a short Letter to him addressed them as he had directed
							to New-York.— I received this morning a New-York Daily Tribune of last
							Monday, containing a translation through the New Orleans Bulletin, from
							the Diario del Gobierno of Mexico, of a Correspondence between <persRef ref="green-benjamin2">Ben E.
								Green</persRef>, son of <persRef ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> chargé d’Affaires of the United States in
							Mexico, and <persRef ref="bocanegra-jose">Jose Maria de Bocanegra</persRef>, the Mexican Minister of Foreign
							Affairs: from the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st</hi> of last May, whereby the Mexican
							Government was notified of the Treaty for the annexation of Texas which
							<persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef> had negotiated and sent to the Senate on the<space/>of
							April— I have also received two Sermons, one preached at the
							consecration of <persRef ref="eastburn-manton">Bishop Eastburn</persRef>, by <persRef ref="delancey-william">Bishop De Lancey</persRef> 29. December 1842
							at Boston, and called the faithful Bishop; and the other by <persRef ref="park-edwards">Edwards A.
							Park</persRef> Professor at the Andover theological seminary, delivered on the
								28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May last at Boston, on the
							duties of the New-England Clergy— These Sermons, are the bane and
							antidote to each other. The New-York Evangelist of 11. July contains a
							narrative of a new expulsion of the Jesuits from Persia— This various
							and desultory reading absorbs my attention so that when I turn to the
							second Book of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef> on the advancement of learning, my Memory becomes a
							cullender, and the stream of thought runs through as fast as I pour it
							in— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> read this evening two Chapters of <persRef ref="capel-george">Coningsby</persRef>— I suffered last
							Night with the rhumatism.</p>

						<p>The confinement to which I still subject myself owing to the disability

							made a necessary of life, is sinking me into a state of Apathy and
							stagnation of the blood. I have every evening on going to bed an

							shoes for subsistence, but he aspires to loftier destinies, and is
							desirous of acquiring the Science of music—to qualify himself for
							teaching it— This of course requires expence, and he comes to me as a

							Evening visit from <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George W. Beale</persRef>— I

							at Lebanon springs, written that day.— I finished reading the second
							book of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef> on the advancement of learning; and now I ought to compass
							the whole extent of the work, but cannot, without reading it over again
							and again— These two books however on the advancement of learning form a

							nine Books in the fourth Volume of this Edition, in Latin without any
							translation, and is itself only the first part of the Instauratio magna,
							the second part of which is the Novum Organum, like wise in Latin
							without translation— In the distribution of the Sciences and especially
							of those which concern the mind there are in this book a multitude of
							observations upon men and manners which would have been equally if not
							more appropriate in the Essays. There is in them a depth and compass of
							intellect admirable, and surprizing; but always some thing <hi
								rend="italic">louche</hi> in the moral aspect.— The plan of the work
							is original; but the thoughts in detail are all borrowed; and the

							which at every return gives warning of nearer approach if not advent of

							It was a nearly idle day for reading or writing; and this day was still

							Hancock</persRef> was born, and the surrounding beautiful village—we then went to
							the temple, the door of which was open, and sexton in the porch under
							the belfry, and over the vaults. He had not the key of the vault where
							<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> repose, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson
							viewed the marble tablet, at the right hand of the pulpit as you go up
							the central aisle, erected in 1829. with the inscription upon it written

						<p><persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce</persRef> of Brookline preached, this morning
							from a clause in Colossians 3.4. “Christ, who is our life.”— This figure
							of speech unintelligible in its literal sense was first used by Jesus
							Christ himself— “I am the resurrection and the life.” the life—not
							saying whose life— <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>, speaking to the Christians of Colosse says
							Christ is <hi rend="italic">our</hi> life—and in the verse preceding
							that of the text he says— [“]For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
							Christ in God”—and the whole verse from which the text was taken reads
							[“]When Christ, our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with
							him in glory.”— This Epistle to the Colossians is one of the shortest
							books of the new Testament, consisting only of 4. short chapters, in
							which the peculiar Christian doctrine of the atonement is blended with a
							summary of moral precepts for the regulation of private and domestic
							life. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce considered the assertion in
							the text that Christ is our life, under five several aspects 1. As
							Christ is the source 2. the manifestation 3. the hope, 4 the comfort and
							5 the resurrection to eternal life. Upon each of these points he made
							remarks apposite to the text, but from which I could draw no very clear
							practical conclusion.— It was a dissertation of the old school of which
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce is one of the oldest
							patriarchs. A graduate of Harvard of 1793.— He gave notice at the
							request of <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> that the communion would
							be administered next Sunday.— He came home with me, and dined with us.—
							His afternoon text was from John 19.25. [“]Now there stood by the cross
							of Jesus, <persRef ref="lunt-mary">his mother</persRef>, and his mother’s sister, <persRef ref="maryofclopas">Mary</persRef> the wife of
							<persRef ref="clopas">Cleophas</persRef>, and <persRef ref="marymagdalen">Mary Magdalene</persRef>.” (Question of construction, was the sister
							of Jesus’s mother, and Mary the wife of Cleophas the same person, or two
							persons, and if the same how came the two sisters to be both named
							Mary?) The motive for the selection of this text seems to have been, to
							pronounce a magnificent panegyric upon the female sex— I believe the
							superiority of the female sex in all the social and benevolent virtues,
							and am not sure that the tribute of the Doctor’s gallantry was out of
							place. I had scarcely returned from the afternoon service when <persRef ref="clapp-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> came in from Boston, with <persRef ref="clapp-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> W. W. Clapp</persRef> Editor of the Boston Evening
							Gazette who took tea and spent the evening with us. They visited with
							me, my garden Nursery and seminary; and witnessed the ruin of my trees.—

							County-road—traverse centrally my lot in front of my house and the
							Hancock lot given by <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to the town, and pass close westward of
							the burying ground.— It would scarcely be possible to carry through a
							line more injurious to my property, both by the danger of firing my
							barns and by cutting up into fragments the most valuable lot of land
							that I possess. But it is useless to complain and idle to remonstrate.
							While standing out at the corner where they were to pass, a phaeton came
							along with a gentleman and Lady in it— The man got out, and came up to

							make enquiry concerning two Portraits of my father, and <persRef ref="washington-george">President

							answered last Saturday, and according to his request had sent the
							portraits to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my son’s</persRef> office 23. Court Street Boston— And that I had
							been so much pleased with the Portraits that I had exact copies of them
							taken by an eminent Portrait Painter, <persRef ref="marchant-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							apples.— A person by the name of <persRef ref="fiske-samuel">Samuel L. Fiske</persRef> of Southbridge in the

							the purpose of seeing me, and having to say that he had seen me— <persRef ref="tufts-mercy">Mercy

							<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, who has come back from her

							Austrian chargé d’Affaires at Washington; and afterwards one from <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef>, who was very urgent in soliciting
							my attendance at the Hingham celebration of the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of August. I persisted in declining, assigned my lameness
							from which I have not yet sufficiently recovered, as my principal
							reason, but hinting at some others, not less monitory to detain me at
							home.— I told him I had answered with some prolixity Miss Thaxter’s
							Letter of invitation, and explained my unwillingness to take part in the
							celebration of this anniversary.— He said he should go to Boston again
							to-morrow, and on his return in the Evening would stop, and take the
							letter to Miss Thaxter and deliver it to her.— I began to read the Sylva
							Sylvarum, or Natural History in ten Centuries: each consisting of 100
							experiments— There is a preface to this work by <persRef ref="rawley-william">William Rawley</persRef>, Lord
							Bacon’s Secretary written for publication before his death, but not
							published till after that event— He says it was intended as a third part
							of the Instauration. As a middle link between the De Augmentis
							Scientiarum, an the Novum Organum— But Bacon hesitated whether to
							publish it or not during his life time, and it does not appear at all
							essential to the great work. It is divided into experiments in consort,
							and experiments solitary; and it has more the appearance of a Cookery
							book, or collection of Confectioner’s receipts than a philosophical
							system of Natural history— It begins with experiments of percolation—or
							the straining and passing of bodies one through another— And the
							remarkable fact is that he falsifies the result of the experiment. He
							says dig a pit on the sea shore above high water mark, and sink it below
							low-water Mark— As the tide flows in, it will fill with fresh and
							potable water— This is a mistake—the water will not be potable, nor even
							potable though it will lose many of its saline particles, by <hi
								rend="italic">evaporation</hi>. Charles spent the evening here, but
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> did not come.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 4 51. set 7.18.</p>
						<p>For the first time since my return home I was able to go up the hill and
							see the Sun rise from the South-east corner of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house— My
							Chronometer is 51 minutes in advance of the Sun. It qualifies not a
							little the pleasure which I experience in witnessing the phenomenon of
							Sunrise to observe what progress of Southing he has already made from
							the solstitial point of declination. From this day forward the nights
							lengthen and the days shorten till the winter solstice, and I must soon
							rely upon lamplight for the morning hours— I received a note from <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef>, that he could not call here this
							afternoon, as he had promised yesterday— I took therefore the Letter to
							<persRef ref="thaxter-anna">Miss Thaxter</persRef> to the Post-Office— It began to sprinkle as I was on my
							way, and before I got home became a shower followed by others all the
							remainder of the day, which confined me to the house— <persRef ref="johnson-alexander2">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> A. S. Johnson</persRef> dined at <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef>. I received a Letter from
							<persRef ref="whitney-william2">William Wallace Whitney</persRef> at New-Orleans, enclosing the Morning Herald of
							that city of 17. July current— In that paper, there is printed a Letter
							from the same Whitney to <persRef ref="bryant-william">William Cullen Bryant</persRef> Editor of the New-York
							Evening Post. It is an elaborate and formal defence and attempted
							vindication of the character of <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General Edmund Pendleton Gaines</persRef> from the
							charge of rashness in an editorial article of the Evening Post.— In his
							Letter to me enclosing this paper M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney
							refers to my address to my constituents at Braintree of 17. September
							1842. in which he says I took occasion to allude to the measures of
							General Gaines on the Sabine during the Mexican and Sabine War, and as
							he, Whitney conceives, did him injustice— He therefore calls my
							attention to the printed Letter and requests a reconsideration of my
							opinion— The printed Letter is in so small a type that I was obliged to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. S. Johnson for reading it to me;
							and it will require from me a calm, considerate and spirited answer.—
							But for this I must take time Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">daughter</persRef> spent
							the Evening with us.— But all my reading of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef> is suspended, by
							<persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay’s</persRef> review of <persRef ref="montagu-basil">Basil Montagu’s</persRef> edition of his work and Life. The
							review charges Montagu with a laborious and absurd effort to defend the
							moral character of Bacon; and the attempt to pass him off as a Spirit as
							pure as it was bright—but this was a desperate task. Macaulay darts into
							both extremes—extols the intellect and denigrates the moral qualities in
							Hyperboles. Bacon was at once an unscrupulous man of the world and
							sycophant of a royal court, and a profound philosopher— The important
							events of his life—his slow and gradual ascent to fame, power and
							honours— His horrible treachery to the <persRef ref="devereux-robert">Earl of Essex</persRef>, his base
							subserviency to the favourite <persRef ref="villiers-george">Buckingham</persRef>; his lamentable downfall and
							self-sacrifice, and the resignation and perseverance with which he
							redeemed himself to the veneration of posterity are a theme for
							continuous meditation and unabating interest.</p>
