							not nominated a candidate against me—but they will at this time, and it

							frequent services that they were indebted to me for, in support of the

							interview to ascertain my opinions on certain points upon which there
							was considerable adversity among those generally opposed to Slavery.— I
							told them that I would cheerfully give to them my opinions as they were
							sincerely entertained, upon any and every point interesting to them—
							That I had no motive to conceal or disguise any of my opinions upon
							subjects of public concernment— That I had lived 77 years and served in
							various offices, and never asked or solicited directly or indirectly the
							vote of any man, and thought it not worth while to commence the practise
							now— I answered all their questions; discussed with them the points upon
							which we did not concur— The vote for President upon which I should not
							be the partizan of any man.— We considered the abolition of Slavery in
							the District of Columbia and the territories and the prohibition of the
							interstate Slave-trade. They declared themselves perfectly satisfied
							with the interview— One of them said he should vote for me with
							pleasure—another said he did not know but what he should— The rest were

								>My visitors yesterday from the Committee of the Liberty

							yet when they left me. My opposition to the immediate abolition of
							Slavery in the District of Columbia, and in the Territories, they all
							disapprove, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe the late Senator
							from Norfolk County in the State Legislature pressed me specially with
							the question whether Congress have not the power to repeal the Laws of
							the District which allow and sanction Slavery— With regard to the
							inter-state Slave trade I told them I had no doubt of the power of
							Congress to prohibit that, and would vote for a bill to that effect
							to-morrow, though it would not be possible to prevail upon the house to
							receive such a bill— I told them I regretted that I could not concur
							with them in all their opinions, and still more the dissensions
							prevailing among themselves— The Colonization Society— The Anti-Slavery
							and abolition Societies—the no-government non resisting and women
							membered Societies— I grieved also at their classing in the same level
							of exclusion the whig and democrat parties.— I thought there was a great
							difference between them; and that placing them on the same level was to
							secure the triumph of the worst party— This tendency of all private
							associations to settle into factious cabals is the besetting sin of all
							elective governments— I had no visitors this day— This Evening <persRef

								Jackson</persRef> upon the annexation of Texas to the United States—
							I employed so industriously this day that besides the daily record I
							wrote 4 pages of my task, only to prove what with diligence can do in
							one day.— The danger now is that I shall do too much—slide into dulness,
							wander into impertinence, fret into ribaldry and worry into tediousness—
							The conspiracy against my good name is so complicated, so combined so
							crafty and so base that I can scarcely keep my self-command to meet

						<p>Th temple Clock struck 6 with the first beam of the Sun emerging from the

							of tickets for a convivial party of the members of the Quincy fire
							companies at 1. O’Clock p.m to-morrow— I took ten tickets and promised
							to attend the meeting in person, if I should find it convenient—
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went this morning
							with his son Charles Francis to the granite quarries, where <persRef
								ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemuel

							unfinished— At the setting of the Sun I went up the hill where <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> told me that he had not

								<persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin F Andrews</persRef> where he had
							left him this morning; but <persRef ref="davenport-james">James
								Davenport</persRef> their servant followed close after me and told
							me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles with his Son had
							returned. Though I had the whole day for my labour I was able to write
							only three pages of my task, and find I shall be obliged to curtail and
							concentrate much of what I have yet to say on Monday next— In the
							Evening Charles came down—without his wife, and I read to <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">the family</persRef> what I
							have already written for the address of next Monday.— It occupied an
							hour and a half, and I suppressed the reading of several documents,
							which I must not pass over next Monday.— I must bespeak the patience of
							my hearers a full hour longer and then abridge and leave out— But what
							is worse my language is too violent, and must be smoothed down, I know
							not how nor to what extent—further I have now only four days more to
							finish, and must leave space for a final recapitulation— I read myself
							this evening quite hoarse, and took warning to pitch my voice quite low
							when I begin— All my correspondence lags behind and I leave unanswered
							numerous invitations, and complimentary Letters. <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> has completed for me a
							large collection of extracts from my Diary of 1818 and 1819. which I
							much wanted at Washington last Winter; and of which I want that more
							than one copy should be in existence to guard against the casualty of
							fire, and the possibility of theft or mutilation— The Steamer Caledonia
							arrived from Liverpool at Boston this morning at ten O’Clock, in the
							average Summer passage of 14 days, and with the average number of 101.

						<p>Rain storm from early morning till late this afternoon— I thought I
							should have a long uninterrupted day, but was sadly disappointed. As the
							evening twilight came on I took my hat to go up to <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, when two strangers
							came in and introduced themselves as <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson</persRef> of Missouri and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Haven</persRef> of
							New-York city— They are whig politicians and came to see me from mere
							curiosity to see and talk with me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson
							said he had been settled in Missouri nearly 25. years, and most of that
							time in opposition to <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas H Benton</persRef>, whose
							recent movements against the annexation of Texas were caused by his
							knowledge that nothing else could have saved him politically in
							Missouri— The people there were all of them perfectly willing to take
							Texas, and to fight the Mexicans, or the British—but they have an
							abhorrence to being burdened to pay the debt of Texas which they know
							will amount to nearer twenty five than ten millions of dollars, and they
							know that if Texas should be annexed to the United States there will not
							come to them one acre of ungranted land— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wilson discoursed thus for at least an hour with little interruption
							from me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Haven said little— I invited
							them to take tea with us, but they said it was growing late and they
							must return to Boston— They were scarcely gone, and our tea table
							cleared when <persRef ref="clymer-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edward M. Clymer</persRef> a Student at the Law school at Cambridge,
							came with a Letter of recommendation from his uncle <persRef
								ref="hiester-william">William Hiester</persRef> of New Holland
							Pennsylvania— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clymer’s object was only to
							spend an evening with us which he did— He is a pleasant very well bred
							and sociable young man, whom I regretted not to have convenient means to
							pass the Night with us. Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> also spent the evening here— The news by the
							Caledonia and other newspaper intelligence absorbed hours, and a private
							Letter from <persRef ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef> to
							me in the pamphlet, of 1. March 1818 referred me to one that I had
							received from in London after my appointment as Secretary of State, and
							before I embarked to return home. <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> searched and found it for me and with it a file of
							Letters from him received by me in England from 1815 to 1817. The one of
							which I was in search contained a quotation from a Latin poet, not of
							the hacknied class, and I lost some time in searching for it, in vain—
							And more time in reading over the file.</p>

						<p>I attend meeting at the Temple in the hope of composing my shattered

							the interests of Time— This is peculiarly my desire on the days when I
							partake of the communion— This day, with sorrow I says was too much

							stand— Heaven forgive me for it! <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi

							from John 12.27. [“]Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
							Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this
							hour.” This is part of a discourse of Jesus only six days before his
							last Passover at Bethany where he had performed the miracle of raising
								<persRef ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> from the dead— Here it was
							that between the worship of those who had witnessed the miracle and
							believed him to be the Messiah; and the compassing of his death by those
							who disbelieved, which was within one week of being consummated, his
							soul was troubled— He revealed himself and the destiny that awaited him,
							in figurative and, somewhat misterious, discourse, not understood even
							by his disciples, until explained by his subsequent death and
							resurrection; and foretold at once his suffering and his glorification—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s view of his text appeared to
							me ingenious and impressive as he delivered his sermon; but other
							thoughts were forcing themselves upon my memory while he spoke, and my
							soul was like one of those sheets of antient parchments, upon which a
							poem in monkish rhyme is written over an Oration of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt administered the communion and the usual annual collection was
							taken up to defray the expenses of this ordinance— He also reminded the
							members of the church of a resolution within the last year adopted, that
							two blank books should be purchased, one for a copy to be made in it of
							the antient records of the church, and the other in which the future
							records may be kept— The change in the time of meeting from ten, to half
							past ten in the morning, and from a quarter past to a quarter before 2.
							in the afternoon commenced this day.— On returning from the morning

						<p>This was one of the epochal days of my life— On the 26<hi

								ref="adams-charles2">my son</persRef> brought me the Boston Post of
							25. March containing <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew

							containing Brown’s Letter to the Editors of the Globe, with Jackson’s
							Letter for publication— I determined to make them the text of the
							address which I had promised to deliver to the young men’s whig club of
							Boston this Evening.— I thought this a suitable occasion for opening my
							defence before the country and the world, against the conspiracy of
							Andrew Jackson, Aaron Vail Brown, <persRef ref="erving-george">George W.
								Erving</persRef> and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, with their coadjutors and tools, to ruin my

							surrendered to Spain— I began the address that day, and finished it this
							day just in time for dinner— The composition therefore is excessively
							hurried and unskilfully put together, with sundry repetitions, which
							needed a pruning hand; but I had no time to give— At 6 O’Clock this
							afternoon I rode into Boston with my Son and <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, and precisely at 7.
							alighted at the Tremont Temple— I was there received with the utmost
							simplicity by the Committee of the young men’s whig club, in a private
							room adjoining the hall which was already crowded as full as it could
							hold— Several of my elderly friends were assembled in this private room
							and I was specially greeted by <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Samuel T.
								Armstrong</persRef>, <persRef ref="mason-jeremiah">Jeremiah
								Mason</persRef>, <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">Abbott
								Lawrence</persRef>, <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">Stephen C.

									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef>
							<persRef ref="walley-samuel">Samuel H. Walley jun<hi rend="superscript"

							Editor of the Boston Atlas, <persRef ref="brooks-erastus">Erastus
								Brooks</persRef> of the New-York Evening Express, and the younger
								<persRef ref="buckingham-edgar">Buckingham</persRef>, applied for
							the use of my manuscript for immediate publication in their respective
							papers— I gave it with a pledge that I should have a proof sheet to
							revise before publication, to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayden the
							first applicant— At precisely half past 7. I entered the Hall with my
							Son, who is President of the club, and with the chairman of the
							Committee of the Club. The reception was complimentary and enthusiastic,
							and my Son said that after such a reception, it would be superfluous for
							him to do more than announce to them the name of his father John Quincy
							Adams—whereupon another shout of welcome shook the house— A young
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coffin</persRef> at
							my request read the Letters of Aaron Vail Brown and of Andrew Jackson,
							and I discoursed upon them two hours and ten minutes much to the

							Boston was specially well received. As soon as the crowd was cleared
							away we re-entered the Carriage; left my son at the United States Hotel,
							and with Walter Hellen I returned to Quincy—reaching home at eleven.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 6:4. Set 5:33.</p>
						<p>In the hurry of preparation for the last evening my diary has run three
							days in arrear, and the high excitement of yesterday with more than two
							hours of loud speaking, preceded and followed by the rides have left
							upon me a feverish lassitude, and longing for a vacation ill-suited to
							my condition— I am to address my constituents the people of the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts
							before the last of this month— I ought to have been at work upon it this
							day but could not bring myself to it. I allowed myself about three hours
							to transport three seedling stocks of pear trees, and one shag-bark
							walnut tree from the Nursery to the Seminary: a very hazardous
							operation, and of the success of which I despair even while undertaking
							it. The trees are of six or seven years growth and would flourish in
							their native soil; but they stand too near other yet more valuable
							trees, and must be removed from their proximity—the walnut had a double
							tap root which <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef> could not
							extract from the rock-bound soil, and of which he cut off with the spade
							a large portion— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> remained
							last Night in Boston, and took lodging at the United States Hotel to
							start early this morning on the Western Railroad for Springfield, where
							he is to address a whig Meeting this Evening— To morrow and Thursday he
							is to perform the same service at other places; and to return home next
							Friday. The Atlas and the Boston Courier of this morning have notices of
							the meeting of the Young men’s whig club last Evening at the Tremont
							Temple, and very commendatory accounts of my Address which the Atlas
							promises to give from my Manuscript Notes to-morrow— But I received no
							proof sheet. I had engaged to pass the Night at <persRef
								ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H
								Foster’s</persRef> if I had remained in the City. <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah Quincy
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> also offered me a
							bed, and <persRef ref="davis-john">judge John Davis</persRef> engaged me
							to dine with him on the next day of Meeting of the Massachusetts
							Historical Society— My time was so wholly absorbed yesterday that I
							could not even read the Boston Morning Newspapers— The State-elections
							keep up the political agitation— The accounts from Delaware are very
							equivocal—from Maryland encouraging, but with a dark spot from the City
							of Baltimore. From Pennsylvania and New-York they are desperate, and the
							general result is equally so. Maine has gone by a majority of more than
							ten thousand for free trade and Texas.— It is hard to steer and row
							against wind and tide; but even in the agony of death we must say like
								<persRef ref="lawrence-james3">Lawrence</persRef> don’t give up the
							ship.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 6.5— Set 5:31.</p>
						<p>The moon had just risen when I rose, and having been yesterday in
							conjunction with Venus, I hoped to see them both at the rising of the
							Sun; but as the morning dawn advanced a hazy vapour arose and covered
							the atmosphere—the Sun rose with a crimson colour, and a smoky outline,
							and the day was the entrance to the Indian Summer.— I redeemed the
							arrears of my Diary, and began an address to my constituents, which I
							propose to have in readiness for the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of this month— But it will absorb all my time so that I can do nothing
							else— I set out upon a new plan, and consider all that I have written
							from the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July when I got home till
							the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September as waste paper. My
							Address to the young whigs of Boston was published entire in the Boston
							Atlas of this day; but the paper did not come to me— The Morning
							Chronicle, the Liberty party paper of yesterday had not even a notice of
							the Meeting of the whig club of the night before— This day it has a very
							favourable account of the Address, specially remarking that there was
							not a word in it about the Presidential election or the Presidential
							candidates— Yesterday was the day of the Meeting of the Liberty party
							Convention to nominate candidates for Senators for the County of
							Norfolk; and for a member of the House of Representatives of the United
							States for the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District
							of Massachusetts in the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress. I
							received on Monday two Letters from <persRef ref="gulliver-john2">John
								Gulliver</persRef>, of Roxbury, one of the Liberty party Committee,
							who conferred with me on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this
							month—extremely anxious between the fear that the Meeting would, and the
							hope that they would not nominate a Candidate against me— There is in
							the Morning Chronicle of this day no notice of the Meeting at Dedham
							yesterday— The Democratic party have nominated <persRef
								ref="wright-isaac2">Isaac G. Wright</persRef> who was last year one
							of the Senators for the County of Norfolk in the Legislature of the
							State. <persRef ref="savil-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah
								Savil</persRef> came this afternoon to enquire concerning certain
							papers, which he says were put into my brother <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">Thomas’s</persRef> hands shortly before his
							death, relating to the claim of <persRef ref="newcomb-charles">Charles
								Newcomb</persRef>, a revolutionary Soldier for bounty Lands— Newcomb
							was a pensioner under the act of Congress of 1818. The pension was
							revoked by the act of 1820.— He died soon after the papers were put into
							my brothers hands—and his widow <persRef ref="newcomb-jerusha">Jerusha
								Newcomb</persRef> who was a daughter of <persRef ref="adams-micajah"
								>Micajah Adams</persRef> is now entitled to a pension by the 5 years
							laws.— I referred M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savil to <persRef
								ref="gourgas-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourgas</persRef>
							for the papers, and asked him for a written statement, to which I would

						<p>Sun rose 6.6. Set 5.29 Indian Summer.</p>
						<p>I went up the hill to see both the rising and setting of the Sun, but
							before he rose the haze gathering over the Eastern horizon thickened so
							that I could discern only the outline of his disk, and at his setting
							although distinctly visible till he drew within a disk’s distance of the
							western, he had totally disappeared behind the haze before reaching its

							morning Chronicle Office.— A young man by the name of <persRef
								ref="wiley-ebenezer">Ebenezer Wiley</persRef> from South Reading in
							the County of Middlesex came to see me, from motives of mere curiosity—
							I was somewhat inquisitive about himself, but he was not much disposed
							to talk about himself, and I did not press enquiry.— <persRef
								ref="hardwick-henry">Henry Hardwick</persRef> came again to propose
							the purchase of that corner of land behind his house, which he has so

							that he would give for it double what it was worth— I paid to my wife

								<persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>— He brought me out the
							Boston Atlas of yesterday containing my address to the young men’s whig
							Club of Monday Evening published entire but with sundry considerable
							errors of the press.— About half of my address copied from the Atlas is
							published in the Boston Courier and in the Daily Advertiser of this day.
							The latter with a very favourable editorial notice— The first accounts
							came in this day of State Government elections in New-Jersey and
							Pennsylvania— The first favourable to the whigs— The second far
							otherwise— Both parties have Committees remaining at Washington during
							the recess, to superintend the issuing of documents and the circulation
							of intelligence— <persRef ref="green-willis">Willis Green</persRef> of
							Kentucky is the Chairman of the whig-Committee— <persRef
								ref="walker-robert">Robert J. Walker</persRef> the Senator from
							Mississippi chairman of the democracy.— Walker printed a pamphlet—an
							Address of the Democratic Association at Washington D.C— Headed the
							South in Danger— Read before you vote.— Green undertook to circulate the
							same pamphlet in the North and the Democrats charged him with
							forgery.</p>

						<p>Sun rose beclouded. Set 5:28.</p>
						<p>My time is so thoroughly consumed in reading and writing on days occupied
							as this has been, that when it has passed I have nothing to tell— I had
							two Pear trees and two plum trees transplanted into the Nursery, and
							devoted an hour to the thinning of my seedlings in the Nursery. The
								<persRef ref="coe-jonathan;coe-james">two persons by the name of
								Coe</persRef> were strangers from Connecticut the first, Minister of
							an episcopal church at Bethlehem, Litchfield County and the other from
							Winchester in the same County. They came to <unclear>see</unclear> me, merely for
							curiosity and the younger brother said that if he had returned home
							without seeing me, <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> would not have
							forgiven him. <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> came back
							from his excursion to Springfield, Westfield and Cabotville where he has
							been making speeches the last three evenings— He comes with a severe
							cold, and weary of the office he had undertaken— <persRef
								ref="turner-ruth">Ruth Turner</persRef> was here at work; <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> went to Boston to see
								<persRef ref="macready-william">Macready</persRef> perform in a new
							Tragedy called the Bridal— I examined at last the publication in the
							Atlas of my Address to the young men’s whig club. The remainder of it is
							published in the Boston Courier, and I suppose in the Daily Advertiser
							of this day.— There are a few mistakes of the press in the Atlas—none of
							much importance except the word vaccination for buccination, which is
							ridiculous, and the more so because buccination is not a legitimate
							word, but one which I sported for the benefit of <persRef
								ref="brown-aaron">Aaron Vail Brown</persRef>— Buccino is the Latin
							word for swelling the cheek to blow the trumpet or the horn, and there
							is a picture in the word— I made a noun substantive of it by the common
							analogy of Latin verbs turned into english nouns.— The compositor of the
							Atlas was not scholar enough to perceive it and substituted for it a
							word, which turned the whole sentence into nonsense— The returns of the
							elections continue to come in most unpropitious— The whigs have indeed
							carried the election in New Jersey and <persRef ref="stratton-charles"
								>Stratton</persRef> will be the Governor of the State— But
							Pennsylvania is irretrievably sunk in Democracy, and her most popular
							statesmen are trickish and unsafe— My projected address expands as I
							proceed— I am still wandering among first principles and generalities— I
							wish to call the attention of my countrymen to the pernicious feature of
							the slave-representation in the Government of the United States; but the
							people are so broken to it, that it is of no avail to expose it— I have
							yet much to unfold of the Tennessean conspiracy of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>, <persRef ref="erving-george"
								>Erving</persRef>, Aaron Vail Brown and <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Jared Ingersoll</persRef> against
							me, but I am yet uncertain whether now is the most favourable time for
							completing the exposure, or whether to wait.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 6:9. Set 5:24</p>
						<p>I directed sundry pear, plum and apple trees to be transplanted but I
							cannot spare half an hour from 4 in the morning till ten at Night,
							without losing at least a page of my task, and when I once relax, it
							ends with the failure of the purpose before me— By the Quincy Patriot of

								Howe</persRef> of Weymouth for election to Congress for the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts—
							He was one of the Committee from the Liberty party who visited me last

							been several years a Senator from the County of Norfolk, and is a Major
							General of the Militia. <persRef ref="wright-isaac2">Isaac H.

								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> returned from

							perform last Night in the Bridal, a Tragedy said to be revived from

							folded up to distribute, but sent only 3. to <persRef

								<persRef ref="seward-william">William H. Seward</persRef> of Auburn
							and to <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Christopher Morgan</persRef> of
							the same place.— There are errors of the manuscript and errors of the

								<persRef ref="brown-aaron">Brown</persRef> and <persRef

							formidable conspiracy against the good name of an honest public man
							never was plotted, and besides numerous understrappers they are four to
							one against me— I must sleep in armour and be ready to meet them in
							Indian warfare— I called at the Stone bank, for my bank book and found I
							had made a mistake in my casting up, and overdrawn 36.62. which I
							immediately rectified and had the book balanced— I called also at the
							Quincy Aurora Office to enquire if they intended to publish my address—
							The answer was affirmative but faint— I received this evening an
							invitation from <persRef ref="halsey-george">George H. Halsey</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee of arrangements of the Young Men’s <persRef

						<p>The sharpest morning of the Season yet— A more splendid exhibition of the
							starry firmament I never witnessed than that of this morning immediately
							after I arose— And among the numberless multitudes of assembled worlds,
							the planet Mercury shot his seldom visible but brilliant solitary beam
							into my window, about a quarter of an hour risen precisely in the track
							in which he was to be followed by the Sun— I ought to have seen the
							rising of Arcturus, just now rising long enough before the Son to be
							visible in the morning. Within a week of Starlight mornings I shall see
							him. My fingers and feet were pinched to see the rising of the Sun from
							the corner of <persRef ref="adams-charles">Charles’s</persRef> house;
							but it was a glorious sight— The surface of the ground wherever the eye
							could range was covered with hoar frost; but the temperature of the
							atmosphere softened much in the course of the day.— The <persRef
								ref="pope-augustus">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Augustus R.
								Pope</persRef>, of Kingston, near Plymouth officiated at the Temple
							by exchange with <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef>. His morning text was from Luke 22.32.
							“But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art
							converted strengthen thy brethren.” It is the saying of the Saviour to
								<persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, forewarning him of his
							approaching desertion at the last Supper.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pope remarked upon the strangeness of the fact, that Jesus,
							the Messiah, at the moment when he was about to suffer an ignominious
							death, should have prayed that the faith of his disciple Peter might not
							fail, when he knew and foretold to Peter himself that it would— But he
							foretold also that Peter would recover from the fall of his frailty, and
							exhorts him when he is converted to strengthen his brethren— The Sermon
							was chiefly a discourse upon Faith— Simon (Peter’s) faith was to fail
							notwithstanding the prayer of Jesus—he was yet to be converted, and then
							was to strengthen the faith of his brethren. Since my own Dissertation
							upon Faith, which palls a little upon my Memory I have heard several
							Sermons from Clergymen on the same Subject, all of which have given me
							further ideas regarding it, but none has presented an exact analysis of
							it as an intellectual and sensitive property of men. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope enumerated the various senses in
							which the word Faith is used in the Scriptures without remarking upon
							the analogy between them— He dined with us, and I made several enquiries
							of him concerning the family of old <persRef ref="sever-william2">judge
								Sever</persRef>, at whose house I once slept in April 1787. and of
							his son, <persRef ref="sever-john">John Sever</persRef> my Classmates—
							They are both long since dead but many descendants of John and his
							brother <persRef ref="sever-james">James</persRef> remain. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope’s afternoon Sermon was from James
							1.22. [“]But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
							your own selves.” After the service I called to see <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> who still keeps her bed— He was here this
							evening.</p>

							to Boston this morning and took his boy <persRef ref="adams-john17">John
								Quincy</persRef> into the Latin School. He returned and dined with
							us, and was here again in the Evening. He brought out a note of

								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> last week

							had finished our dinner <persRef ref="jackson-william3">William
								Jackson</persRef> of Newtown and his brother <persRef
								ref="jackson-francis2">Francis Jackson</persRef> came in; returning
							from a tour to Plymouth to examine the course of the Old Colony

							the Office of Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth. Francis Jackson
							is of the party who take no part in the Government because it requires
							an Oath to support the Constitution of the United States— William
							Jackson told me that he went to the Liberty party Convention last week
							at Dedham to prevent if possible the nomination of a Candidate for
							Congress against me— But he found it impossible— They were exceedingly
							zealous. He said he hoped I should be re-elected, but considered it
							doubtful— <persRef ref="story-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William H. Story</persRef> came from Brooklyn, New-York, with an
							invitation to me to preside over a whig mass-meeting there, on the 24<hi

						<p>How often Self-examination, is followed by self-reproach! and how often
							self reproach by self absolution and the neglect or forgetfulness of
							reform! I had determined to attend the exhibition at Cambridge this
							morning and to be there in Season at the Meeting of the Committee of
							Overseers at 10 O’Clock, to leave home at the latest by half past 8. The
							morning Newspapers came by the Mail, and among them, the National

								inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> containing the whole of my
							Address of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the young Men’s Whig

							printed enticed me to read till I found the watch within five minutes of
							ten and that the Carriage had been an hour and a half in waiting— I
							hurried through Boston to Cambridge, and found the performances of the
							exhibitions just commenced, by a Latin Oration— There was a Prospectus
							of 14 performances, three of which were omitted— Three in Latin, two in
							Greek, &amp; the rest in English— There was an English version of

						<p>Excessively hurried and delayed— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My
								Son</persRef> removed this day with his family to Boston— The
							further I proceed in my task, the more the field widens before me. I had
							received a Letter of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of last Month
							from <persRef ref="hilliard-francis">Francis Hilliard</persRef> of
							Roxbury, Chairman of the whig Committee of the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Congressional District, inviting me to address my
							Constituents and the public, at such time and place as might be
							convenient and agreeable to myself— I had then just agreed to address
							the young men’s whig club at Boston, and had not even commenced that
							address.— I sent word by <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef> to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hilliard, that I would comply with that
							invitation and fix the time and place for it after getting through with
							the young men of Boston— Ever since the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							I have been intending to write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hilliard, but he called on me this morning for my answer— I proposed to
							him this day fortnight the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this
							month at 10. O’Clock in the morning.— The place I left entirely at the
							discretion of the Committee to select; wishing only to suit the persons
							who will be likely to attend, that they may be put to as little
							inconvenience as possible— I had suggested to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Loring the expediency of notifying the towns of the District
							and proposing to them to send delegations to attend the meeting, which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hilliard said he thought they would
							do.— With regard to the place M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hilliard
							went and consulted with <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham</persRef>, and returned and
							said they proposed to apply for the use of the church at the Weymouth
							landing to which I readily agreed. He asked if I thought of adding any
							religious solemnity to the meeting. I said I should be glad that the
							meeting should be opened with prayer, by the Minister of the Church, or
							if he should be reluctant by <persRef ref="storrs-richard">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard Storrs</persRef> the Minister
							of the next Orthodox Church at Braintree— And so the arrangement was
							concluded— <persRef ref="foster-george4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George S. Foster</persRef> is a young man, a member of the Young
							Men’s <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> Association of New
							York.— He came for the purpose of persuading me to attend at their mass
							meeting next Wednesday, and to deliver over again that evening in the
							Tabernacle, my address to the young Men of Boston— I told him how much I
							regretted that I could not perform and that I had answered the
							invitation from <persRef ref="v">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Halsey</persRef> to that effect. He then said that they would have a
							printing press in the procession, and want an address to be struck off
							and circulated while the procession is moving. He urged me very warmly
							to write such an address but I declined. I wasted too much time and a
							little anger upon a Letter of <persRef ref="cheves-langdon">Langdon
								Cheves</persRef> about the Tariff, Texas, Nullification and
							disunion— Evening not idle.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 6.14. behazed Set 5.17. beclouded</p>
						<p>I received my manuscript of the Address, from the Atlas Office, but its
							publication in pamphlet form is yet problematical.— I have revised the
							errors of the publication in the Atlas, and have made up 20 copies and
							distributed them among several individuals my friends in several
							quarters of the Union— I shall soon be called to reply—to furious
							assaults from the worthies, whose characters and exploits I have brought
							in relief before the civilized world.— My main object now is the address
							to my Constituents to be delivered on the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this month—but in the review of the proceedings at the
							last Session of Congress I must make a selection of the topics which I
							am to discuss.— They are, 1. The choice of a Speaker whose election was
							contested. 2. The prostration of the Law prescribing elections by single
							districts. 3. The exclusion from the Journals of the protest against the
							subversion of the Law. 4. The abortive effort to discard the gag rule
							which I am yet discussing. Then come the Massachusetts Resolutions and
							the proceedings of the House upon them— The bill to refund <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> fine— The threatened repeal
							of the Tariff of 1842.— The Oregon fever.— The Texas fever and Treaty—
							The Treaty with the German Customs Union, and the complicated intrigues
							and cabaling for the annexation of Texas; with the three Baltimore
							Conventions— The whig nomination of <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry
								Clay</persRef>, and <persRef ref="frelinghuysen-theodore">Theodore
								Frelinghuysen</persRef>— The mock democratic nomination of <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> without a Vice President— The
							smuggled nomination of <persRef ref="polk-james">James K.
							Polk</persRef>, and <persRef ref="dallas-george">George M.

								ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef>, and the disunion
							schemes of <persRef ref="rhett-robert">R. Barnwell Rhett</persRef> and
							Langdon Cheves, all form a compound subject for discoursing to my
							Constituents. Of all these I must make a selection of which the Slave
							representation may be the common bond— A large portion of my time this
							day was consumed in a revolutionary Letter of <persRef
								ref="cheves-langdon">Langdon Cheves</persRef>. There is an almost
							insuperable difficulty in my way, that I cannot discuss these matters
							without bearing upon the Presidential canvas— <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							and his <persRef ref="beale-ann;beale-caroline">two daughters</persRef>
							spent the Evening here— It was my only interruption, yet I was up till
							11. at Night.— I received the first and second number of a new weekly
							Newspaper, published at Boston called the Plain Dealer—professing
							Democracy, but striking at the prominent Men of all parties—except
								<persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef>.</p>

						<p>The pressure upon my brain increases and my time becomes so totally
							absorbed in writing that I have now Memory for scarcely any thing that
							passes from day to day. This day, besides the journal of yesterday I
							wrote four pages of my task, an atchievement which I shall probably
							never again perform. <persRef ref="bryant-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Bryant</persRef> came from North
							Bridgewater, and invited me to go and address a meeting of the people
							there— He said the Liberty party were making very great exertions there,
							and were speciall working for a concert with the Democracy; and they
							were detaching so many from the whigs, that they were apprehensive of
							losing the election of their candidate to represent the town in the
							State Legislature— I told him that I had promised to address the people
							of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District on the
								30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month— I had left it to
							the whig Committee of the District to fix upon the place where the
							Address should be delivered, and I understood they had agreed upon
							Weymouth landing.— But I could divide my address in two, and deliver
							part of it at one place and part at another, and if he would see
								<persRef ref="hilliard-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis Hilliard</persRef> of Roxbury, <persRef ref="brigham-josiah"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham</persRef> of this town,
								<persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer</persRef> of Braintree or
								<persRef ref="loring-thomas2">Thomas Loring</persRef> of Hingham,
							and could make an arrangement with them, I would go to North-Bridgwater
							at any one or two days before or after the meeting at Weymouth landing.
								<persRef ref="miller-nathaniel">Doctor Nathaniel Miller</persRef> of
							Franklin, came also to enquire if I could not visit that town or that
							part of the County, where he said the Liberty party were extremely busy
							and courting favour with the Democracy— He made some enquiries about the
							deputation from that party which visited me, and particularly about
								<persRef ref="fisher-milton">M. M. Fisher</persRef> of Medway. At
							their convention at Dedham there were 55 votes taken of which there were
							36. for <persRef ref="howe-appleton">Appleton Howe</persRef> 14 for me,
							and 5 for this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher. Their Presidential
							Candidate <persRef ref="birney-james">James G. Birney</persRef> has come
							to Boston to electioneer for himself— He has been nominated by a
							Convention of Democrats at Saginaw in the State of Michigan, as a member
							of the State Legislature, and is throwing off his mask, and still trying
							to hide his face behind it— This coalition secretly concerted and just
							now coming out in its true colours will certainly break down the
							election in this 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> District for the next
							Congress. I hope I may not take it too much at heart, but that it will
							prepare me for retirement for the rest of my days.</p>

						<p>Warm rain with a furious storm of wind all last night and continued all
							the morning of this day.— I still drudge without seeing when I can come
							to a close— I received this morning a Letter from <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef> of Baltimore, thanking
							me for my exposure of that infamous fraud concocted by <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="brown-aaron">Aaron Vail Brown</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>, with the
								<persRef ref="lewis-dixon;lewis-william3">two Lewises</persRef> and
							other understrappers, for the destruction of my character; and to
							accomplish the annexation of Texas and a fourth part of Mexico to the
							United States. But he gives me warning that I shall have the whole swarm
							of hornets upon me; and I must make up my mind to meet them— In the
							progress of my address to my Constituents I am now coming to the
							encounter with the deepest, the cunningest and the foulest rascal of
							them all— With the bold dashing utterly base and baseless lies of Andrew
							Jackson, I shall have not much trouble, and no danger but of
							assassination not by him, but by one or another of his blood-hounds.
							With George W. Erving, I shall have easy work if I can get hold of him;
							for his revelations have not yet been made public, and I only know that
							the Statements drawn from them by Jackson, Brown and Ingersoll are all
							equally false— Brown’s Note, upon Jackson’s Letter is of itself enough
							to demolish him—he can never get over it.— Ingersoll’s falsehoods, are
							more cautiously covered and more dexterously combined— There is cunning
							as well as impudence in his publishing his report as the report of the
							Committee of foreign Affairs, although they rejected it— The mountebank
							mock solemnity with which he announces the revelations of George W.
							Erving to Jackson, may not perhaps be so easy to turn into ridicule, nor
							will it be so light a task to unravel his web of sophistry and
							chicanery, woven from Ervings sleezy threads, as to unty the coarse and
							clumsy knots of Jackson and Brown— To an impartial jury I should have
							but a plain tale to tell and the whole fabrick of knavery would fall to
							pieces—but with prejudice, faction, false popularity and unbridled
							profligacy, what will be the event?— The odds are fearful— May God
							defend the right— This afternoon <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter

							preached this morning from Matthew 21.28. [“]But what think ye? A
							certain man had two sons; and he came to the first and said, Son, go
							work to-day in my vineyard. 29. He answered and said, I will not: but
							afterward he repented, and went. 30. And he came to the second and said
							likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir, and went not. 31. Whether
							of them twain did the will of his father— They say unto him the first”—
							The discourse was a comme̅n̅y upon the whole parable, and one of the
							most pleasing Sermons I ever heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt— He dissected the whole story—filled up the outline of the
							contrasted character of the two Sons—delineated the characters of two
							others, who might be of the same family— The one who upon being
							commanded by his father to go, work upon his vineyard, should answer at
							once I go, and should actually go—the best of the family—and the worst
							who should on receiving the command, should refuse obedience and act
							accordingly— He remarked upon almost every separate word of the
							narrative. Go <hi rend="italic">Work</hi>—expatiated on the Nature of
							the command to work—active and useful industry—<hi rend="italic">to</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">day</hi> not waiting till to-morrow—and he closed with
							an Arabian Apologue about Bén Hassan to whom a Genius came and called
							him up to do some act of diligence, but who pleaded for indulgence from
							day to day, till Death came in the place of the Genius and would listen
							to no delay.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt occasionally digressed
							from the parable to the context and remarked upon the manner in which he
							avoided answering the question by what authority he performed his
							miracles—retorting upon them by a question whether they think the
							baptism of <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John</persRef> from Heaven or
							of men? and when they answer they cannot tell he rejoins neither tell I
							you by what authority I act, not saying as they did that he cannot tell,
							but predicating his refusal upon their pretence of inability— <persRef
								ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De

								ref="angier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

									>r</hi> George T. Bigelow’s</persRef> at Boston, and came out
							last evening with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bigelow from Boston.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts afternoon Sermon was from 1. John
							3.7. [“]Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doeth
							righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous”—that is as Christ
							the Son of God is righteous— The doctrine is that all righteousness
							consists of deeds and not of words— The Acadia Steamer arrived from
							Liverpool this afternoon at 4. O’Clock at Boston— At 2 and at half past
							3 I had looked for her from the hill, but did not see her.</p>

							to address my Constituents twice at two different places before I go to

							Corresponding Secretary of the Young Men’s Institute at Hartford Conn<hi

							about the middle of November.— From <persRef ref="stetson-charles"

							upon a public celebration in aid of the funds of the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> Monument Association in
							New-York on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November next— They
							say the occasion will be one of peculiar interest and my presence and
							participation in the ceremonies are earnestly and respectfully
							solicited— These with multitudes of others, of little comparative
							interest remain unanswered. An old Clergyman from Providence, by the
							name of <persRef ref="williams-thomas6">Thomas Williams</persRef>, who
							has been here before came with a young man, named <persRef
								ref="perkins-jonas2">Jonas Reynolds Perkins</persRef> a son of the

							and now a student at Law, with <persRef ref="coffin-timothy">M<hi

							had a long conversation with me upon speculative politics and religion.
							I deposited at the stone Bank an order of <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>my Son</persRef> upon the Merchant’s Bank—Boston, for 500 dollars,
							and drew 200 which I gave to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my

								ref="clapp-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clapp</persRef>
							if he proposed to publish my Address to the young Men’s whig club at
							Boston— He said he would, and I promised him a revised copy, from the
							Boston Atlas— My Son came out from Boston with <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> but returned almost
							immediately to Boston, himself— My wife had intended to take her
							departure for Washington this day, but was deterred by the prospect of
							foul weather and postponed her journey till to-morrow—</p>

						<p>In my Address to the young Men’s whig club at Boston, I alluded to an
							incident in the Roman History merely from Memory, and in my extreme
							hurry I hazarded it, without verifying it by recurrence to <persRef
								ref="rollin-charles">Rollin</persRef> or <persRef ref="livius-titus"
								>Livy</persRef>— After the delivery of the discourse, I have felt a
							desire to verify my recollection of the facts and asked <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, to look it up in Rollin— I
							found it myself this morning, first in Rollin, and afterwards in Livy,
							3.71— The event occurred in the 309<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year
							ab urbe condita—at the close of a war with the AEqui and Volsci— The
							dispute was between the Ardeates and Aricini and the people were
							wheedled into the judgment by an old soldier 83 years of age named
								<persRef ref="scaptius-marcus">Scaptius</persRef> who started up in
							the Assembly of the people and declared that he would not suffer his
							country to be cheated out of her property— That he himself had fought in
							the battle when that same territory was taken, and would not without
							remonstrance see it taken away. The People and their Tribunes took fire—
							The Consuls and Senators struggled in vain to shame them out of their
							self-degradation in adjudicating the territory to themselves— Scaptius
							and the tribunes prevailed and the territory was re-annexed— This
							consultation of Livy was a temptation to dally with Time, to commune
							with him further but I broke away from him and wrote four pages of my
							proposed address, besides the journal of yesterday— I took nevertheless
							to <persRef ref="clapp-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clapp</persRef> the publisher of the Quincy Aurora, the Boston Atlas
							of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> with the errors of the press in
							my address to the young men’s whig club at Boston— He said he would
							publish it in two papers commencing next week, and would send me proof
							sheets to revise before the publication— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> postponed again her
							departure for Washington till to-morrow— But she went this afternoon
							with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Adams</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> into Boston,
							and took tea at <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef>, with
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>.— He himself was

									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Daniel D. Barnard</persRef> of
							Albany, who came to Boston to deliver a Lecture before the Boston Lyceum
							and an Address to the young men’s whig club; which last took place last
							evening. The party got back this evening about 9. O’Clock. While they
							were gone <persRef ref="goodrich-samuel;goodrich-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Goodrich</persRef> (he the author of Peter Parley[)] came and took

						<p>Isaac P. Davis told me that there were in the Globe Newspaper of last

							met with in this world.— He came out from Boston this morning to invite

							address to the young men’s whig club at Boston. He retains more of any

							by the preservation of insects in it— I found the fact stated in
								<persRef ref="rees-abraham">Rees’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia— This
							afternoon <persRef ref="thaxter-catherine">Miss Catherine
								Thaxter</persRef> called here with a cousin of hers, apparently of a
							later generation whom she introduced as <persRef ref="thaxter-susan2"
								>Miss Susan Thaxter</persRef>.— Catherine spoke of my father and
							mother, and said she was here at the fiftieth anniversary of their
							marriage—which was of course the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							October 1814. and she well remembered hearing <persRef ref="adams-john"
								>my father</persRef> say then to <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my

							place where on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1842 I
							addressed my Constituents of the then 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							District and there is the place where I am to address next Wednesday my
							Constituents of the present 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> District—
							As the performance is to be introduced by a religious invocation, M<hi

							objection to that solemnity’s being performed by <persRef
								ref="williams-thomas6">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas

							said none, if it would be agreeable to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Perkins himself.— He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams had
							expressed to him his wish to officiate and he was willing to gratify
							him— I requested M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins if he should on
							his way home pass by <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Minott Thayer’s</persRef> house, to call on him, and say
							to him that I was grateful to him for his kind invitation to dinner on
							that day, but that I shall be obliged to return home to dine—and that I
							begged him not to be at any expence for entertaining any company on that
							day— My feelings are very different at the prospect of this meeting,
							from what they were on that occasion— All is now gloomy and
							discouraging, with a double opposition before me, and all but a
							certainty of failing to carry the election.</p>

						<p>My only interruption of a visitor this day was <persRef

							brought me a Letter from the <persRef ref="briggs-charles">Rev<hi

							deliver a Lecture at the opening of the Lyceum in Roxbury two or three
							weeks hence— I have not time even to answer the invitation, and have
							numbers of unanswered invitations before me— But I wrote this day the
							journal of yesterday, and four pages of the address for next Wednesday
							at Braintree. This hurried composition however has so pernicious effect
							upon the style, that my heart sinks within me at the thought of what I
							am going to deliver, and my only hope is in striking about half of what
							I have written. About half an hour before dinner I took a walk round the
							garden, nursery and Orchard, looking into the seminary— The desolation
							of the Season cast a gloom on my spirits— The fruit has been gathered
							from all the trees except one bearing Quince tree on the borders of the
							pond— The ground is strewed with sere red and yellow leaves—the ground
							is wet and gathered in clods— <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirke</persRef>
							has taken up a number of my seedlings and cut down others— Most of the
							large trees are mere stems, strip<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of all
							their leaves— I hastened in from this prospect to dinner— I afterwards
							met in the garden <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Green</persRef> the daughter of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> and <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"

								A. Green</persRef> editor of the Quincy Patriot— I had not seen her
							since her marriage, and did not at first know her— Again as the Sun went
							down, I walked up the Hill to <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house to see the Sun set. But although it was
							not quite 5. O’Clock the Sun was already behind Mount Ararat.— I went
							further over the hill and surveyed the village, the surrounding country;
							the harbour and bay of Boston. The State house of Boston itself and the
							shaft of the Bunker-hill Monument; and Memory returned to the fact that
							this day 80 years ago, <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> were united in
							marriage— What an ordo seculorum commenced for me from that day. What
							was then the condition of the People who then constituted the town of
							Braintree— What is the condition of the People of the three towns of
							Quincy, Braintree and Randolph now? And what will be the condition of
							the occupiers of the soil of these three towns in 80 years from this
							day? The recollection of the past is pleasing and melancholy— The
							prospect of the future— Oh! how gloomy it is! Not a soul now lives, who
							was then in the bloom of life— Not a soul now living will be here in
							1924.— My own term—how soon it will close! And to whom will all this
							belong in 80 years from this day? Will prayer to God preserve the
							branches and shoots from my father’s Stock What a phantasmagoria is
							human life!</p>

						<p>I was somewhat disturbed in the Night, and not a little disordered
							through the course of this day. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> had told me that he
							should preach at home this day but he exchanged with <persRef
								ref="stearns-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stearns</persRef> of Hingham. The morning text was from Matthew
							18.14. [“]Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven
							that one of these little ones should perish”— The Sermon had obviously
							been composed by way of consolation to some person who has lost a child.
								<persRef ref="bass-jonathan">Jonathan Bass</persRef> had a note up
							for the loss of a grand child; and the father and mother one for the
							loss of their child. I suppose the discourse was adapted to this
							occasion and perhaps may administer comfort to some persons.— But
								<persRef ref="rachel">Rachel</persRef> refused to be comforted for
							her children because they were not.— This eighteenth chapter of Matthew
							is a fruitful field of meditation. It begins by stating that after the
							transfiguration, Jesus being at Capernaum, and having performed a
							miracle to procure money to pay tribute for himself and for <persRef
								ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, the disciples came and asked him who
							should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven— Was there not some
							connection between his paying the tribute and that question—and surely
							there was a rebuke in his answer.— He told them that they who made
							themselves like little children would be the greatest in the kingdom of
							heaven and that no others would be admitted there.— Then he gave them
							that mysterious charge if any of their own members offended them to cast
							them off, and proceeds to say that it is not the will of their heavenly
							father that any one of the little ones should perish— Other injunctions
							of infinite importance follow, and the parable of the two debtors— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns stopped at the promise to little
							children that none of them shall perish. He argued that they come into
							the world for a wise and benevolent purpose—that they afford comfort to
							their parents while they live, and that however prematurely taken away
							they leave to those whose affections they have engaged here the hope of
							meeting them in bliss hereafter.— The contemplation is sad and we can
							come after all to no other conclusion than resignation and submission to
							the will of heaven. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns dined with
								<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and me, and
							preached in the afternoon from John 13.34. “A new commandment I give
							unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also
							love one another.” Love is the essence of Christianity—but the love
							enjoined by this precept is not precisely the same with that commanded
							for the neighbour.— Love is a song of degrees— Parental filial conjugal
							love, friendship, gratitude, veneration, compassion are all diversified
							forms of one benevolent impulse of the heart, which the Christian must
							cherish and regulate.</p>

						<p>A stormy Night, and stormy day succeeding it. No rain yesterday—not much
							last Night or this day but an occasional drizzling mist, and a heavy
							North-eastern gale through both days. I am still disordered and was up
							twice last Night. <persRef ref="clapp-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles Clapp</persRef>, editor of the Quincy Aurora
							brought me this morning a proof page of his next Thursday’s paper,
							containing about half of my address to the Boston young men’s whig club
							reprinted from the Atlas Newspaper, with my revisal— I examined it
							without discovering any error in it— There are several errors in the
							Atlas copy—among which the substitution of the word vaccination for
							buccination which is ridiculous; and the more provoking as buccination
							was a word of my own coinage, which I ventured for its peculiar point in
							the application—for the sake of the walk a took back to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clapp his proof page— Of the Letters that
							I received this day there was one from <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott"
								>Abbott Lawrence</persRef>, enclosing two to him from <persRef
								ref="brown-david">David S. Brown</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="churchman-charles">Charles W. Churchman</persRef>, both of
							Philadelphia— Brown is a Quaker; both dated the 24<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> stating that <persRef ref="miller-daniel2">Daniel L.
								Miller jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> a respectable
							young Quaker and abolitionist would write me that same day a Letter of
							enquiries about <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and Texas, and intreating M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence to urge me to answer Miller’s
							enquiries, because many Quaker and abolition votes would depend upon my
							answer.— By the same mail there came to myself a Letter from <persRef
								ref="chandler-joseph">Joseph R. Chandler</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="gibbons-charles">Charles Gibbons</persRef> President of the
							National Clay Club, <persRef ref="lewis-aj">A. J. Lewis</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="sargent-nathan">Nathan Sargent</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="churchman-charles">Charles W. Churchman</persRef> notifying me
							of this Letter of enquiries from Daniel L. Miller jun<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> and urging me to answer it— Then two
							Letters from Miller both of the same date, one giving me notice of the
							other which contains three questions for my opinion— 1. Whether the
							Election of H. Clay would defeat the Texas-annexation.— 2. Whether the
							election of Polk would ensure it? 3. Whether the annexation of Texas
							would advance or retard the abolition of Slavery? I wrote a joking
							answer but know not how he will take it— I could not with propriety
							write any other— It is curious how the Polecat rascals work upon the
							Quakers, and to what base uses electioneering is turned— All the rest of
							this day, and until 11. at Night I was writing upon my address for next
							Wednesday— I want another week to finish it as a new draft— It will now
							be a thing of shreds and patches of which I am heart-sick.</p>

						<p>The storm finally terminated by rain falling in torrents which began in
							the course of the last Night and all the former part of this day.
							Towards Sunset the storm subsided The Northeastern gale gradually sunk
							to a calm— A soft, damp, clammy state of the atmosphere succeeded still
							covered with murky clouds till as the Night darkened the stars of the
							western horizon first appeared, and before I retired to bed at 11. P.M.
							the sky was clear and waning moon was bright— What small incidents cheer
							or depress the Spirits! I was fretting all day with the terror of a
							similar day to morrow, and to the prospect of having to go tomorrow to
							Braintree through floods of rain, and then to deliver the address to
							empty walls— The brightening sky as I closed the writing of my address
							was delicious— A promise of a fair day to morrow; and I found upon a
							review, that the new introductory written since I finished the first
							draught last Saturday, with the last half of the first draught, would
							make a sufficiently well compacted discourse for a delivery of two full
							hours and I was at my ease.— But nothing less than the incessant toil of
							writing from the day after I addressed the young whigs of Boston could
							have produced this result. Though often called to extemporize I never do
							it with any satisfaction to myself— This morning as the floods of rain
							were falling a young man named <persRef ref="seymour-george"
								>Seymour</persRef>, came on horseback from Boston, where he had
							arrived, by the night passage from New-York— He brought me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="vanvleet-jrs">J. R. S. Van Vleet</persRef>, Chairman
							of the Committee of arrangements of the whigs of New-York, who are to
							have another great procession of trades to-morrow among which will be
							the Printers; and they want me to write a short address to the People
							which they may print with my name, while they are moving— I told this
							young man it was impossible, being engaged day and Night in preparing an
							Address to be delivered to the People of my own district, to-morrow— He
							asked for a written answer, but I thought a verbal one sufficient.— The
							poor young man said he was very unwell and had not slept last Night— I
							pitied him— <persRef ref="tileston-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Tileston</persRef> came with his brother <persRef
								ref="tileston-james">James</persRef>, to ask the Manuscript of my
							address of tomorrow to print in the Courier with which he is connected—
							I told him it was engaged to the Atlas— He then spoke for the Address to
							be delivered at North Bridgwater next week, which I promised.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 6.31. Set 4.58.</p>
						<p>I rose with gratitude for the clear blue sky and saw the Sun rise from
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house on the hill—
							The meeting was announced for half past ten— I went with <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Minott
								Thayer’s</persRef> house, where I was received by him with his

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Putnam</persRef> was <persRef
								ref="simmons-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Simmons</persRef>
							of Roxbury— <persRef ref="fogg-susannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Fogg</persRef> an old Lady turned of 80, a sister of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer, infirm and unable to leave her
							chamber sent a message requesting me to come up and see her, which I
							did— <persRef ref="fogg-ebenezer">Her son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fogg-betsey">his wife</persRef> were also there and live with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer, who is a bachelor nearly of
							my age. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fogg knew <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-abigail"
								>mother</persRef> and all the family in the time of her and my
							childhood, but I was so early in my days absent from the country that
							she remembered not having ever seen me. Nor did I. There was a
							procession formed to meet me at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer’s
							house and escort me to the Meeting house—with a small musical band; and
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas11">Major Thomas Adams</persRef> of Quincy
							was the Marshall. But the procession assembled slowly and it was past
							11. before they came— I marched between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thayer and <persRef ref="hilliard-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Francis Hilliard</persRef>— There was a stand on a
							platform in front of the pulpit with a large folio bible upon it; and
							upon that bible I read my Address— The choir in the organ loft sung the
							hymn America— The <persRef ref="williams-thomas6">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Thomas Williams</persRef> read the
							Chapter 1. Samuel 12.5 verses and made a short prayer. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Hilliard, chairman of the District
							whig Committee, announced me as about to address the meeting, which I
							did for about two hours and a quarter; after which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hilliard announced that there would be
							another meeting at the same place at half past 3. in the afternoon, but
							that I should not be present— I returned to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Minott Thayer’s, where there was a table laid for dinner and
							several friends there. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer urged me to
							stay; but I had sent him word last week that I should be obliged to come
							home to dinner as I did with Miss Smith.— My address was well received.—
							The house was not filled. The democracy, had stretched a <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> and <persRef ref="dallas-george"
								>Dallas</persRef> flag across the way under which the procession was
							to pass, but the wind blew it down— We got home at half-past two, well
							satisfied and grateful for the day.</p>

							concerning it.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes was in a stage,
							and had promised the driver not to detain him more than five minutes.— I

							Left her at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							the Massachusetts Historical Society at which 28 members were present—
							It was rather jocular than dignified and adjourned soon after one. An
							invitation was received from the New-York historical Society, to attend
							their anniversary Meeting on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							November— A Committee of five members was appointed to attend as a

							attend as a delegate— <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi
