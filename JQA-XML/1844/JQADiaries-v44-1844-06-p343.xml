						<p>I had called a final meeting of the select Committee on the Smithsonian
							bequest, at half past 9 this morning, and yesterday sent round by one of
							the pages a notification to all the members of the Committee in the
							house— I had also personally notified <persRef ref="houston-george"
								>George S. Houston</persRef>—but the only members who attended were
								<persRef ref="brengle-francis">Brengle</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="french-richard">French</persRef>, and <persRef ref="yost-jacob"
								>Yost</persRef> to whom I read the report and bill that I had
							prepared, both which they approved and authorised me to present after
							obtaining the consent of one more member of the Committee, to the house—
							That consent I afterwards obtained from <persRef ref="potter-emery"
								>Emery D. Potter</persRef>, the member from Ohio— At the house there
							was an hour’s debate on two Resolutions offered by <persRef
								ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef> 1. That the daily hour
							of the meeting henceforth should be 10. O’Clock A.M. 2. That the house
							should daily take a recess from half past 2 to 4. O’Clock P.M. To which
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>
							offered as an amendment that the house should sit till 8 O Clock every
							evening— There was no opposition to the first Resolution, which was at
							last unanimously adopted. But <persRef ref="white-john6"
							>White</persRef>, Speaker of the last house strenuously opposed the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> resolution for the daily recess, which he
							urged experience had proved to be worse than useless waste of time. It
							was struck out by tellers 65 to 61. Ingersoll’s amendment was declared
							by the Speaker to be not in order. The motion to adjourn being by a rule
							of the house always in order. <persRef ref="reding-john"
								>Reding</persRef> moved that debate should cease on the Memphis
							Navy-Yard Bill, in one hour after it shall be taken up in Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union— As he pleaded hard for two hours,
							and then for an hour and a half which was carried— The private Calendar
							was then taken up, and 76 private bills were passed— That for <persRef
								ref="sweetser-seth">Seth Sweetser</persRef> and that for <persRef
								ref="cazeau-francois">Francis Casaux</persRef> were laid on the
							table and that for <persRef ref="depeyster-h">H De Peyster</persRef>
							laid aside. The house, after several abortive motions to adjourn yielded
							to one shortly before 5. and at 6. I went and dined with <persRef
								ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pakenham</persRef> the British Minister. I have minuted in the
							margin the names of all the company at this dinner— <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> has just returned from
							his mission to Mexico, and greeted me, with kindness for Massachusetts
							of outward cordiality! the snake! <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert
								C. Winthrop</persRef> told me he had received a Letter from his
							relative <persRef ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef>,
							relating in part to me, and of which he gave me the general purport, to
							be remembered. </p>

						<p>I received yesterday a printed note of invitation— “<persRef
								ref="priestman-rachel">Rachel Priestman</persRef> a minister of the
							Gospel in the Society of Friends, has appointed a meeting for Divine
							Worship, to be held in the Capitol to-morrow morning at 11. O’Clock to
							which thou art respectfully invited.” I attended accordingly. She
							preached from the Clerk’s table where two men and two women of her
							company were seated with her.— After sitting about 20 minutes in silence
							she took off and laid aside her black bonnet and rising began rather
							suddenly, “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
							that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners.” from this text 1
							Timothy 1.15. without so naming it, she discoursed nearly an hour in the
							peculiar canting tone of Quaker Oratory, slow, distinct and loud
							articulation without a moment’s loss of words, but within almost every
							sentence, a pause and hitch to take breath, repeating almost every verse
							in <persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> epistles impressing the doctrine
							of Salvation by Faith in Christ Jesus.— Her exhortations were full of
							unction and intensity— She finished as abruptly as she had begun, and
							sat down, apparently exhausted— The house was well filled and attentive
							Some of the auditory thinking the service over began to move, but a man
							of her company requested them not to depart, and they resumed their
							Seats. After an interval of about 5 minutes she kneeled and made a
							fervent affectionate and passionate prayer in behalf of her hearers, not
							omitting a supplication to God to turn their hearts to dissolve the ties
							of bondage, and let the oppressed go free After the service was over,
							she came with <persRef ref="priestman-jonathan">her husband</persRef> I
							suppose, to my seat and shook hands with me; as did with <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Giddings</persRef> a young woman from Ohio named<space/>I walked home.
							After dinner I attended at Saint John’s Church, where <persRef
								ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pine</persRef> read
							Evening prayers for Trinity Sunday and another clergyman, a Stranger
							preached from Psalm 27.8. [“]When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart
							said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.”— <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							was not there; though he had been in the morning, and administered the
							Communion. He is in feeble health; and it is said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pine is already engaged to be settled, as
							his colleague— <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef> was
							there this afternoon. The heat of the day was so intense that I could
							write little. </p>

						<p>As I was stepping into my carriage this morning to go to the Capitol, I

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>, agent for the heirs
							of <persRef ref="cazeau-francois">Francis Casaux</persRef>, who were
							coming to see me. This Casaux claim, now of 67 years standing was before
							the house last Saturday in the shape of a Bill for the relief of the
							heirs of Francis Casaux reported by the Committee of the whole and put
							upon its passage for engrossment. The bill was opposed and I made some
							remarks expressing my doubts if there was any good foundation for the
							claim— The Bill was laid on the table— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bigelow came to convince me of the justice of the claim— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings having to call at a Department,
							went on; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow took a seat with me and
							went with me to the Capitol, reminding me on the way of his application
							to me as long since as 1832, for my testimony in this case which then or
							afterwards I gave in writing— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow
							brought me a report from the late <persRef ref="maxcy-virgil">Virgil
								Maxcy</persRef> when solicitor of the Treasury; in favour of the
							claim— A motion was made by <persRef ref="dean-ezra">Dean</persRef> of
							Ohio to reconsider the vote laying the bill on the table, and then the

								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> moved a

							treaties between the United States and Portugal, the Netherlands and
							Spain, and the resolution concerning the reciprocity treaties, with
							Denmark, Sweden, the Hanse-Towns and Great Britain. He dragooned the

							called the yeas and nays— Lost 78 and 84— Committee of the whole on the

						<p>I had promised yesterday to give <persRef ref="cranch-john">M<hi

							for him to retouch his portrait of me with which he is not satisfied—
							But the morning was dark lowering and rainy, and it was half past 9.

							preferred waiting till to-morrow for another sitting to taking of one of
							half an hour this day.— At the house <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles"
								>Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>, offered a Resolution calling on the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for all the
							correspondence with the British Government relating to the exaction by
							them of duties on rough rice contrary to the Treaty of 1815— There was a
							snake under this foliage, for Ingersoll said it was harmless.— But
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved an
							amendment calling for all the documents relating to the Texian Treaty.
							Ingersoll objected to this amendment and advised and persuaded Johnson
							to withdraw it till at last he promised that all these Documents shall
							be communicated to the house, whereupon Cave withdrew his amendment and
							Ingersoll’s resolution was adopted. <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> then moved the Resolution to cease debate in
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the civil and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill, and take it out of Committee at 12
							O’Clock to-morrow.— There was great pleading by <persRef
								ref="white-john6">White</persRef>, <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
								>Barnard</persRef> and others to extend the time to Friday or
							Thursday, or to 4 O’Clock or 2 O’Clock P.M. to all such motions M’Kay
							stood inflexible, and called the previous question which was sustained
							and carried— There will of course be not one word of debate on this
							bill, bearing on the appropriations or having any reference to the bill
							itself—not one word relevant to the subject before the house. And so it
							would be if the debate were protracted to the last hour of the Session.—
							The house then went immediately into Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union, <persRef ref="davis-john8">John W. Davis</persRef> in the
							chair <persRef ref="rathbun-george">George Rathbun</persRef> took the
							floor and poured forth an hour of glory and defence upon <persRef

							vilification of <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>.—
								<persRef ref="summers-george">Summers</persRef> followed on the

							>Peyton</persRef>, <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Saunders</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin">Bidlack</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="foot-solomon">Foote</persRef> of Vermont, till near 8. O’Clock
							in the Evening.— Foote’s speech was the most eloquent and the most
							decent of them all— Several motions for the Committee to rise were voted
							down, till twilight came, when on taking the question, upon a motion to
							rise, the majority voted against rising, but the whole vote was
							only<space/>no quorum— The Committee then rose per force and reported no
							Quorum— A motion to adjourn was rejected— A call of the house was
							refused by yeas and nays<space/>Motions to adjourn to 8 to 6. and to 4
							O’Clock to morrow morning were made, till after lights had been brought
							into the hall—the house adjourned to the usual time. </p>

								>Pollock’s</persRef> amendment requiring stationary of American
							Manufacture, as a species of whig humbuggery, which was an insult to the
							American People, and when called by name on the yeas and nays taken on
							this amendment he voted for it.— The temper of the Speech was in full
							keeping with its conclusion, which was the Standard of Henry Clay should
							consist of his armorial bearings, which ought to be, a pistol, a pack of
							cards and a brandy bottle— <persRef ref="tibbatts-john"
								>Tibbatts</persRef> took the last house of the debate, allowing only
							ten minutes of it to <persRef ref="thomasson-william"
								>Thomasson</persRef> to back him in a motion to appropriate 550000
							dollars to purchase a remnant of Stock in the Louisville, and Portland
							Canal to make it toll free— At 12 O’Clock the debate ceased and the
							voting commenced on the amendments, and continued till past 4. many of
							which were rejected, and a few were adopted— <persRef ref="pratt-zadock"
								>Pratt</persRef> chairman of the Committee on the public buildings

							over the remains of the late <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">Major
								General Alexander Macomb</persRef>. The chairman decided Pratt’s

							and finished by admitting Pratt’s items one by one, and excluding mine
							when the bill was reported to the house. Tibbatts renewed his motion for
							an appropriation to purchase the canal Stock—but the <persRef

								Botts</persRef> had been made the special order of this day.— Both

							desired.— The first question was whether the competitors in arguing
							their claims should be limited by the hour rule, and after much debate

								<persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> so decided— <persRef

						<p>Another last sitting to <persRef ref="cranch-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cranch</persRef> for my portrait. At
							the house, <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> called for the
							consideration of the civil and diplomatic, and the navy appropriation
							bills, and <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef>, chairman of the
							committee of claims, expressed a willingness to pass over the private
							bills for this day, upon condition that they shall be taken up
							to-morrow. But he pleaded for a short slip of time to call for the
							reports of Committees. <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> called on the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef>, for a Letter from <persRef
								ref="wickliffe-charles">Charles A. Wickliffe</persRef> Postmaster
							General, referring to a charge against him for official malversation,
							made on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month, by <persRef
								ref="davis-garrett">Garret Davis</persRef>, declaring the charge in
							every sense untrue, and that he is prepared to prove it so; and
							demanding an enquiry by order of the house. Garrett Davis said that he
							had stated the facts, and was prepared to prove them all true. As to the
							guilt of the Postmaster, he left that to be inferred from the facts
							which he had stated; and if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wickliffe
							wanted enquiry as to the facts stated by him he was perfectly willing,
							and even to extend the enquiry to other charges against the Postmaster
							General, of similar character.— Cave the moved to refer the Letter to
							the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-Roads, with Liberty to send for
							persons and papers. Cave slyly observed that Garrett Davis’s charge this
							day was a little different from that which he had made before. Davis
							demanded in what particular it differed, and Cave had no reply to make.—
							His motion to refer the charges to the Committee of Post Offices and
							Post-roads was adopted, but Davis’s motion to extend the enquiry was
							lost.— M’Kay reported the bill-making appropriations for the unlawful
							naval expenditures— I moved to lay the bill on the table—lost—ayes 45.—
							It was referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union;
							where <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> told me he wanted
							to debate it— <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> made a
							voluminous report from the Select Committee on the Rhode Island
							Rebellion, and moved that it be printed and postponed to the first
							Monday, in December next, which, after some debate it was carried, with
							agreement that a minority report, promised by <persRef ref="causin-john"
								>Causin</persRef> shall also be printed— I presented the report and
							Bill from the select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, which were
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and
							ordered to be printed— The civil and diplomatic, and the Navy
							Appropriation Bills were taken up, and driven through, and just before
							5. O’Clock the house adjourned <persRef ref="colton-george">M<hi

								<persRef ref="tecumseh">Tecumseh</persRef>—brought me a Letter of

							and spent the Evening with me. <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi

								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> went to an Evening

							yesterday was different from that which he had made, and upon which M<hi

							interfere in the election against Davis and for his competitor, <persRef
								ref="wickliffe-robert2">Wickliffe’s nephew</persRef>— Davis had
							stated facts leading to that conclusion, and said he left the house to
							draw their own conclusion— Cave Johnson rather retreated from the
							discussion and Davis moved a suspension of the rules for a Resolution of
							enquiry by the Post-Office Committee generally of malversation by the
							Postmaster General. The suspension of the rules was refused 60 to 66—
							The house passed two bills relating to affairs of the district, and laid

						<p>I attended this morning with <persRef

							where <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pine</persRef> read the morning service for the first Sunday after
							Trinity, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Scoresby</persRef> preached from Isaiah 5.3. [“]And now, O,
							inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt
							me and my vineyard 4. What could have been done more to my vineyard that
							I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
							forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?” There is a singular
							transition from the third to the first person in the narrative of this
							wild but beautiful allegory. This seeming grammatical confusion is
							characteristic of the style of the Hebrew prophets and especially of
								<persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>— This chapter is one of the
							most fearful predictions of the destruction of the two kingdoms of
							Israel and of Judah in the whole book of the Scriptures. With regard to
							the application of the text to the time and place, some question
							occurred to me of the propriety of the selection.— If this Country was
							to be considered as the vineyard of the Lord, for which he had done so
							much; all that could be done, and the vineyard had brought forth
							pernicious fruit instead of good fruit, was it for a stranger just
							landed on our shores then to use the language of reproach and the menace
							of destruction— But the preacher dealt to day only in generalities,
							expostulated only with individuals, and avoided all offensive
							imputations The boundless bounties of the Creator and the graceless
							ingratitude of the desperately wicked human heart was a theme upon which
							it was easy to expatiate at large— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Scoresby’s manner is earnest without extravagant, his composition grave
							and impressive, his pronunciation all English— <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							announced the death of <persRef ref="smith-margaret3">M<hi

							was out. Notice was given by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley that
							this afternoon and henceforth for the Season, the evening service would
							commence at 5. O’Clock— But at 4. I attended at the second Presbyterian
							Church and heard <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> James Knox</persRef> from Ecclesiastes 4.13 [“]Better is
							a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king”—leaving out the

							abundantly democratic, and a collection was taken up for the Society—

							violation of the exclusive constitutional authority of the house—lost 78

						<p>I had little time this morning to prepare for the discussion of the
							question upon my appeal last evening from the decision of the <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef>, upon the motion to reconsider
							the vote on the vetoed Treaty.— There was a debate of three hours upon
							the question in the house; but the decision of the Speaker was sustained
							by yeas and nays 97 to 85 <persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jameson</persRef>
							of Missouri, by suspended rules offered and carried a Resolution to take
							a recess from half past two to four O’Clock P.M this day and the

							a son of the late <persRef ref="clark-william">Governor William

								>Dromgoole</persRef> in the chair— The supplementary naval
							appropriation was taken up <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D.
								Barnard</persRef> moved an amendment, more explicitly declaring than
								<persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> had done in his bill that
							almost the whole of these expenditures had been incured not only without
							authority of Law but in defiance of Law.— Barnard was followed by
								<persRef ref="dean-ezra">Ezra Dean</persRef>, one of the rankest
							radicals in the house, who pronounced a philippic of an hour upon all
							parties, upon the last and the present Congress, interspersed with
							special venomous thrusts at the whigs—bewailing his disappointment in
							the expectation of reform<unclear>s,</unclear> and declaring that he would henceforth
							never <unclear>take?</unclear> the name of reform from in any other sense than as a
							humbug with unmitigated contempt— M’Kay commenced the defence of his
							bill, but was interrupted by the time for recess. I went and dined with
							Kennedy and Winthrop.— It was 5. O’Clock when we returned to the house—
							The naval appropriation bill supplementary had been resumed. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard’s amendment was adopted; and the
							bill was passed.— The penal post-office bill was taken up in Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal"
								>Hamlin</persRef> Chairman; after a vote to take it out of Committee
							in 5. minutes.— D. D. Barnard asked leave to present, and moved to
							suspend the rules for 2 Resolutions of censure—upon <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">Tyler’s</persRef> usurpations— Suspension refused
							by yeas and nays 56 to 123.— The Light house bill—Army Appropriation
							Bill, Western Land sales bill, and Georgia dead horse bill, were
							successively taken up, and buffeted along in Committee and in the house
							till half past ten at night when the house adjourned, and I came
							home</p>

						<p>There was steady rain almost the whole day of yesterday and great part of
							last Night; and this day was of a temperature more congenial to October
							than to June. <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Laurie</persRef> called on me this morning and renewed
							his solicitation for my interference, to obtain from the President of
							Mexico <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa Anna</persRef> the release
							of <persRef ref="shepherd-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								William M. Shepherd</persRef> a prisoner taken at Mier and confined
							in the Castle of Perote— I repeated a promise I had made before on

							last, that if Peace with Mexico should be restored, I would appeal to
							the humanity of General Santa Anna in behalf of D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Shepherd and others of the Prisoners taken at Mier— <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waddy
								Thompson</persRef> had already requested my good offices for them.
							At the house, this was the second of the last days of agonising
							confusion usual at the close of a Session of Congress.— It passes a
							spunge upon my memory, so that it is impossible to record the course of
							business, and can notice only a few of the incidents of the day.— There
							have been majority and minority reports from the <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund4">Burke’s</persRef> select Committee on the
							Rhode-Island memorial— Burke failed this day in a motion to print 5000
							copies of his incendiary report.— Upon a Senate Bill to fix the Northern
							boundary of Missouri <persRef ref="dodge-augustus">Augustus
								Dodge</persRef> the delegate from the territory of Iowa hitched in
							an amendment authorising the People of that territory to form a State
							Government, with a surface of more than 100000 square miles.— The
							plundering Louisiana land claim bill was earnestly opposed, by <persRef
								ref="vinton-samuel">Samuel F. Vinton</persRef>, until the hour of
							the recess when I came home and dined— A message was received from the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> with a large budget of
							the correspondence of <persRef ref="erving-george">George W.
								Erving</persRef> in Spain from 1815 to 1819. not heretofore made
							public— It was the answer, to the call of the house, moved by <persRef
								ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef><space/>April before his
							transfer to the Senate— I cursorily read over the papers and found
							abundant evidence to falsify the pretension of George W. Erving that he
							could have negotiated a boundary, even to the Colorado; but his
							instructions were not included in D. H. Lewis’s call.— This afternoon I
							asked leave to present a Resolution calling on the President for them—
								<persRef ref="reding-john">Reding</persRef> objected— I moved and
							carried a suspension of the rules, and the Resolution was adopted— The
							Louisiana land claim bill, after a stubborn struggle was passed by yeas
							and nays 86 to 84. a reconsideration was afterwards moved, but the bill
							had been sent to the Senate, and <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>White</persRef> objected that in such case there could be no

								<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> in the chair The

						<p>The <persRef ref="brown-obadiah">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Obadiah B. Brown</persRef> came this morning with a deed of release
							to him of his mortgage given as security upon his note for 1000 dollars
							taken by me in March 1842 in part payment of the debt of the Columbian
							College to me— On the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of last Month he
							paid the note-principal and interest in full and took it up with the
							mortgage.— In addition to this, a deed of release from the mortgagee is
							customary here; and I executed and acknowledged this one before two
							magistrates <persRef ref="brown-edmund">E. F. Brown</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="lawrenson-james">James Lawrenson</persRef> who came
							with him— I found the house in a chaos of confusion with two stupid
							resolutions against a bank of the United States reported from the
							Committee of elections by <persRef ref="ellis-chesselden">Chesselden
								Ellis</persRef>, one of the weakest and most worthless turncoats in
							the house— They had been sprung this morning without notice or
							consultation with the minority of the Committee of Elections, and by the
							screw of the previous question moved by Ellis, were crammed down with
							the yeas and nays 108 to 68— A meaner and more despicable fraud was
							never perpetrated— There was something of consolation in what followed—
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> rose
							and without making any motion insinuated that the journal of 31. May
							required amendment.— It was there stated that I had presented a petition
							from citizens of Pennsylvania for an alteration of the naturalization
							Laws, and that it had been laid on the table— Since then he had received
							many Letters enquiring into the facts, and upon applying to the <persRef
								ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk</persRef> had been told that the petition
							had been withdrawn by me— If the petition was not on the clerk’s table,
							the Journal ought no to show that it had been laid there— The Petition
							was in my draw.— I took it out, held it up and said that in my anxiety
							to have it referred to the Committee, after enquiring of the Clerk
							whether it could not be so referred from the table without new
							application to the house and being informed that it could not I had
							borrowed it yesterday for the express purpose of moving that it be taken
							up and referred to the judiciary committee, which now I did.— The
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> said could only be
							entertained by universal consent. I asked it.— Charles faintly said he
							saw no reason that it should not be referred— <persRef ref="reding-john"
								>Reding</persRef> objected— I moved a suspension of the rules and
							carried it by an overwhelming shout. Opposition slunk into silence, and
							the petition was referred to the judiciary committee— The same petition
							which 16 days ago by yeas and nays 128 to 24 refused to refer it, and
							laid it on the table— Ingersoll has raised a hornet’s nest about his
							ears by his double vote first against and then for laying the petition
							on the table. He has published a Letter to his constituents of the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of Pennsylvania
							to account for his double vote— His chief reasons are that the other
							Pennsylvania members save two, voted as he did at last, and <pb n="358"
								type="ms"/>that the petition was presented by me— He did not like
							the [“]auspices.”— While the house was in its Babel state this morning,
							I went for a long hour into the Senate chamber where I found <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">George M’Duffie</persRef>, closing a violent
							and rancorous speech against <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas Hart
								Benton</persRef>, and his bill for the annexation of Texas— The bill
							was already laid on the table; but M’Duffie had obtained leave to answer
							Benton’s speech on introducing his bill— M’Duffie’s speech was unsparing
							upon Benton; and his reply of about one hour was so merciless and
							personal, that nothing but bodily fear, could have withheld the hand of
							M’Duffie from a challenge— But he put up with it, quiet as a lamb— I
							returned to the house where the Louisiana land bill, return from the
							Senate at the request of the house, was reconsidered, and after a
							metamorphosis, striking out all but one section it was passed and sent
							to the Senate again— From half past 2 to 4. O’Clock P.M. I came home and
							dined, and returned to the house— During the whole day and till after
							midnight the appropriation bills, civil and diplomatic, army-navy and
							Indian were time after time before the house, in and out of Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union, upon amendments pending between the
							two houses and reports of Committees of conferences on disagreeing
							votes— In almost every instance the house finished by receding, as they
							did without one exception from all their retrenchments Though <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> had sworn to me that he would lose
							the civil and diplomatic, and the army bill sooner than give up the
							retrenchments which his Committee had introduced into them and which the
							house had sanctioned but after a second conference, he gave them all up,
							and the house submitted.— <persRef ref="ashe-john">Ashe</persRef> of
							Tennessee carried through a bill for establishing a naval depot at
							Memphis in that State against the opposition of the Mississippi and
							Louisiana, who wanted it in their own States— The whigs helped Ashe
							through.— The Cumberland Road, the bill to extend the Charters of the
							District Banks, and multitudes of private bills were urged upon the
							house in most admired disorder, one against the other, and by perpetual
							motions to suspend the rules rejected by yeas and nays or by tellers.—
							About 10 at Night conflict commenced between the District bank bill, and
							private bills, all at the third reading and under the previous question—
							Motions for a call of the house and to adjourn were followed up in
							alternate succession and always with demand for yeas and nays— Shortly
							before midnight <persRef ref="rhett-robert">R B Rhett</persRef> moved to
							adjourn, and said that whether the house should adjourn or not, he would
							retire as the sabbath should commence— A motion to adjourn at 4 minutes
							past 12 was rejected— I desired that the time might be minuted on the
							journal— Soon after 2. the Senate adjourned— 20 minutes past 3 a motion
							to adjourn was made, and on the call of my name I answered no and fell
							asleep till <persRef ref="potter-elisha2">E. R. Potter</persRef> roused
							me and told me the house was adjourned</p>

							the Litany and Communion and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley gave
							out the notices.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wainwright preached a
							very excellent Sermon, from Proverbs 23.26, first part of the verse.
							[“]My Son, give me thy heart.”— The discourse commenced with an
							exemplification of the various senses in which the heart is used in the
							scriptures to indicate the properties of the human character— He quoted
							sundry passages of Scriptures in which the heart is significant of the
							understanding of the judgment of the Memory, of the Imagination, of the
							affections, and he might have added of the vices— The wisest of men does
							not appear to have analyzed the compound man, so as to discriminate
							between the operations of the intellect and of the affections— In the
							chapter from which this text was taken, is successively used to signify
							the seat of thought of deception, of wisdom of envy and of joy.— Jesus
							declared the first commandment to be, thou shall love the Lord thy God,
							with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind—that is
							with the affections, the intellect and the will— <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef> includes all in the heart— In this text the
							heart, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wainwright thinks means
							exclusively the affections, and he builds upon it a theory that the
							first avenue to all religious Faith is through the senses— This must be
							true—but neither Trinity nor transubstantiation can be traced to this—
							After the morning service I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">Daniel D. Barnard</persRef> to take leave; and
							a long conversation with him— This Texas annexation we deem the turning
							point of a resolution which transforms the North-American Confederation
							into a conquering and warlike Nation. Aggrandizement will be its passion
							and its policy— A military Government, a large army, a costly Navy,
							distant Colonies, and associate islands in every sea will follow of
							course in rapid succession—a President for four years will be a laughing
							stock. A Captain General for life and a Marshal’s truncheon for a
							Scepter will establish the law of arms for the constitution, and the
							skeleton forms of War and Slavery will stalk unbridled over the land.—
							Blessed God deliver us from this fate!— After dinner M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley jointly performed the service, 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							Sunday after Trinity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne preached from

							to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. </p>

						<p>Close of 28. Congress. 1. Session.</p>
						<p>The first shock of Slave Democracy is over. Moloch and Mammon have sunk
							into momentary slumber— The Texas Treason is blasted for the hour, and
							the first Session of the most perverse and worthless Congress that ever
							disgraced this confederacy has closed. This last day from 10 in the
							morning till Noon was a continuation of tumult from the adjournment of
							yesterday morning. The joint Resolution of the two houses, had fixed the
							adjournment, by their respective presiding Officers at 12 O’Clock
							Meridian this day. There were numerous bills public and private still
							pending before them both, and the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							joint rule forbids the sending of any bill to the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for his approbation on the last
							day of the Session— This rule was rescinded and bills were sent to him
							and signed by him at least until the moment of adjournment. A printed
							notice signed by three lawyers, counsel for the 3 city banks, was laid
							on the tables of the members, stating that if Congress should not act on
							the bill for extending the charters, on their expiration, 4 July next
							they would be without power to recover any debts due to them— <persRef
								ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>, chairman of the Committee
							on the District of Columbia succeeded after a hard struggle in
							introducing a bill, which he called a compromise, giving the banks power
							after the expiration of their charters to prosecute and recover debts
							due to them, and making them accountable for their own, which bill was
							carried through and signed by the President— The inflexibility of the
							house against rechartering the banks, is said to have been wrought by
							the two brothers Carroll, one a <persRef ref="carroll-charles2">whig
								member</persRef> from the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> district
							of New-York, and the other <persRef ref="carroll-william"
								>Clerk</persRef> of the U.S. Supreme Court, and who is said to have
							a debt of his own of 20000 dollars to one of the City banks.— The Senate
							passed a Resolution to postpone the adjournment till two O’Clock, and
							while it was under discussion, in the House, the yeas and nays were
							called; in the midst of which call, the minute hand of the clock,
							pointing precisely at 12. the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef> stop’d the call—declared the house adjourned
							without day, and left the chair. No Messages between the houses— No
							farewell to the President, and the members dispersed to their respective
							places of abode— <persRef ref="thompson-gilbert">Gilbert Livingston
								Thompson</persRef> the Messenger sent to Mexico to snuff the scent
							of the Texian annexation Treaty there, returned this day, and reports
							that <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa Anna</persRef> is ready and
							willing to treat for the cession of Texas to the United States. In the
							course of the day, I had visits from <persRef ref="colton-george">M<hi

								<persRef ref="muller-albert">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi

						<p>In the midst of the hurly burly of a closing session of Congress, a scene
							always sufficient to discompose the serenity of a steadier mind than
							mine, I have been distracted with multiplied applications for autographs
							and lines in Albums, which it would be ungracious and would be thought
							churlish to refuse, and yet with which it is insupportable to comply.—
							For many years I have occasionally written knacks, trifles, nosegays in
							the scrapbooks of my younger relatives, for which I have but a wretched
							talent, and inginuety could seldom save me from compliance— I once
							attempted to make a collection of these nugae albae; but I sickened at
							the sight of most of them and I gave it up.— A quarto volume, price ten
							dollars was published a few weeks since called the United States Album,
							with copperplate engravings of the arms of all the States in the Union,
							and fac-simile signatures of the President, of all the members of both
							houses of Congress, and of all the judges of the Supreme Court, and then
							blank leaves to be written upon.— <persRef ref="stephens-alexander">A.
								H. Stephens</persRef> of Georgia, <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Joshua R. Giddings</persRef> of Ohio and <persRef
								ref="fish-hamilton">Hamilton Fish</persRef>, have each a copy of
							this book, and asked me to write my name and a few lines in them, and
							there I was straining from hard bound brains senseless rhymes, like the
							slipshod <persRef ref="sybil">Sybil</persRef> in lofty madness
							meditating song.— I went this morning to the Capitol, returned the
							volume of <persRef ref="dupuis-charles">Dupuis</persRef> which I had
							borrowed for <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todsen</persRef> from the congress Library, and took out the 5<hi

							<persRef ref="alcedo-antonio">Alcedo</persRef>.— <persRef

							Pastor of a Congregation of English Lutherans had invited me to attend
							at the ceremony of laying the corner stone of a Church last Thursday.— I
							was that day engaged at the house, but the weather was bad, and the
							ceremony was postponed to this day. D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Muller came yesterday and repeated the invitation to me to attend.
							Accordingly at 3 O’Clock this afternoon I went to the City Hall, and
							thence walked in procession of clergymen, church council of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul’s congregation, teachers and pupils
							of the Sunday school; the Officers of the Grand Lodge of the <hi
								rend="strikethrough">Grand</hi>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">Lodge</hi> District of Columbia in full
							Regalia; the Sons of Temperance Society, and multitudes of boys,
							escorted by the Marine band, to the corner of H and 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Street, where the corner stone was laid
							of the English Lutheran Church of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Paul’s.— There was a disgusting alliance of religious ceremonies with
							Masonic Mummery, but not a word could be heard of the address of the
							Grand Master who laid the corner Stone— The heat was excessive. Evening

						<p>It sometimes happens at sea, that in the midst of a hurricane, the wind

							attention to public affairs is absorbed in the preparations for settling
							my debts here, and in looking up the documents for the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> and third Sessions of the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, one set of each of which I am
							to pack up in a chest and send round by water to Boston— The Documents
							are now divided into three sets of 1. Executive Documents of the House.
							2. Reports of Committees of the House 3. Senate Documents, including
							Executive and Reports— Then one Volume of Journals of Each house—and a
							Folio Volume or two of printed Bills and Amendments— I doubt if another
							member of Congress besides myself preserves an entire set of all these
							papers. Of the Bills no one condescends to keep a set After the close of
							each Session, every member of each house is entitled to receive bound
							one set of what are called the Session Documents, and one copy of the
							Journal of each house. But not of the Bills— During the Session each
							member has a copy of every printed document, and of every sheet of the
							Journals of both houses laid on his table fresh printed—these, like
							sybil leaves are scattered and destroyed from day to day— My practice is
							to have them kept in files for me, including the printed bills, and
							after the close of the Session to have them bound at my own expence— I
							have thus one set of the Documents here, and one at my home in Quincy.
							But many of the voluminous Documents are not printed till long after the
							close of the Session to which they belong. I found my sets of documents
							of both the second and third Sessions of the 27<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congress incomplete and called at the Intelligencer and
							Globe Offices, and at the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk’s</persRef>
							Office H.R.U.S. to rectify mistakes. <persRef ref="french-benjamin"
								>French</persRef> the Subclerk was gone to dinner, and I did not

							conversation with <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef>, that
								<persRef ref="thompson-gilbert">Gilbert L. Thompson’s</persRef>
							reports from Mexico were shameless lies, and that instead of <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> John C. Spencer</persRef> whose
							relations with the vicarious administration of <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>John Tyler</persRef> as President of the United States have been

							between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler and the whig cabinet of
								<persRef ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef>— John
							C. Spencer, was President or Chairman of a whig association in the State
							of New-York and called an indignation meeting of whigs against Tyler at
							Syracuse— Before that meeting was held on the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of October 1841. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer
							was appointed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler Secretary of War,
							which Office he accepted and held, till March 7. 1843 when he was
							appointed Secretary of the Treasury— During the recent Session of
							Congress he was nominated a judge of the Supreme Court and on the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January last was rejected by the
							Senate. Since then, he resigned his office as Secretary of the Treasury,
							for which no reason has been made public; and on the last day of the

							write some verses addressed to her— I did write a couple of Stanzas
							which puzzled me in the composition not a little— For I began with a
							line of seven syllables and in following out the verse fell
							unconsciously into the blunder of mingling 7 and 8 syllable lines
							together— I discovered it only by the want of harmony in the lines upon
							reading them over— I never before the peculiar property of the seven
							syllable line, which consists in the uniform location of the accent and
							emphasis on the first syllable of each line— The inadvertent admission
							of a word accented on the second syllable, changes the measure to the
							eight syllable verse, and the mixture of the two measures produces
							dissonance— It took me hours to Procrustesize my lines to M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Morris— She was here this day with
								<persRef ref="payne-anna">Miss Paine</persRef>, when I was out.—
							Miss Paine left word that I must not write any more verses for ladies— I
							proceeded in the assortment of my documents for the second and third

						<p>The settlement of my accounts; the payment of accumulated bills, the

							Sarah H. Butler President of the Ladies of the Wyoming Monumental
							Association at Wilkesbarre Pennsylvania—and I found it also, both in the
							Boston Courier and Daily Advertiser which came this day. I called again
							at the Office of the National Intelligencer, and obtained a copy of the
							paper of 7. June containing the fifth List of petitions presented by me
							to the House of Representatives at the first Session of the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, with the disposal of them by
							the house— The preceding lists are in the papers of 28. December 1843.
							10 and 29. February and 5. April 1844— This last of 7. June contains
							also the Memorial of <persRef ref="jarvis-edward">Edward
								Jarvis</persRef>, <persRef ref="brigham-william">William
								Brigham</persRef>, and <persRef ref="thornton-john">J. Wingate
								Thornton</persRef>, the Committee of the American statistical
							association, demonstrating a multitude of gross and important errors in
							the printed Census of 1840.— On the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							February last I had stated to the then Secretary of State <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">Upshur</persRef> that there were numerous errors
							in the printed census, and proved to him by inspection of the census
							itself the error of the return of 133 insane coloured persons in the
							town of Worcester, Massachusetts— On the 26<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of that month, the house at my motion, adopted a call upon
							the <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of State</persRef> for a
							report whether any such material errors existed, and if so what had been
							done to correct them— The journal of the house of 4. May (p 887) states
							that the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> laid before the
							house a Letter from the Secretary of State (John C. Calhoun) in answer
							to the Resolution of 26. February, “stating that no such errors had been
							discovered”— On the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May I moved to
							amend the journal of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> by striking out
							the words “and stating that no such errors had been discovered”— My
							motion was lost, by yeas and nays 32 to 126— On the preceding 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April the same Secretary of State
							John C. Calhoun, in an official Letter to the British Minister <persRef
								ref="pakenham-richard">Pakenham</persRef> had drawn out an elaborate
							argument from these same falsified returns of the census as if they were
							uncontroverted truths, to justify the annexation Treaty with Texas.— On
							the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May I moved a suspension of the
							rules to enable me to present this memorial, to the house and the yeas
							and nays on my motion were 93 to 47. The Speaker’s vote would have
							carried the two thirds required to suspend the rules; he declared it
							lost for lack of two thirds. I asked if he had voted he said he had not,
							and if he had it would have been in the negative— The next day I entered
							the memorial under the rule and it was referred to the Committee on
							Statistics whose Chairman <persRef ref="pratt-zadock">Zadok
								Pratt</persRef> promised me that they would report upon it; but they
							did not. At the house this day I obtained a copy of the House Journal
							27. Congress 2 Session. </p>

						<p>I attended public worship this morning alone at the second Presbyterian
							church, where <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knox</persRef> preached from Luke 10.42— “But one thing is needful.”
							He premised this discourse with a narrative of the circumstances under
							which these words were spoken— The peculiar relation of tender affection
							between Jesus and this whole family of <persRef ref="martha"
								>Martha</persRef>, <persRef ref="mary3">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef>— Then the incident which gave
							occasion to the remark, the extraordinary solicitude of Martha for the
							entertainment of her guests— Her call upon Jesus to bid her sister give
							some attention and assistance to the duties of hospitality, and the mild
							and gentle rebuke of Jesus to Martha for her excessive anxiety for mere
							worldly concerns with his approbation of Mary for adhering to the one
							thing needful, Religion. he proceeded with an earnest and affectionate
							exhortation to his hearers to apply to themselves that solemn injunction
							to every Christian, to devote himself and all his faculties to the one
							thing needful— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox read the whole of the
								10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Luke, which besides
							this account of the visit of Jesus to the house of Martha, contains also
							the question of the lawyer what he should do to inherit eternal life;
							and the answer of Jesus referring him to the Law—and asking how he reads
							the law? The lawyer replies Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all
							thy heart, and all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
							mind— The words, and with all thy strength, are here additional to the
							same saying as reported in Matthew 22.30. whether the illustration of
							the meaning of the term neighbour by the parable of the good Samaritan
							is not included— As I came out of the church I was accosted by <persRef
								ref="fillebrown-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fillebrown</persRef> who told me that <persRef
								ref="fillebrown-thomas2">his father</persRef> always a firm and good
							friend of mine died last week at the age of 81. He lived at Winthrop in
							the State of Maine.— This afternoon I attended with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary;adams-mary4">my
								family</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church
							where <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pyne</persRef> read the evening service for the third Sunday after
							Trinity, and preached from Matthew 7.20— [“]By their fruits ye shall
							know them.” He began by observing that the judgment of the world was apt
							to require too much of Christianity by making it responsible for the
							faults and errors of its votaries— After some preliminary remarks he
							divided the discussion of his subject into three parts 1. What the world
							may justly expect from professing Christians 2. What it does require of
							them and 3. The practice incumbent on them in the fulfilment of their
							duties. He confined himself now to the first and second points, leaving
							the third for hereafter I walked this evening to <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p>I received last Friday a Letter from <persRef ref="davis-george4">George
								R. Davis</persRef> of Troy, New-York, asking my opinion if there was
							any thing in the course of <persRef ref="seymour-david">David L.
								Seymour</persRef> on the question of reconsideration upon the
							reconsideration of the Eastern harbour Bill, after the veto—that evinced
							any want of good faith or calculated to defeat a constitution at two
							thirds vote to pass the bill— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour has
							been charged with this in a Troy newspaper, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Davis, his neighbour and friends wants testimony to refute
							the Slander. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis was lodging at
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gurley’s</persRef>
							on Pennsylvania avenue, and wrote me that he proposed to leave the City
							for home this day. I called last Evening at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gurley’s to see him but he was out. He came here this
							morning, and I told him that before answering his Letter, I wished to
							see the Article in the Troy Newspaper containing the charge against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour, but he had it not, and could
							state only the general purport of it. I told him that I could readily
							and cheerfully certify that I never for an instant entertained a
							suspicion of insincerity on the part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Seymour, when the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> by what I
							thought a shameful collusion, cut off all reconsideration of the Eastern
							harbour bill, by deciding that the main question upon the previous
							question moved by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour, applied to the
							passages of the bill, when not five minutes before Seymour had moved the
							previous question only upon an assurance from <persRef ref="boyd-linn"
								>Linn Boyd</persRef>, then in the Speaker’s chair that the main
							question would be on Seymour’s motion to postpone the reconsideration of
							the Bill from Tuesday to Thursday— This was a knave’s trick. I
							remonstrated against it in vain. If M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Seymour had resented it vehemently I believe he would have shamed the
							Speaker out of it and the bill might have passed by a two thirds vote—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David L. Seymour was embarrassed by
							his reluctance to break with his Southern democratic allies; and
							submitted to the iniquitous decision of the Speaker which smothered all
							reconsideration of the bill. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis in
							substance admitted all this, and will be satisfied with my testimony to
							my belief in the sincerity of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour— I
							was hard worked all this day in retrieving my arrears of diary run up in
							the last days of the Session— Towards Evening I walked to <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye’s</persRef>
							expecting to find <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary;adams-mary4">my

								<persRef ref="moody-theodore;hellen-adele">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Moody</persRef> with
								<persRef ref="moody-adelaide">their infant daughter</persRef>
							recently recovered from the scarlet fever— <persRef ref="hellen-walter2"
								>Walter Hellen</persRef> was also there. I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye for a statement of his accounts as my

						<p>On Sunday the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of September 1840 I passed
							the day at Cornwallis in Nova Scotia. In the morning I sallied forth in

							went with him to church— His name was <persRef ref="harris-james4"

						<p>This day set in the extreme heat of the summer—the trial of the climate
							to my Constitution. A burning Sun— The thermometers in my chamber at 90
							and a light breeze from the Southwest, a fan delicious to the face, but
							parching instead of cooling the skin— I have been a full month for a
							river bath without daring to take it— This morning at 5. I went in the
							Barouche to my old favourite spot—found the tide unusually high— All my
							station rocks occupied by young men, except one, and that surrounded by
							the tide, already upon the ebb.— I had some difficulty to undress and
							dress, but got my bath—swam about 5 minutes, and came out, washed and
							refreshed— It was my exercise for the day— After returning home I did
							not again pass the sill of the street door— I continued the process of
							packing up books and papers to send to Quincy— I found the blue chests
							N. 11. and 14 with their keys, and another, blue chest without key or
							number.— The chest furnished me by the Postmaster of the house holds not
							half the books and documents accumulated in the second and third Session
							of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress— On opening the blue
							chest N. 11. and the one unnumbered which had not been opened for
							several years, I found a mass of old Letters and secret documents of
							which I must if life and health be indulged me till the next Session of
							Congress make a thorough and systematic revisal— On a cursory glance at
								<persRef ref="humboldt-alexander">Humboldts</persRef> New Spain I
							find at Vol. 2. p. 229. Chapter 8. Section 10. Intendancy of San Luis
							Potosi, notice of the claim of the United States to Texas under the
							Louisiana Treaty; and the very distinct opinion of the author against
							it.— I find also two important facts to be hereafter noted— First, in
								<persRef ref="joutel-henri">Joutel’s</persRef> Narrative of <persRef
								ref="lasalle-robert">La Sale’s</persRef> last voyage—of his death by
							a musket ball fired by a man of his own company named <persRef
								ref="duhaut-pierre">Duhaut</persRef>, on the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1687. page 201— Secondly in
								<persRef ref="tonti-henri">Tonti’s</persRef> book published in
							1697.—p. 329 speaking of his own wanderings in the Country of the
							<unclear>Nanadiches</unclear>,—he says, “Nous quittames leur pays le 29 du Mois de Mai
							(1690) et nous avançames jusqu à une journée des Palaquessons. Ce sut là

							Sauvages, et que les autres avoient pris le parti de remonter vers les
							habitations Francoises.”— [“]C’est pour quoi n’aiant pas cru devoir les
							aller chercher ou ils n’etoient plus, je me resolus de revenir sur mes
							pas”— In the same book p. 192 is the account of La Sale’s first
							discovery on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1683 of the

						<p>The extreme heat of the weather reduces my condition to a state little
							above mere vegetation— I have had for a succession of years repeated
							invitations to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum at Frankford 6. miles
							North of Philadelphia; and have repeatedly promised at some time to
							comply with this request— I had concluded to go to Philadelphia next
							Wednesday—to devote the Evening to the Frankford Lyceum—return then to

								<persRef ref="richards-william2">Richards</persRef> and <persRef

							23. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1844. that on the 5<hi

								ref="miller-william5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							cent duties are to be levied upon Articles imported from England,
							without reciprocity; and by a third, the British Consul is authorised to
							appoint the jury for the trial of any British subject, charged with any
							crime— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richards was conscious that these
							Articles were scarcely compatible with the pretensions of a Government
							to absolute Sovereignty and Independence; and admitted our right to
							claim for citizens of the United States the benefit of all these
							Articles, as much as if they had been concluded with us— These
							Commissioners had not yet seen the <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary

						<p>The summer heat and its enervating spell continues— I walked this morning
							to my old bathing station upon the strand of the Potomac river and
							bathed and swam for about 10 minutes, and then walked home— From the
							practice of personal ablution and the exercise of swimming I cannot
							totally abstain, for I believe they have promoted my health and
							prolonged my life many years. And yet the experience of late years has
							compelled me gradually to disuse them— But my great anxiety now, is
							having much to do, and to be doing nothing.— I called at the Globe
							Office, and saw <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kane</persRef> the book-binder of that establishment— He has my file
							of Documents for the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Session of the
								27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress; they are not complete,
							and I requested him before binding them to send to <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								French</persRef> the sub-Clerk of the house, to have the missing
							papers supplied. I returned to the Globe office a remnant of the numbers
							of the Congressional Globe of 1842—found among my loose papers since I
							returned the rest— I called at the Patriotic Bank, and left my book
							there to be balanced. Then at the Office of the National Intelligencer,
							and saw <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef>— I took a paper of the 27<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> containing my Card to take leave of all invitations to
							public meetings.— It contains also a remarkable speech of <persRef
								ref="archer-william">W. S. Archer</persRef> in the Senate against
							the advice and consent to ratify the Treaty for the annexation of Texas
							to the United States. At the Office of the Clerk of the House, French
							was not there— I requested of the Clerk who was there a copy of the
							memorial of <persRef ref="tarr-a">A. de Kalb Tarr</persRef>, and 179
							citizens of Pennsylvania, praying for an alteration of the
							naturalization Laws, so as to require 21 years of residence by
							foreigners before admitting them to all the privileges of native
							Americans— This was the first memorial presented to the house on the
							subject— I moved its reference to the judiciary Committee but it was
							laid on the table by yeas and nays. 15 days after it was at my motion
							taken up from the table and referred to the Committee on the judiciary—
							The clerk promised me a copy for Monday next with the names of the
							signers. I shall see whether the Editors of the National Intelligencer
							will publish it— I declared in the house that I should not hold myself
							bound to support the demand in the house; but at the next Session on the
							native American party will be heard in both houses, and the proceedings
							of house on this first memorial, will have a material influence upon the
							debate. <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Cooler— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> down to 84. At the second Presbyterian Church,
								<persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knox</persRef> preached from Matthew 23.33. “How can ye escape the
							damnation of hell?”— He read the whole chapter of tremendous
							denunciation of Woe, eight times repeated against the Scribes and
							Pharisees, for their hypocrisy.— This discourse was held almost
							immediately before the arrest, trial, sentence and execution of the
							Messiah— It is in this chapter also that occurs the pathetic, and
							affecting prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem— There is no
							mention of pharisees in any book of the old Testament— Nor in the
							apocryphal books— But they are found in the New Testament as a
							profession, of half Priests, half Lawyers, invested with authority, for
							Jesus says they sit in <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> seat and
							with his bitterest reproaches upon them, he enjoins upon his disciples
							implicit obedience to their authority— The believed the resurrection,
							the existence of Angels and Demons, and the retributions of a future
							state— They veiled their vices therefore with hypocrisy, and made great
							show of rigid and austere virtue— He charges them with prevarication,
							cruelty, extortion and excess, all under the disguise of hypocrisy— And
							this was the class of man, of whom he demanded how can ye escape the
							damnation of hell? Is it a suitable enquiry to make of Christians in
							communion with the church? It is inconceivable to me, how men of decent
							character can suffer themselves to be treated from week to week like the
							vilest malefactors— It seems to me as if the preacher considered himself
							as a chaplain to a penitentiary, discoursing to the convicts.— After
							dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church <persRef
								ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read
							the evening service for the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday
							after Trinity and preached the remainder of his Sermon, begun last
							Sunday from Matthew 7.20. “By their fruits ye shall know them.”— The
							divisional part which he had left for consideration this day, was the
							third and last— The extent to which the world does hold the deportment
							of the Christian man, by which he appeared to understand the Christian
							minister responsible to them— He said they were often censured for not
							wearing an unalterably cheerful appearance and he assigned various
							reasons why the Christian man should were an appearance of gravity—
							Sometimes he said they were censured for the opposite property of
							hilarity unbecoming the Christian profession, which he considered
							equally unreasonable. The discourse was upon the whole a dissertation
							upon the injustice of the judgments of the world, and upon the duty of
							maintaining a spirit of independence against them; indicating a
							consciousness of the necessity of self-vindication. I answered this
							evening a Letter received last January, from a young man named <persRef
								ref="curtis-thomas2">Thomas W. T. Curtis</persRef>, enclosing, a
							mutilated copy of my Vision—in the hand-writing of <persRef
