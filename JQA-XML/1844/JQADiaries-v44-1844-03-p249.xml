						<p>Yesterday, immediately after the reading of the journal of the Senate was

								<persRef ref="rives-william">William C. Rives</persRef> a Senator
							from Virginia rose and after a very brief and appropriate notice of this
							awful dispensation of Providence, moved corresponding Resolutions to
							those which had been adopted by the house— They were passed by an

							arrangements for attendance at the funeral of the <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel;gilmer-thomas">two Secretaries</persRef>, appointed
							by the President pro Tempore of the Senate <persRef ref="mangum-willie"

								ref="king-william2">William R. King</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="woodbury-levi">Levi Woodbury</persRef>.—The two Committees went
							into the Vice President’s chamber—all present except M<hi

							hour it was agreed to leave to the discretion of the two Chairmen to
							concert the arrangements, with those made under the direction of the
							President, and to give notice in the newspapers; to the members of the
							two houses, of the order of the procession.— I went into the chamber of
							the military Committee of the Senate, where<space/><persRef
								ref="edwards-jonas">Edwards</persRef> took two Daguerrotype
							likenesses of me, and I walked home, where I spent the remainder of the

						<p>This morning I went to the Capitol; and at the <persRef
								ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerks</persRef> Office procured copies of the

							106. and on Wednesday upon <persRef ref="chapman-reuben"
								>Chapman’s</persRef> motion to lay the whole subject on the table
							first 85 to 90—and then by the change of 3 votes 88 to 87. The three
							votes were Duncan of Cincinnati <persRef ref="davis-john8">John W.
								Davis</persRef> of Indiana, and <persRef ref="yost-jacob">Jacob S.
								Yost</persRef> of Pennsylvania who changed on a promise from the
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> that the subject might
							be resumed by a vote of a mere majority—a promise which the Speaker will
							take care to break— I procured also copies of three recent documents of
							new regulations for the Navy and the Navy Department.—While at the house
							I heard of the death, of <persRef ref="frick-henry">Henry
								Frick</persRef> a member of the house from Pennsylvania— I met at
							the house several members, and among them, <persRef
								ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I had met yesterday at the Capitol <persRef ref="rives-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rives</persRef> the Chairman of the
							Senate’s Committee of arrangements for the funeral, who told me that the

							this morning at half past ten, and thence to proceed in a body to the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">Presidents</persRef> house where the
							corpses were deposited, and where in the East-room the religious
							services were to be performed— I went accordingly to the house this
							morning— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> were with me—
							A large portion of the members of both houses assembled and hack
							carriages were provided for them— I step’d into one of them with the
							Speaker <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hopkins</persRef> and <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef> my colleague members
							of the House Committee of Arrangements— But before we had got out of the
							Capitol Yard the Speaker discovered that the hack was crazy, and the
							horses restive, and he insisted on changing his carriage— We all
							alighted, my Carriage was close at hand in the procession— It was
							beginning to rain, and he took a seat with me— I could not make the same
							offer to the other two gentlemen but they were immediately supplied with
							a new carriage.— At the Presidents house the Speaker parted from me to
							resume his place at the head of the house; a special place having been
							assigned in the procession, immediately after the President and <persRef
								ref="spencer-john;wilkins-william;wickliffe-charles">his
								cabinet</persRef> to the Ex Presidents of the United States—of whom
							I was the only one present— There were four corpses in plain

								officers</persRef>, with the union flag stretched over them and
								<persRef ref="gardiner-david">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Gardiner’s</persRef> covered with a black pall. The East room was
							crowded with the President, his Cabinet; and <persRef
								ref="tyler-john3;tyler-robert">sons</persRef> and women of his
							family— The two houses of Congress foreign Ministers, the <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Mayors of Washington</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cox-john">Georgetown</persRef> and <persRef ref="eaches-joseph"
								>Alexandria</persRef>—municipal officers and of the Departments Army

									>r</hi> Butler</persRef> delivered a short discourse after which
							the long funeral blackened all the way from the East-room to the
							Congressional burying ground near the Eastern branch of the Potowmac. My
							young men left me and I went in the procession alone, in my carriage— At
							the common depository vault I heard the remainder of the Episcopal
							funeral service recited, and then came home alone— It was four in the
							afternoon, and I mused.</p>

						<p>After I returned home last evening I received visits from <persRef
								ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas H.
								Perkins</persRef> of Boston and <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"
								>Robert C. Winthrop</persRef>—<persRef ref="dana-richard2">Richard
								Dana jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thom-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thom</persRef>—
							There was a notice in the National Intelligencer yesterday, that
								<persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> the chaplain of the Senate would preach this
							morning, and turn to religious improvement the recent calamity. I
							attended at the Hall of the House of Representatives a few minutes
							belated during which a brief narrative of the melancholy occurrence had
							been read— They were singing when I reached the hall, which held a
							crowded auditory; among which there were certainly not twenty members of
							Congress— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin’s text was from
							Revelation 20.11. [“]And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on
							it—from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was
							found no place for them. 12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
							before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened,
							which is the book of life: and the dead were judged, out of those things
							which were written in the books, according to their works. 13. And the
							sea gave up the dead which were in it: and death and hell delivered up
							the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to
							their works.”— The throne of God—The Sea—Death—Hell—Books of Account and
							a book of life— Judgment for eternity according to their works—are the
							leading ideas of this magnificent but incongruous imagery.— The day of
							judgment—a theme always appropriate to the discourse of a christian
							teacher and perhaps peculiarly appropriate to a case of sudden,
							instantaneous unexpected violent death, in the midst of festivity and
							enjoyment, and falling at once <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi> upon
							several person in the extremes of human society— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tustin’s discourse was impressive and edifying, but hardly
							adequate to the occasion— The most remarkable thing in it was a
							statement that a watch in the pocket of one of the sufferers was found
							unbroken, with the hands on its face stop’d at 16 1/4 minutes past
							4—indicating to a second the time of the explosion. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin gave notice that his Colleague
								<persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tinsley</persRef> the Chaplain of the house would deliver an
							occasional discourse on this afflictive dispensation of Providence next
							Sunday.— After the service was over I called at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Whitwells</persRef> and saw Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Perkins, and <persRef
								ref="grinnell-joseph;grinnell-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grinnell</persRef>— I walked
							home and after dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church
							hear the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frapley</persRef> of Philadelphia read
							the Evening service for the second Sunday in lent, and preach from Amos
							4.12—“Prepare to meet thy God”— A discourse of deep solemnity, and which
							it behooved me perhaps more than any other person present, to lay to
							heart— An awful admonition— May it not be wholly lost upon me. <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. D.

						<p><persRef ref="u">Madame Quesada</persRef> is the Sister of the Mexican
							Minister <persRef ref="almonte-juan">General Almonte</persRef>, and the

							visit this morning in company with <persRef ref="child-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Child</persRef>. She is of mixed
							blood, Hispano-Mexican, almost white— Child told me she had desired him
							to say to me, that she intended this visit personally to me, for there
							were two objects in this country which she had desired to see—The falls
							of Niagara, and John Quincy Adams.— She speaks very little french, and
							is beginning to learn English. <persRef ref="stockton-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stockton</persRef> conversed freely
							with her in Spanish— I called at the Department of State, and read to
								<persRef ref="nelson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Nelson</persRef> of Maryland the present Attorney General, and
							acting Secretary of State, the Letter from <persRef ref="palfrey-john"
								>John G Palfrey</persRef> Secretary of the Commonwealth of
							Massachusetts, which I had already read to the late <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">Secretary Upshur</persRef>, who had promised to
							communicate with the new Minister from England <persRef
								ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pakenham</persRef> concerning it— At M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Nelson<unclear>’s</unclear> request I left M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Palfrey’s
							Letter with him and he promised to write a note this day to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham upon the subject— I mentioned
							also to him the Resolution of the house, moved by me, concerning the
							errors in the printed census, and told him that since that Resolution
							was adopted I had received a petition from the territory of Ioway
							complaining that there was in the printed census a return of Slaves
							there. I had examined the census and found there was in it such a
							return, and a like on in the territory of Wiskonsin— I wished the Report
							from the Department on the Resolution of the house should refer to these
							errors as well as to those stultifying the free coloured population— He
							asked me to write him a note pointing out these errors, and said he
							would cause an investigation to be made how they had originated.— At the
							house: immediately after the reading of the Journal, <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> announced the
							decease of <persRef ref="frick-henry">Henry Frick</persRef>, late member
							from the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> district of Pennsylvania, who
							died last Friday morning, and whose remains were taken away the next day
							by <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, to be buried at his home— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll delivered a brief and very
							elegant obituary notice of his deceased colleague and moved the usual
							mortuary resolutions excepting those of attendance on the funeral and
							the house adjourned— After remaining two hours at the house I walked
							home and read <persRef ref="walker-robert">Walker</persRef> the
							Senator’s pamphlet urging the reannexation of Texas to the United
							States— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> was here this Evening— He has received an overture
							for the purchase of the Columbian Mills— I told him my terms, but
							without expectation of any successful conclusion.</p>

						<p>At the house, immediately after the reading of the Journal, I moved to
							take up from the table <persRef ref="reding-john">Reding’s</persRef>
							motion to reconsider the vote by which the whole subject of the Report
							on the Rules was laid on the table last Friday— The motion to reconsider
							was itself laid on the table, on the motion of <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef>. Before <persRef ref="yost-jacob"
								>Yost</persRef> changed his vote from no to ay, which changed the
							decision and laid the whole subject on the table, he enquired whether
							the subject could be resumed without a vote of two thirds— The <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> promised him that it could by
							giving one day’s notice— The rules of the house he said were thus always
							under the controul of a majority of the house— I then noticed in this
							Diary that the Speaker would take care to break this promise— I gave
							notice that I should move to dispense with the rule requiring a majority
							of two thirds to take up the report— The Speaker would not suffer my
							notice to be entered on the journal— And this morning when I moved to
							take up the motion for reconsideration which had been laid on the table
							last Friday, he said it could be done only by a vote of two thirds— I
							claimed that a motion for reconsideration being privileged could not
							lose its privilege by being laid on the table; he decided that it did— I
							said it was to be presumed the Speaker of the house was a man of his
							word—and reminded him of his promise to Yost— He said he had told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Yost that the rules of the house might be
							changed by giving notice, <hi rend="italic">when</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">it</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">would</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">be</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">in</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">order</hi>, of one day— I said he used these
							underscored words now, but had not used them then— He said he had used
							them then—which was not true— I asked when such notice would be in
							order. He said on the day for offering resolutions— But this is of no
							avail. The notice will be objected to, and lie over nominally for one
							day; but then cannot be taken up in its order, the time for which never
							will come.— The Committees were called for Reports— <persRef
								ref="elmer-lucius">Elmer</persRef> from the Committee of elections
							obtained leave for them to continue the employment of a Clerk till they
							got through the contested case of Jones and <persRef ref="botts-john"
								>Botts</persRef>— The Bill from the Senate for repairing the
							Pennsylvania Avenue was laid on the table by yeas and nays 118 to 64.— A
							message was received from the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef>, with the correspondence called for by the
							Resolution offered by <persRef ref="yulee-david">Levi</persRef> the
							Delegate from Florida, between the U.S. Marshal and the Government of
							New Providence, upon their refusal to deliver up certain fugitive
							negroes charged with murder.— Levi moved, its reference to the Committee
							of foreign Affairs with instructions which was carried and he made a
							rabid hour speech. His motion and instructions were carried by the
							previous question—no debate allowed— But the motion to print the <hi
								rend="strikethrough">motion</hi> to print the message was debatable
							and <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> made a stinging
							speech. <persRef ref="pettit-john">Pettit</persRef> opposed the
							printing, and I answered him. The printing was ordered— <persRef

							bill.— At the house— A report by <persRef ref="mcdowell-joseph">Joseph
								J. M’Dowell</persRef> of Ohio, from the Committee of Accounts
							remodeling the system of the folding room, and the discipline and wages
							of the pages; which yesterday after some debate had been laid on the

								<persRef ref="parmenter-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parmenter</persRef> from the Committee of Naval Affairs reported a

							Resolves, but <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of
							Cincinnati had the floor for a speech on a bill introduced by him, for
							holding elections for members of Congress, and electors of President and
							Vice President— He spoke one hour on this bill, and then <persRef

							Committee of Elections moved as an amendment to Duncan’s bill, another
							as a substitute for it upon which he said just enough to give Duncan,
							another hour to finish his speech— It was a glaring and preconcerted
							evasion of the hour rule—strong objection was made to his occupying the
							second hour, but <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> who
							occupied the chair as speaker decided the question in his favour— His

								<persRef ref="pendleton-nathanael">Pendleton</persRef> carried the
							election for Congress against him. He would not vouch for it, but it was

								Hobart</persRef> is the son of <persRef ref="hobart-benjamin2"
								>Benjamin Hobart</persRef> of Abington, and delivered to me
							yesterday at the house a Letter of introduction from his father— He

							at ten this morning to the <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Postmaster
								general</persRef>, which I did— He produced his Letters and a map of

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wickliffe promised him an answer this
							evening I went with him thence to the Patent Office, and passed
							cursorily round the long hall, the museum of the National Institute— I
							was agreeably surprised at the elegant and tasteful scientific
							arrangement of all the objects of curiosity collected not only in
								<persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Lieutenant Wilkes’s</persRef>
							exploring expedition, but from a multitude of other sources; all which
							has been effected since the meetings of the Institute in that hall the

							in Session. At the house— <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef>
							offered a call on the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">clerk</persRef> to

							Rhode-Island Memorial for leave to send for persons and papers.—

						<p>I called this morning at the Patriotic Bank, where I deposited the check
							last received from <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Frye</persRef> to me as Executor of <persRef

								Causin</persRef> to discharge the select Committee on the memorial
							of the 23 members of the Rhode-Island Legislature, from the further
							consideration of the subject— It seems to me that Cranston and <persRef
								ref="potter-elisha2">Potter</persRef> should have arrested this
							movement at the threshold by protesting at once against all action of
							the house upon it— They were taken by surprize when the first movement
							was made by <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef>; and have not
							met it with suitable firmness or sagacity—when Cranston closed to day he
							was followed by <persRef ref="rathbun-george">George Rathbun</persRef>
							of New-York a member of the select Committee and a venomous <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Burenite</persRef> who spoke to the

								ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef>, chairman of the Committee of
							claims moved that the Committees should be called for such Reports as
							would not give rise to debate, and sundry Reports were accordingly
							made—among them <persRef ref="mckay-james">James I. M’Kay</persRef>
							chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a bill to modify
							and amend the Tariff act of 30. August 1842 M’Kay said he would
							to-morrow or next Monday at the latest present the report of the
							majority of the Committee with certain tabular statements which were not
							yet quite ready— <persRef ref="marsh-george">George P. Marsh</persRef>
							from the Committee of Naval Affairs, reported a joint Resolution of

							American Steam frigate Missouri, and in preserving the lives of her
							Officers and crew, as well as for the kindness and hospitality which
							characterised their treatment of the ship’s company of that vessel after
							her unfortunate destruction by fire— This Resolution was read three

								>Hale</persRef> of New Hampshire did say he would debate it, but
							upon a single word from <persRef ref="parmenter-william"
								>Parmenter</persRef> withdrew his objection— I combined the slave

								>Captain Tyler</persRef> and his late Secretaries <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">Upshur</persRef> and <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"

							for whose destruction these Engines were intended, for endeavouring to

							for sham<unclear>e.</unclear> Private bills till past 4, and adjourned.</p>

						<p>I took to the pension office, and left with <persRef ref="edwards-james"
								>James L. Edwards</persRef>, two papers relating to the claim of
								<persRef ref="fairbanks-bulah">Bulah Fairbanks</persRef> for a

								>Commodore Warrington</persRef> the acting Secretary a Letter from
								<persRef ref="washburn-john">John M Washburn</persRef> of South
							Boston, which I had received this morning, praying for the discharge of
							his brother <persRef ref="washburn-thomas">Thomas S. Washburn</persRef>,
							a musician on board of the U.S. line of Battle ship Ohio, in Boston

							made out and forwarded this day— At the house, <persRef
								ref="rathbun-george">George Rathbun</persRef> of Auburn 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of New-York
							finished his hour speech on the Rhode-Island— Wormwood and gall in
							answer to <persRef ref="cranston-henry">Cranston</persRef>, but without
							touching upon the sharp points involved in the case— I intend if I can
							get the floor to make an hour speech on this question, taking for my
							text nullum numen adest ni sit Prudentia— May I be true to my theme! and
							may its issue be useful! on this and kindred subjects my heart is too
							full for my head—and my faculties are in decay.— Cranston indiscreetly
							denied the right of a majority of the People to change their form of
							Government at pleasure— Rathbun seized upon this denial, and raved about
							the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence.— Cranston
							had spoken with great exasperation about <persRef ref="dorr-thomas"
								>Dorr</persRef> and his partizans, and the memorialists, with
							admissions concerning their characters marked more with candour than
							with controversial address.— Rathbun seized with the ravin of a shark
							every concession, and turned it to his own purpose, making none in
							return— When he finished <persRef ref="potter-elisha2">Elisha R
								Potter</persRef> took the floor, and as the morning hour was about
							expiring, only read one section of a law of Virginia against popular
							movements to overthrow the existing government, and moved to postpone
							the subject till next Tuesday which was done. <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
							presented his tariff report, with the tabular statements— <persRef
								ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> moved to print 25000

								>Speaker</persRef> said that motion was not now in order. <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> a member of the
							Committee said he should present a minority report and claimed that an
							equal number of that should be printed with the other— Question not
							taken. The private Calendar was then taken up, and sundry Bills were
							passed till they came to a Bill for the relief of <persRef
								ref="ellery-william3">William Ellery</persRef>, a fishing bounty
							claim contested by <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>;
							and laid on the table by yeas and nays 72. to 69— <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> moved a reconsideration which
							stands over— At <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole’s</persRef>

							departed to represent the trying condition of that church, and to

								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie’s</persRef>
							church, at which Resolutions in their favour were adopted, and

								Septimus Tuston</persRef>, Chaplain to the Senate— There was also an
							arrangement made for the preaching of the three Scottish divines at
							various places this day, and particularly that D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Cunningham the associate and friend of the renowned
								<persRef ref="chalmers-thomas">Doctor Chalmers</persRef>, would
							preach this morning in the Hall of the house of representatives— This

							last Sunday, of a discourse this day on the Calamity of the ship
							Princeton, by the House chaplain <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley</persRef>. At ten minutes past

							apologizing for the non-appearance of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cunningham, he knew not from what cause, and announcing that he himself
							should perform the service of the morning. The hall was so crowded in
							the expectation of hearing D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham,
							that I was unable to find a seat till <persRef ref="follansbee-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Follansbee</persRef> the late
							door keeper of the house gave me the one he occupied at the extremity of
							the outer row of the seats of members of the house— It was so distant
							from the clerk’s table that I could hear scarcely a sentence of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston’s discourse; though it was upwards
							of an hour long. He did not distinctly announce his text but read the
							whole eighth chapter of Matthew and in his exposition dwelt with much
							repetition upon the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse—“Lord, save
							us, we perish”— I walked home and before dinner received visits from
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="worth-william">General Worth</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mckeever-isaac">Captain M’Keever</persRef> of the Navy. After
							dinner at the second Presbyterian Church I was belated, and found Doctor
							Robert Burns, preaching from Romans 14.17. [“]For the kingdom of God is
							not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy
							ghost.” Neither the person nor the voice of Doctor Burns are
							prepossessing in his favour, but his discourse was eloquent, methodical,
							tolerant, practical—full of the spirit of the chapter from which he took
							his text. Meat and drink were essentials of the <persRef ref="moses"
								>Mosaic</persRef> Law— They were tacitly discarded from the
							Christian dispensation; and <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> preaching
							to Jews and Gentiles, exhorts them to mutual toleration, to
							righteousness, peace and joy in the holy ghost— This doctrine is more
							acceptable to me, than doubtful disputations about the atonement. After
							the Sermon, <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knox</persRef>, introduced D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burns to

						<p>From this time forward, the house will meet every morning at 11— I wrote
							this morning a Letter to the <persRef ref="brown-obadiah">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Obadiah B. Brown</persRef>, who sent
							me word that he would call upon me— As this was the semi-monthly day of
							calling for Resolutions, I prepared one for a call upon the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, for information whether he has
							instituted or engaged in a negotiation for the annexation of Texas to
							the United States. Just as I was going out to the house, <persRef
								ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pakenham</persRef> called on me to pay a morning visit— I could stay
							only a few minutes, in which I assured him of my deep anxiety for the
							preservation of Peace and Harmony between this Country and
							Great-Britain— He said he was assured of that from sentiments that I had
							expressed in the house— He said he had rented <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster’s</persRef> house, and expected to go into it next week. At
							the house, <persRef ref="cranston-henry">Cranston</persRef> made a
							personal explanation referring to an Article in the globe asserting that
								<persRef ref="rathbun-george">Rathbun</persRef>, had made him take
							back almost every thing that he had said— Cranston denied that he had
							taken back any of his assertions— Rathbun controverted some of his
							explanatory remarks; and <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef>
							questioned him still more—but they did not reply.— There was some
							bickering about the proceedings of the judiciary committee, relating to
							a bill for charging the time and place of holding the U.S. Circuit and
							District Courts in the State of Ohio— <persRef ref="brown-aaron">A. V.
								Brown</persRef> from the Committee on the territories reported a new
							Oregon territory Bill, extending the Iowa territory to the pacific
							Ocean. Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							and ordered to be printed— The <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef> commenced the call for Resolutions at
							South-Carolina, and moved South and West, as far as Ohio— A multitude of
							Resolutions were offered, and among them two by <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, who had given notice of
							them unnoticed in connivance with the Speaker on Saturday— They restored
							the rules rescinded at the commencement of the Session, by which a bare
							majority of the house, can go into Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union, and come out of it, at pleasure.— They were both adopted
							by yeas and nays this day. An attempt was made to fix a day for taking
							up the new tariff bill, and adhering to it from day to day till finally
							disposed of.— The motion to lay this on the table was lost by a close
							vote, and the motion for the previous question by a still closer one;
							and it failed. An old notice of <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Giddings</persRef> to modify the gag-rule was smothered on a point
							of order— Adjourned at half past 3— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

							the whole on the State of the Union— I enquired if there was a report
							with the bill, and Parmenter brought me a short report accompanying
							another bill which he had before reported to regulate the civil
							department of the Navy yards— He moved to print 2500 copies of that
							report, which was carried.— <persRef ref="kennedy-andrew">Andrew

							the house— This debate consists on the part of <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> who brought it forward and his
							compeers of indefinite general invective against the whigs— When he
							closed I addressed the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef>, but

							of Indiana, at whose motion the subject was postponed till to-morrow—

								ref="morse-freeman">Freeman H. Morse</persRef> of Maine— The late

							having been supplied— His appointment as Secretary of the Navy; his
							presentation of his report to the house, and his resignation as a member
							of the house, were all cotemporaneous with the last meeting of the
							Committee— His instantaneous and violent death by the bursting of the
							great Gun of the Princeton, may point a moral, but will not heal the
							wound inflicted upon Freedom and the rights of human nature by his life—
							At this meeting Joseph R. Ingersoll, read his report on the
							Massachusetts Resolves— It is an elaborate eloquent verbose and
							sophistical counter argument to mine, which he has had in his hands all
							the time that he has been preparing it. He was two hours in reading it—
							Garret Davis said that he should also sign it. Edmund Burke said his
							report was ready, but that he did not wish to read it in Committee. Burt
							was impatient for the immediate report to the house, but Sample said he
							wished to prepare a report also; and it was known that Morse intended
							the same thing.— I objected to presenting the final report to the house
							until all the separate reports shall have been submitted to the
							Committee; and we adjourned to meet again Saturday morning at 9 O’Clock—
							I found the house already in Session, and <persRef ref="french-benjamin"

								>Hopkins</persRef> said it would cost the Nation 20 or 25 dollars

							floor, and the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> gave it for

						<p>A young man by the name of <persRef ref="thayer-john">Thayer</persRef>

								<persRef ref="rantoul-robert">Robert Rantoul</persRef> the Collector
							of the Customs at Boston, for whose appointment <persRef

							yesterday rejected by the Senate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer

							of Worcester— That he was married and <persRef ref="thayer-mary">his

							might be one of Henshaw’s protégés, in danger of dismissal in
							consequence of the removal of his patron— This morning I drew a check on
							the Bank of the Metropolis for 100 dollars, for the current house hold
							expenses, and found by the number of my check, with my bank book, that I
							had drawn one and omitted to enter it in my book. Calling at the Bank
							and asking to see my checks I discovered one of the 20<hi

								<persRef ref="hellen-adelaide">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

						<p>On my way to the Capitol this morning, I stop’d at <persRef

								ref="ingersoll-joseph;giddings-joshua;davis-garrett;burke-edmund4;sample-samuel;burt-armistead"
								>select Committee</persRef> on the Resolves of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts, met in the chamber of the Committee of Manufacturers—
							Edmund Burke after repeatedly saying that he had no desire to read his
							report, did read it and occupied little short of two hours— It is an
							epitome of New Hampshire democracy, mangled up with South-Carolina
							Slavery, a bitter infusion of partizan malignity, and the oozings out of
							personal venom against me. Burt immediately moved that the Resolution
							closing Ingersolls report, that the Committee be discharged from the
							further consideration of the subject, be reported to the house this
							day—but Sample wanted further time to prepare his report and <persRef
								ref="morse-freeman">Morse</persRef> confined to his lodgings by
							indisposition wished also for time to prepare his— I objected to
							reporting to the house that the Committee be discharged, till all the
							separate reports shall have been read in Committee— Ingersoll in full
							concert with Burt was earnest for reporting this day, but Davis more
							liberal was willing to allow a few days for Sample and Morse to prepare
							their reports— After some discussion Ingersoll moved that the report
							asking to be discharged should be made to the house next Saturday, which
							was carried though whimsically enough Burt, Giddings and myself voted
							against it.— The Committee adjourned to Saturday next 9. O’Clock—
							Ingersoll certainly under the spur of Burt, now for the first time
							objected to my minutes introductory to the journal of the Committee
							which commences at the second meeting on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January— I said that my preliminary matter was only for
							my own use to complete the journal of the Committee and I did not wish
							them to be made part of the Journal, if there was any objection to them—
							At the house—private bills—debate on the cost of engraving— New
							Committee to superintend engraving of maps— I moved a suspension of the
							rules for a Resolution calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> for information respecting his interference in
							the Rhode-Island conflicts— Yeas and nays 70 to 62 lost, for lack of a
							two thirds vote— Adjourned soon after 3. O’Clock— In the evening I had a

						<p>The <persRef ref="lewis-george">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> George
								Lewis</persRef> one of the delegates from the free church of
							Scotland, preached this morning in the Hall of the house of
							Representatives; from John 18.37. [“]<persRef ref="pontiuspilate"
								>Pilate</persRef> therefore said unto him art thou a king then?
							Jesus answered, thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born,
							and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness
							unto the truth— Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice” The
							last clause of the verse he omitted— And by what induction of reasoning
							this text could be brought to bear upon the controversy which now
							convulses the free church of Scotland, is beyond my comprehension. The
							preacher divided his discourse into three parts—maintaining that Jesus
							Christ was to be considered in three different capacities as prophet,
							priest, and king; and that if Pilate had asked him art thou a prophet or
							art thou a priest? he would have given the same answer—to this end was I
							born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear
							witness unto the truth— Now that all this should have some affinity to
							the doctrine of the atonement which the Reverend Orator assured his
							hearers was now the true orthodox creed of the free church of Scotland
							did not so much surprize me, as the transition from these articles of
							faith, to the question whether the ministers of the church of Scotland,
							shall continue to be appointed as they have been heretofore appointed by
							noble patrons or elected by the people of their parishes, and he said
							that 500 ministers of the church of Scotland had agreed to renounce
							their pecuniary compensation, to an amount of half a million dollars,
							rather than submit any longer to be appointed by Patrons— And he said it
							was a matter of as deep interest to us as it was to them— He said
							something of <persRef ref="pusey-edward">Puseyism</persRef> and
							something of Romanism; but the upshot of it all, as I believe is
							democracy— The popular principle creeping in to the religious creed of
							the atonement. After dinner at the second presbyterian church, I heard
							the <persRef ref="cheever-benjamin">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Benjamin H. Cheever</persRef>, of the methodist episcopal conference
							now sitting in this city, preach from 1. John 3.2. [“]Beloved, now are
							we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we
							know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see
							him as he is.” inexplicable mysticism.— The preacher commented
							ingeniously upon the link of argument that in the future world the
							faithful believer shall be like Christ: because he shall see him as he
							is. <persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<dateline>Washington Wednesday 20. March 1844—</dateline>
						<p><date>20. VI:30. </date>Wednesday.</p>
						<p>Our friends <persRef ref="stockton-francis">Francis B.
							Stockton</persRef>, a purser in the Navy, and <persRef
								ref="mcknight-anna">his wife</persRef>, once Miss Ann M’Knight and
							afterwards M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Twiggs, who have been on a
							pleasant visit to us of three weeks, left us this morning to return to
							Philadelphia. The debate at the house on the bill to remove the United
							States Circuit and District Courts in the State of Ohio from Cincinnati
							to Columbus, was renewed on the motion of <persRef ref="hale-john">John
								P. Hale</persRef> of Dover, New-Hampshire, to reconsider the vote by
							which the bill was yesterday past— The report of <persRef
								ref="saunders-romulus">Saunders</persRef> yesterday from the
							judiciary Committee had been against the passage of the bill so that he
							readily assented to the reconsideration which sent the bill back to the
							question upon its passage— The delegation from the State were divided
							rather by a lure of local interests than of politics. <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> two of the bitterest democrats in
							the house, were at sharp points between Cincinnati and Columbus— A
							further reconsideration of the vote by which the bill had been engrossed
							was necessary to place it in an amendable condition that is at the
							second reading—this was done, and Saunders offered an amendment, and
							then the bill passed again the second and third reading, whereupon
								<persRef ref="simons-samuel">Samuel Simons</persRef> of Bridgeport
							Connecticut moved another reconsideration—which the <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> decided to be inadmissible; a
							second motion for reconsideration, after one has been carried, not being
							in order— Duncan appealed from the decision, saying that after the
							adoption of an amendment it was no longer the same vote— The speaker
							stubbornly persisting in his decision, got into a sharp altercation with
								<persRef ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> the Speaker of the
							last house, in which he came off second best, so that when it came to
							the issue by yeas and nays the vote was a tie 73 to 73. and his decision
							was sustained only by his own vote— The Rhode-Island Memorial then came
							up, and <persRef ref="stetson-lemuel">Lemuel Stetson</persRef> wasted an
							hour, in a laboured and very dull defence of the changeable opinions of
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef> upon the
							extension of the right of suffrage— When he closed, I again addressed
							the chair and said I wished to say a few words, but the Speaker said he
							had assigned the floor to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Simonds.
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> in the Chair— The
							discussion upon the fortification bill was closed and it was laid aside,
							and at the motion of <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef>
							chairman of the Committee of Military Affairs, the bill from the Senate
							to remount the old second Regiment of Dragoons was taken up— <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> very faintly opposed it— Hale
							moved an amendment which he knew was not in order, to disband the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Regiment of Infantry— I moved to disband
							the rifle regiment itself: and spoke about half an hour.</p>

						<p><date>21. VI. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>I made about half my speech yesterday in Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— My
							time last Evening and this morning was absorbed in looking up the
							journals and proceedings of the second Session of the last Congress upon
							the reduction of the army, and the dismounting of the second regiment of
							dragoons, and turning it into a rifle regiment— At the house after some
							miscellaneous business, part of which was a memorial presented by
								<persRef ref="summers-george">George W. Summers</persRef> from the
							Colonization Society of the District of Columbia, praying for aid from
							Congress, the Rhode-Island Memorial was taken up. <persRef
								ref="simons-samuel">Samuel Simonds</persRef> of Bridgport
							Connecticut had the floor, upon <persRef ref="causin-john"
								>Causin’s</persRef> motion to discharge the select Committee from
							the further consideration of the memorial. Simonds moved the previous
							question, whereupon <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> asked
							leave to modify his motion for leave to send for persons and papers so
							as to limit the call to two persons in Rhode-Island with papers— The
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> pronounced this
							modification not in order, under the previous question— The main
							question was first on Causin’s motion to discharge the Committee which
							was lost by yeas and nays 70 to 86— Then on the resolution of leave to
							send for persons and papers, which <persRef ref="elmer-lucius"
								>Elmer</persRef> moved to lay on the table—lost 72 to 84. and the
							resolution was then carried. 78 to 71.— I had repeatedly requested to be
							heard, and <persRef ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef> had
							appealed to the generosity of the house to indulge me, but <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> said it could not be
							done— <persRef ref="hardin-john">John J. Hardin</persRef> of Illinois,
							voted with the majority for the privilege of moving a reconsideration
							which he did, and thereby tricked out an hour speech which he devoted
							exclusively to a reply to <persRef ref="stetson-lemuel"
								>Stetson’s</persRef> vindication of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Martin Van Buren</persRef>— He closed by moving the previous
							question on his motion to reconsider; which he did, to withdraw it upon
							my rising to follow him; but before he closed a motion was made to lay
							on the table his motion to reconsider— <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> moved a call of the house, which consumed a full
							hour, and produced only 171 members, when further proceedings were
							suspended, when Burke’s motion to lay on the table, the motion to
							reconsider was carried 89 to 77. I asked Burke to move now his promised
							call on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for
							information and documents concerning the Rhode Island quarrel; but he
							said he would move the call, when it should be in order. I have thus
							been by concerted action of the Speaker excluded from speaking on this
							subject—</p>

						<p>A remarkable circumstance of the present times is the habitual absence of
							more than 50 members of the house about 30 of them in the city always
							ready to answer a party summons but seldom seen at any other time, in
							the house— They are paid as if they attended 12 hours a day— Full half
							the time there is no Quorum in the house— After the passage of the
							Resolution allowing the Committee on the Rhode-Island Memorial to send
							for persons and papers, the House went into Committee of the whole on
							the state of the Union, and took up the bill to repeal the provision of
							the act of August 1842, which converted the second regiment of dragoons
							into a rifle regiment— I completed my hour speech, and was just entering
							upon the most interesting point of it, when <persRef ref="johnson-cave"
								>Cave Johnson</persRef>, the Chairman’s hammer came down like the
							Razor of the guillotine— <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop</persRef>, had invited me to
							meet at their lodgings the whig members of the Massachusetts delegation,
							to have some consultation together, upon some of the measures under
							consideration of the house— I went accordingly at 7 in the evening, and

							fellow boarders at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

									>r</hi> Abbot</persRef> is a member of the select Committee on

								Markoe</persRef> of the Department of State, the main pillar of the
							National Institute had sent me last week the Memorial of that body to
							Congress which I had agreed to present to the house of Representatives,
							and which <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Levi Woodbury</persRef> presented
							yesterday to the Senate. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Markoe had
							requested an interview with me, and I had promised to call on him but
							was prevented from performing my promise by visitors upon business or
							curiosity at the only time when I could have performed it— On going to
							the house this morning, I met M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Markoe, at
							the door of the Hall, where he was watching to meet me, and he asked <pb
								n="271" type="ms"/>a short conference with me; for which purpose we
							retired into the chamber of the committee of manufactures: he had with
							him a mass of manuscript documents forming a folio volume as thick as a
							Corpus Juris, to be communicated to the house with the memorial, and
							which he wishes to have printed with it— I promised to present the
							memorial on the first day when it will be in order— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Markoe urged me with great importunity to
							take active part at the anniversary meeting of the Institute to be held
							next Month; especially by delivering an address, though it should be
							only of a few minutes; but I gave him no encouragement to expect it. I
							said however that I would do all in my power to promote the objects of
							the Institute— I found the house in Session—there had been a motion for
							a call of the house to obtain a quorum; but in the progress of the
							motion for the call a quorum having appeared the call was refused by
							yeas and nays 66 to 75— The yeas and nays were also taken upon <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller’s</persRef> motion to print 15000 extra
							copies of the sub-treasury bill report from the Committee of Ways and
							Means. 108 to 51. And upon a motion of <persRef ref="davis-garrett"
								>Garret Davis</persRef> to suspend the rules for him to introduce a
							new rule requiring the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk</persRef> to
							call over the roll every morning, and record the members present and the
							absentees 85 to 86. <persRef ref="brown-milton">Milton Brown</persRef>
							moved a suspension for a call on the <persRef ref="spencer-john"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for a return of losses by
							Banks—74 to 94— The <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> called
							for reports from select Committees, and <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> presented a Report from the select Committee
							appointed on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> on the counter
							resolutions of the Legislatures of Virginia and Alabama, to the Resolves
							of the Legislature of Massachusetts of<space/>March 1843— The Committee
							consisted of Dromgoole, <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> of
							South-Carolina <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Boyd</persRef> of Kentucky,
								<persRef ref="abbott-amos"><hi rend="italic">Amos</hi>

									>Brengle</persRef></hi> of Maryland, <persRef
								ref="roberts-robert">Roberts</persRef> of Mississippi and <persRef
								ref="clinch-duncan">Clinch</persRef> of Georgia. The report was
							short and closed with two Resolutions—one that the compromises of the
							Constitution ought to be held sacred, and the other that no proposition
							of amendment of the Constitution with regard to representation and
							direct taxation ought to be recommended by Congress, but that every such
							proposition ought to be promptly and decisively condemned. He moved the
							previous question on the resolutions.— I asked him to withdraw his
							motion, to allow me to move the reference of the report and resolutions
							to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—for
							discussion—he refused— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef>
							moved a call of the house—refused. Abbott said he had never been
							notified of any meeting of the select Committee or of the report—
							Dromgoole said he had sent a messenger boy to notify all the members of
							the Committee— That all the members <pb n="272" type="ms"/>members had
							attended except M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott who was sick, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Strong and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><space/>Brengle who had both gone home— And the report was
							unanimous— The previous question was carried—by yeas and nays 118 to 51—
								<persRef ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef> moved to lay
							the report and resolutions on the table— Winthrop moved as an amendment
							until the question is decided whether the annexation of Texas be
							considered as the settled policy of this Government—which the Speaker
							decided was not in order— The motion to lay on the table was lost 48 to
							132—and a question being taken on each resolution, the first was carried
							128 to 18—and the second 127 to 41.— These votes in immediate succession
							to each other show that of the minority on the second 23 did not vote on
							the first, at all— <persRef ref="steenrod-lewis">Steenrod</persRef>
							moved a reconsideration, for the purpose of having it rejected; and it
							was rejected without a discussion—before the last vote by yeas and nays
							the Speaker announced that the morning hour had expired, but Dromgoole
							moved to suspend the rules to finish this business and it was carried—
							The whole matter was disposed of in the space of an hour and a half—
							After which <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef> moved to go
							into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the
							bill for restoring and remounting the second regiment of dragoons; which
							the house refused; and the rest of the day was engaged in the
							consideration of private bills; some 30 of which were passed in the
							house, or reported from the Committee of the whole <persRef
								ref="vinton-samuel">Samuel F. Vinton</persRef> in the chair.— The
							house adjourned soon after 3. O’Clock— I had a morning call from
								<persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Connell</persRef> urgent for the passage of the bill for the relief
							of the <persRef ref="blight-julia;crary-cornelia;ludlow-mary"

							there was objection to the Fulton bill though it has repeatedly passed
							the house— Evening visitors <persRef ref="newton-edward2">M<hi

								<persRef ref="rockwell-julius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							which I had suggested to a part of his theory— He is now desirous to

							note; and he promised to call on me again to-morrow evening.</p>

							Committee— The question was not taken on my motion— The Committee

						<p>The inflammation of my left eye and the tremulation of my right hand in
							grievous afflictions. They render it impossible to keep my record with
							the current of time— In the hall of the house of Representatives this
							morning I heard a long discourse from the <persRef ref="kincaid-eugenio"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Kincaid</persRef> a missionary to Burmah, where he and
								<persRef ref="kincaid-barbara">his wife</persRef> now with him have
							been about 13 years, and have returned to this country for the
							restoration of her health— Burmah is called an empire in the peninsula
							of India, and bordering on China— It is under British dependency, with
							the instrumentality of Semi-sovereign native princes, and subject to the
							incursions of robber chieftains, whose remorseless cruelties M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kincaid has witnessed and described with
							deep sensibility.— The religion of Burmah is Buddhism, but the
							missionaries are tolerated and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kincaid
							says they have fifty churches in that country— His text was from Isaiah
							9.2. [“]The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they
							that dwell in the land of the shadow of death; upon them hath the light
							shined.” but he gave out only the first part of the verse. He related
							with much emphasis, and incident in which he escaped almost miraculously
							from death, and another of which he was an eye-witness in which a woman
							of dignified deportment and distinguished condition with several of her
							children around her, was whipped to death with a rattan, by a robber
							chief to force her to disclose her property. After dinner I attended at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church, where <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the evening service for the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday
							in Lent, and preached from 1. Peter 1.22 “Seeing you have purified your
							souls in obeying the truth, through the spirit unto unfeigned love of
							the brethren, so that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.”
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s sermons are all in one
							strain, and attest his kindness of feeling not less than his piety—
							Coming out of Church I met <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> and requested him to
							call and see <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
							confined to her bed with an attack of Erisypelas striking at the lungs,

								ref="barnard-cora">their youngest daughter</persRef> last Evening
							from Albany. I had about an hour of conversation with him upon political

							upon men, but no defeat of purposes— Mysterious Heaven!—and let they
							will be done! <persRef ref="king-charles2">Charles B. King</persRef> the

							and wrote to fill up the chasm of the closing days of the last week;—but
							my stern chase of time, is to borrow a simile from <persRef

							a wooden leg after a horse. At the house it was the regular day for the

							Retrenchment, presented a report with a bill to regulate the pay of the

							after some chicanery 5000 extra-copies of the report were ordered to be
							printed— Black said the merit of the bill consisted in reducing half a
							million of dollars a year of the public expenditures— Fudge! The
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> began the call for
							Resolutions, with Ohio proceeding West and South— <persRef

								<persRef ref="woodward-joseph3">Woodward</persRef> then offered the

							of Virginia afterwards moved that another member be appointed on the
