						<p>Sun rose 5.24. Set. 6.36.</p>
						<p>The Sun rose clear, but a fog soon arose, and before breakfast came on a
							heavy shower. It continued showery through the day— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached in the morning from Matthew
							22.37. “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all
							thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” He observed
							that the Saviour emphatically declared this to be the first and great
							Commandment— But cavilling speculators had sometimes enquired what was
							the reason for this precept—a question not easy to answer upon any
							principle founded on human reason— The command is for sentiment and not
							for action— Can we love by command?— what is the use of love without
							action? why should we <hi rend="italic">love</hi> God? We can do him no
							service— We can contribute nothing to his glory or his power. He created
							us, for his own pleasure and not for ours— He continues our existence at
							his pleasure—not for ours— There is a reason assigned in 1 John 4.19. We
							love him, because he <hi rend="italic">first</hi> loved us—all
							sufficient— The proof of his first love was in our creation— The proof
							of our love is in obedience to his commandments, and in the love of our
							brother— And it is only obedience to the second commandment, Love thy
							neighbour as thyself that we can prove our love to God— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt suggested another proof by abstaining
							from the idle and licentious use of his name, and especially by
							refraining from the practice of profane swearing against which he urged
							a most earnest expostulation. He told a story of some political orator
							from the South afterwards notorious as a duelist, who haranguing at a
							public meeting in Boston, disgusted his audience by such frequent use of
							the name of God that at last one of his hearers called out to him dont
							swear so.— which mortified him and put him in check for the time— It is
							said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s rebuke to profane
							swearers was seasonable, and much needed at this time and place— His
							afternoon Sermon was from Luke 12.15. last clause of the verse—[“]for a
							man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things he
							possesseth.”— And Romans 8.6. also the last clause of the verse “to be
							spiritually minded is life and Peace.” whereupon he remarked that the
							passage from <persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef> declared what life is not, and the passage from the
							epistle to the Romans what it is— Not wealth—but the spiritual mind.

							Evening.— The Steamer Hibernia, <persRef ref="ryrie-alexander">Captain Ryrie</persRef>, arrived from Liverpool at
							Boston this afternoon, by a passage of 13 days and 2. hours—said to be
							the shortest ever made— <persRef ref="brooks-sidney">Sidney Brooks</persRef>, with <persRef ref="brooks-francis">his wife</persRef>, and her <persRef ref="u">Sister

							<persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-charles7">Charles Francis</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-henry4">Henry Brooks</persRef> took tea and passed the
							evening here— I read the remainder of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon’s</persRef> Apophthegms, with two
							shorter supplementary collections— Then come the Ornamenta Rationalia or
							Elegant sentences— Some made, others collected by the Lord Bacon, and by
							him put under the above said title. These are 36. proverbial aphorisms,
							in Latin, with English translations— They are followed by a Collection
							of Sentences out of some of the writings of the Lord Bacon, chiefly I
							think from the Essays— These are much better than the apophthegms and if
							at the age when I first read Bacon’s Essays—the life of <persRef ref="agricola">Agricola</persRef>, and
							the Annals and Histories of <persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef>— I had closely studied and mastered
							the power and beauty of a sententious Style and applied myself to the
							problem of embracing the maximum of thought in the minimum of words— I
							might have effected something in the world. It is now too late for me to
							begin— I read also the correspondence of Mess<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs.</hi> Monroe and C. Pinckney, with the <persRef ref="cevallos-pedro">Spanish Minister
							Cevallos</persRef>, in 1805— The whole claim of French title west of the
							Mississippi rests upon <persRef ref="lasalle-robert">La Salle’s</persRef> fort built after the loss of his
							vessels in 1685. and exterminated within two years after— I read also
							some pages of <persRef ref="darby-william">William Darby’s</persRef> Geographical description of the State of

						<p>The morning was cloudy, and the sky was all day clearing off— I took my
							two hours of exercise immediately after rising and planted button pear
							seeds and horse plum stones, in a flour pot. Six of my seedling Apple
							trees in the Nursery bear very fine Apples, and the one near the Summer
							house cellar is loaded with the wood house apple— The same with that
							from the parent tree— So that I consider that experiment wholly settled—
							But will the budded or grafted fruit produce fertile, or all barren
							seeds?— <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles F. Adams</persRef> went to Boston
							to see her brother <persRef ref="brooks-sidney">Sidney Brooks</persRef> and <persRef ref="brooks-francis">his wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Miss Dehon</persRef> her Sister,
							just arrived in the Steamer Hibernia, from Liverpool— <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi

							<persRef ref="crane-adoniram;clark-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Crane</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, went also with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Charles to Boston, and they all returned to dine.— A book pedlar by the
							name of <persRef ref="mcgowan-john">John M’Gowan</persRef> came to circulate a small pamphlet Family Doctor,
							with an appendix containing 100 valuable recipes—price 12 1/2 cents— As
							a supplement to <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> apophthegms and elegant sentences, I took one of
							them— The first volume of Bacon closes with a half page of Notes for
							civil conversation, and an Essay on Death, which he finds the least of
							all evils, and yet he does not profess to be a stoic, and consider it as
							no evil— Having read through this volume, except the Essays, read before
							I skip’d over the second volume, for the present, wishing to come to the
							history of the reign of <persRef ref="henry-vii">King Henry the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef>
							which I have never read— It is dedicated to <persRef ref="charles-i">Prince Charles, afterwards
							Charles the first</persRef>— The adulation is not quite so fulsome as I had
							expected— The History begins abruptly, with the sequel to the battle of
							Bosworth Field— I read of this very few pages, and find myself much
							interested in the history— I was also much occupied in reviewing the
							negotiations between the United States and Spain from the conclusion of
							the Louisiana to that of the Florida Treaty.— The most material points I
							have found; but there is much yet to trace. I answered a Letter of
							enquiry from <persRef ref="child-george">George H. Child</persRef> at Boston, as to time of sailing of the
							Boston frigate for France, upon <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> first mission there— 15.
							February 1778— And I received from <persRef ref="child-david">David Lee Child</persRef>, with an enclosure of
							<persRef ref="earle-thomas">Thomas Earle’s</persRef> Resolutions and the report of the American Anti-Slavery
							Society’s Committee against me.— We spent the evening in examining
							<persRef ref="middleton-james">Middleton’s</persRef> celestial Atlas with the companion, comparing them with the
							Stars in the firmament, which we observed with a sky of transcendent
							clearness and an atmosphere soft and mild as Paradise. We saw the signs
							of the Zodiac from the scorpion setting to Aries rising the Great and
							Little Bear, Cassiopeia, Arcturus in Bootes; the Gem of the Northern
							Crown—Perseus with the head of Medusa, Andromeda, the square of
							Pegasus-Vega and the mirror stars of Lyra the Swan in the Milky way and
							many others.</p>

						<p>Clear sky, and a cloudless day.— Morning exercise unprofitable. <persRef ref="field-harvey">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harvey Field</persRef> came in great impatience for
							the deed of the Quincy meadow, six acres, for which he said <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> had
							agreed to the execution and delivery this day. He brought with him <persRef ref="field-john">his
							eldest son, eight years old, and who bears my name</persRef>, and said he wanted
							the deed, this day, having agreed to give one for a house lot on the
							land, for 600 dollars— He brought also three bills of one thousand
							dollars each of the New-England Bank, which he said he had received this
							morning, from <persRef ref="bartlett-ibrahim">Ibrahim Bartlet</persRef>, Cashier of the Quincy Stone Bank. I
							hunted up an old blank fee-simple warranty deed, filled it up, signed
							and sealed it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Field went out and found
							<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George W. Beale</persRef> at work on his farm,
							and brought him in, and he took as Justice of Peace my acknowledgment
							and that of <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> for her relinquishment of Dower— The witnesses were
							<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="clark-susan">Susan Crane</persRef>— And thus I alienated the Quincy meadow,
							purchased by <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah3">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Josiah
							Quincy</persRef> in 1772 and conveyed by my father to me in 1803. I parted with it
							reluctantly—perhaps improvidently, but at what is esteemed here a very
							high price.— Field told me that a woodlot of 15 Acres on Pine hill,
							between two of mine was sold yesterday at auction, and purchased by
							<persRef ref="baxter-daniel">Daniel Baxter</persRef>, and two others— But there was some difficulty between
							them about the payment, and they were all willing that it should be
							conveyed to me for 33 dollars an acre— I told him I would take it at
							that rate— Having now 3000 dollars upon my hands I determined to invest
							it as soon as possible, and for that purpose to go to Boston to-morrow—
							I called at the Stone Bank, and deposited there the three Bills, which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett received and entered to my
							credit as cash. I drew at the same time by a check 200 dollars in bills,
							for my current household expenses, and desired M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bartlett to give my compliments to <persRef ref="u">his daughter</persRef>, and say to
							her that an engagement of business at Boston to morrow would deprive me
							of the pleasure of attending at the Pic-Nic, as I had promised— I put
							into the Post-Office a copy of my Eulogy upon <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>, which I had
							promised to <persRef ref="bancroft-george">George Bancroft</persRef>— <persRef ref="french-asa">French</persRef> the Postmaster, took me mysteriously
							into another room, to shew me a pair of spectacles which he said had
							belonged to <persRef ref="hancock-john">Governor Hancock</persRef>—and which <persRef ref="morton-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Sarah Morton</persRef> had given him, on account of his keeping the Hancock house—
							At <persRef ref="gill-caleb">Gill’s</persRef> shop I took a supply of five sheets of blank warranty Deeds.
							While we were at dinner <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef> sent me
							an invitation to come up the hill and see a ship come into the harbor.—
							I went up with <persRef ref="crane-adoniram">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane</persRef>, and we saw three
							large ships go up— I spent the afternoon, till near Sunset in
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles, and enjoying
							the prospect— And the evening in star-gazing and consulting <persRef ref="middleton-james">Middleton’s</persRef>

							He said he had another woodlot of 49. acres which he was willing to sell
							for 30 dollars an acre, with a growth of 20 years wood upon it— I
							promised at some leisure time to go and look at the land. I went into

								rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Frothingham</persRef> that I would come and dine
							with them at 2— I strolled round the corner of Federal and Milk Streets,
							and seeing at the Corinthian Hall an advertisement of the exhibition of
							<persRef ref="allston-washington">Alston’s</persRef> picture of <persRef ref="belshazzar">Belshazzar’s</persRef> feast, I went in and inspected that
							work which reminded me of the risum teneatis amici—for it is as if the
							artist had purposely intended to realize the imaginary absurd picture of
							<persRef ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> art of poetry. It is the most chaotic composition upon canvas
							that I ever beheld— There are two small designs, first thoughts, shewing
							what the large picture was intended to be. Both these have great merit,
							and one of them is far better than the final abortion. In neither of
							them were the finger of the hand on the wall, nor the words written by
							them painted.— There is a group of Babylonian soothsayers and
							astrologers of gigantic dimensions, double the size of the king, queen,
							and <persRef ref="daniel">Daniel</persRef>—and they are double the size of figures at the banquet table
							behind. I met there <persRef ref="quincy-maria">Sophia Quincy</persRef> who was as much displeased with the
							picture as I was, and regretted that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Alston’s friends had allowed it to be exhibited— From this Hall I went
							into State Street and walked to the head of long wharf, where I saw the
							unfinished Custom-house with its multitude of granite pillars— Returning
							slowly up the Street, I met <persRef ref="degrand-peter">P. P. F. Degrand</persRef>, the person of whom I was
							in search, and requested him to procure for me 30 shares of the stock of
							the great western rail-road, and to bring them to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> office, which
							he did in the course of half an hour— I gave him a check for 2692.50
							upon the Quincy Stone Bank; which in consideration of my name they

							looked into the volume of the Library of useful knowledge containing an
							account of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon’s</persRef> Novum organum scientiarum or new method of
							studying the Sciences in two parts—said to have been written by <persRef ref="brougham-henry">Lord
								Brougham</persRef>—but I made progress in the history of the reign of <persRef ref="henry-vii">Henry the
								7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef>— I find this reading very
							agreeable, and am quite delighted with the Style; which must be
							considerably modified, at least for the spelling.— In the very first
							page he says of <persRef ref="richard-iii">Richard the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></persRef> that he was
							“a Prince in military virtue approved, jealous of the honour of the
							English Nation, and likewise a good lawmaker for the ease and solace of
							the common people.”— There are numerous examples of pregnant antithesis
							and synonimous nest eggs, and curious similitudes— The people made
							heartier demonstrations of joy on the day of his marriage with the white
							rose, Elizabeth of York, than on the day of his entry, or of his
							coronation “which the king rather <hi rend="italic">noted</hi> than <hi
								rend="italic">liked</hi>.”— “that it was not the first blow that
							made the war invasive, for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> no wise Prince
							would stay for, but the first provocation, or at least the first
							preparation.”— “Pretext is never wanting to power.”— “Arguments are ever
							with multitudes too weak for suspicions.” “This Court (Star chamber) is
							one of the sagest, and noblest institutions of this kingdom.” In
							Yorkshire [“]the memory of King Richard was so strong that it lay like
							lees in the bottom of men’s hearts; and if the vessel was but stirred,
							it would come up.”— [“]In my judgment it is some defect even in the best
							writers of history, that they do not often enough summarily deliver and
							set down the most memorable laws that passed in the times whereof they
							writ, being indeed the principal acts of peace.—” The book is full of
							such striking passages, but I have no time or space to record them.—
							This afternoon I walked to <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef>
							and delivered to her a Letter from her Son, <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef>, engaged on the
							survey of the North-eastern boundary.— She spoke of the Pic-Nic
							yesterday as having been very numerous. The universalist minister, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef>, speechified. Returning home I
							stop’d and spent an hour with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles</persRef>— He
							himself and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> returned this evening from their excursion to

							merely to see me, and to ask of me an autograph to send to <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>. I

							the chief Sub-clerk in the office of the Clerk of the House of

							200 copies to be struck off, to be delivered to members of Congress on
							or before the first of March next at 15 dollars a set—a <hi

							French refers to a Resolution of H.R.U.S. adopted on the 14<hi

							Congress, each a set of the documents already furnished to the members

								>th.</hi> Congresses, which French says includes Elliot’s
							debates—but no appropriation was made to pay for the books, and a
							proviso is contained in the Resolution that it shall not authorise a
							reprint of the books— I recurred to the Journal of the House which I
							have in sheets, and found the Resolution which was offered by R. C.
							Winthrop, and carried through by the previous question twice over
							against the opposition of <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, by yeas and nays, first to lay
							on the table 64 to 111. and last to reconsider the vote for the

							the Resolution, and I advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shute that
							as the reprint and the order for 200 copies for the members are directly
							in the face of the Resolution, he should have nothing to do with it— And
							as the Resolution was offered and carried by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Winthrop, I recommended a second visit to him: that he
							should tell him my opinions on the subject, and conclude for his

							the work of <persRef ref="joutel-henri">Joutel</persRef> in French and English from the University

						<p><persRef ref="stetson-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stetson</persRef> the Minister of the old
							congregational church at Medford preached for <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> this morning from Galatians 6.5. “For every man shall
							bear his own burden” This epistle to the Galatians is a controversial
							argument against the practice of circumcision, and generally to set
							aside the ritual obligations of the <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>—meaning
							the Levitical Law— Jesus had not explicitly abrogated that Law— But he
							had commanded his apostles to preach his gospel to <hi rend="italic">all
								Nations</hi>, baptising them in the name of the father and of the
							son, and of the holy ghost, and had promised to be with them till the
							end of the world— Baptism was thus tacitly but not explicitly
							substituted for circumcision. The converted Jews however still adhered
							to that bloody rite— From the narrative in the Acts it appears that at
							first both <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef> and <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> preached the gospel indiscriminately to the
							Jews and Gentiles— Peter was by a miraculous vision was absolved from
							the Law as to lawful and unlawful meats; but he still adhered to
							circumcision. It was at Corinth that Paul after his return and that of
							<persRef ref="silas">Silas</persRef> and <persRef ref="timothy">Timothy</persRef> from Macedonia, reasoning in the synagogue to Jews and
							Greeks, when the Jews opposed themselves and blasphemed—shook his
							raiment and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads: I am
							clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles—and the same night in
							a vision he was recommissioned, with a promise from the Lord that he
							would be with him, and no man should set on him to hurt him (Acts
							18.5–10) In this Epistle to the Galatians 2.7. he says “the gospel of
							the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
							circumcision was unto Peter”—and they quarreled—and Paul says he
							withstood Peter to the face, because he was to be blamed— And this axiom
							that every man shall bear his own burden is part of Paul’s argument.
							M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stetson and <persRef ref="stetson-frederick">his son</persRef> dined with us,
							and his afternoon text was from Matthew 16.24 “Let him deny himself.”
							The whole verse being “Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man
							will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
							follow me.” The discourse was upon self denial, which he defined
							somewhat metaphysically, observing that self-denial implied a double
							nature in man one craving and the other refusing the same thing. He
							descanted also largely upon the soul—its immortality, its solitude, its
							condition in futurity— I read also a Sermon of <persRef ref="dewey-orville">Orville Dewey</persRef> upon
							Retribution, recommended to me by <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef>— After the service this afternoon I went with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>,

							confined by illness to her chamber and could not see us. M<hi

						<p><persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> youngest Son, <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef> has been for some weeks in drooping
							health, but I met him Saturday towards evening, on the hill, with his
							nurse <persRef ref="rebecca2">Rebecca</persRef>—yesterday afternoon the scarlet fever struck out upon him,
							to our great alarm, though with favourable symptoms.— This morning
							early, Charles took his eldest son, <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> to Boston, to place him
							at the town Latin School. <persRef ref="crane-adoniram">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane</persRef>, and
							<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, went also to Boston intending to visit Medford and mount
							Auburn, but found time only for a pilgrimage to the Bunker hill Monument
							at Charlestown. To the top of this they ascended with the help of a
							steam engine. Walter Hellen returned alone about 8 O’Clock this evening;
							but Charles and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane stayed to attend a
							Meeting of the young men’s whig club, and got back shortly before
							midnight— <persRef ref="baxter-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Baxter</persRef> came with his
							Deed ready drawn of the 15 Acre woodlot on Pine hill, interlocked
							between two lots of mine but he was not fully provided with his title—
							In 1829. it was purchased by <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">Lemuel Bracket</persRef>, and in November of that
							year was surveyed by <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">Lemuel Humphrey</persRef> for him. in 1832. it was after
							cutting off all the wood upon it, sold by Bracket to <persRef ref="white-caleb">Caleb</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="white-clivingston">Livingston White</persRef> and in 1837. Caleb conveyed his part to Livingston
							White—who now conveys to Daniel Baxter. But he had with him only the
							deed from Bracket to the Whites and the bounds in his deed to me were
							not properly described. So I told him he must produce all the evidences
							of his title, and amend the description of the bounds, which he
							undertook to do— After dinner a person whom I took to be a clergyman
							came with a friend of his, named <persRef ref="hale-elisha">Elisha Hale</persRef> settled in one of the
							North-western States—his own name<hi rend="strikethrough">d</hi> is
							<persRef ref="u">Cozzens</persRef>—but I find not this name in the list of Clergymen of Boston in
							the Massachusetts Register— They came merely on a visit of curiosity,
							and stayed but a few minutes— I finished reading <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon’s</persRef> History of
							the Reign of <persRef ref="henry-vii">Henry the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> which has been a
							delicious treat. There is an imitation of the style of <persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef> in the
							narrative, and an interweaving of moral reflection with the series of
							events, extremely pleasant.— The story of Peter Osbeck son of a
							<persRef ref="osbeck-john">converted Jew</persRef> of Tournay, historically known by the name of Perkin
							Warbeck is marvellous. “Nay, himself, with long and continual
							counterfeiting, and with often telling a lye, was turned by habit almost
							into the thing he seemed to be; and from a liar to a believer.”— The
							notice of the discovery of America by <persRef ref="columbus-christopher">Christopher Columbus</persRef>, and the
							expedition of <persRef ref="cabot-sebastian">Sebastian Cabot</persRef>, or as Bacon calls him Gaboto, are among
							the remarkable passages in this work— Another is the melancholy fortunes
							and fate of <persRef ref="edward-v">Edward Earl of Warwick</persRef>, son of <persRef ref="edward-iv">Edward the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> brother <persRef ref="georgeplantagenet">Clarence</persRef>— The character of Henry
							himself at the close of the book is drawn with a master’s hand, but with
							a Courtier’s spirit, smoothing over the truth with flattery.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 5:34. Set 6.21.</p>
						<p>After breakfasting about Sunrise; with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>, <persRef ref="crane-adoniram">Adoniram Judson Crane</persRef>, and
							<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, I went in the Barouche, first to <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Loring’s</persRef> house at Hingham, whence without alighting we
							proceeded to Cohasset on a fishing party— Not to our usual place of
							departure the Cold Spring, but to a new building, erected since our last
							Summer’s party; and called the Atlantic House—close upon the end of
							Nantasket Beach. A larger and more convenient lodge for dining a party
							than the one at the Spring. Before we left home, <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef> came in from Roxbury and kept company with
							us. Between the Atlantic house and the beach we met <persRef ref="allen-joseph3">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen</persRef> the young clergyman whose ordination
							to the pastoral charge of the Church at Jamaica Plains I attended last
							October— He was here in company with several Ladies of his parish. There

							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring and the <persRef ref="brooks-charles">Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Charles Brooks</persRef>— There was a small sloop
							at anchor near the beach which with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crane, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks, the <persRef ref="brazer-john">Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
							Brazer</persRef> of Salem, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis, a young man
							named <persRef ref="lincoln-nathan">Nathan Lincoln</persRef>, and two or three others, we reached by a small
							leaky boat from the beach, and in which we sailed in quest of fishing
							grounds from 10. A.M to nearly 2. P.M. The Captain and owner of the
							Sloop took us successively to all the favourite fishing grounds, but
							without success at any one of them— The sky had been occasionally
							covered with thin transitory clouds. Soon after we sailed the Sun came
							out with intense heat and a dead calm for about an hour, when an eastern
							breeze came up and thenceforth we were comfortably cool— We had a very
							pleasant sail; but upon four several removes found not fish enough to
							make sport. We caught less than a dozen chiefly small rock cod— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brazer very soon tired, and when the
							breeze came up qualmish, and impatient and quite importunate to return
							to the shore— To please him we returned before 2. and found a the
							Atlantic house several other gentlemen, accessions to the party— A
							temperance dinner of chowder and fried perch was soon over, with coffee
							for claret and lemonade for Madeira— After dinner M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathan Lincoln sung two Sea Songs Soon
							after, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis took leave and returned
							home— At 4. we left the Atlantic house and came to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s house at Hingham. Charles,
							anxious for his Son <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane
							afflicted with a fit of asthma, returned immediately to Quincy and sent
							back <persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> with the barouche for Walter Hellen and me. We had an
							evening party of Ladies and Gentlemen at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Loring’s in conversation chiefly with me, till the sound of the 9
							O’Clock bell started us, and we took leave of the company and came back
							to our home at Quincy—where we landed just before ten O’Clock, rejoiced
							to learn that the symptoms of the child Arthur’s disease are
							favourable.</p>

						<p>My morning exercise is now confined to sowing seeds of Apples, Button

							stones and seeds of Apples from the young summer house apple tree, in
							the summer house cellar. <persRef ref="baxter-daniel">Daniel Baxter</persRef> came with his Deed of the Pine
							hill lot, and <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">Lemuel Humphrey’s</persRef> plan of it, making it 15 Acres 1. Rood
							and 25 Rods, for all which he had charged— There was also yet missing
							the deed from <persRef ref="white-caleb">Caleb</persRef> to <persRef ref="white-clivingston">Livingston White</persRef>, and I told him as all those
							Lots were originally sold by the town for 15 acres each— I could not
							take the lot for more. And I thought it probable that, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey’s plan encroached upon my two
							adjoining lots. I said also that <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> had told me the price of
							the lot was 495 dollars. he went and soon returned with Caleb White’s
							deed to Livingston, dated in 1837 and recorded— His own deed to me was
							made conformable to that from <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">Bracket</persRef> to the Whites and the
							consideration for 15 acres only—495 dollars.— I took his deed and the
							plan, and gave him a check on the stone bank for that sum— This lot,
							with the three others adjoining it, and the lawyer’s common form are
							aggregate of 108 acres of woodland all contiguous.— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> paid me a morning visit, and said
							there was to be an ordination, next Wednesday at Chelsea of a young man
							by the name of <persRef ref="rice-george">Rice</persRef>, to which our church is invited, and he inquired if
							I should be willing to accompany him as a delegate— I told him that I
							was engaged to go to Cambridge on that day to pass the Night at
							<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy’s</persRef>; but I should not be obliged to go till late in the
							day, and supposed I could attend the ordination and go afterwards to
							Cambridge— But there was one suggestion for his consideration rather
							than mine which had perhaps not occurred to him— I had twice within the
							last two years attended him as a delegate at Ordinations— Might there
							not be other members of the church, who would incline to have their turn
							to partake of these offices, and might think I was engrossing more than
							my share? He said the idea had never occurred to him— I said he might
							take time to think of it and I would go with him or give place to
							another according as he should conclude— I was engaged at least two
							hours of this morning in examining my Diary, commencing with October
							1818, to make extracts of all the notices of the Negotiation of the
							Florida Treaty with the <persRef ref="onis-luis">Spanish Minister Onis</persRef>. I marked a number of
							passages which I requested <persRef ref="hellen-walter">Walter Hellen</persRef> to copy for me; which he
							readily promised to do— I proceed in the reading of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> Works— The
							Reign of <persRef ref="henry-vii">Henry the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> is followed by two
							fragments. One a single page, commencing the History of the reign of
							<persRef ref="henry-viii">King Henry the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> The other three pages of

							diagonally through my lot in front of my house; utterly ruining the
							finest lot for dwelling houses in the whole town—exposing my barns and

							I thought it best to have no altercation with them, and referred them
							entirely to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>— I took Letters to the Post Office, and called twice

						<p>Morning hours absorbed in digging round the seedling tree patches in the

						<p><persRef ref="perry-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas H. Perry</persRef>, a professor in the navy
							of the United States called on me this morning from South Abington, his
							native place and where he is now upon furlough. He has visited me
							before— Last fall here, and after the close of the late Session of
							Congress at Washington— He has a taste for astronomical studies and is
							desirous of being stationed at the new Washington Observatory— He says
							he made known this desire to the <persRef ref="wilkins-william">Secretary of War</persRef>, who promised him that
							he should be provided for, but said that no appointments for the
							observatory would be made, till the bills shall be finished.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Perry said there had been some
							recommendation to put the Observatory in charge of a Post-Captain in the
							Navy; which would just be an extinguisher over the whole concern—for
							there was not a Post-Captain in the Navy who knew how to take an
							Astronomical Observation, the art of which was only to be acquired by
							practice; as he himself had ascertained by being admitted to observe by
							the astronomer at the British observatory at the Cape of Good Hope— I
							went to Roxbury, and dined at <persRef ref="codman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Codman’s</persRef> with the Trustees of the Massachusetts agricultural Society— <persRef ref="adams-john">My

							as I have ever known him. These dinner parties of the Trustees of the
							agricultural Society to which I am occasionally invited bring up a
							mingled memorial of three several stages of my life, all studded with
							affecting reminisces— My early youth from 1790 to 1794— My return from
							Europe and residence at Boston from 1801 to 1809. And my last return

						<p>Sun rose beclouded— Set clear</p>
						<p>The weather continues excessively dry, with this day a return of Summer
							heat— My <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Son’s</persRef> children <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>, who came in
							yesterday from Boston are with us to keep them away, from <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef> who is
							yet going through the scarlet fever; still with favourable symptoms— The
							eruption passing off and the sore throat abated— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> came home
							yesterday afternoon from Charles’s house, sick; had a bad night and has
							been all this day confined to her bed.— The effect of the heat upon my
							nervous system to disable me for writing is appaling, and irremediable.
							<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached at home—this morning
							from Joel. 2.13. “Rend your heart and not your Garments.” The discourse
							commenced, with an historical account of the different usages among the
							antient Jews of manifesting their afflictions, by personal acts of
							violence—by clothing themselves in sackloth, rolling their bodies in
							ashes, prostrations—scarifying their faces, and among other things
							rending their garments— He then adduced numerous citations from both the
							old and new Testament to shew that these practices were disapproved by
							God, and repeatedly and severely censured by Jesus Christ— He quoted
							especially the passage in Micah 6.7. and the frequent warnings of Jesus
							against the hypocritical fasts and ostentatious slovenly manners of the
							Pharisees— The emphatic precepts in all parts of the Bible against
							observances merely of form cannot escape the notice of every enquirer
							after truth. And from the earnest exhortation to despise and discard all
							such delusive pretensions to sanctity the argument naturally slided into
							a glowing commendation of pure Christian humility— This book of <persRef ref="joel">Joel</persRef>
							consisting only of three short chapters, is at the first aspect an
							outburst of lamentation at the calamity of a land devoured by worms and
							caterpillars— The canker worm the palmer-worm and the Caterpillar.—
							These I suppose were metaphorical figures denoting the Babylonian
							conquerors. All these pictures by the prophets of the dreadful judgment
							of God in the captivity, are of what <persRef ref="west-benjamin">Benjamin West</persRef> used to call the
							terribly sublime— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon text
							was from Psalm 67.4. [“]O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for
							thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the Nations upon
							Earth.” I read also two of the Sermons of <persRef ref="dewey-orville">Orville Dewey</persRef>. The 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> in the volume, being the second upon
							future retribution—and the first in the volume—upon human nature— My
							Sons <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> has been frightened by the Sermons on retribution— They are of
							the rigid and gloomy school of theology. Such doctrines, if they cannot
							breed a hell in the next world, at least make one in this— I have no
							faith in them—and very little in their author— The Sermon upon humann
							nature is better, and yet does not entirely satisfactory to my mind.</p>

							Lunt</persRef> and alighted at <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert C. Winthrop’s</persRef>
							house. I sent <persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> with the Barouche to land M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt at <persRef ref="warren-charles3">judge Warren’s</persRef> house in Beacon Street to take him up
							there again at one O’Clock, and then call for me at <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="spooner-allen">A. C.
							Spooners</persRef> Office N. 23. Court Street. I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Winthrop that I had called on him to speak of <persRef ref="erving-george">George W.
									Erving</persRef> and <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll’s</persRef> concerted attack
							upon me during the last Session of Congress, and particularly upon
							Erving’s written communications to Jackson against me. Erving had spoken
							to me about it during the Session— He then read to me part of a Letter
							which Erving had written to him on the subject— And he now read me part
							of another received by the last Steamer, and written after Erving had
							received Charles J. Ingersoll’s counterfeit report published as the
							report of the Committee of foreign affairs dated 1. May 1844— Erving’s
							Letter now is apologetic towards me; but tenfold bitter and rancorous to
							the memory of <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>; and mean and
							sneaking in his excuses for his wanton attack upon me— I asked Winthrop
							if Charles J. Ingersoll’s view contains Erving’s paper or a garbled and
							summary statement of it made up by Ingersoll himself.— Winthrop said he
							thought it was Erving’s own paper— But I read from it several passages
							evidently shewing that it is not. While we were in conversation <persRef ref="gray-john">John C.
							Gray</persRef> came in and having apparently business with Winthrop, I left them—
							Called at the Office of the morning Chronicle and Emancipator and
							enquired of <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> if they had any
							pamphlet copies of my Letter of 4. July 1843 to the Bangor Committee.
							<persRef ref="alden-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alden</persRef> said he believed he had some at
							his house, and if he had he would send them to me. I enquired also if <persRef ref="fisher-milton">M.
							M. Fisher</persRef> had received my answer to his Letter. He said he had— At one
							O’Clock I found A. C. Spooner at his office, just returned from a four
							months excursion to Europe— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt came in
							the Barouche— We went over Winnisimmet ferry to Chelsea, and thence to
							the town Hall two miles distant from the landing— It was half past two
							when the Council met. <persRef ref="flint-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flint</persRef> of Salem
							Moderator. <persRef ref="waterston-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterston</persRef> Scribe. After the
							usual preliminaries we walked to the Meeting house and the <persRef ref="rice-george">Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> George M. Rice</persRef> was ordained Pastor of the
							Church— The Sun went down upon the ceremonies. We partook of a Collation
							at the town Hall, and then with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt I
							recrossed the Winisimmet ferry, and after taking M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt home I returned to my own at Quincy.</p>

						<p>At the ordination, or rather installation yesterday of the <persRef ref="rice-george">Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> George M Rice</persRef>, as Pastor of the first
							Congregational Church and Society in Chelsea, the ceremonies were as

								Robert C. Waterston</persRef> of Boston 11. Concluding prayer by <persRef ref="gray-frederick">Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> Frederick T. Gray</persRef> of Boston 12. Doxology.
							13. Benediction by the Pastor George M. Rice— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt’s Sermon was from Philippians 3.9.—“the righteousness
							which is of God by Faith.” All the services were appropriate and
							creditable— This form of ordaining a minister of the gospel to the
							charge of a single church is pre-eminently popular and republican— And
							contrasts most advantageously with the forms of episcopal ordination In
							these there are two things insupportable, and blasphemous. 1. The
							pretension of the bishop to confer the holy ghost and 2. the power of
							pardoning a retaining sin at his discretion. These are the most servile
							and obsequious vicious practices retained from the church of Rome— Our
							churches are independent of each other. Associated as brethren— Their
							pastors are all equal—elected by their people without hierarchy of
							Bishop Priest and Deacon; without the ridiculous pretension of receiving
							from the afflatus of the Bishop either the holy ghost or the
							discretionary power to forgive or to retain sins.— The introductory,
							ordination, and concluding prayers each by a separate brother pastor—
							The Anthem, Hymns and Doxology— The Sermon— Charge, Right hand of
							fellowship and Address to the People, are all congenial parts of one
							ceremony—all solemnizing incidents of reciprocal duties contracted by
							the incipient relations between the Pastor and his flock— These services
							were all well performed on this occasion.— This day was the great Mass
							Meeting of the whigs at Boston, at which I was invited to preside but
							declined— <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef> presided and delivered a Speech of an hour and
							a half— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef>, who is President of the young Men’s whig club went into
							Boston with <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-louisa3;adams-mary4">my two Granddaughters</persRef> to see the show.—
							<persRef ref="hudson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hudson</persRef> the Portrait Painter came and
							took a sitting of an hour.— The next is to be next Monday— I went up the
							hill, and saw the sun set from the North-western chamber of Charles’s
							house— I saw <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, and her boy <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef>, the glands of whose neck are
							badly swollen after they had flattered themselves that the scarlet fever
							had entirely passed off.— Walter and the two girls returned home about 7

							objects of his visit was to enquire if in the old Record Book of Births,
							Marriages and Deaths in Braintree the name of Allen appeared, about a

							the name, between 1680. and 1720.— I lent him the book on his promise to

							and <persRef ref="bond-william">Bond</persRef>. The conversation was various, literary, not very scientific,
							occasionally political, but not controversial and throughout cheerful
							and good humoured— The only drawback to me, was the continual call upon
							me for talk, leading me to engross a very disproportionate part of the
							conversation to myself; an impulse to vanity and self conceit— Towards
							11. O’Clock, the company retired— I asked for a lamp and a friction

						<p>After a sound nights sleep I awoke just in time to hear the town clock

							journal of yesterday; which just brought me to the breakfast hour of <persRef ref="quincy-eliza;quincy-eliza2;quincy-maria;quincy-abigail">the
							family</persRef>— The hour of morning prayer at the University is as when I was
							there 6. preceded by two bells— Immediately after breakfast, I visited
							with <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> the University Library, in the new building of
							gothic Architecture, solid granite and fire proof, erected upon the
							princely bequest of <persRef ref="gore-christopher">Christopher Gore</persRef>. The librarian is <persRef ref="harris-thaddeus2">Thaddaeus William
								Harris</persRef>, a son of <persRef ref="harris-thaddeus">my lately deceased friend and Classmate</persRef>, who had at one
							period of his life from 1791. to 1793. also held that office— The
							library is well assorted and arranged in this building in suitable
							alcoves; with the names of the donors over the respective alcoves
							containing the books given by them— The name of Adams is over one of the
							Alcoves, which contains the books given by <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and by me whether
							all of them or not they do not know; for they have no catalogue of
							either set. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris asked me if I could
							furnish lists. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy has asked me more
							than once the same question— He has noticed the donations in his History
							of Harvard University 2.569. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
							shewed us a considerable collection of new French Books recently added
							to the Library and a German collection of Etruscan and Grecian
							sculptured vases— They have not the works of the <persRef ref="caylus-anne">Count de Caylus</persRef>— I
							borrowed the second volume of <persRef ref="black-john2">Blacks</persRef> Translation of <persRef ref="humboldt-alexander">Humboldt’s</persRef> New
							Spain— We then visited the cabinet of Minerals where <persRef ref="webster-john">Professor Webster</persRef>
							was at work in reducing and cleaning some crystals which he has lately
							collected on an excursion into the western part of New-York— After
							viewing the collection of portraits in the dining hall we returned to
							the President’s house, and then rode out to the new Observatory, on the
							spot where stood <persRef ref="craigie-andrew">Cragie’s</persRef> Summer house— When I was there the day after
							commencement last year they were digging the foundation— There is now a
							dwelling house for the observator, piers for placing on them as stands
							the great <persRef ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauenhofer</persRef> Refractor. The transit instrument, and the
							transit-circle— The tower of solid granit is raised about 20 feet above
							the surface of the earth and is not yet finished— We found <persRef ref="peirce-benjamin">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Peirce</persRef> and <persRef ref="bond-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bond</persRef> there and went all over the buildings with them.— The prospects are

						<list><item>Beale George W.</item></list>
						<p>Sun rose 6. Set</p>
						<p>Sudden change from midsummer heat and a parching drought— The sear and
							yellow leaf on many trees, and showers of them fallen and falling from
							the willows.— The Sun set clear last evening but a Southwest gale had
							been blowing all day. This morning was cloudy and from 2 to 4 pm this
							afternoon the was a copious shower of rain— The first for<space/>days— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached this morning from
							Philippians 3.9.— “The righteousness which is of God, by Faith.” The
							same sermon which he preached last Wednesday at the Installation of <persRef ref="rice-george">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rice</persRef>— It gave me occasion to remark upon
							the great imperfection of my Memory.— As M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt read over his sermon I recollected every sentence as I had heard it
							before. Yet I could not remember one sentence, but as it was repeated to
							me. <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce</persRef> of Brookline has told me of a
							young woman in his parish who after hearing a sermon once delivered, can
							go home, and write it out word for word—what a power! and how vainly I
							have struggled full three score years to retain so much as the substance
							of discourses that I hear.— Even after twice hearing this sermon of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt I could give but a scanty and meagre
							account of it— The kernel of it is that Faith is the Christian system of
							morals. He began by observing that it had been cast as a reproach upon
							Christianity that it had no system of Morals connected with it— Meaning
							thereby a code of positive precepts, such for example as the decalogue—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt presents Faith as in itself a
							system of morals; and a priesthood and the institution of the Sabbath as
							schools of moral philosophy.— There is much in this view But in truth
							the New Testament is itself the most excellent code of ethics in the
							world, and Jesus was the most perfect of moral teachers— He summed up
							the whole duty of man in two precepts, the love of God, and the love of
							his neighbour— He taught his doctrines to the poor— He exemplified them
							by his life— He sanctioned them by the performance of miracles.— He died
							and rose from the dead to prove their immortality. Love is to the moral
							universe, what gravitation is to the physical— One principle, the vital
							element of all human action, pervading the life of man from the cradle
							to the grave—all founded upon duty— The basis of Greek and Roman Moral
							Philosophy was self love. Happiness— There was no word in their
							languages to express duty— Justice was their moral law— Mercy is the
							moral law of Christianity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s
							afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 7.31. “And they that use this
							world as not abusing it.” From which he inferred that there are lawful
							uses which may be made of the world—and by the world he said might be
							understood either the people of the world, our fellow tenants of the
							globe—or the globe itself the tenement of man— Besides these discourses
							I read two of the volume published by the <persRef ref="dewey-orville">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
								>d</hi> Orville Dewey</persRef>, the second upon human nature; and the third
							upon the wrong which sin does to human Nature— The two sermons on human
							nature contain an ingenious, benevolent and I believe sound argument
							against the doctrine of its total depravity— I saw the Sun set from
							<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house—clear— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Beale</persRef> here

								Brown</persRef> with the mystification of <persRef ref="erving-george">George W. Erving’s</persRef> treachery, but
							without success. The <persRef ref="garland-gilman">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> G. D. Garland</persRef> of
							Roxbury, a preacher of the Freewill Baptist Society came with a
							contribution paper for building a church of that denomination to which I
							put down my name for 5. dollars.— I barely made out my record of
							yesterday and took a short tour in the garden and nursery when I was
							called to dinner— Soon after which <persRef ref="dana-anderson">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dana</persRef>
							of Brandon, Vermont came with a Letter recommendatory from <persRef ref="hayden-william">William
							Hayden</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Senior editor of the Boston Atlas</persRef>— He was accompanied by his
							brother a merchant of Boston. They are fervent whigs, and the only
							object of their visit was to see and converse with me— While they were
							here, <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs.</hi> Birney</persRef> came in— He is the son of <persRef ref="birney-james">James G. Birney</persRef> now of
							Michigan, and the candidate of the Liberty party for election as
							President of the United States— The Son resides at New-Haven,
							Connecticut; I met him last week at the office of the Morning Chronicle,
							in Boston last which, and <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef>
							introduced him to me. Why he visits me now I do not know— His father
							owes me a grudge, and as the head of the abolition Liberty party made a
							violent and furious assault upon my character and reputation in a Letter
							to his party— He had perhaps some provocation— When he was going to the
							first world’s convention at London in 1840. he wrote to me requesting
							Letters of introduction to my friends in England—a piece of sheer
							impertinence, for I had no personal acquaintance with him which could
							warrant me in recommending him to my friends, nor any reason to believe
							him a man of merit so transcendent that I could venture to recommend
							him, though a stranger. But as an answer of refusal would have required
							an assignment of reasons which I knew would be more offensive to him
							even than neglect, I left his Letter unanswered, and he now assails me
							in revenge.— He has emancipated some Slaves which he inherited from his
							father— Has suffered persecution, obloquy and loss for the cause of
							Liberty for which he is entitled to respect and gratitude. But he is the
							sport of envious, bitter, ambitious and malignant passions, and his head
							is turned by the greatness thrust upon him of a party candidate for the
							presidency.— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> took his Son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> to Boston to school this
							morning, and brought him back this Evening.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 5.48. Set<space/><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 36. Frost.</p>
						<p>Sharp frost, and the morning so cold that I was unable to write— We had a
							fire in the middle room, and the cold shatters my nerves so that I have
							scarcely the use of my hands— Yet <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my son</persRef> has promised the young men’s
							whig club of Boston that I will deliver to them a political Lecture on
							the evening of Monday the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October—
							Charles is President of that association, and I wish to give him aid as
							far as may be practicable in the fulfilment of his duties in that
							capacity— I wished also to take the opportunity to expose the foul
							conspiracy of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, <persRef ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef>, <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron Vail Brown</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Jared Ingersoll</persRef>, <persRef ref="lewis-william3">Major Lewis</persRef>—<persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> and others charging
							me with a treacherous surrender of Texas to Spain by the Florida Treaty
							in 1819.— I have written 40 pages, which it would take me two hours and
							a half to deliver, and I have not yet got half through my defence— I
							cannot finish before the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next month,
							and must deliver it in fragments.— I shudder at the work before me, and
							despair of making it effective. <persRef ref="hudson-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hudson</persRef>
							came and took a sitting for my portrait— It is so irksome, and so
							time-consuming, that he has agreed to reduce the sittings to one hour a
							day, and I have agreed to give him as many sittings as he shall desire.
							He improved the likeness very much this day. This afternoon <persRef ref="clay-cassius">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cassius M. Clay</persRef> came out from Boston, with
							M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> George T Bigelow, and <persRef ref="porter-elizabeth">Miss Porter</persRef>
							daughter of the late <persRef ref="porter-peter">General Peter B. Porter</persRef>, to visit us. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> C. M. Clay is a native of Kentucky, and
							within the last two years has acquired great celebrity by declaring the
							highest toned sentiments against Slavery— He has in numerous public
							speeches advocated the abolition of Slavery in that State; has raised
							against himself hosts of deadly enemies, and has been more than once
							hunted for assassination.— He has emancipated a number of his own
							slaves. Last winter he attended a meeting called by <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Colonel Johnson</persRef> to
							pass Resolutions for the annexation of Texas to the United States and he
							prevented the passage of the Resolutions He is now travelling about the
							Northern States, discoursing wherever he goes against Slavery, the Slave
							trade and the annexation of Texas. <persRef ref="clay-mary2">His wife</persRef> is with him, said to be a
							very fine woman; but has been taken ill in Boston, and could not come
							out with him this afternoon— He has made several speeches at Boston, and
							is said to be transcendently eloquent He told me that his speech to the
							Boston young men’s whig club, was reported in the Atlas of this morning;
							and requested me to read it and write to him at New-York my opinion of
							it. He also said that he had derived his principles in part from me—
							Charles here this evening.</p>

						<p>Sleepless Night— Its causes— Breakfast yesterday on Coffee; and a large
							cup of tea last evening. I must beware of evening tea. The third cause,
							anxiety for my task I cannot shake off— <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Loring</persRef> called this morning on his way from Hingham to Boston, and gave
							me a letter from <persRef ref="hilliard-francis">Francis Hilliard</persRef>, Chairman of the whig Committee of the
								8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District, inviting me
							to address my Constituents and the public, at such time and place as may
							be most convenient and agreeable to myself— This is a new burden which I
							must assume, and I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring to say
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hilliard that having promised to
							address the young men’s whig club at Boston next Monday week, I must ask
							for time to prepare for another address to my Constituents, probably
							till towards the close of the next month; and will answer his Letter in
							time to give ample notice to the people of the whole district of the
							time and place when and where I may address them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring inclined to Dorchester or Roxbury,
							and to the Evening rather than the day-time— He called again this
							afternoon on his return from Boston to Hingham. I had agreed with him to
							go upon a fishing excursion to Cohasset to morrow. But the weather was
							lowering, and we both expected foul weather to-morrow. We determined
							therefore to postpone indefinitely the party to Cohasset—especially as
							he says the Cod have forsaken the fishing grounds on the coast for the
							Season, and that there has been but one Cod in Boston market for the
							last ten days. <persRef ref="hudson-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hudson</persRef> came and took an
							hour sitting for my portrait— He is to come again on Friday— He inclines
							to take the hands, and we had a long consultation how to dispose of
							them— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> took his son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> again to Boston to attend school—
							He came out yesterday because it was holiday for a muster— And Charles
							remains in Boston over this Night— I wrote with great difficulty and a
							trembling hand—excessively hurried— In reviewing the Negotiations with
							Spain which terminated by the conclusion of the Florida Treaty, the
							subject spreads and widens under my hand— It goes back not only to the
							negotiation of the Louisiana Treaty in 1803. but to the suspension of
							the deposit at New-Orleans in 1802— To <persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">Thomas Pinckney’s</persRef> Treaty of 1795—
							To the Negotiations of <persRef ref="jay-john">John Jay</persRef> and <persRef ref="gardoqui-diego">Gardoqui</persRef> about the Navigation of the
							Mississippi in 1786.— And to the cobwebs spun by France and Spain during
							the war of our Revolution, to exclude us from the right of navigating
							the Mississippi, and from the country bordering on that river and its
							tributaries.— But I must stop far short of all this— I begin with <persRef ref="erving-george">G. W.
							Erving’s</persRef> Commission, full power and intructions as Minister to Spain in
							1816.—but must look back to the Negotiation of <persRef ref="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef> and Charles
							Pinckney with <persRef ref="cevallos-pedro">Don Pedro Cevallos</persRef> in 1805 and not wholly overlook the
							Louisiana Treaty purchase in 1803. I was most laboriously occupied upon
							this work till 10 O’Clock this evening and then went to bed, labouring
							with it in my head.</p>

						<p>There was some rain in the course of the last Night but it began in
							earnest about the hour of my rising, and continued without abatement
							till near Noon— It was well that we had agreed to postpone indefinitely
							our fishing party to Cohasset, and as I have promised to address two
							public meetings before the first of November, my anxiety to prepare for
							both of them becomes from day to day more and more intense. After all
							the trouble and pains I have taken to draw up an Address to my
							Constituents I find that it wants unity of subject, point, for
							impression, good humour to hit the fancy and secure the sympathy of the
							auditory, and pleasantly to amuse them— All these are essential to
							popular eloquence— There is nothing so fatal to the success of stump
							speaking as dulness— Tous les genres sont bons, hormis le genre
							ennuyeux— I have analysed the correspondence furnished in answer to the
							call moved by <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> in the House of Representatives on the
								29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April last, and every page of
							it furnishes pregnant evidence to refute the lies of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron Vail Brown</persRef>, <persRef ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef>, and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Jared Ingersoll</persRef>, every
							one of whom lies without remorse, but with variety of falsehood, which
							makes each of them an effective witness against all the others. But it
							will require extreme caution to compare and collate with one another all
							the documents heretofore published; the new ones recently produced and
							the false statements of each of the four false witnesses— And I never
							can be too much on my guard to avoid contesting any well attested
							statement, and to make none on my part susceptible of being disproved—
							We had visits this afternoon from <persRef ref="waterston-robert;quincy-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> R. C. Waterston</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> who had
							passed last Night in Boston to attend a supper party of the young men’s
							whig club, returned home this day, and spent the evening with us— He
							brought out the Boston Post of 25. March 1844. containing Andrew
							Jackson’s Letter to Aaron V. Brown of 12. Feb<hi rend="superscript"
								>y</hi> 1843. which he has borrowed from the files of the Boston
							Atlas. I have been for weeks wanting this paper without being able to
							find it; and I still want the Letter of Aaron V. Brown to the Editors of
							the Globe communicating Jackson’s Letter for publication— My Son brought
							me a declaration of <persRef ref="jennison-mary">Mary Jennison</persRef>, widow of <persRef ref="jennison-william">William Jennison</persRef>, an Officer
							of the Revolutionary War, and of the Boston Frigate in 1778. to obtain
							an increase of pension— He brought also a Letter from <persRef ref="amory-jonathan2">Jonathan Amory</persRef> of
							Roxbury, soliciting in case of a vacancy at West Point a warrant for his
							son <persRef ref="amory-thomas3">Thomas C. Amory</persRef> now at school under the charge of <persRef ref="leach-daniel">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Leach</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Amory encloses a certificate of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Leach to the moral character, intelligence and proficiency
							in study of the youth for whom the warrant is desired. These two
							subjects will require my attention at Washington next December.</p>

						<p>I have been desirous of staving off the making a fire in my writing
							chamber till the first of October; but have not succeeded— After losing
							one night’s sleep with cold feet, and losing hours of insomnolency
							before getting to sleep last Night, I gave up the struggle, and this
							morning lighted a fire in my chamber.— <persRef ref="hudson-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hudson</persRef> came and took another sitting for my portrait, which he has so
							much improved, that <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary;adams-mary4">the family</persRef> are all pleased with the likeness. The
							spy-glass in the hand will distinguish it from all other portraits of
							me. The Boston morning Post of 25. March last, which <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> brought out
							for me last evening enabled me to find this morning the Globe of 21.
							March 1844. upon the files which I had brought from Washington, and
							which I had not hitherto been able to find— It is better for my purpose
							than the Boston Post, because it contains the original publication by
							<persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron Vail Brown</persRef>, of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> Letter, and further, the Letter from
							Brown, to the Editors of the Globe, <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> and <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef>, enclosing Jackson’s
							Letter for publication. I have determined to make this the immediate and
							single subject of my Address to the young men’s whig club at Boston,
							next Monday week— First, for the vindication of my own character, from
							the vile Slanders, of Jackson, <persRef ref="rives-john">Erving</persRef>, Brown, and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
							Ingersoll</persRef>—and secondly, to expose to the world, and to after times the
							infamous means used to accomplish this annexation of Texas to the United
							States— How far this selection of my subject will be satisfactory to
							those whom I am to address; how far to the free people of this Union—how
							far I shall be able to enliven it with interest is a problem from which
							I would shrink if I could.— I have fearful odds to encounter; and little
							to encourage me—</p>
						<lg><l>Truths would you teach, and save a sinking land </l>
						<l>All fear, none aid you and few understand.</l></lg>
						<p>My Polar star must be my guide— The Florida Treaty was the most important
							incidents in my life; and the most successful Negotiation ever
							consummated by the Government of this Union— And this is precisely
							selected above all others as an engine for the total destruction of my
							good name and to charge me with treachery to my country and to my trust—
							I have long hesitated, not whether I should notice this conspiracy
							against me; but how, and when— I have taken time to look over the
							documents, and can wind the whole body of the conspirators round my
							fingers— My only danger, is of losing my vantage ground. I went up the
							hill at Sunset and was forthwith called back to see <persRef ref="foster-john">M<hi

						<p>The roaring of Nantasket beach was heard last Evening from our house, and
							this day we had a South-east storm of wind and rain which I found in
							full blast and shower when I rose, and continued till 3 in the
							afternoon, when it cleared off and the Sun flamed out for an hour or
							two, but went again into clouds.— <persRef ref="francis-convers">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Francis</persRef>, Parkman Professor of Pulpit eloquence and the Pastoral Care at
							the Harvard University preached for <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							this morning from Ephesians 4.13 “Till we all come in the unity of the
							faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
							the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.” The text and the
							discourse had an aspect of affinity with the Professor’s chair It was
							liberal and anti-sectarian, holding up the Christian Religion as a
							system of great and all comprehensive purpose bearing upon the condition
							and happiness of all men; and that it could not possibly contracted into
							the narrow compass of such questions as whether a little more or a
							little less water should be used in administering the rite of
							baptism—whether the operation of the spirit was instantaneous or
							gradual; whether fashions of dress or modes of conversation should be
							reduced to articles of faith; all seeming to belong to the childhood
							than to the mature age of human existence, all more suited to the
							imperfect growth, than to the measure of the stature of the fulness of
							Christ— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis dined with us. his
							afternoon Sermon was from Acts 15.9. “purifying their hearts by faith”—
							There was something of a disquisition upon the nature of Faith, upon
							which I some years since delivered at several places a Lecture, but he
							did not mark the distinction between the faith which is confidence in
							others and that which is fidelity to a trust— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Francis was several years minister of a congregational
							church at Watertown, and bears the reputation of standing high in the
							class of our clergymen of the middle age— He has none of the graces of
							delivery, nor brilliancy of composition which are the appendages of
							Pulpit eloquence— His genius is solid rather than sparkling— I could not
							give this day that attention to his discourses which their intrinsic
							merit should have commanded. I was too much absorbed in preparations for
							my self defence, before the Boston young men’s whig club, of Monday 7.
