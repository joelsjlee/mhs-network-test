                        <list><item>Hale Joseph M.</item></list>
                        <p><persRef ref="hale-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hale</persRef> came as an agent to solicit a
                            contribution for a private establishment for the support and disposal of
                            poor orphan children— It was devised and is maintained by <persRef ref="fellows-anstrice;fellows-eunice">Misses A. and
                            E. C. Fellows</persRef> in Boston, who publish a quarto periodical journal, styled
                            the Social Monitor and Orphan’s Advocate in Monthly numbers, one of
                            which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hale left with me. He says he was
                            himself an orphan, supported and educated by these persons. Their plan
                            is to withdraw from the poor houses of the country towns such orphan
                            poor as they can find opportunity to provide for by placing them in
                            families where care is taken to educate and maintain them— This is the
                            day of the Anniversary celebration at Hingham— This day the Steam ship
                            Caledonia <persRef ref="fellows-eunice">Captain Lott</persRef>, arrived at Boston from Liverpool and Halifax in
                            12 1/2 days with 92 passengers. And the Steamship Hibernia <persRef ref="ryrie-alexander">Captain
                            Ryrie</persRef>, sailed from Boston for Halifax and Liverpool— One calendar month
                            now suffices for writing to London and receiving an answer— I finished
                            reading <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay’s</persRef> Article on <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef>, which I have read with pleasure,
                            but which has kindled my thirst to see and compare <persRef ref="montagu-basil">Montagu’s</persRef> edition of
                            his works with that of <persRef ref="mallet-david">Mallet</persRef> which I possess.— and particularly to read
                            Montagu’s life of the compound of Angel and Fiend Francis Bacon—
                            Macaulay judges him with a mixture of excessive rigour and of extreme
                            admiration and kindness. There is a natural alliance between admiration
                            and love—and a natural affinity between contempt and hatred— But between
                            admiration and hatred there is none; and between Love and contempt there
                            may be an easy transition but no union. Macaulay’s estimate of Bacon’s
                            philosophical system and discoveries appear to me to be greatly
                            exaggerated, and his condemnation of the Grecian Philosophy much too
                            broad and universal.— The Stoic, Epicurean, and Platonic philosophies
                            were as full of practical good as the novum organum. When <persRef ref="pythagoras">Pythagoras</persRef>
                            sacrificed a hecatomb, for having discovered the relative measure of the
                            right angle and the hypothenuse, it was not the mathematical abstraction
                            that caused his joy.— When <persRef ref="archimedes">Archimedes</persRef> said to <persRef ref="hieron-ii">Hiero</persRef> give me a stand I
                            will move the earth, it was not a barren problem of mechanics of which
                            he boasted. The sayings of the wise men—the golden verses—the inductive
                            reasoning of <persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef> were all eminently practical and useful— Bacon
                            proposed a new method of study, and disparaged too much that which
                            preceded him. While I have been reading Macaulay Bacon himself slumbers.
                            I have fallen into idle habits— I rise about 4. Wash, scrub and curry
                            one hour—read first permanent matter—then Newspapers and pamphlets which
                            come by Mail— Journalize 3 hours—searching for papers at intervals till
                            2. dine. Afternoon Siesta two hours— Yawn, and range about the house and
                            garden till Sunset— Tea— Evening with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my family</persRef>.</p>

                            went this morning on a fishing party to Cohasset— They returned before

                            dinner— I declined though with a very strong inclination to accept— And
                            I wrote to <persRef ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Fuller</persRef>, Administrator
                            of the Estate of <persRef ref="gill-moses2">Moses Gill</persRef>; requesting him to transfer to the Executors
                            of the Will and Trustees of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>, seven shares of the
                            stock of the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States, of the 25 which I
                            transferred to him last April. A great part of this day was absorbed in
                            looking up loose pamphlet documents of which I have immense multitudes
                            in such disorder and confusion that whenever I want any one of them it
                            is like seeking one grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff—a desolating
                            search three times out of four terminating in disappointments, and loss
                            of the time.— With the design of answering <persRef ref="whitney-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> William Wallace Whitney’s</persRef> Letter, I recurred to my Address
                            to my Constituents at Braintree on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                            of September 1842— I soon found the passage containing the statements
                            and opinions which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney requests me to
                            reconsider— It was the charge that in 1836. <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> expressly
                            authorised <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef> to invade the Mexican territory—and take post
                            at Nacogdoches which he did.— I find throughout the whole passage no
                            charge against General Gaines, but I did not state in my address, the
                            equivocating disavowal by Jackson in <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary Forsyth’s</persRef> Letter to the
                            <persRef ref="gorostiza-manuel">Mexican Minister Gorostiza</persRef> of 10. May 1836. of Gaines’s actual
                            occupation of Nacogdoches. Of that disavowal M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Whitney takes no notice in his Letter to <persRef ref="bryant-william">Bryant</persRef> Editor of
                            the New-York Evening Post—a disingenuous omission which must not be
                            suffered to pass without exposure— But for that purpose I must review
                            the whole series of transactions of that period, and especially the
                            whole controversy respecting the Gorostiza pamphlet— In this pursuit I
                            passed from my Address at Braintree, to my fragme<unclear>nt</unclear> speech of June and
                            July 1838. where I charged upon Jackson’s administration these
                            escroceries of his conduct towards Mexico, and once engaged in the
                            reperusal of that Speech the leisure of the day was consumed— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi

                        <p>Communion day. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef> morning text was
                            from 1. Peter 3. [“]For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the
                            just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death
                            in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 19 by which also he went and
                            preached unto the spirits in prison.” It was a discourse preparatory to
                            the administration of the communion— The verse immediately preceding the
                            text says “For, it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer
                            for well-doing than for evil-doing.” an admirable principle of morals,
                            and well deserving to be itself the text of a whole sermon— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt said that the <persRef ref="peter">Apostle Peter</persRef> must have
                            had an acute sense of the difference between these two modes of
                            suffering— He had suffered for evil-doing, when he forsook his lord and
                            Master in the last scene of his life; and he was to suffer for
                            well-doing, when he died a martyr to the Christian cause— There is
                            something obscure, and which seems to require explanation in the
                            assertion that Christ after his crucifixion went and preached unto the
                            Spirits in prison— The main argument of the epistle is an earnest
                            exhortation to all the disciples of Christ to follow his example by
                            suffering, not only without swerving from the path of righteousness, but
                            by persevering in that of active beneficence. In the administration of
                            the Communion an affecting incident occurred by the appearances of the
                            two new Deacons to distribute the bread and wine in the place of the two
                            who for several years past had performed that service—<persRef ref="savil-samuel">Savil</persRef> and <persRef ref="spear-william">William
                            Spear</persRef>— After the Meeting I began to walk home, but was overtaken by a
                            sudden shower of which the water fell in a flood, and I was driven to
                            take refuge in the carriage which was taking home <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>. Even that barely saved me from a
                            drenching.— <persRef ref="bigelow-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> handed me as we were
                            coming out of the Temple a very urgent invitation from <persRef ref="chapman-jonathan">Jonathan Chapman</persRef>
                            Chairman of the Whig State central Committee, to attend and preside at a
                            Mass Convention of the Whigs of Massachusetts upon Boston Common, on
                            Thursday the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September next, and
                            said he would call on me for an answer this evening— I attended meeting
                            this afternoon alone— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts text was from
                            2. Corinthians 7.1. the last line of the verse—“perfecting holiness in
                            the fear of God.” The doctrine of the discourse was that the fear of
                            God, that is Religion is the exclusive and only foundation of perfect
                            virtue; a principle which I hold to be certain though perfect virtue
                            does not always follow from religious faith. This Sermon was well
                            written, well reasoned, and well delivered. I preferred it to the one of
                            the morning. The fear of God is the sum total of the Old Testament— The
                            immortality of the Soul is the vital essence of the New— From these two
                            articles of faith necessarily follows the responsibility of Man, the
                            only guarantee of human virtue. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi

                            left us this morning, to return to the city of New-York, where he
                            resides, and is a practising lawyer— He was born 30 July 1817. at Utica,
                            and was educated at Yale College (See my diary of 1. June 1830. Vol. 10.
                            p. 466.) The <persRef ref="storrs-richard">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Storrs</persRef> of Braintree paid us a morning visit with <persRef ref="storrs-anne">his wife</persRef>
                            and sister— I called at the Quincy stone bank, and deposited there 20
                            Eagles and 20 half Eagles which I had received at the Bank of the
                            Metropolis at Washington—reflecting that a deposit there of gold coin,
                            is far safer than in my own house. After dinner, <persRef ref="warren-george3">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            hoped to be spared the annoyance of these applications by my card in the
                            National Intelligencer of<space/>July last, but they are more numerous than
                            ever. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren that I could make no
                            engagement, but would deliver a Lecture if I should find it in my power—

                            also here—and I promised to go with him to a fishing party at Cohasset,
                            on Thursday of next week— Three times this afternoon I sat down to
                            continue writing my proposed address to my Constituents—and wrote not
                            more than five lines— Read not a single concerted or solitary experiment
                            of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> Natural History, nor one page of <persRef ref="">Macaulay’s</persRef> Miscellaneous
                            articles from the Edinburgh Review— Great part of the day was consumed
                            in overhauling my pamplets putting them into confusion worse confounded,
                            and hunting up 25 of my own composition of which I made a parcel and
                            gave it to Alexander S. Johnson— I made out last summer a list of 72
                            Miscellanies in print by me, which on looking over now I find very
                            deficient.— In American State Papers collected by <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef> and <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clark</persRef> and
                            published by <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> in 21 volumes folio, the first four
                            contain the Documents relating to foreign Affairs, and of these there
                            are in the fourth volume many written by me— My hand is in almost every
                            collection of the Session of Congress documents from year to year for
                            the last 30 years, and not unfrequently before— I rise so early that in
                            reading or writing I find myself oppressed by drowsiness, and compelled
                            to quit my table for more stirring occupation— I then begin to ransack
                            my old papers, which wakes me up, but consumes my time, and dissipates
                            my thoughts. I have also resorted to the practice of taking a Siesta
                            after dinner which makes up for the shortness of my sleeping hours at
                            Night. But it is a subtle thief of Life.</p>

                            <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house—not quite clear, but so that I could mark the first beam
                            of his appearance above the horizon.— I filled earthen pot N. 3. with
                            earth and planted in it 3. Washington red plumstones; as I had done in
                            each of the other two— I took other morning exercise of an hour, my
                            health recreation and apology for wasted time— There are four stocks,
                            budded last Summer by <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E Price Greenleaf</persRef>, 3 apple and one Pear, which
                            have put forth shoots, the pear 3 feet 9 inches—the apple in front of my
                            study window 2. feet—that in <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny’s</persRef> plat 28 inches—that in <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
                            Louisa’s</persRef> plat 21 inches— The stalks of all the apples stunted by the
                            congregaiton of green aphides and black ants. There are seven shag-bark
                            walnuts up in the bed behind the tool box up, from my last fall’s

                            returned the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> volum of my miscellanies
                            which I have given to my grand daughter Mary Louisa— He told me he had
                            been pleased with my essay on the character of <persRef ref="desdemona">Desdemona</persRef>, but did not
                            concur with my opinion of her— I asked him on what point he differed.—
                            He said on the point that the colour of Othello constitutes the Tragedy,
                            and on my rigorous estimate of the character of Desdemona— But he was
                            not disposed to discuss, and I did not press for it— He said there was a
                            man at work in the graveyard engraving on the ministerial monument the
                            name of <persRef ref="quincy-anne">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Anna Fiske</persRef> second wife of the
                            <persRef ref="fiske-moses">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Moses Fiske</persRef>, and before that,
                            widow of <persRef ref="quincy-daniel">Daniel Quincy</persRef>, and mother of <persRef ref="quincy-john">John Quincy</persRef> whose name I bear— She
                            was my great-great-grand-mother—my trisayenle, and I revere her memory
                            as if she were mother. That she was buried in this Tomb, is ascertained
                            by an extract from <persRef ref="marshall-john3">Fairfields</persRef> Journal quoted in M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lunt’s two centennial Discourses— M<hi rend="superscript"

                            me, requesting me to revise and correct it— This has stimulated me to
                            re-examine the immense mass of my pamphlets and old Congressional
                            documents which appals me as I proceed. <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> offers to assist
                            me and this day we made some progress, but a whole month will not
                            suffice for the task. I this day found at last the collections which I
                            had made last Summer, and preceding Seasons, of my own miscellanies, to
                            give to my son, and others of my relatives and friends— That for my Son
                            contains a number sufficient to make four large volumes for binding—and
                            there are scattered about in newspapers and other public journals an
                            ample number to make up four volumes more; besides manuscripts
                            numberless. I received this day Letters from <persRef ref="seward-william">William H. Seward</persRef> and

                        <p>Sun rose 5. Set 7.10 beclouded </p>
                        <p>I awake now habitually before the Clock in our entry strikes 3. and
                            cannot sleep again— I lay an hour more or less and rise with the first
                            glimpse of twilight. At this when the sky is clear, I see every night
                            just before going to bed between 10. and 11. the planet Jupiter rise in
                            the North east, about the extremest Northern declination of the Sun; and
                            at half past 3. in the morning. Venus rises nearly at the same point— It
                            seems as if it were the same star night and morning; fixed in the
                            heavens, with unceasing and unfading splendor. I suppose that not one
                            person in a thousand would understand me should I say that this incident
                            has given and continues to give me a transient sensation of pleasure. I
                            resumed the practice of allowing two hours of morning exercise, devoted
                            to my seedling trees. I planted two Washington plum stones in a plat in
                            the Seminary, next the Barn fence, and covered them with an inverted
                            earthen flower pot, bottom broken off. The summer house cellar was
                            choked up with weeds, from 3. to 5. feet high. I plucked and hoed them
                            up; and disclosed 2 seedling shagbark trees, up from last years nuts of
                            the old adjoining tree— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Beale</persRef>

                        <p>My morning exercise encroaches already upon my hours for labour, and the
                            search for old documents and pamphlets absorbs time beyond all
                            computation— I worked this morning upon an old Apple tree in the alley

                            returned home to dine— <persRef ref="cummings-charles">Charles A. Cummings</persRef>, heretofore a School-teacher,
                            and in 1840 Selectman of Quincy, a fierce democrat called on me this
                            morning with a <persRef ref="cummings-charles">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Goodrich</persRef> a Minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church to
                            solicit a subscription for building a new church of that denomination in
                            this town— There is already a church of the same denomination near
                            Quincy point— <persRef ref="goodrich-nelson">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goodrich</persRef> belongs to the
                            Providence Conference, and the town of Quincy falls within that
                            jurisdiction. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goodrich was appointed by
                            the Conference to preach here, but the proprietor, of the church or of
                            the pews refused to receive him, and will not permit him to occupy the
                            Church. And so M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cummings gets up a
                            contribution to build another— I declined on the ground that this was a
                            family quarrel, with which Strangers should not interfere, but which the
                            parties should settle by amicable consultation, or by appeal to the Laws
                            of the Land.— They said they supposed that the right of possession of
                            the Church must ultimately be decided by a suit at Law, and they would
                            have to commence an action— But that would necessarily consume a year,
                            and perhaps two before the final decision, and in the mean time, they
                            had no place where they could perform their devotions— I persevered in
                            declining the contribution A man by the name of <persRef ref="green-horatio">Horatio Green</persRef>, an
                            itinerant Cabinet maker traveling about the Country in search of work
                            came to see me for the mere sake of curiosity, because he makes it a
                            practice to go and see all the great men whenever they fall in his way.—
                            He made some slight apology for intrusion, but gave me to understand
                            that he considered it a clear right for any labourer to visit all the
                            great men, and talk politics with them ad libitum.— He entered
                            accordingly, upon the Tariff and the Bank and Texas and <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef>, the
                            burden of all which was that the whole burden of taxation ought to be
                            brought to bear, upon the wealthy; and that the labourer ought to have
                            light work and heavy wages.— This is genuine democracy, and the
                            universal feeling of the masses— The rest of the day was swallowed up in
                            unpacking the three chests of books and papers which came round by Sea
                            from Washington, and in which with a fresh multitude of documents to
                            assort, I miss two or three articles indispensable to complete sets.</p>

                        <p><persRef ref="young-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young</persRef>, pastor of the New South Church
                            Boston, exchanged this day with <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>, and
                            preached this morning from Psalm 4:6. “There be many that say, who will
                            shew us any good?”— He observed that it was considered as evidence of a
                            discontented and complaining spirit in those who were apt to indulge
                            themselves with this question— As if they felt the gift of life as a
                            burden, and not a blessing. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young took
                            only this clause of the verse for his text— The first Sermon of <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne</persRef>
                            published under the name of <persRef ref="parsonyorick">Yorick</persRef>, is on this subject; but he adds to
                            the text the latter clause of the verse— “Lord, lift thou up the light
                            of thy countenance upon us.”— Sterne begins by a general assertion of a
                            propensity in mankind to search for happiness—which position he
                            diversifies, by reference to the modifications of the pursuit, by men in
                            the several conditions of life— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young
                            dwelt on the unreasonableness and ingratitude of repining at the
                            allotments of life, and enumerated the sources of enjoyment common to
                            all men— He argued much on the theory of the optimist school, and
                            insisted that many of the incidents which are dreaded as evils turn out
                            to be blessings in disguise— Sterne’s argument is that all the usual
                            pursuits of happiness terminate in disappointment— Both come to the same
                            conclusion, that the real good, the consummate enjoyment of human life
                            can be found only in religion.— The second part of the verse, omitted by
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young, but included in Sterne’s text
                            is exceedingly appropriate to that argument. M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Young came home with me, and dined with us. I mentioned
                            Sterne’s sermon to him; but he did not seem to be acquainted with it. He
                            did not howeve say that he had never seen it— His text in the afternoon
                            was Proverbs 13.11. “Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he
                            that gathereth by labour shall increase.” This is an aphorism of private
                            morality, not in the form of a precept but a statement of cause and
                            effect—invariable as the laws of physical Nature. three thousand years
                            ago, the experience of mankind had proved uniformly so, and <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> made
                            a proverb of it— Wealth gotten by Vanity— The words Vanity—and
                            diminished, are to be noted for their significancy— The French Genevan
                            translation, instead of Vanity, uses Fraud— <persRef ref="thomson-charles">Charles Thomson</persRef> has
                            “injustice.”— The term Vanity is more comprehensive and includes wealth
                            acquired suddenly—by chance, by gaming—by any other mode than laborious
                            Industry; and the experience of mankind still after the lapse of thirty
                            centuries witnesses the same results. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            the title of Count, which he said was as common in some parts of Europe,

                            had shaken him most cordially by the hand. He was much inclined to talk
                            politics—said he was of the Liberty party—asked me, if <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi

                            Green was not there, and his journeyman had been only a short time at
                            the Office and knew nothing about it— Then I looked in at the Office of
                            the Quincy Aurora, to enquire if <persRef ref="clapp-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clapp</persRef>

                            called a Journal, a sort of mystical narrative of incidents of daily

                            compilation of recipes, or quack medicines. It is hard to read, and must
                            be taken in broken doses. I strongly suspect that the results of Many of
                            the experiments are fallacious. <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.

                        <p>Last night just before going to bed, returning in the dark to the house,
                            ascending the rough hewn stone steps of the eastern back-door, I lost my
                            balance and fell backwards, stricking the ground just below the right
                            knee, and spraining the cord of the leg.— A repetition of the
                            Jersey-city disaster—though of a milder type— I bathed the part where
                            the skin was broken with vinegar and pasted over it a piece of brown
                            paper steeped in vinegar, tied round with my cravat to keep it on
                            overnight— This morning the paper stuck to the wounded spot like
                            court-plaister— I took off the cravat, and left the paper adhesive. I
                            medicated my old Apple-tree; and hoed up and manured my Nursery seedling
                            plats to the end of my two hours, but felt the sprain of my right leg as
                            a warning to suspend for a time that part of my labours— <persRef ref="sampson-rachel">Miss Samson</persRef> the

                            nor taking any advice till yesterday after breakfast, when able to

                            a specific offer for it— I told him he must do both, and he said he
                            would— <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C. Brooks</persRef> came out from

                            calling up the shadows of departed years— We took a walk towards Sunset,
                            around <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> hill, and looked at the Boston State-house, the Bunker

                            Evening at home— I found the Volume of the Journal of U.S. House of

                            abridges my slumbers— I perceived that I must renounce the project of
                            going to the fishing party to Cohasset to-morrow—and wrote a note to

                            they are building opposite the Stone Temple— The fourth of the pilasters
                            was at the hall about to be raised— One of the workmen said it took

                            were obliged to hasten home, which we reached just in time to escape a
                            heavy shower of rain— I found the sinews of my right leg so much
                            strained that I walked with difficulty and pain. <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> and I
                            dined again at my Son’s with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks and
                            <persRef ref="phillips-susan">Miss Phillips</persRef>. After dinner <persRef ref="minot-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
                                Minot</persRef>, and <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P. Davis</persRef> came out from Boston; and finding I was not at
                            home, joined us at Charles’s, where they took tea and returned to
                            Boston— I spent the evening with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks
                            at my Son’s— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Minot spoke of a Speech of
                            <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef> at Boonville, published in the National Intelligencer
                            of last Monday—his last blast against the annexation Treaty— And I. P.
                            Davis told me that <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler’s</persRef> Madisonian had a violent attack upon me for
                            my Letter to <persRef ref="thaxter-anna">Miss Anna Quincy Thaxter</persRef>, which it calls a Letter to Miss
                            Anna Thayer— <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> and <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> at Springfield, took the proper tone
                            for treating the Texas plot— I wrote the Letter to Miss Thaxter
                            expressly to raise a blister— It is becoming public—but has been printed
                            only in the Atlas of all the Boston Newspapers My time is yet most
                            distressingly absorbed— I finished reading the second and began the
                            third century of Bacon’s Sylva Sylvarum.— The two Books consist of
                            experiments upon music and the motions of Sounds— It is more than half a
                            century since I first read Bacon’s Essays— Would that I had then read
                            three times over all his works. I might then have derived great benefit
                            from them; for the Essays were not barren. But now—all reading to me is
                            percolation—or Sound.</p>

                        <p>My rustic labours, and my sallying forth to see the Sun-rise are
                            indefinitely postponed by the disability of my crippled limbs. <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi

                            Boston, with his Son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> to have him entered as a scholar at the
                            Latin town School, which he did after a sharp examination— The term of
                            study, is of five years, of preparation to enter the University.— May I
                            implore a blessing upon this event—and for this boy? How much of Hope
                            and how much of Fear mingles in every glance at the future— The Soul
                            must rely upon him whose tender mercies are over all his works— Shortly
                            after breakfast <persRef ref="adams-john17">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef> came in from
                            Hingham to enquire what had become of me. He had not received the note
                            which I had sent yesterday morning with entire confidence that he would
                            receive it before Noon. After waiting for me this morning nearly two
                            hours, he came to see if some disaster had befallen me— I told him of my
                            second accident and regretted his disappointment and my own. He urged me
                            to come over to the dinner, or to the evening tea-party; but I thought
                            it most prudent to decline.— Towards evening, <persRef ref="codman-john">D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Codman</persRef> came in with <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, returning from the Cohasset
                            fishing party— The day he said had been fine, but the fishing not very
                            successful— They had only caught about 50 haddock— No Cod.— <persRef ref="tufts-susannah">Miss Susan
                            Tufts</persRef> paid us also an afternoon visit. She was of the Weymouth Committee
                            appointed to confer with me about the fitting up of the parish cemetery.
                            She had declined to come over with <persRef ref="white-enos">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Enos
                            White</persRef>, but she now came by herself, and intimated what she supposed was
                            desired, and perhaps expected of me.— <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph;grinnell-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
                                M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grinnell</persRef> of New Bedford also paid us
                            a visit; returning from an excursion to Saratoga Springs which they left
                            the day before yesterday morning.— I rode this afternoon with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.

                            chastised pleasure in visiting once at least every year— Finished
                            reading the third Century of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> Sylva Sylvarum. “We have laboured,
                            as may appear in this inquisition of sounds diligently: both because
                            sound is one of the most hidden portions of nature, as we said in the
                            beginning, and because it is a virtue which may be called incorporeal
                            and immateriate: whereof there be in nature but few. Besides we were
                            willing, now, in these our first centuries, to make a pattern or
                            precedent, of an exact inquisition; and we shall do the like, hereafter,
                            in some other subjects which require it. For we desire that men should
                            learn, and perceive how severe a thing the true inquisition of nature
                            is; and should accustom themselves by the light of particulars to
                            enlarge their minds to the amplitude of the world, and not reduce the
                            world to the narrowness of their minds.[”]</p>

                        <p><persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> still continues confined to her bed; and I am yet a cripple. My only

                            set—but he went down in a thick cloud and disappointed me. But the day
                            was fully occupied. I resumed the writing of an Address to my
                            Constituents one daily page of which with one of Diary is all that I can
                            accomplish— Charles brought me a bond to execute with him as his surety;
                            to the <persRef ref="phillips-willard">judge of probate for the County of Suffolk</persRef>, with a penalty of
                            sixty thousand dollars, as trustee by the Will of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Thomas B. Johnson</persRef> for
                            the annuities to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;frye-carolina;boyd-harriet;hellen-adelaide;smith-catherine-johnson">his Sisters</persRef>; which I signed, requesting Charles to
                            furnish me, with a copy of it— I read the fourth century of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef>
                            experiments in consort and experiments solitary of the Sylva Sylvarum—
                            This century is upon acceleration—and begins with Experiments in
                            consort, touching the clarification of liquors and the accelerating
                            thereof— “Acceleration of time, in works of Nature, may well be esteemed
                            inter Magnalia naturae. And even in divine miracles, accelerating of the
                            time is next to the creating of the matter”— This observation introduces
                            the book one remarkable feature of which is that it accredits the
                            Alchemist fable of transmuting metals into gold N 326. is an experiment
                            solitary touching the making of gold— He says, “by occasion of handling
                            the axioms touching maturation, we will direct a trial, touching the
                            maturing of metals, and thereby turning some of them into gold; for we
                            conceive indeed, that a perfect good concoction, or digestion, or
                            maturation of some metals. will produce gold[”]— 328. is an experiment
                            solitary touching the nature of gold.— “Gold hath these natures;
                            greatness of weight; closeness of parts, fixation; pliantness or
                            softness; immunity from rust, colour or tincture of yellow. Therefore
                            the sure way, though most about to make gold, is to know the causes of
                            the several natures before rehearsed, and the axioms concerning the
                            same. For if a man can make a metal that hath all these properties, let
                            men dispute whether it be gold or no?[”]— There is also in this book an
                            Experiment solitary touching chameleons. 360— [“]They have a foolish
                            tradition in magic, that if a chameleon be burnt upon the top of an
                            house, it will raise a tempest: supposing, according to their vain
                            dreams of sympathies, because he nourisheth with air, his body should
                            have great virtue to make impression upon the air.” Was it worth while
                            to record such experiments as that?— Again. 399. [“]The heat of the Sun
                            maketh men black in some Countries, as in Æthiopia and Guiney &amp;c.
                            Fire doth it not, as we see in glass men that are continually about the
                            fire”— And read the rest of this precious experiment. By way of relief,
                            I read <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay’s</persRef> Review of <persRef ref="croker-john">Croker’s</persRef> Edition, of <persRef ref="boswell-james">Boswell’s</persRef> life of

                        <p>I ventured out this morning to see the Sunrise, and visit my seedling
                            trees.— But the scraping of the skin under my knee was not healed, and
                            in the course of the day became some what inflamed, and the leg swollen.
                            A small plaister of diaculum salve applied this afternoon covered the
                            wound and allayed the inflammation— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> took his son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John</persRef> to Boston,

                            The day was oppressively warm, and I sought refuge from dejection of
                            spirits in reading <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> fifth century of experiments, and <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay’s</persRef>

                            of Dedham, laden with enquiries about the claims of <persRef ref="dunbar-amasa">Amasa Dunbar</persRef>, and
                            <persRef ref="barron-william3">William Barron</persRef>, of which I could give him but an indifferent account.— I
                            recurred to the House Journal of the last Session, and found the case of
                            Amasa Dunbar, first referred to the Committee of Revolutionary pensions,
                            and then a report by <persRef ref="rathbun-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rathbun</persRef>, moving the
                            discharge of the Committee from the further consideration of this and
                            sundry other claims, and the papers laid on the table. Of the case of
                            William Barron I could give him no account, but that the Committee had
                            reported against it— I mark these cases in the margin to be remembered
                            at the next Session, if my life and health are spared to be there. For
                            the continuous remembrance of the course of private claims and petitions
                            is among the most arduous and burdensome duties of the public service.
                            Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent the evening here— The fifth century of
                            experiments is an enquiry of plants or vegetables—of excellent and
                            general use for food, medicine, and a number of mechanical arts—
                            Acceleration of germination putting back or retardation of germination—
                            Melioration of fruits, trees and plants. Compound fruits and flowers.—
                            Sympathy and antipathy of plants; and making herbs and fruits
                            medicinable, are the titles of the experiments, all in consort of this
                            century. Many of them may be made useful; but many of them are
                            experiments to be made; and I have neither the time, the materials nor
                            the talent to make them. Some are given, with doubt or denial of the
                            result; and the assignment of causes seldom is satisfactory.— Frequent
                            reference is made to what he calls the spirits of plants trees and
                            flowers, and heat and cold, and moist and dry, and harsh and soft are
                            attributed to them as vital properties— I am puzzled with the multitude
                            of specific names of fruits and flowers and plants which I never knew,
                            or have totally forgotten. The same remarks are applicable to the
                            musical instruments and technical musical terms of preceding centuries.

                            Hampden is the fierce Republican Spirit in which it is written— The
                            reverential and apologetic tone in behalf of the republican cause, and
                            the bitterness of invectives against <persRef ref="james-i">James</persRef> and <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="laud-william">Laud</persRef>, and

                        <p>The wound below my knee continues to fester and inflame The tendon of my
                            right leg is yet sore and painful and a discolouring of extravasated
                            blood appears below the outer ankle bone.— I was obliged to ride to and
                            from meeting both morning and afternoon, and walking was more painful to
                            me than it had yet been. On going to bed this evening I resolved to try

                            large, and officiates at the Pitts Street Chapel in Boston. He exchanged
                            this day with <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>, and preached this
                            morning from Matthew 24.12. “And because iniquity shall abound the love
                            of many shall wax cold.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterston is a
                            young man, warm hearted, and enthusiastic in the cause of evangelical
                            religion and of his Country.— The text is part of the chapter in which
                            Jesus shortly before his crucifixion prepared his disciples for the
                            persecutions and sufferings which they were to endure for the preaching
                            of the gospel— He foretold the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem—
                            He gives warning to the disciples that there shall be Wars and rumours
                            of wars—that Nations shall rise up against Nation, and kingdom against
                            kingdom.— That they the disciples shall be delivered up to be afflicted,
                            and be killed, and be hated of all nations for his name’s sake—that many
                            should be offended, and betray one another, and hate one another— And
                            for all this he adds because iniquity shall abound, the love of many
                            shall wax cold—but then he adds—he that shall endure unto the end, shall
                            be saved— And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
                            world for a witness unto all Nations: and then shall the end come.— The
                            prediction has been verified in all its parts except the coming of the
                            end, which is not yet consummated. The gospel is not yet consummated—
                            Even yet iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxes cold.— The sincere
                            and righteous Christian suffers not his love to wax cold—he sees
                            iniquity abound, and some betray, and some desert and some wax cold— The
                            voice of the Saviour has told him that the end shall come, and what end
                            shall be.— The Christian waits in fervent faith and humble hope, and all
                            embracing Charity, for the universal emancipation of the race, ready to
                            promote it to the utmost of his power: and knowing if it must be
                            atchieved through blood and slaughter and exterminating War, it will be
                            because the Supreme Ruler of the world shall have ordained that so it
                            shall be.— After dinner M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterstons text
                            was Exodus 14.15. “And the Lord said unto <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, wherefore criest thou
                            unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward.” A
                            brief reference to the condition of the children of Israel, at the time
                            when this injunction was laid upon them introduced a parallel between
                            their undertaking and the burden upon the Soul of the Christian at this
                            day—and he impressively exhorted his hearers, not only to be solicitous
                            of sound opinions and virtuous principles, but to follow them up by
                            going forward— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            and before whom a splendid speech was delivered by the <persRef ref="choate-rufus">Senator Rufus
                            Choate</persRef>— I read yesterday the sixth and this morning the seventh century
                            of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> Sylva Sylvarum. They chiefly consist of experiments upon
                            plants and trees—roots, leaves, flowers fruits, trunk and boughs,
                            germination, growth and decay.— The experiments record many of the
                            wonderful phenomena of vegetation— I ought to derive great store of
                            knowledge from these experiments, many of which form part of the history
                            of my seedling trees— But I have lost much of my memory, especially,
                            relating to philosophical enquiry, and the multitude of experiments
                            disables for the intimate remembrance of any.— I fasten only upon the
                            passages where he explains his own systems; as in closing his enquiries

                            of plants, and their virtues to herbalists, and other like books of
                            natural history; wherein men’s diligence hath been great, even to
                            curiosity; for our experiments are only such, as do ever ascend a degree
                            to the deriving of causes, and extracting of axioms, which we are not
                            ignorant, but that some both of the ancient and modern writers have also
                            laboured; but their causes and axioms are so full of imagination, and so
                            infected with the old received theories, as they are mere inquisitions
                            of experience, and concoct it not.” Now as to his investigation of
                            causes, he explains all the arcana of vegetation, by a movement of
                            Spirits; which he attributes to all vegetable as well as to all animal
                            nature—and the properties of all trees and plants are under the dominion
                            of Spirits, not less than Men and women— But what are these Spirits of

                            he says is much more than it is worth— I told him I would go and see the

                            that it would then not be worth while for me to go and look at it.— The

                            dinner— After which I resorted to the couch for half an hour, but
                            without repose— I then attempted to read <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay’s</persRef> Review of <persRef ref="stanhope-philip2">Lord
                            Mahon’s</persRef> History of the War of the succession in Spain, but soon found I
                            was reading to no purpose— Taking no interest in what I read—dragging
                            heavily along from page to page and dosing over them all.— So I rode out
                            in the Barouche with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Charles Adams</persRef>— She alighted to pay a visit to <persRef ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >rs</hi> Lunt</persRef>—we drove by the new road through Copeland street to
                            Braintree, and returning over Penn’s hill took up again M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles and came home by Willard Street,
                            and the Railway quarries. The ride was pleasant, but the afternoon was
                            gone, and I had not written a line upon my task— And so passes day after
                            day— I had read in the morning the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            Century of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> Sylva Sylvarum— These experiments are miscellaneous—
                            <persRef ref="rawley-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rawley</persRef> in his preface says that he
                            who reads them attentively will find in them a secret order— But he says
                            also that Lord Bacon himself said he had collected them without
                            methodical order, to induce other men to do the same— This century
                            begins with an experiment touching veins of medicinal earth— The next
                            upon the growth of sponges—then upon sea-fish put in fresh waters—
                            Drinks in Turkey— Sweat—and the glow-worm follow in succession. Where is
                            the secret order between these? The experiments in consort touching the
                            impressions, which the passions of the mind make upon the body are
                            deeply interesting; but Caterpillars, Cantharides, Lassitude; is it not
                            ludicrous to grope for a secret order of succession upon topics such as
                            these?</p>

                        <p>The transition from Summer heat to autumnal cold took place with unusual
                            force in the course of the last Night. It occurs simultaneously with the
                            real close of the dog days—that is with the first morning appearance of
                            Sirius, after his conjunction with the Sun. I have not been able to
                            ascertain this to a day by observation for want of a succession of clear
                            mornings at the time of the transition; but I have no doubt it is
                            between the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 20<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August. There had been prospects of
                            rain and threats of thunder gust, with the intense heat of the last two
                            days— Last evening there was a light shower without thunder, and in the
                            night a heavy gale, which continued after I rose this morning, and
                            finally cleared off with a crystal Northwester and bracing cold. The
                            third night poultice upon my wounded knee, not even cooled the
                            inflammation around it. <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef> who
                            after several days of intermission, from inflammation of his eyes, came
                            again to visit <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef>,
                            looked at my knee, and advised the application of lead water which was
                            accordingly done— And after dinner I rode with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Miss Smith</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-charles2">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, her boy Arthur and Mary-Louisa,
                            round by the lower landing and over Penn’s hill.— I read the ninth
                            century of the Sylva Sylvarum, and the close of <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay’s</persRef> Review of
                            <persRef ref="stanhope-philip2">Lord Mahon’s</persRef> History of the War of the Spanish succession— The
                            Experiments of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century are various,
                            and some of them mystical— The first one touching perception in bodies
                            insensible, tending to natural divination or subtile trials— And he
                            begins with a startling assertion, that all bodies whatever, though they
                            have no sense, yet they have perception: for when one body is applied to
                            another, there is a kind of election to embrace that which is agreeable,
                            and to exclude or expel that which is ingrate— It is therefore a subject
                            of a very noble inquiry, to inquire of the more subtile perceptions; for
                            it is another key to open nature, as well as the sense; and sometimes
                            better— And besides, it is a principal means of natural divination; for
                            that which in these perceptions appeareth early, in the great effects
                            cometh long after— That perception is an attribute of all bodies
                            whatsoer, is a postulate which I am not prepared to grant; nor is it
                            necessary for the argument which recommends the study of Secret
                            Sympathies, and of which there is in nature multitudes sufficient for
                            the curiosity of the most inquisitive spies of Nature— <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef> however is
                            constantly repeating the principles of his system. “To apply, says he
                            notions philosophical to plebeian terms; or to say, where the notions
                            cannot fitly be reconciled that there wanteth a term or nomenclature for
                            it, as the antients used, they be but shifts of ignorance; for knowledge
                            will be ever a wandering and indigested thing, if it be but a commixture
                            of a few notions that are at hand and occur and not excited from a
                            sufficient number of instances, and those well collated” The chief
                            interest of the Review of the History of the War of the Spanish
                            succession is in the adventures and character of <persRef ref="mordaunt-charles">Mordaunt the eccentric

                            of Spain the only question seems to be which was the most insignificant
                            of the two.</p>

                            a series of Articles under the head of Southern Convention, marking the
                            movement of the Southern Disunionists to carry through the Texas

                            stimulated my industry, full three hours of this day— Shall it be in
                            vain?— I read the tenth and last century of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon’s</persRef> Sylva Sylvarum. He
                            calls it a Natural History; but so is <persRef ref="glass-hannah">Hannah Glasse’s</persRef> cookery book—
                            There are one thousand experiments in consort or solitary of
                            heterogeneous character, many of them exceedingly curious, but huddled
                            together without commune vinculum to keep any thing upon the memory— The
                            last century commences with experiments in concert touching the
                            transmission and influx of immateriate virtues, and the force of
                            imagination. This topic is inexhaustible— He says it is “such as we are
                            a little doubtful to propound; it is so prodigious: but that it is so
                            constantly avouched by many; and we have set it down as a law to
                            ourselves to examine things to the bottom; and not to receive upon
                            credit, or reject upon improbabilities, until there hath passed a due
                            examination.”— 986— [“]I myself remember, that being in Paris, and <persRef ref="bacon-nicholas">my
                            father</persRef> dying in London, two or three days before my fathers death, I had
                            a dream, which I told to divers English gentlemen; that my father’s
                            house in the country was plaistered all over with black mortar.”— The
                            last Experiment is solitary touching the general sympathy of men’s
                            spirits— The delight which men have in popularity, fame, honour,
                            submission, and subjection of other men’s minds, wills or affections,
                            although these things may be desired for other ends, seemeth to be a
                            thing in itself, without contemplation of consequence, grateful and
                            agreeable to the nature of man &amp;c. quod vide— Then I returned

                            heavy shower, without clearing up.— I received yesterday a copy of <persRef ref="middleton-james">J.
                            Middleton’s</persRef> Celestial Atlas with the small volume its companion—a
                            present from the author in England. The work with which <persRef ref="davis-john">judge John Davis</persRef>
                            had made me acquainted last Summer, and of which I then expressed to him
                            my approbation— <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Savage</persRef> had on his
                            last visit to England become acquainted with the author, and through his
                            means a correspondence had been opened between M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Middleton and judge Davis.— The judge communicated to M<hi

                            work, and this present is forwarded to me by the hands of M<hi

                            <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Treadway</persRef>, with <persRef ref="clark-susan;crane-adoniram">her Son in Law and

                            Virginia, New-York and Boston— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> passed the Evening
                            with us— I read this morning, the New Atlantis of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon</persRef>— Like the
                            Sylva Sylvarum, a posthumous publication, by <persRef ref="rawley-william">Doctor William Rawley</persRef>; said
                            by him to be a work unfinished— It is in form, a fable somewhat like
                            <persRef ref="swift-jonathan">Swift’s</persRef> <persRef ref="lemuelgulliver">Captain Gulliver</persRef>, the narrative of an Island, discovered on a
                            voyage from Peru, to China, and Japan— Rawley says it was devised to
                            exhibit a model or description of a College instituted for the
                            interpreting of nature, and the producing of great and marvellous works,
                            for the benefit of men; under the name of Solomon’s house; or the
                            College of the six days work— He says too that Bacon first intended to
                            have included in this frame a code of laws, or of the best state or
                            mould of a Commonwealth— But this was never performed; foreseeing it
                            would be a long work, his desire of collecting the Natural history
                            diverted him, which he preferred many degrees before it— The New
                            Atlantis in regard to its near affinity with the Natural History is
                            printed immediately after it— The Solomon’s house is a college for the
                            collection of experiments in Natural History— A stone house for the ten
                            centuries— The governor of the island tells the traveller that about
                            3000 years before, they had ships that “went sundry voyages, as well to
                            your Straits, which you call the pillars of <persRef ref="hercules">Hercules</persRef>, as to other parts
                            in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas; as to Peguin, which is the same
                            with Cambaline, and Quinzy, upon the Oriental seas, as far as to the
                            borders of the east Tartary.”— Where did he get that Quinzy?— I still
                            read without yet finishing <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay’s</persRef> review of <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Horace Walpole’s</persRef> Letters
                            to <persRef ref="mann-horace2">Sir Horace Mann</persRef>— Macaulay cuts him up without mercy—but he is more
                            exorable to the memory of his father; <persRef ref="walpole-robert">Sir Robert</persRef>— Horace’s writings have
                            amused me so much, and are so full of genius that I had not analyzed his
                            character with such a steel pen as Macaulay’s. I wrote a page of
                            task—but was obliged to set up till half past eleven to finish it— My
                            subject spreads till I lose sight of its central point.</p>

                        <p>A dull, cold, cloudy day, without rain, most busily occupied, with no
                            other efficient action than a walk before dinner; with <persRef ref="crane-adoniram">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane</persRef> up the hill of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house
                            Charles himself was gone to Boston, but returned home to dine— We saw
                            <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane admired the prospect
                            of the harbour—the islands, the city, the village, and the western
                            hills. My garden and Nursery rambles are barren and my meditations
                            teeming but as yet unfruitful— I cannot do the writing and the reading
                            of my daily task in one day—one of them is and must be sacrificed to the
                            other I read this morning <persRef ref="bacon-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bacon</persRef> in praise
                            of knowledge, and began his Valerius Terminus or the Interpretation of
                            Nature; with the Annotations of Hermes Stella— A few fragments of the
                            first book— And then there is a Note, that none of the annotations of
                            Stella are set down in these fragments— Of all this title there is no
                            explanation— Valerius Terminus and Hermes Stella with annotations, not
                            set down must explain themselves— I see nothing but fragments of the
                            first book of an immense imaginary work upon the interpretation of
                            Nature—extremely curious—but profoundly to be studied—22 quarto pages. I
                            intended to have them for this mornings portion, but before I had got
                            half through came the daily mail and newspapers; and in the Boston
                            Courier of this Morning the address of <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> to his friends
                            throughout the Union, withdrawing his name from the canvas, as a
                            candidate for election of President— To this step he has been driven, by
                            a deputation of Democrats from New York; disclosing to him that cannot
                            get up an electoral ticket; to vote for him in any one State in the
                            Union— His address is a <persRef ref="captainbobadil">Captain Bobadil</persRef> brag of the prosperity of the
                            Country all the merit of which he claims as due to his administration,
                            and a viperous string of invective against <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="kent-james">Chancellor Kent</persRef>,
                            <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef> and me— The dirtiest of his spite is vented upon me. He
                            is perhaps too low for further notice from me, but as the tool of others
                            hate his address is not to be overlooked or despised— I have come in my
                            own address to my constituents to the point of my own vindication, and
                            the exposure of the base <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> and <persRef ref="erving-george">Erving</persRef> plot against me, which it
                            will require all my energy and more than all my discretion to manage— A
                            falser and fouler conspiracy never debased the character of man than
                            this— To show it in all its turpitude to the world is my duty to the
                            world and to my self— I have the power and the means—the transcendent
                            difficulty is to do it with calmness and composure, and without an
                            unbecoming manifestation of temper— Medio tutissimus ibis— Not the
                            tameness of a nameless victim, not the tempest that loses self command.
                            Oh! for a curb upon my temper!— I am still also labouring through,
                            <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulays</persRef> characteristics of <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Horace Walpole</persRef>, and <persRef ref="walpole-robert">his father</persRef>— Charles and

                        <list><item>Frothingham Nathaniel L. Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> D.D</item></list>
                        <p><persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> preached this morning from
                            Matthew 25.18. “But he that had received one went and digged in the
                            earth, and hid his Lord’s money”— The D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            observed that every part of this parable of the Talents was rich with
                            instruction, and every word in which it is related, subject for grave
                            and varied meditation— The commendation of the Servants to whom the lord
                            had entrusted severally the 5 and the two talents was susceptible of
                            improvements impressing the duties of diligence and fidelity; but it was
                            worthy of enquiry what was the precise nature of the wickedness of him,
                            who digged in the earth and hid his Lord’s money— It was not dishonesty,
                            not selfish avarice, no embezzlement—no conversion of the money to his
                            own use— It was not careless, extravagant, or foolish investment of the
                            money, exposing it to be lost. He returned it to the Lord, as he had
                            received it from him, without diminution without increase— But his duty
                            was to improve the fund entrusted to his care— He was not the faithless,
                            but the unprofitable servant. That was his wickedness, and for that his
                            punishment was just as it was severe. His inaction had been caused by a
                            sullen, discontented, disrespectful temper. The reason that he assigned
                            for his neglect of duty was offensive to his Lord— He said he knew him
                            to be a hard man, reaping where he had not sown, and gathering where he
                            had not strewed— The very considerations which should have spur’d him on
                            to the most active exertions to turn his talent to account— In the
                            corresponding narrative by <persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef> of the same parable, 19.20. The servant
                            says he had laid up the talent in a Napkin— There is indeed so much in
                            the narrative between the two Evangelists that it might reasonably be
                            questioned whether they are one and the same story. D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s discourse was copious in
                            thought, and forcible in application— He walked home with me, and dined
                            with us. We rode to meeting in the afternoon in a flood rather than a
                            shower of rain— The auditory was very small—about 40 persons, of whom
                            perhaps ten women— The afternoon discourse was from 2. Corinthians 12.7.
                            “And lest I should be exalted above measure, through the abundance of
                            the revelations, <hi rend="italic">there</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">given</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">me</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">thorn</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">the</hi>

                            I should be exalted above measure.” The words underscored were the text,
                            and there was no comment on the repetition of the assignment of the
                            purpose for which this mysterious and unexplained thorn in the flesh was
                            given— The Doctor’s eldest son <persRef ref="frothingham-thomas">Thomas</persRef> came out with him, and with <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
                                Hellen</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef> on the hill,
                            while <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> himself dined with us. The Doctor returned to Boston, and
                            Charles and his wife spent the evening with us.</p>

                        <p>I have so far recovered from my lameness that I was able this morning to
                            give one hour before and after sunrise to exercise, and piddling with my
                            seedling trees. I saw the Sunrise, and filled an earthen pot to sow in
                            it apple and pear-seeds— I mixed manure with earth from the richest
                            mould of the garden for my experiments— But this time lost me the day
                            for my task— <persRef ref="waterston-robert2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterston</persRef> the father of the

                            settled at Louisville, Kentucky called and spent about two hours with me
                            in conversation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayward on leaving me
                            requested an autograph, for <persRef ref="speed-eliza">Miss Eliza Speed</persRef>, a young Lady of
                            Louisville, which I gave him— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> brought me a Letter from <persRef ref="palfrey-john">M<hi

                            subscription to the fund, or of continuing a separate and larger
                            provision from year to year.— We spoke also of my design to build in
                            connection with his house on the hill a fire proof granite edifice for
                            the safe keeping of my library, and of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> and my own manuscript
                            books and papers— <persRef ref="crane-adoniram">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
                            Hellen</persRef>, went this afternoon to Boston for an excursion to Lowell
                            to-morrow— I have finished reading the fragments of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Bacon</persRef> upon the
                            interpretation of Nature.— A Summary abridgement of a great work never
                            finished— Full of instruction; not well digested an enormous mass of
                            gold in the mine.— Here the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter is
                            indicative of the celebrated four idols—thus— [“]Of the inherent and
                            profound errors and superstitions in the nature of the mind, and of the
                            four sorts of idols or false appearances that offer themselves to the
                            understanding in the inquisition of knowledge; that is to say, the idols
                            of the tribe, the idols of the palace, the idols of the cave, and the
                            idols of the theatre.— That these four added to the incapacity of the
                            mind, and the vanity and malignity of the affections, leave nothing but
                            impotency and confusion.— A recital of the particular kinds of these
                            four idols, with some chosen examples of the opinions they have begot,
                            such of them as have supplanted the state of knowledge most.”— At the
                            close of the book are two profound observations.— 1. “Of the singular
                            advantage which the Christian religion hath towards the furtherance of
                            true knowledge in that it excludeth and interdicteth human reason,
                            whether by interpretation or anticipation, from examining or discussing
                            of the mysteries and principles of faith.” 2. “That monarchies incline
                            wits to profit and pleasure: and Commonwealths to glory and vanity. That
                            universities incline wits to sophistry and affectation; cloisters to
                            fables and unprofitable subtilty; study at large to variety; and that it
                            is hard to say, whether mixture of contemplations with an active life,
                            or retiring wholly to contemplations, do disable and hinder the mind
                            more.”— Not a word read of <persRef ref="macaulay-thomas">Macaulay</persRef>. Not a line written of the task</p>

                        <p>No sight of morning stars, or of rising or setting Sun.— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went to

                            is a young student of divinity recently from the theological school at
                            Cambridge— A native of Dorchester and now residing there— He assigned
                            two motives for his call to see me—one, as a manifestation of personal
                            respect for my character— The other to ask my opinions upon some
                            scruples which troubled him with regard to his voting at the
                            presidential election— He was an abolitionist in principle, though not
                            of the abolition party; nor of any abolition Society. He was also a whig
                            and strongly desirous of voting for the <persRef ref="clay-henry">whig candidate</persRef>— But the Liberty
                            party charged him with being an avowed duelist—and not only a Slave
                            holder, but a decided partizan for perpetual Slavery— A
                            gambler—intemperate, and otherwise of loose licentious life— There was
                            no satisfactory refutation of these charges made public, and he was much
                            perplexed what to do. He needed advice and came to ask it of me— I said
                            that his doubts were of no easy solution. That I took no part as a
                            partizan in the presidential election I deemed it my duty to abstain
                            from canvassing for any one for that office, and to leave it to the
                            people to fix their choice for themselves.— But as to matters of fact I
                            would say what I knew or believed and as to principles, what I think—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay is a Slave holder and a
                            supporter of Slavery— I believe him in error upon those points; and hope
                            he will revise and reform his opinions. He is a man of the world—of
                            self-indulgent habits; but not as I believe a gambler or intemperate— He
                            abhors dueling, and has been engaged in several duels— A rigorous
                            puritanical principle of morals cannot be applied to the exercise of the
                            right of suffrage— There must be some reference to the result— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s <persRef ref="polk-james">chief competitor</persRef> is vastly more
                            exceptionable than he— To vote for a third candidate who cannot be
                            elected is in effect to vote for the worst of the three— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington thanked me. My reasoning
                            evidently failed to convince him— <persRef ref="crane-adoniram">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> returned from their excursion to Lowell, and we took
                            tea, and spent the Evening at Charles’s house— Except <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> who is
                            much indisposed— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, who is yet confined to her chamber, and Walter

                            this manner— Loose thoughts— Objections to the prevailing systems and
                            modes of teaching— Next to these Sequela chartarum sive Inquisitio

                            valley farm— He proposed also to sell to me his own house and farm, and
                            also to clear out the brook behind the native spot houses; concerning
                            all which I propose to take further advice— <persRef ref="davis-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            manuscript books and papers— I have long been deeply anxious upon this
                            subject— The library and the manuscripts are all now in houses liable
                            every day of the year and every hour of the day to be consumed by fire.
                            My career must very shortly close; and I look with intense feeling to
                            posterity for the preservation of my father’s name, and of my own as his
                            son. All my hopes are centered in my surving son and his <persRef ref="adams-louisa3;adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4;adams-arthur">infant
                            children</persRef>—daughters may possibly transmit inheritances, but not names— My
                            son will not dishonour his, but how frail and precarious is the tenure
                            of a single life! what a lottery the chances of virtue, wisdom and
                            prosperity even of one among four small children! I feel the necessity
                            of guarding against casualties from external causes, from the decays of
                            nature and accidents of fire. For the rest in humble reverence and hope
                            I rely upon mercy from on high— I read this morning, Articles of

                        <p>My Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa-Catherine</persRef>, brought me an Album of a <persRef ref="fearing-eleanor">Miss Eleanor
                            B. Fearing</persRef> of New-York, now a visitor at <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lunt’s</persRef>, with a request that I would put some thing in it; and it must be
                            done immediately, for the young Lady was going for New-York this
                            afternoon. I could not mortify my granddaughter by a refusal and wrote a
                            short Stanza. I keep copies of all these Album Fadaises; but am ashamed
                            to meet four out of five of them— These offscourings of the wits of
                            distinguished persons are almost universally dull. But it is better to
                            be dull than churlish.— Of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon</persRef> the physiological remains which I
                            read yesterday are followed by the medical remains—a sort of
                            apothicary’s shop; a catalogue of astringents, openers and cordials
                            instrumental to health— An extract for his own use out of the book of
                            the prolongation of life; and recipes of his own— 32 empirical nostrums
                            of pills, potions, clysters and quackeries Among which 14. Never to keep
                            the body in the same posture above half an hour at a time 15 Four
                            precepts. To break off custom. To shake off spirits ill disposed. To
                            meditate on youth. To do nothing against a man’s genius. 26. Heroic
                            desires— 28 To provide always an apt breakfast.— The series closes with
                            medical receipts for the gout and the stone— And then come the Works
                            Moral— Beginning with a fragment of the Colours of Good and Evil. To the
                            <persRef ref="blount-charles">Lord Mountjoye</persRef>— In the dedication he says, he takes his subject from the
                            last part of the best book of <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef>, who he says does not deliver,
                            and unwrap himself well of that he seemeth to conceive; nor to be a
                            master of his own knowledge— There are ten colours, or appearances of
                            Good and Evil— Extracts from Aristotle—but given in Latin; and of which
                            he presents his analysis of persuasives and dissuasives—detecting the
                            fallacies of the Stagirite— For my task I had a long search for
                            documents of the second Session of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            Congress of which I have two sets and could find neither of them
                            complete, and miss especially the report of the select Committee of the
                            House of Representatives on <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> Seminole War Campaign. In
                            searching however for these, I found some others which I wanted, but did
                            not know where to look for them— As <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> Register for 1819 and <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis’s</persRef>

                        <p>The moon was full last Tuesday, and shone this morning when I rose almost
                            as bright as day. The whole Constellation of Orion the great and little
                            dog-stars, Venus, and the twins were all brilliant before my windows—
                            Sirius about 10 minutes and Venus about 20— I saw the Sun rise from the
                            East corner of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house.— I went to Boston and attended the

                            with reference to the nomination of a Candidate to represent the

                                12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this Month as the day when they
                            wished to call on me if convenient; and he requested me to name the hour
                            of that or any other day when it would be agreeable to me to receive
                            them. I answered the Letter, assuring him that I would with pleasure
                            receive the Committee, on the day named by him between 10 and 12
                            O’Clock, or on either of the two immediately succeeding days, at their
                            convenience. But they did not come on either of the days, nor have I
                            heard from them or from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher since— I
                            was apprehensive that he might not have received my Letter. M<hi

                            that he would give M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher notice of the
                            fact— I desired him to add that I shall be glad to see the Committee
                            upon any day that may suit them— Walking in the Street I met the Rev<hi

                            the Phi Beta Kappa Oration at Cambridge. I told him I proposed to call

                            Church for the names of Boylston and White— At the meeting of the
                            historical Society— I presented copies of my Oration at Cincinnati, and

                            if the spirit should move would speak a few words— Our late evening

                            ever since— Numberless editions of them have been published— So that it
                            is no vain boasting when he says, I do conceive, that the Latin volume
                            of them, being in the universal language, may last as long as books
                            last. But I suppose that in these days, the English original finds many
                            more readers than the Latin translation— The Essays are followed by a
                            Collection of Apophthegms, New and old 150 of which I read this day. In
                            his preface to them he refers to the example of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef>, and says
                            its pity that book is lost— If they are not better than Bacon’s they are
                            no great loss.— He says they are mu crones verborum pointed speeches. He
                            says he will not omit any because they are vulgar; for many vulgar ones
                            are excellent good—that may be—but some of his are beastly filthy, and
                            ought never to have been published— The practice of collecting
                            apophthegms is perhaps good, but these are upon the whole flat and
                            unprofitable.</p>
