                        <p><persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> had left a Letter signed by <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef> and himself as Executors and Trustees of
                            <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>, to the Selectmen of Princeton, proposing an
                            amicable chancery suit in the Supreme Court of the State, to ascertain
                            the right of the town, and the duty of the Executors, concerning a
                            bequest, which was to take effect after the decease of <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >rs.</hi> Alicia Boylston</persRef>— I signed the Letter and it was sent this
                            morning. Also an answer to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef> Letter of last Saturday from
                            Baltimore. This morning before breakfast I brought up my diary, and then
                            gave the day to visitation of my friends— I gave my Granddaughter
                            <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa-Catherine</persRef>, the breast pin I had purchased for her yesterday— I
                            called on <persRef ref="mitchell-francis">Mitchell</persRef> the engraver with the signet ring I purchased for her
                            yesterday, and gave an order to engrave the Lion crest and the initial
                            A. on the Cornelian stone— At <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> George Parkman’s</persRef>
                            former residence I found he had removed to N. 1. Joy place, Belknap
                            Street— I visited at the houses of <persRef ref="otis-harrison">H. G. Otis</persRef>, <persRef ref="brooks-edward">Edward Brooks</persRef>, <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C.
                                Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef ref="davis-john">John Davis</persRef>, and found no one of them at home. I had found
                            <persRef ref="hall-joseph">Joseph Hall</persRef>, 83 years old verging upon the very last stage of life, with
                            <persRef ref="parker-rebecca">his Sister</persRef> not so old but as decayed, a melancholy contemplation of
                            human life; but still he received me with a warm welcome. I was going to
                            <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef> when I met <persRef ref="frothingham-ann">his wife</persRef> in the
                            Street who told me he was at New-York, and she expect him to return
                            to-morrow. at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef> I saw <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth">his wife</persRef>
                            and daughter <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth2">Elizabeth</persRef>— I had met their daughters <persRef ref="foster-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="foster-louisa">Louisa</persRef> at
                            D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s door— I met also <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
                            Quincy</persRef> in the Street, and first mentioned to him the idea of having
                            short Memoirs of the Lives of the persons, whose Portraits are at the
                            historical Society, with an engraving of one of the Portraits published
                            in every future volume of the Society— I was ten minutes at my Son’s
                            office where I saw <persRef ref="spooner-allen">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> A. C. Spooner</persRef>. Found <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef> at home, and spent half an hour
                            with him and <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine;lawrence-katherine2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and Miss Lawrence</persRef>. Dined at
                            Charles’s. <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> also dined there. After dinner I called at
                                D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> George Parkman’s, and passed an hour with
                            him <persRef ref="parkman-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Parkman</persRef> and <persRef ref="parkman-george2">their Son</persRef>— About 7 this Evening
                            my Son returned home from his political excursion to Ashburnham, Ashby,
                            and Winchenden. I received in the course of the evening successively
                            five columns from the Atlas office, from 7. to 11. O’Clock after I was
                            in bed, of proof of my address at Braintree— There was still a column
                            left, which I sent them word to publish without waiting for my
                            revisal.</p>

                        <p>At half past 6 this morning <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> took his daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef> to

                            Chapman</persRef> late Mayor of Boston called to see me, and for an answer to an
                            invitation which I had received to visit Medway and address the whigs
                            there next Thursday or Friday. I declined having already taken cold and
                            made myself so hoarse that it is doubtful whether I shall be able to
                            speak next Wednesday at North-Bridgwater— I received also a Letter from
                            <persRef ref="bryant-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant</persRef> of that place enquiring by which road,
                            I propose to go there, as some of the Citizens, wish to come out and
                            meet me— This too I declined and answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Bryant’s Letter, intimating a doubt whether, the state of my health and
                            particularly of my voice will permit me to go at the appointed time. I
                            visited <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert C. Winthrop</persRef>, and had a long
                            conversation with him respecting his relative <persRef ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef>, his base
                            treatment of me, and my public notices of him— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Winthrop, that when before the close of the session of
                            Congress he gave me <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll’s</persRef>, View of the Texas question
                            and I observed to him my astonishment at the disclosure of Erving’s
                            conduct, never having in the course of forty years acquaintance given
                            him the slightest cause of offence; but having even named him to <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> as a candidate for the mission to France,
                            and Winthrop said he would communicate to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving
                            what I said;— I did purposely intend to give M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Erving time to offer any explanation or apology to me—which the occasion
                            required to repair the wrong he had done me.— He has not done it. By the
                            Letter to Winthrop, from which he read me lately an extract, he
                            expresses his regret at having assailed me; admits that I had given him
                            no cause for it, and says that <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> had gone far beyond any thing
                            that he had said to him would warrant. But he had offered neither
                            excuse, apology nor explanation to me, and in handling him as I have
                            been compelled to do I have acted with extreme reluctance. I assured
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop also that my Son would countenance
                            no design or attempt to place him in competition with him, and that he
                            would have my best wishes for his continuance in his present station as
                            long as it would be agreeable to him and for his promotion to any other
                            office of higher dignity and importance. He expressed much gratification
                            at these assurances; but said he had determined not to serve in Congress
                            after this next election— My next call was at the Atlas Office, where
                            <persRef ref="hayden-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayden</persRef> returned me the manuscript of my
                            Address at Braintree. It is published at full length in the Atlas of
                            this morning, five columns. Small type— By these two Addresses, to the

                        <p>The Steamer Hibernia arrived last Night about 11. O’Clock having left
                            Liverpool the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month. I looked in vain
                            for her therefore in crossing the hill going to and returning from
                            meeting— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached this morning from 2.
                            Timothy 1.7. [“]For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of
                            power, and of love, and of a sound mind”— This Epistle was written from
                            Rome it is said when <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> was brought before <persRef ref="nero">Nero</persRef> the second time— It
                            was certainly very shortly before his martyrdom.— It is evidently
                            written under great distress—in prison, abandoned by almost all his
                            associates, some of whom he names, particularly those from Asia, his
                            tone of complaint is not boisterous, nor pusillanimous but moderate,
                            calm, without invective, and firm, specially exhorting <persRef ref="timothy">Timothy</persRef> to stand
                            firm in the discharge of his duties, reminding him that the cause for
                            which he suffers, is the purpose and grace of God “given us in Christ
                            Jesus before the world began, but now made manifest by the <hi
                                rend="italic">appearing</hi> of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath
                            abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality through the
                            gospel:”— This is the cause with regard to which he says God hath not
                            given us the spirit of Fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound
                            mind. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt as is his usual practice analyzed the
                            words of his text and contrasted the Spirit of Fear, with that of the
                            three others named in the text—Power, Love and a sound mind. His
                            description of Fear was almost as graphic as that of <persRef ref="collins-william">Collins</persRef> in his Ode
                            on the Passions; and he specially noticed the opposition in which it is
                            placed by the Apostle to a sound mind— He observed that a sound mind
                            never admitted Fear— That the passion always disordered the mind, and
                            disabled it for the exercise of its regular functions.— The fear of God
                            itself he said was so qualified by the Spirit of Love, that it lost its
                            evil qualities; but that simple Fear, was of all human qualities that
                            most selfish and base— The closing exhortation to the auditory, to
                            banish the Spirit of Fear, and adhere to those of Power and Love, and a
                            sound mind, was spirited and acceptable.— In the afternoon some what
                            unexpectedly <persRef ref="cunningham-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Cunningham</persRef> a Classmate of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my

                            look upon all the works of the most high: and there are two and two, one
                            against another.” There is much wisdom in the Book of Jesus the son of
                            <persRef ref="sirach-joshua">Sirach</persRef>, but it is not in good taste for a protestant divine to take a
                            text from it for a Sermon; and the Sermon itself was not equal to M<hi

                            Illinois, where he resides and is one of the teachers of the school— The
                            fortunes of that Apthorp family, are impressively melancholy. from

                            the father of this young man.— There is deep tragical romance in the
                            story of almost every member of this family— A <persRef ref="apthorp-paul">brother</persRef> of this young

                            address— He came to advise me as to the best road to take in going
                            there, that is, by Braintree, West Randolph and a corner of Stoughton—
                            The distance is 12 miles, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett said there
                            were a number of young men of the town of North Bridgwater and of
                            several adjoining towns, who propose to form a cavalcade, and come 5 or
                            6 miles and meet and escort me to his house— I told him I had
                            remonstrated against this in a Letter to <persRef ref="bryant-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant</persRef>
                            last week— But he said they would come, and I promised to take the road
                            to meet them— A young man named <persRef ref="freeman-john">John Stocker Freeman</persRef> came to ask for

                            name of the other he does not know— He was born in Boston in 1821. and
                            in 1823. his mother died in childbed with a daughter who died also— His
                            father about the same time went to see, and he has heard nothing from
                            him for many years— He himself had been brought upon Charity, had been
                            several years at sea, and is now a Journeyman boot and shoemaker at
                            Quincy point.— He had written letters to his Sisters to ascertain
                            whether they were to be found but had received no answer— He wanted
                            advice— I advised him to write again to his Sister, and enclose the

                        <p>As I came into my library this morning the rain pattering on the windows
                            and the wind howling round the corner of the house announced a
                            Northeastern gale which continued till the afternoon, and then subsided
                            without entirely clearing up.— The <persRef ref="freeman-john">young man</persRef> came again with a Letter to
                            his Sister <persRef ref="freeman-mary2">Mary Ann Freeman</persRef>, Leominster County of Hereford, England, and

                            might perhaps be married, and a certificate of the British Vice Consul
                            at Boston <persRef ref="grattan-edmund">Edmund A Grattan</persRef>, dated the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> day of
                            last July that <persRef ref="smith-mary3">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary S. Smith</persRef> of Boston
                            personally appeared before him, and in his presence on oath declared
                            that John Stocker Freeman, who had signed his name at the foot of the
                            certificate, was to her certain knowledge the son of <persRef ref="freeman-thomas;freeman-mary">Thomas and
                            Mary-Anne Freeman</persRef> of Leominster in the County Hereford England, and
                            formerly resident of Boston where the said John Stocker Freeman was born
                            on the 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> day of September 1821.— The Deponent was
                            uncertain whether the said Thomas Freeman were still alive or not but
                            farther stated that the said Mary Ann Freeman (otherwise Mary Ann
                            Collins[)] his wife, died in Boston in the month of March A.D 1823. The
                            Letters to the Sister and to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett are well
                            written, and the signature of the young man to the certificate is in a
                            good hand. I promised to enclose these papers to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Everett, and would recommend the enquiries to his special attention—
                            This was the only interruption of this day but I received from
                            Nashville, Tennessee a Newspaper, containing <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson’s</persRef> first
                            Answer to my address to the young men of Boston.— He is in great fury,
                            but totally abandons the charge of the <persRef ref="erving-george">Erwin</persRef> Treaty— I had been all the
                            morning commenting upon <persRef ref="polk-james">James K. Polk’s</persRef> Letter declaring his opinion in
                            favour of the immediate annexation of Texas in which he assails me
                            directly by name— And the remainder of the day and evening till 11 at
                            night I was absorbed in writing a reply to Jackson’s letter to <persRef ref="armstrong-robert3">Robert
                                Armstrong</persRef>— The paper was enclosed to me by <persRef ref="mcnairy-boyd">Boyd M’Nairy</persRef>— Jackson denies
                            positively that he ever advised the acceptance of the Sabine for the
                            western boundary. Whether he equivocates upon the word <hi rend="italic"
                                >advised,</hi> or has totally forgotten his interviews with me of 2.
                            and 3. February 1819. The memory of violent men, is always the slave of
                            their passions.— Jackson pledges himself to answer my charge further as
                            soon as he can procure the Erving Manuscripts from Washington—</p>

                        <p>I added this morning one page to my notice of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson’s</persRef> first
                            answer to my summons in the address to the young men of Boston. I sent

                            to go with me to North Bridgwater, which he accepted— I took him up at
                            his house at 8 O’Clock and we rode through Braintree, West-Randolph, and
                            a corner of Stoughton, to North Bridgwater—12 miles. At West Randolph
                            about half way we were met by a cavalcade of about one hundred men, the
                            leader of whom came up to the carriage, accosted me by name and
                            announced that they were citizens of Norfolk, Bristol and Plymouth
                            Counties who had come to escort me to the place of meeting; for which I
                            returned to them my cordial thanks— They accordingly formed a line and
                            preceded the Carriage to <persRef ref="bennett-edward">Bennet’s</persRef> tavern at North Bridgwater— Here I
                            found <persRef ref="bryant-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant</persRef> the Chairman of the whig Committee

                            from all the neighbouring towns of whom the persons named in the margin
                            were with <persRef ref="french-thomas">Thomas French</persRef> of Canton were nearly all whom I had before
                            known. Many were introduced to me, among whom several Warriors of the
                            Revolution with War worn and time worn faces and forms. At half past ten
                            a procession was formed preceded by a band of martial music and we
                            marched to the meeting house— <persRef ref="sprague-seth2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seth Sprague jun<hi

                            and introduced me.— From a quarter past 11. to half past one. I read
                            from the pulpit with my manuscripts on the Bible my address which was
                            listened to with close attention and well received. <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            adjourned to a frugal and tempeate dinner at the Inn.— Immediately after

                        <p>Sun rose 6:40. Set.</p>
                        <p>There was a hard frost last night, and ice as thick as window glass was
                            made on the ditch between my house and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>— I saw the Sun rise
                            from the corner of his house, and at 10. O’Clock left home and came in
                            to Boston, leaving <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, who proposes to pass a day or two
                            with <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams</persRef>.— I came immediately to my
                            Son’s house N. 57. Mount Vernon Street. He had just returned from a tour
                            to Nantucket and New-Bedford, where he has delivered electioneering
                            addresses.— I went to the office of the Boston Courier, and gave <persRef ref="buckingham-joseph">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Buckingham</persRef> the manuscripts of my address delivered
                            yesterday at North Bridgwater—with the newspapers containing the Letters
                            of <persRef ref="polk-james">James K. Polk</persRef> and <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, and his charge about the <persRef ref="erving-george">Erwin</persRef>
                            Treaty— Buckingham proposes to publish the address on Saturday morning,
                            and promised to send me proof columns of the paper to-morrow afternoon—
                            I called at my Son’s office, and learnt that there is a second Letter
                            from Andrew Jackson in answer to my address to the young men of Boston.
                            This last is addressed to <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> the Editor of the Globe, and calls upon
                            him for help in this controversy— There was great agitation in the
                            streets, especially in State Street on the opposite sides of which are
                            the Atlas and Times Newspaper Offices; before the doors of which crowds
                            were collected awaiting the election returns from New-York— They were
                            then highly favorable to the whig party— <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> George
                            Parkman</persRef> called on me at my Son’s house— At 4. O’Clock we went and dined
                            at <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel T. Armstrong’s</persRef>, with the company named

                            found with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Charles</persRef> on our return from the
                            dinner— There was a very numerous democratic torch light procession this
                            evening, who visited the dwelling house of <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

                            ten I retired to bed, and about midnight was awaked by the firing of 26.
                            guns—the Io Triumphe of the democrats, on receiving the election returns
                            from Albany.</p>

                        <p>I understood the meaning of the guns fired last night, on receipt of the
                            election returns, from the western Counties of New-York, by the train of
                            Cars from Albany. They settle the Presidential election, and <persRef ref="polk-james">James K.
                            Polk</persRef> of Tennessee is to be President of the United States for four years
                            from the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March 1845— What the further events
                            of this issue may be—but it will be the signal for my retirement from
                            public life— It is the victory of the Slavery element in the
                            Constitution of the United States. Providence I trust intends it for
                            wise purposes and will direct it to good ends— From the sphere of public
                            action, I must at all events very soon be removed.— My removal now is
                            but a few days in advance of the doom of Nature, and gives me time if I
                            have energy to improve it, which will not be lost. I called this morning
                            on <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">Doctor Frothingham</persRef>;—and just before reaching his door, met <persRef ref="davis-isaac">M<hi

                                >r.</hi> Frothingham I examined and we construed the whole 16<hi

                            found that there is extant in English a translation in verse of this
                            author, published in 1782. without the name of the translator— I called
                            on <persRef ref="davis-john">judge Davis</persRef> who condoled with me on the loss of the Presidential
                            election; and also that in the list of stars in <persRef ref="rees-abraham">Rees’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia <hi

                            left us to go by the railway cars to Haverhill to address a convocation
                            of whigs there this Evening. I called at <persRef ref="libby-jacob">Libbey</persRef> the jeweller’s shop with

                        <p><persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> returned this morning from Haverhill just after we had
                            breakfasted. He attended a numerous whig meeting there last Evening and
                            made a speech. He comes home much gratified that this is the last of the
                            electioneering campaign. There was also an immense meeting of whigs last
                            evening at Faneuil Hall in Boston <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef> was there, and made a
                            speech commencing with What though the field be lost! All is not lost
                            &amp;c— The depression and despondency of the whig party at the issue of
                            the presidential election in the State of New-York is beyond all example
                            or precedent.— A young man by the name of <persRef ref="wheeler-daniel">Wheeler</persRef> from Rutland in the
                            County of Worcester, came this morning to see me. Merely to gratify his
                            curiosity— We conversed about half an hour, upon indifferent topics—but
                            no politics— I recovered the arrears of my journals, and answered an
                            invitation to dinner from <persRef ref="sears-david2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David Sears</persRef> for next
                            Thursday. Accepted. But I can have no tranquility in the city in the
                            daytime. My address at North-Bridgwater was published in the Boston
                            Courier of this morning. On examining it, I found a considerable number
                            of errors of the press.— I read it over, and corrected as many of them
                            as I perceived without finishing I went out—called at <persRef ref="libby-jacob">Libby</persRef> the
                            jeweller’s shop, and took the signet ring which I have procured for <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my

                            wife</persRef>. The seal is the lion crest bearing the cross and under it the
                            initial A. Thence I went to the Office of the Courier; where I finished
                            the revisal of my address, and bespoke fifty copies of it which were
                            sent to me at my Son’s house— After dinner at 4. O’Clock, <persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> came

                            out alone to Quincy, reached my house just at the dusk of evening— I
                            sent the Carriage for <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C Smith</persRef> at <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.

                            Morning. She returned in about half an hour; and I spent the Evening in
                            folding up copies of my two addresses to my Constituents at Braintree
                            and at North-Bridgwater, and in reflecting upon the duty that will now
                            devolve upon me, to retire for the short remainder of my days from
                            public life altogether— There are still duties enough to occupy the rest
                            of my time, and to prepare me for my closing scene.</p>

                        <p>Sun rose 6.44. Set 4.44.</p>
                        <p>The Sun rose perfectly clear near the belfry of the Stone temple, by
                            observation in November 1842. I found he rose directly behind the belfry
                            on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>— I shall be gone this year before that
                            day— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached this morning from 1.
                            Corinthians 6:20— “Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which
                            are Gods.” The Chapter from which this text is a clause of the last
                            verse begins with a very severe reproof of the Christians at Corinth for
                            going to Law with one another, not before the Saints their fellow
                            Christians— The <persRef ref="paul">apostle</persRef> declares that the saints shall judge the
                            world—and this principle assumed thus early, and perseveringly pursued
                            was doubtless the cause of the absolute power exercised during so many
                            centuries by the Pope as the head of the Christian church This
                            peremptory injunction never to go to Law with one another before infidel
                            judges, was an unhinging engine which disabled to the extent of its
                            influence all the roman tribunals of their power over the Christian
                            sectarians. The Apostle then proceeds to declare that no person addicted
                            to vicious morals, of person, property or good name shall inherit the
                            kingdom of God. He then passes to a special, solemn, and deeply
                            impressive charge against the sin of fornication, reminding them that
                            other sins are offensive externally to the sinner himself but that this
                            is a sin against his own body— He says they are bought with a price—
                            That each one of them is the Temple of the holy ghost within him; not
                            his own, but the property of God himself— Therefore says he glorify God
                            in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s— This is a doctrine of
                            angelic purity— On returning from meeting I found <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Degrand</persRef> at my house who dined and spent the day and evening with us till
                            9. O’Clock He brought out sundry newspapers, all confirming the fact of
                            the total loss of the Presidential election— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            could.” a Melancholy allusion to the condition of the present times, and
                            to the disastrous issue of the Presidential Election— For the first time
                            he alluded to the dismal prospects before us to the cause of human
                            liberty, and the rights of petition and of protection— And he exhorted
                            all his hearers to enquire of themselves whether they have done what
                            they could for their salvation and preservation— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                        <p>Thick fog in the morning. Thunder and Lightening with a sprinkling of
                            rain in the afternoon— Evening calm, moderate damp cloudy— It was the
                            day of election for Electors of President, and Vice President of the

                            settled my balance there, and then to the town house where I tore off my

                            in the ballot box. I gave my own name which I had torn off to <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey

                            yet not enough so, wholly to resolve my doubts I wrote in the evening a

                        <p>The practice is for each voter to put into the ballot box the whole
                            printed ticket, but every individual strikes out or effaces any name for
                            which he chooses not to vote, and substitutes another name in its place—
                            Candidates usually strike out their own names, but not always. There is
                            no law, authorising the rejection of any man’s vote for himself.— The
                            majority in the town of Quincy at the autumnal elections has been for
                            several years democratic, consisting of transient Stone-cutters from New
                            Hampshire— There were taken yesterday 719 votes. the number of
                            registered voters in the town being 7<space/>Of the returns I only know that
                            there were 345 for me, not a majority of the whole The Boston Atlas and
                            Courier of this morning did not come by the regular mail, but I received
                            a Courier under a blank cover— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> came out from Boston with the
                            Atlas, which has the returns from the whole Commonwealth except six
                            towns— The whig ticket has been sweepingly successful.— The vote in the

                        <p>Confined to the house all the morning by the rain, but without any thing
                            more than the journal of yesterday and making up a file of Letters
                            received within the last three weeks, and which I have not found time to
                            answer, to file, and scarcely to read.— I have now four or five days of
                            leisure—not sufficient to answer a tythe of the Letters which I ought to
                            answer if I could. I did not finish the filing and endorsing of them—
                            <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Angier</persRef> of Medford was here, and I
                            agreed to go and pass the Evening at her house next Friday— At noon I
                            called on <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">Doctor N. L. Frothingham</persRef>, and passed an hour with him
                            examining his <persRef ref="propertius-sextus">Propertius</persRef>— <persRef ref="burman-pieter">Burman’s</persRef> Edition— The best extant— My edition,
                            <persRef ref="baskerville-john">Baskerville’s</persRef> quarto has nothing but the text, and the passage quoted in
                            in <persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving’s</persRef> Letter, is in the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> elegy of
                            the second book—in Burman’s edition it is the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            But we found no explanation of the difference— The Doctor asked me what
                            had so much excited the attention of my mind to this passage of
                            Propertius? I told him it was the quotation of it in G. W. Erving’s
                            Letter, and its whimsical connection of it with the Texas question, and
                            with Erving’s base and treacherous treatment of me I called at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi

                            had promised to go to Medford on Friday, and must therefore postpone our
                            return to Quincy till Saturday At the Boston Courier Office I asked the
                            return of the three newspapers with marked passages cited and inserted
                            in my Address at North-Bridgwater— They sent them to me this afternoon—
                            I found myself after dinner, drowsy and went out again, purchased small
                            toys for <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> <persRef ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4;adams-arthur">four sons</persRef>, and called at <persRef ref="davis-john">judge John Davis’s</persRef>— He asked
                            me to go with him this Evening to the Wednesday evening club of which I
                            was a member in 1790. and again in 1802 and until 1809. It was this
                            Evening at <persRef ref="parkman-francis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Parkman’s</persRef> and I promised to
                            go.— Returning home, I directed <persRef ref="andrews-benjamin">Benjamin<space/>Andrews</persRef> to go at a quarter
                            before eight with the Carriage and take up judge Davis in Milton place
                            and come for me to Charles’s house which he did, and I spent the Evening
                            with the Club at the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Francis Parkman’s— There were about 30 persons present—among whom five
                            or six Strangers— At half past ten I took judge Davis home, and then
                            returned to my Sons house. I found judge Davis exceedingly gratified
                            with my notice of the founders of the Plymouth Colony in my Address at
                            North-Bridgwater.</p>

                            1826. and in the second volume at page 140. I find a review of two
                            Articles; publications at Milan by Angel May of fragments of 6. Orations

                        <p>Morning visits from <persRef ref="otis-harrison">Harrison Gray Otis</persRef>, and <persRef ref="otis-george">George Alexander Otis</persRef>, men
                            between whom there is no community, but of name; with the former of whom
                            I have been in relations of personal intimacy and political controversy
                            little short of three score years— For many years he acted a conspicuous
                            part on the theatre of public affairs, and led in an unfortunate career
                            of policy our native Commonwealth of Massachusetts— The result was to
                            arrest him in his career of ambition, and he never reached beyond the
                            Station of Senator of the United States, which he voluntarily
                            relinquished, to move in the more contracted sphere of Mayor of the City
                            of Boston; from which he also after short experience retired to affluent
                            retirement in private life. He is abundantly wealthy, and has raised a
                            numerous family, only one of whom has ever ventured on the stormy sea of
                            politics, and meeting with adverse gales and some slight disaster,
                            regained the shore and has not attempted a second voyage.— The father
                            takes no longer any part in politics but lives, crippled with the gout,
                            but otherwise in comfort, and the enjoyment of all that this world can
                            afford, with <persRef ref="otis-alleyne2;otis-william">two sons</persRef>, <persRef ref="ritchie-sophia">one married daughter</persRef> and several grand-daughter,
                            awaiting in his 80<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year his transition to Mount
                            Auburn— My acquaintance with George Alexander commenced as a fellow
                            passenger from London to New-York in 1817. Without an early classical
                            education He has devoted his life to the literature of translation,
                            which he has had the good fortune to make profitable. His translation of
                            <persRef ref="botta-carlo">Botta’s</persRef> history was eminently successful, and his Tusculan of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>
                            have not proved a failure. He has unpublished translations of the other
                            philosophical works of Cicero, and of the Offices—and also of <persRef ref="davila-enrico">Davila’s</persRef>

                            the address of 6. November at North-Bridgwater, in the Boston Courier of
                            9. November. These 3 papers embrace my defence against the infamous
                            conspiracy of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, <persRef ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef>, <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron Vail Brown</persRef>, and
                            <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Jared Ingersoll</persRef>. I have by design taken this mode of appealing
                            to my Constituents, to the world and to posterity— My constituents have
                            answered and nobly vindicated my character.— In the same District where
                            in 1842 I received only 5<space/>votes I have now received 8091 and where I
                            had then a majority of less than 500 I have now a majority exceeding
                            1900— The voice of the world and of posterity is yet to be heard.— After
                            a short ride with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, I came out with my

                            After dinner Charles and his two sons returned to Boston— <persRef ref="smith-nathan2">M<hi

                            all his object— He only wished that all his children should see me— He
                            lives in Roxbury—the new part of the town, Eustis Street and does
                            business in Boston, in connection with the great Western Railway.— Of
                            this Class of visitors I have many, but do not feel myself much
                            flattered by their motives. “Dulce est digito monstrari et dicier hic
                            est”—says <persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef>, but it is pleasing only to vanity— The curiosity to
                            see a person of great notoriety imports nothing favourable or friendly
                            to him— It is mere selfish curiosity— This Evening I answered a Letter
                            of <persRef ref="gould-benjamin">B. A. Gould</persRef> and 7 others, a Committee of the Boston Latin School

                        <p>From the S.E. corner of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, the Sun rose one full disk North
                            of the Temple belfry which performed a complete transit over the disk in
                            7 minutes. when the whole disk was behind the pillars of the belfry, the
                            temple clock struck seven— True to the Sun to a minute— Last evening a

                                <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark</persRef>, an Episcopal Clergyman from

                            plan and give him a certificate of my opinion of it.— I told him that I
                            made it a general rule, never to give certificates; and that if I did
                            ever give one I had now no time for the examination— D<hi rend="superscript"

                                >r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached in the Temple from Luke 17.21. [“]For behold,
                            the kingdom of God is within you.” This was the answer of Jesus to the
                            Pharisees who enquired when the kingdom of God should come? It was
                            immediately after the miracle of cleansing of ten lepers, only one of
                            whom returned to glorify God; and he a Samaritan— In the verse
                            immediately preceding the text Jesus says the Kingdom of God cometh not
                            with observation— That is heralded with the sound of a trumpet. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt said it was a Revolution in the human
                            character— That it was the reign of righteousness and truth upon earth—
                            Oh! how far yet from its consummation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s
                            afternoon discourse was from Philippians 4.5— “Let your moderation be
                            known unto all men.”— He expatiated well upon the importance of this
                            precept, as a lesson of Prudence.— It is not only moderation, but
                            notorious universally known moderation— And yet how much more emphatic
                            and solemn is the injunction, with the additional clause of the text,
                            which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt omitted—“The Lord is at hand” That
                            your moderation should be known, is for your own benefit—propitiates the
                            good will of others, and disarms enmity and malice— But the
                            consideration that the Lord is at hand, reminds us our responsibility to
                            God. It is the pure dictate of duty; and whether known to man or not
                            cannot escape the notice of the Lord who is at hand— After Meeting I

                            I gave my English Signet ring with the cock and the motto “Watch” to my

                            them—and afterward of <persRef ref="degrand-peter">P. P. F. Degrand</persRef>, who called in the course of the
                            Evening— We had a pleasant dinner party, enlivened with literary
                            conversation. I received an invitation to an Evening party next Friday
                            from <persRef ref="bacon-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Francis Bacon</persRef> a sister of M<hi rend="superscript"

                            acquaintance— Of course my absence will make my acceptance of the
                            invitation impossible. Before leaving Quincy this morning I planted in
                            the garden, and in one flower pot a basket full of apples, pears,
                            apple-seeds, peach and plum-stones, English-white Oak acorns, and shag
                            bark walnuts from the old garden Summer house tree, which I have been
                            gathering all the Summer and Autumn with the intention of planting them
                            at leisure but no leisure have I had. From the same cause I leave my
                            books and papers in confusion worse confounded— No part of my life has
                            been more totally absorbed by toil than the four months and six days
                            since I last returned from Washington I sent a message to <persRef ref="duggan-william">D<hi

                        <p>I rose in time to finish my journal of yesterday, and to breakfast before
                            half past seven O’Clock— Then took a hack to the depot of the Worcester
                            Railroad, and took passage in the day line by the Long-Island-rail-road
                            to New-York— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> accompanied me to the Car, and took leave of me in
                            it— As did also <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Savage</persRef>— I found there <persRef ref="codman-john">D<hi

                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis</persRef>, delegates, my associates from the
                            Massachusetts historical Society to attend the anniversary celebration
                            of the New-York historical Society, to-morrow. We started precisely at 5
                            minutes past 8 as I supposed for Providence; but it had been the coldest
                            night of the Season, and all the windows of the car were closed, and dew
                            obscured— At 10. O’Clock the Car stop’d and I was surprized to hear we
                            were at Worcester— The stoppage was scarcely for five minutes—and we
                            proceeded in the same cars to Norwich where we crossed over the bridge
                            of the Quinepaug swelling into the Thames; a stupendous work—we followed
                            the Southern bank of the river seven miles down, where the Steamer
                            New-Haven was in waiting to receive us— We noticed as we passed along
                            the region of the Pequod War, and the reserve upon which the remnant of
                            the Mohegan tribe yet dwell 3000 acres, and about 70 Souls.— We passed
                            down the river, stopping at New-London only time enough to take in
                            passengers, and in two hours and a quarter, with a bright Sun a smooth
                            Sea and a chilling Northwester; landed at Greenport a small village on
                            Long-Island— Here we took again the cars, at 3. O’Clock having dined in
                            the boat and at 7 in the Evening alighted at Brooklyn—95 miles in 4
                            hours— We immediately crossed the ferry, took a hack and at half past 7.
                            found ourselves (M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young, with a young Lady <persRef ref="u">Miss

                            <persRef ref="bunker-william">Bunker’s</persRef> hotel or boarding house in Broadway.— Exactly 12 hours from my
                            Son’s house in Boston— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Codman stop’d at Brooklyn—
                            On the road I had much conversation with sundry Strangers, but chiefly
                            with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis, Minister of a Congregational church
                            and Society in Charlestown, and a writer of sundry Articles in <persRef ref="sparks-jared">Sparks’s</persRef>
                            American biography— He is intimately acquainted with the history of the
                            Pequod War, of which he mentioned to me many incidents, and is also much
                            interested in the controversies in which <persRef ref="hutchinson-anne">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

                        <p>The visitors were so numerous and the transactions of the day so various,
                            that they left scarcely a distinct impression upon my mind of any thing—
                            Professor Mason as chairman of the Committee of arrangements of the
                            New-York historical Society came early and informed me of the
                            arrangements for the day. A Committee of 5 members of the Society with
                            <persRef ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> W. Beach Lawrence</persRef>, a Vice-President, came
                            welcomed me to the city— An interlude of no small note was the friendly
                            visit of <persRef ref="bankhead-james">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Bankhead</persRef> to apprize me that <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi

                                    George E. Ellis</persRef> to the Astor-House, where we took up <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            the University where the Meeting of the historical Society was held, the
                            <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">President Albert Gallatin</persRef> being in the Chair. The numbers of the Society
                            are unlimited, and the only business done, was the admission by an open
                            vote sundry members, nominated at a previous meeting; and the nomination
                            of sundry others among whom was John Jacob Astor.— The assembly was
                            quite numerous and thronged the spacious apartment.— They then joined in
                            a procession of Carriages to the Church of the Messiah, of which <persRef ref="dewey-orville">Orville
                                Dewey</persRef> is the Pastor, where an Orati<unclear>on</unclear> was delivered by <persRef ref="brodhead-john2">John Romeyn

                            Holland—of which agency he gave an interesting account; interspersed
                            with several passages of beautiful eloquence— The house is large, and
                            was well filled— The Discourse was preceded by a prayer by <persRef ref="dewitt-thomas">Rev<hi

                            Codman.— From the Church between 8 and 9. O’Clock the Society adjourned
                            to the New-York Hotel where a magnificent dinner was prepared for 300
                            persons— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had not gone to the Church; but
                            presid<unclear>ed</unclear> at the table for about an hour, and then retired before the

                            roasted me with a speech so fulsome that it overset all my philosophy,
                            and I stammered a reply the only palliation of which was its brevity—
                            The speeches followed till sometime passed midnight when I retired with
                            my colleagues Saltonstall, Young and Ellis. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Samuel L. Gouverneur promised to call on me to-morrow Morning at 8

                            was one of my visitors yesterday, and told me of the disastrous
                            accidents which befell <persRef ref="johnson-alexander">his father</persRef> and his brother <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William</persRef> about three
                            weeks since—the father having been thrown out of a Chaise in which he
                            was riding with <persRef ref="johnson-eliza2">his wife</persRef>, and broken one arm, and sprained a wrist— And

                            I said I was— He asked me, if I had received the information from or

                            me the last question was that there had been some days since a

                            when up before.— This morning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gouverneur called
                            on me at 8. And told me that he had according to his recollection a
                            Letter from General Jackson to President Monroe, written at New-York in
                            February 1819. and speaking of the Florida Treaty—as universally

                            boat from New-York to Jersey city formerly Paulus Hook, was<space/><persRef ref="cogswell-jonathan">Cogswell</persRef>
                            who was one of the Students at Harvard University in 1806. when I was
                            installed Professor of Rhetorick and Oratory at that institution— He was
                            one of the Committee of Students who requested a copy for publication of
                            my inaugural address— I believe their chairman, <unclear>. . .</unclear> had then the reputation of being the first
                            scholar at the University— He was then about 20.— He is now, within two
                            or three years of 60— I should not have recognized him, but <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Blunt</persRef> introduced him to me; and he remembered the
                            delivery of my Lectures— His career has been respectable, but not so
                            highly distinguished or successful, as might have been expected. He told
                            me he was now employed by <persRef ref="astor-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Jacob Astor</persRef> as an
                            Agent for carrying into execution his donation of four hundred thousand
                            dollars to the City of New-York, for a library— Our arrival at
                            Philadelphia last evening was delayed by an accident which befell the
                            corresponding train of Cars going from Philadelphia to New-York— Between
                            Princeton and Trenton their locomotive engine ran off the track and
                            stuck in the mud— Their train barred the passage to ours, and we were
                            obliged to change our seats and take others in the train from
                            Philadelphia, to which the accident had happened— The train which we
                            left was taken by the passengers from Philadelphia for whom another
                            engine was procured, and baggage enough to load a ship was mutually
                            transferred. The detention was of about two hours and a half; and
                            <persRef ref="bartlett-william2">professor Bartlett</persRef> more than once reminded me of the melancholy disaster
                            which befell the train of Cars, between Amboy and Bordentown in November
                            1833. when he and <persRef ref="bartlett-harriet">his wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="u;u">two infant daughters</persRef> were fellow
                            passengers.— He said his wife and daughters who were much injured by the
                            accident had all entirely recovered from its effects— This morning

                            Meredith</persRef> of Baltimore dined with us at the Lady’s Ordinary— I received
                            of <persRef ref="rundle-george">George Rundle</persRef>, York Street 61. dollars a final dividend of the
                            Schuylkill permanent bridge stock, and at the Bank of North-America
                            Chesnut Street an order on the Bank of the Metropolis at Washington for
                            240 dollars for 8. Coupons of interest on Cincinnati bonds— In the
                            evening I went to the Chesnut Street Theatre and saw the Hunchback, and

                        <p>Rain all Night— I rose to a minute in time to finish the record of
                            yesterday, to breakfast and walk to the depot in Market street of the
                            Railroad Cars for Baltimore. At 8 O’Clock they started; and at a quarter
                            before 3. landed me in Pratt-street, Baltimore. As the Sun rose the rain
                            held up; and the sky was all the morning clearing off— By the time we
                            reached Baltimore it was throughout the hemisphere crystal clear and so
                            continued for the remnant of the day. I left <persRef ref="andrews-benjamin2">Benjamin F. Andrews</persRef>, my <hi
                                rend="italic">help</hi>, with his spaniel dog at the depot to get
                            his dinner at the United States Hotel, and to take care of the baggage,
                            and walked to <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> for a dinner— Missed my way, and strolled, till I
                            met <persRef ref="rogers-lloyd">Lloyd N. Rogers</persRef>, the first person whom I knew, after leaving <persRef ref="jones-john10">Jones’s</persRef>
                            Union Hotel in Philadelphia.— He walked with me, bewailing all the way
                            the issue of the election and left me at Barnum’s door.— At the Lady’s
                            Ordinary they were at table, and there I met <persRef ref="ballard-henry">Commodore Ballard</persRef> and <persRef ref="ballard-juliana">M<hi

                            their granddaughter</persRef>— The Commodore welcomed me with great cordiality;
                            told me that it was a constant satisfaction to him that I had signed his
                            commission, and remembered as I did, that in May 1836, he had given up
                            at 11. O’Clock at Night his own chamber at Barnum’s, to me for a
                            lodging, when there was not another in the house to be had.— He then
                            took for the Night a bed in the chamber of <persRef ref="dallas-alexander2">Commodore Alexander J. Dallas</persRef>
                            then a fellow lodger here, but recently deceased as commander of the
                            squadron in the pacific. After dinner, I returned to the depot and took
                            a seat in the train of Cars for Washington, which started at 5. O’Clock
                            for Washington City. at the relay house 8. Miles from Baltimore, the

                            soon after 7. by the light of the moon, almost rivaling the noonday.
                            From the depot at the foot of the Capitol hill I walked home, and had
                            scarcely entered the house, when <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> followed
                            me— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef> was confined to her bed, and <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
                            dear wife</persRef>, though not in bed is afflicted with one of those stubborn
                            nervous coughs which seem to deny respite or relief.— And thus on
                            reaching home, I am called to mingle with the notes of gratitude for
                            continued blessings the supplication for further mercies— <persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi

                            spent an hour of the Evening here— And after the visitors were gone, I
                            mused over the prospects before me; with the impression that they
                            portend trials more severe than I yet have passed through—and with a
                            reliance alone on him who rules above.</p>

                        <p><persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was quite ill great part of this day, but promisingly better this
                            Evening.— I gave her this morning the signet ring which I purchased for
                            her in Boston, upon the Cornelian stone of which <persRef ref="mitchell-francis">Mitchell</persRef> engraved the
                            crest of the Lion bearing the cross, and under it the Letter A. with the
                            hair of our Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> in a box under the stone— And I
                            gave to my granddaughter <persRef ref="">Mary Louisa</persRef> the signet ring which I procured
                            for her, and on which Mitchell engraved the cock, with the motto
                            “Watch”— And for the significancy of the device, at my request she read
                            to me the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Mark—the last verse of
                            which is—And what I say unto you, I say unto all, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Watch.</hi> I attended public worship this morning at the second
                            presbyterian church, where <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> preached from
                            Luke 19.41. “And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept
                            over it.”— There was something deeply saddening in this discourse. Jesus
                            wept over the city because he foresaw and foretold the destruction of it
                            which was so soon afterwards to ensue. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox
                            remarked that there but two occasions in the life of Jesus, upon which
                            it is recorded that he wept— This, and at the death of <persRef ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> before he
                            restored him to life— That these tears were indications of the purest
                            benevolence, and the most exquisite tenderness; all which is apparent—
                            But the destruction of Jerusalem has no observable connection with their
                            treatment of Jesus Christ. Judea was conquered by the Romans as other
                            Nations were, and in the process of that conquest Jerusalem was taken
                            and the second temple was destroyed— In foretelling this event Jesus
                            affirms that if Jerusalem had repented and believed in him, she would
                            not have suffered that dreadful fate; but the Judean war of <persRef ref="vespasian">Vespasian</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="titus">Titus</persRef> had no earthly connection with the life and death of Jesus of
                            Nazareth. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox in the application of his
                            discourse, put it, as an awful question to his hearers whether this city
                            was not as guilty, and as deserving of the afflictive judgment of Heaven
                            as Jerusalem was in the days of Jesus Christ; but he did not specify the
                            sins which may draw down destruction upon it— Slavery is the great
                            besetting sin of this city; but of that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox took
                            no note— He complained that of 25 or 26 thousand inhabitants, not more
                            than 3000 attended upon any religious exercises of public worship, a
                            fact that seems incredible but otherwise the sins of this city are not
                            more aggravated than those of the age in other populous cities, and that
                            the vices of the age, and the sins of this Nation deserve a severe
                            judgment of Heaven is too painfully true to be denied— May that judgment
                            be averted, and the manners of the age and nation be reformed and
                            purified. After dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
                            church where <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for
                            the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and <persRef ref="slaughter-philip">M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>I arrived here on Saturday Evening with a clear sky, bright moonlight,
                            and the atmosphere of May rather than of November— Yesterday Morning it
                            was yet warm; but the wind came round to the North-west and it was all
                            day growing cold; and as I was returning from church last evening,
                            between 5 and 6. O’Clock, I saw the moon just risen with the shadow of
                            the earth already encroaching upon her disk— The eclipse was total and
                            lasted upwards of three hours but the cold was so pinching that I could
                            look at it only once or twice; and then less than five minutes at a
                            time— This day has been of bright clear disqualifying cold— I unpacked
                            my trunks, and immediately missed one or two articles, precisely those I
                            wanted and left behind— It made a day of fruitless search and of wasted
                            time. I walked out for exercise, and at the National Intelligencer
                            Office saw <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> in deep distress at the issue
                            totally unexpected issue of the Presidential election— He is in despair
                            and foresees that it must prove his irretrievable ruin. It has been
                            accomplished by fraud through the Slave representation.— The partial
                            associations of native americans, Irish catholics, abolition Societies,
                            Liberty party.— The <persRef ref="gregory-xvi">Pope of Rome</persRef>, the Democracy of the sword, and the
                            dotage of a ruffian, are sealing the fate of this Nation, which nothing
                            less than the interposition of omnipotence can save. I asked M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales to send me the Intelligencer, from the 14<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> which he did, and I sent him the Boston Atlas of
                            2. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> and the Courier of 9. November containing
                            my addresses at Braintree and at North Bridgwater which he had no read—
                            After I came home, <persRef ref="nourse-michael">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Michael Nourse</persRef> a ruling elder
                            of the second Presbyterian Church called on me and enquired if I would
                            consent to go as a delegate from that Church and Society, to the Sabbath
                            day Convention to be held at Baltimore next Wednesday. I said I should
                            feel honoured by the election, but doubted whether it would be in my
                            power to go. The meeting of the Society was held at half past four this
                            afternoon— I did not attend it but in the Evening the <persRef ref="knox-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
                                >d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Nourse came as a Committee from the Meeting to inform me that I had been
                            elected a delegate from the Society to the Convention. I expressed my
                            grateful sensibility for the honour conferred upon me, and promised to
                            attend the Convention, if it should be in my power. I know not if this
                            acceptance be prudent, but as an act of kindness to the Society and a
                            testimony of respect for the Sabbath I believed it proper.</p>

                            October 1845—for 197:78. For all these M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> P Boyd
                            imploringly calls for 300 dollars immediately, to save her and her

                        <p>At 5. I breakfasted, and rode to the depot of the train of Cars for
                            Baltimore— Met there the <persRef ref="laurie-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Laurie</persRef>, and <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> whom I informed that <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
                            being better I had concluded to come to Baltimore, and attend the
                            Sabbath day convention At 6. we started and at a quarter past 8.
                            alighted at the depot in Baltimore— I walke to <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel, and
                            bespoke a bed chamber. Met there <persRef ref="chambers-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chambers</persRef> of
                            Chambersburg and <persRef ref="denny-harmar">Harmar Denny</persRef> of Pittsburg and <persRef ref="newkirk-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Newkirk</persRef> of Philadelphia, and sundry others delegates to the Convention—
                            At a quarter before 10 M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox called for me, and I
                            went with him to the first Baptist Church in Sharp Street which we found
                            filled with about 1200 delegates to the National Lord’s day Convention—
                            <persRef ref="hammer-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hanmer</persRef> the Minister of the Church moved that
                            <persRef ref="hall-willard">judge Willard Hall</persRef> of Delaware should be chairman of the meeting to
                            organize the Convention which was voted by acclamation and he took the
                            Chair. Two Secretaries were chosen and a Committee of 5. <persRef ref="waugh-beverly">Bishop Waugh</persRef>,
                            <persRef ref="bond-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond</persRef>, <persRef ref="stillman-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stilman</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            appointed to submit officers and rules for the government of the
                            Convention— While they were out, <persRef ref="powell-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Powell</persRef> of
                            Philadelphia was requested to address the meeting which notwithstanding
                            some objections he did— The Committee soon came in and reported John
                            Quincy Adams, President—seven Vice Presidents 1. Willard Hall, 2.

                            nominations were approved by an unanimous vote— I took the Chair and
                            made a very brief address to the Convention; and the Committee on
                            Officers and rules made a supplementary report of 8 rules— The first of
                            which was that the Convention should meet at 9. A.M—sit till 1 p.m.
                            adjourn till 3. P.M adjourn at 5. and meet again at 7. P.M.— There was
                            some discussion whether the question should be taken upon all the rules
                            at once, or upon each rule separately—after some debate a motion was
                            made to take one question upon all the rules, which was carried by a
                            large majority and they were adopted with only two or three dissenting
                            votes— There was much discussion about a roll call of the members, and
                            after an attempt <pb n="524" type="ms"/>to read over the names which it
                            was found would consume more time than the Convention could spare a
                            committee of enrolment was appointed, to whom all members having
                            credentials were authorised to present them and members having no
                            credentials were to be accredited upon their own declaration— A Letter
                            from T. Frelinghuysen was read regretting his inability to attend the
                            convention, whereupon <persRef ref="clarke-james">James Clarke</persRef> was appointed 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                            Vice President in his place— Bishop Waugh, Methodist read a Letter
                            addressed to the Convention with enclosed papers, but a Committee had
                            been appointed to report the business to be acted upon by the
                            Convention; and a rule required that all communications addressed to the
                            Convention should be referred to the business Committee— They reported
                            seven Resolutions the first of which was a general one, avering the duty
                            of all men to remember the Sabbath and keep it holy. This started a
                            snarling debate <persRef ref="lemmon-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemmon</persRef>, a delegate from
                            Baltimore, and <persRef ref="magruder-allan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Magruder</persRef> of Virginia, who insisted
                            that the Sabbath being an abrogated Jewish institution, in no wise
                            binding upon Christians. This was in substance nothing more than an
                            objection to the use of the word Sabbath, instead of the Lords day; but
                            they misunderstood it as an infidel attempt to break up the Convention
                            itself— Attempts were made to silence M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemmon and
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Magruder— They were repeatedly called to
                            order; Magruder was loudly hissed, and there were numerous calls to turn
                            him out. I maintained them both in their right to speak, until they were
                            heard through— A motion was made to lay M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemmon’s
                            amendment on the table, and question made whether that motion was
                            debatable. I decided that it was, there being no rule to the contrary—
                            It was accordingly warmly debated till the time for adjournment,
                            immediately before which the question was taken and M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lemmon’s amendment was laid on the table by an apparently
                            unanimous vote. At 1. O’Clock the Convention adjourned till 3.— As we
                            were retiring M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemmon put into my hand a printed
                            paper, headed, Report for the Lord’s day Convention— I had forgotten in
                            packing up my valise, to put in it—a pen—which reminded me of La gageure
                            imprévue. I stop’d at a shop, and purchased a paper of Camel steel
                            pens.— At Barnum’s they had dinner at 1/2 past 2. I found myself seated
                            by <persRef ref="rogers-lloyd">Lloyd N. Rogers</persRef>, but was obliged to leave the table, dinner half
                            over, to take the Chair of the Convention at 3.— The first and 7. other
                            resolutions offered by the business Committee were now passed in quick
                            succession by unanimous votes before Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Lemmon
                            and Magruder came in— The Convention adjourned from 5 to 7. and sat
                            again from 7 to 10.— The house crowded to its utmost capacity. Adjourned
                            to 9. to-morrow morning</p>

                        <p>I could not comprize in one page the journal of yesterday, nor finish the
                            account of the day before breakfast— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> had charged me to procure
                            for her two handsome picture frames for the portraits of her eldest
                            sister, <persRef ref="hellen-ann">Nancy</persRef>, the first M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hellen and of herself
                            painted by <persRef ref="savage-edward">Savage</persRef>, before they were married— I went accordingly to the
                            shop of <persRef ref="fryer-es">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fryer</persRef> in Gay Street— My wife had named
                            him to me, and the bar-keeper at <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> had assured me that his shop
                            was the best shop for that Article in the City— I found and bespoke the
                            two frames for 20 dollars and directed them to be sent to the depot of
                            the rail-road Cars, boxed up—this afternoon or to-morrow morning as I
                            should thereafter advise— Precisely at 9. O’Clock I took the Chair of
                            the Convention, of whom very few members were present <persRef ref="waugh-beverly">Bishop Waugh</persRef> of
                            the methodist episcopal church made the prayer kneeling— The <persRef ref="edwards-justin">Rev<hi

                            presented successively a number of resolutions all having reference to
                            the observance of the Lord’s day; and three several addresses to the
                            Canal Commissioners to the Directors of Railroads, and to the People of
                            the United States, all of which were read and adopted by the Convention
                            without debate— Sundry members of the Convention offered separate
                            Resolutions, which were referred to the business committee, then
                            reported by them with such modifications as they thought advisable then
                            read and adopted without opposition— In this way Resolutions
                            recommending to innkeepers to close their barrooms on Sundays— To the
                            officers of the army, exhorting them not to exact military service from
                            the soldiers on that day, and a recommendation to the ministers of the
                            gospel to preach a sermon once every year urging the faithful observanc
                            of the day.— and there was a resolution expressing the regret of the
                            Convention, that Congress should have within the last few years
                            repeatedly have transacted public business on Sunday. As the essential
                            business of the Convention was done, I resolved to return home this
                            evening, and thinking it fair to leave <persRef ref="hall-willard">judge Hall</persRef> a turn to preside, I
                            took leave of the Convention before adjourning at 1. O’Clock, upon which
                            they passed a vote of thanks— I dined at Barnum’s—excused myself to <persRef ref="kennedy-john">J.

                        <p>I called this morning at the Bank of the Metropolis—and deposited the
                            order from the Bank of North America, for 240 dollars, which was entered
                            to my credit as cash, and they gave me a new Bank-book, as I have
                            mislaid my old one. Next at the Franklin Insurance Company Office I
                            recived a dividend of 316.75 which I deposited in the Patriotic Bank— At
                            the National Intelligencer Office I saw <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef>,
                            and returned two papers of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 19<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month of which they had sent me
                            duplicates but they had not a spare copy of the paper of 28 September
                            last which is yet missing from my file— I brought up my journal but
                            could write nothing else— From breakfast time till past noon upwards of
                            three hours I was swallowed up in reading Newspapers, received this
                            morning— The Baltimore Patriot of Yesterday, and Sun of this day contain
                            detailed reports of the proceedings of the Lord’s day Convention till
                            their final adjournment last evening— In the Boston Semi-weekly
                            Advertiser of Wednesday the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> received under a
                            cover endorsed <persRef ref="ellis-george">George E. Ellis</persRef>, there is a report of the proceedings at
                            the 40<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> anniversary of the New-York historical
                            Society on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> doubtless written by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis himself, and in a spirit of kindness to me.—

                            received under cover without indication from whom, there is a Letter
                            dated at Quincy—Mass<hi rend="superscript">tts.</hi> 23. November 1844. signed
                            E. M. and giving an account of a visit to the grave yard at Quincy, and
                            to the houses and chambers in which <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and myself were born— Of

                            discourses with my hour glass hymn— All these papers I read with a deep
                            interest—was it egotism? vanity? pride? or excusable weakness If so, may
                            it be forgiven!— I had a long visit from <persRef ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Pakenham</persRef>, the Minister from Great Britain— He said there had not been
                            one line of correspondence between <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and
                            him since the close of the last Session of Congress—nor to his knowledge
                            between <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett</persRef> and the British
                            Government— He appears to apprehend no collision between the two
                            Governments— <persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Richard D. Cutts</persRef> was here this afternoon, and <persRef ref="fendall-philip">Philip R.
                            Fendall</persRef> in the Evening— I gave him the newspaper copies of my three
                            Addresses to the young men of Boston; to my constituents at Braintree
                            and at North-Bridgwater. He is one of the very few men who will read
                            them all.— A young man from Lowell by the name of <persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Whittemore</persRef> was here in
                            great want.</p>

                        <p>There is a great variety of business, public and private which passes
                            over from one session of Congress to the next, and of which I have found
                            it extremely difficult and not unfrequently impossible to keep the
                            thread. In the intervals between the Sessions individuals apply for
                            pensions, for petitions to Congress or pension claims new or old before
                            Congress or the Executive Departments— I have kept since 1835 a docket
                            of petitions, which have absorbed a vast portion of my time, besides
                            publishing lists of them in the National Intelligencer— A want of system
                            in keeping a day-book of all business under my charge whether before
                            Congress or the departments has often made me lose sight of particular
                            cases, and had the appearance and the results of neglect. Instead of
                            keeping one continuous book I have scattered my minutes and memoranda
                            over numerous quires of paper, and know not where to look for the one, I
                            happen at any time to want.— I found this morning on my files of papers,
                            three applications for pensions, and two for Cadet warrants, which
                            required my immediate attention. 1. The declaration of Mary Jennison of
                            Boston, widow of <persRef ref="jennison-william">William Jennison</persRef> 2. The Declaration of <persRef ref="allen-hannah">Hannah Allen</persRef>,
                            heretofore widow of <persRef ref="thayer-zebulon">Zebah Thayer</persRef>—now of Roxbury—and 3. A Letter from
                            <persRef ref="benedict-joseph">Joseph Benedict</persRef>—dated Utica 3. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1844. claiming
                            a pension for <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef>, for service of <persRef ref="u">his grandfather</persRef>— The papers of
                            these three claims I took to the Pension Office, and left them with the
                            <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner James L. Edwards</persRef>, who promised answers to them— I met <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> who has removed to the seven buildings and I
                            returned the visit of <persRef ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham</persRef>, the Minister from
                            Great Britain— He told me he had made very little progress with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> in the Negotiation for the Oregon. And he
                            avowed the claim of Great Britain to the Columbia river— I received a
                            Letter of 4 November current from <persRef ref="joy-george">George Joy</persRef>, Pentonville, London with
                            sundry documents printed and manuscript, and I wrote to <persRef ref="rundle-george">George Rundle</persRef> to
                            enclose the certificates of Schuylkill bridge Stock.</p>
