						<p>The old proverb of March coming in like a Lion and going out like a Lamb
							has been this year reversed. March came in very gently, but after a
							heavy rain last Friday night and Saturday morning, a Northwester swept
							off all the clouds and a sharp frost last night has blighted all the
							Apricot blossoms just opened in beauty.— This is the anniversary week of
							the National Institute for which such an ostentatious parade of
							preparation has been made. The members of the Institute, and the
							scientific Strangers attending here by invitation from the Society met
							at ten this morning at the Library chamber of the Treasury department. I
							went there as a member, and as a delegate with <persRef
								ref="choate-rufus">Rufus Choate</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C. Winthrop</persRef> from the
							Massachusetts antiquarian Society. I delivered the credentials to the
							Secretary of the Institute <persRef ref="markoe-francis2">Francis
								Markoe</persRef> with a Letter from <persRef ref="hinde-thomas"
								>Thomas S. Hinde</persRef>— The meeting was numerous and they
							marched in procession, with the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President of
								the United States</persRef>, as Patron of the Institute at their
							head to the presbyterian church, in 4 1/2 street where he presided and
								<persRef ref="walker-robert">Robert J Walker</persRef> the Senator
							from Mississippi delivered the Anniversary Address. He was followed by
								<persRef ref="draper-john">Professor Draper</persRef> of New-York
							and <persRef ref="loomis-elias">professor Loomis</persRef> of Ohio with
							scientific essays— I left the chamber at the Treasury Department before
							the President of the United States came in, to attend my duty at the
							house where I expected to present the Resolves of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts against the annexation of Texas— It was the day for the
							receipt of petitions and Memorials among which are included the
							Resolutions of State Legislatures— But this had been superseded by the
							assignment of this and the two succeeding days for the consideration of
							business relating to the Territories.— The Committee of the whole was
							discharged from the consideration of sundry territorial bills which had
							been referred to it, and they were referred to the Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union. Several new Bills came in to <unclear>. . .</unclear>ed and
							referred—to the same Committee— The house then went into that Committee
							and rapidly drove through numerous bills till they came to one
							authorising the President of the United States to sell the reserved lead
							mines, in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin which started a long and a sharp
							debate— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved an
							amendment requiring a preliminary survey and examination of the value of
							the lands, but it was rejected.— The purpose of the bill is to enable
							the squatters to obtain for 1 dollar and 35 cents an acre, lands worth
							at least ten dollars an acre— The bill was however arrested for the day
							on the question of engrossment and the house adjourned</p>

							Manufactures Present all the members except <persRef ref="davis-garrett"
								>Garrett Davis</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morse read
							his report, which occupied about one hour in reading. Sample’s motion
							made at the last meeting that a list of the Petitions referred to the
							Committee and reported upon, should be appended to the journal, was
							discussed and on taking the question by yeas and nays, Adams Giddings,
							Sample and Morse voted ay— Burke, Burt, Lucas and Ingersoll voted no. At
							my request Davis was sent for to give the casting vote, but was not
							found; whereupon Ingersoll moved with some immaterial modification the
							same resolution and it was carried against the votes of Burke, Burt, and
							Lucas— I was then instructed to report to the house, the Resolution that
							the Amendment to the Constitution proposed by the Resolves of the
							Legislature of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended; and the
							resolution asking that the Committee should be discharged from the
							further consideration of the subject; and the journal and the Committee
							adjourned without day—each member to present his own report to the
							house— Ingersoll however had not made up the journal, and no opportunity
							for presenting the report to the house occurred, this day— In the house
							it was the second day for the consideration of business relating to the
							territories, and the bills were despatched with so much expedition first
							in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> in the chair, and then in the
							house that soon after two O’Clock all the territorial bills were cleared
							off from the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker’s</persRef> table— But
							there had been some previous debate on a bill to authorise the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President of the United States</persRef> to sell
							the lead mines in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin upon which a motion of
								<persRef ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef> to lay the bill

						<p>Sleepless Night.</p>
						<p>After the decision of the house yesterday on the Resolutions reported
							from the select Committee on the Resolves of the Massachusetts
							Legislature, and the postponement to this day of the motion to print all
							the reports and the journal of the Committee; the house was engaged the
							rest of the day in a very warm debate on the bill authorising the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to sell the lead mines
							in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, which on the question of engrossment
							was rejected by yeas and nays 69 to 81—upon which a motion of
							reconsideration was immediately made, and lies over— In the evening I
							attended the meeting of the National Institute at the Presbyterian
							Church in 4 1/2 Street, and heard a Discourse by <persRef
								ref="bache-alexander">A. D. Bache</persRef> on the history of
							Science in Europe and America—an Essay on the Indian Summer by <persRef
								ref="jacobs-michael">Professor Jacobs</persRef> of Gettysburg,
							Pennsylvania; and an account of the petrified forest near Cairo in Egypt
							by <persRef ref="chaloner-aaron">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. D.
								Chaloner</persRef> of Philadelphia— The Secretary of the Treasury
								<persRef ref="spencer-john">J. C. Spencer</persRef> presided at the
							meeting and the new Secretary of State <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John
								C. Calhoun</persRef> was there I shook hands with him in silence—
							The weather is intensely warm and I passed the night without closing my
							eyes— At 2 in the morning I rose and forced my hand to write, struggling
							with the angel of death for two hours— Then returned to bed for two more
							sleepless hours— At half past 10 this morning, with <persRef
								ref="abbott-amos;baker-osmyn;hudson-charles;rockwell-julius">four
								other members</persRef> of the Massachusetts delegation I met in the
							chamber of the Committee of Manufactures the Mormon agent <persRef

								ref="page-john2">Page</persRef>, who set forth at large the grounds
							of their complaints against the Government and People of Missouri, and
							the persecutions for relief from which their memorials claim the
							interposition of Congress— The power of Congress to interfere is
							questionable— The right is doubtful. The memorials must be presented by
							a member from Illinois, and we agreed to act upon them, as the proper
							sense of our duties would require.— At the house, after long and wide
							spreading debate the bill to regulate the pay of the army was passed by
							yeas and nays 109 to 36— The reports from the Committee on the
							Massachusetts Resolves were in despite of <persRef ref="burt-armistead"
								>Burt</persRef> ordered to be printed, 85 to 60. And the joint
							Resolution from the Senate to close the Session on the 27<hi

							till the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of that month.</p>

							again to a sleepless bed— Again I rose about two in the morning, and
							forced my shaking hand to write till the dawn of day between 4 and 5
							where I returned to bed, and in wakeful slumber lay till after Sunrise—
							At the house this morning— The order for printing ten thousand extra
							copies of <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
								Ingersoll’s</persRef> minority report on the tariff, from the
							Committee of Ways and Means, was after a mean struggle to suppress it,
							extorted from a two thirds vote— It is but half the number, already

								ref="tibbatts-john">John W. Tibbatts</persRef> of the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> congregational district of Kentucky
							moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to
							take up the bill making appropriations for the improvement of certain
							harbours and rivers. <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef> pleaded
							for the private claimants in vain— The house went into Committee,
								<persRef ref="boyd-linn">Linn Boyd</persRef> in the chair, and the

								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>, and his

							with another hour of railing by <persRef ref="bowlin-james">James B.

						<p>The loss of sleep—the agitation of nerves, and the multitude and variety
							of calls upon me upon business public and private constantly pressing

							claims; settled three or four times, all more than twenty years ago, and

							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson that I had some remembrance
							that the name of Della Francia was one of those for whom settlement was
							made with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kemper; but that all the

								Everett</persRef> also called on me this morning. He is here in
							attendance on the meetings of the National Institute, and is to deliver

							first business was a motion of <persRef ref="tibbatts-john"
								>Tibbatts</persRef> to take the bill making appropriations for
							certain harbours and rivers out of Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union this day at two O’Clock which was carried— Then <persRef
								ref="seymour-david">David L. Seymour</persRef> of Troy, New-York,
							made his separate minority report from the Committee of Ways and Means,
							on the Tariff; and 10000 extra copies of it were ordered to be printed—
							The house then went into committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union on the river and harbour bill, and then commenced the jarring and
							sparring of the western members for addition of appropriations—not a
							river, not a creek, not a nook or corner from Pittsburgh to Galvezton,
							but was to be stuffed with sweetmeats from the Treasury besides 3 times
							75000 dollars for the Cumberland road and 25000 dollars for a bridge
							over the Ohio— At 2 O’Clock the debate ceased and the voting to reject
							amendments commenced, and continued till past 4. O’Clock, when the bill
							with sundry amendments was reported to the house but could not get no
							further now. The house adjourned— The account was this day received of
							the death of <persRef ref="moore-heman">Heman Allen Moore</persRef> late

								Markoe</persRef>, called on me this morning, and urged me with so
							much importunity to preside at one of the meetings of the National
							Institute, to-morrow, the last day of the anniversary week, that after
							stating to them the condition of my health disqualifying me for
							presiding over any public meeting, I finally yielded to their
							intreaties; and consented to preside at the morning meeting— As the
							house of Representatives will only meet to receive notice of the decease
							of <persRef ref="moore-heman">Heman Allen Moore</persRef> the member
							from Columbus Ohio, to hear his funeral eulogy, and to pass the usual
							honorary resolutions and adjourn— In the hall of the house of
							Representatives I heard a sermon by <persRef ref="caswell-alexis"
								>Professor Caswell</persRef> of Brown University—Providence—from
							Psalm 97.1. “The Lord reigneth: let the earth rejoice”—the remainder of
							the verse “let the multitude of isles be glad thereof”—was not included
							in the text— It is but the repetition of the same idea—the natural
							propensity of joyous exultation— This precept to rejoice in the
							omnipotence of God is founded upon the tacit prejudication that he
							reigns in righteousness, and overrules all evil for good— But if the
							power of God is manifested in destruction, how can we rejoice? If Satan
							triumphs over truth and justice how can we rejoice? In humble
							resignation to the will of God, we may submit to afflictive
							dispensations without a murmur, confiding in the hope that justice will
							at last prevail; but are joy and sorrow at our command? The text seems
							so to presuppose— The theme is copious, and was not thoroughly explored
							by Professor Caswell— His text was regularly divided into the boundless
							power of God; easily illustrated—and the duty to rejoice for it, the
							only contestible point of the doctrine, but which the professor neither
							contested, nor stated the objections by which it is contested— The
							auditory was thin, and the Sermon not unacceptable— <persRef

							called at my house and returned and sat with me, about an hour— From the
							tenour of his conversation I infer that his instructions are to preserve
							peace at all hazards— That he will in no event interpose any objection
							to the annexation of Texas, but will rather favour it— That he will come
							to another evasive compromise about the surrender of fugitive slaves—
							That he will be quite conciliatory upon the Oregon controversy leaving
							something unsettled and yielding as much as may be necessary to appease
							the South, reserving his victory for the demolition of the tariff and
							free trade— This afternoon I attended church at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley,
							read the evening service for Easter—and half the Easter day Homily, for
							a Sermon—</p>

								Forward</persRef> of Pittsburgh called on me this morning, deeply
							concerned, and anxiously adverse, as I had found him last November at
							Pittsburgh against the annexation of Texas to this Union— To his
							enquiries as to the prospects of this event at present I could give no
							answer—though I now see it doomed beyond the reach of all but almighty
							power, and despair of that— The impulse of national aggrandizement,
							spurred by private avarice and corruption cannot be resisted; and it
							will now be consummated even without a War—with the connivance, if not
							with the aid of England. Morning visits also from <persRef

								<persRef ref="moore-heman">Heman Allen Moore</persRef> of Columbus

								ref="burke-edmund4">Burke’s</persRef> what shadows we are, and what
							shadows we pursue— The usual mortuary resolutions were adopted, and the

							apologising for my non attendance at the morning meetings of the last
							week, and expressing my regret at the very little service I have been
							able to render to the Institute— If the last week had been my own, and I
							could have lengthened this address to half an hour, I should have given

								Lambden</persRef> is a painter usually residing at Philadelphia, who
							two or three years ago painted a portrait of me, and from whom I have
							not since heard till this morning, when he called on me, and requested
							me, to sit for him again— He has the portrait still, and says it has
							been much approved as a likeness, by all persons acquainted with me who
							have seen it— He has made a copy of it, which he intends to present to
							the astronomical Society of Cincinnati and wishes me to give him one or
							two sittings for finishing touches to the present time. I agreed to meet
							him to-morrow morning at 10 O’Clock at his room in the capitol. On my
							way to the house I stop’d at the Globe Office, and gave directions to
							the compositor <persRef ref="haliday-james">Haliday</persRef> for the
							printing of the Reports on the Massachusetts Resolves— I spoke for 100
							extra copies of mine—and gave directions for the printing of the whole.
							The original manuscript of the journal in <persRef

							having been retained by <persRef ref="french-benjamin">B. B.
								French</persRef>, supposing that my copy of it would be sufficient
							for the printing— But I directed, that the print should be from the

							send it to the printing Office— I found the house in Session; and taking
							the yeas and nays on a motion to reconsider a vote of yesterday,
							rejecting a proposal of the Committee on the public buildings to
							appropriate 1000 dollars from the contingent fund of the house and
							authorise the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">clerk</persRef> to contract
							for illuminating the hall with the <persRef ref="drummond-thomas"

								>Simons</persRef> chairman of the Committee on engraving—proposing
							the engraving; in debate upon which <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave

								Todsen</persRef> called on me this morning. I had not seen him for
							more than a year. He is still as he was then indigent and unemployed.
							Sickly and destitute, but I have not the means of relieving him— I
							promised to take out of the Congress library for him the life of
								<persRef ref="beethoven-ludwig">Beethoven</persRef> the musical
							performer; but forgot to perform my promise— At 10 O’Clock I repaired to
							the Capitol and gave a sitting of an hour to <persRef
								ref="lambdin-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lambden</persRef>— His former portrait was there, and is one of the
							strongest likenesses that has ever been taken of me. He has also
							likenesses of <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="wilkins-william">W. Wilkins</persRef> and the Senators
								<persRef ref="mangum-willie">Mangum</persRef> of North-Carolina, and
								<persRef ref="morehead-james">Morehead</persRef> of Kentucky.— When
							I went into the house I found <persRef ref="brown-william12">William J.
								Brown</persRef>, of Indianapolis, one of the demi-demons of
							democracy which make a pandemonium of the house closing, under the guise
							of a personal explanation a renewed furious charge against <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> of having said in one of his
							speeches that there was no need of protection— He had made the same
							charge one day last week, and it had been taken up, and convicted of
							forgery by <persRef ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> of Kentucky—
							He had then been compelled to retract the charge, and to apologize for
							it— But he had now got another Report of a Speech of Clay, in which he
							said there was no need of protection for protection; and upon this he
							had the impudence to renew the charge and to rail like a maniac against
							Clay— White claimed the right to reply—and carried it by suspension of
							the rules; and again floored Brown, till he gasped for breath, convicted
							him of rascally slander, and left not a rag of reputation upon his back—
							But no man thinks the worse of Brown for this sample of his character
							and he will be ready to do his dirty work again to morrow, as if nothing
							had happened— Reports form Committees were then received and four were
							made by <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>
							from the Committee of foreign Affairs— One of these was a slave tainted
							sacrifice to the claim of the <persRef ref="beurman-fidencio">Spanish
								Minister</persRef> of indemnity for the Amistad— Another against all
							political intercourse with Hayti— Ingersoll moved to print ten thousand
							extra copies of the Amistad Report— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> moved to go in to Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, to take up the Tariff-bill—lost by yeas and nays 85
							to 87. <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef>
							moved to suspend the rules for a resolution to postpone the tariff bill
							till the last Tuesday in December next— Call of the house— Dromgoole
							moved to strike out next December and insert tomorrow lost 90 to 92.
							Joseph R. Ingersoll’s motion lost 83 to 100.— Message from the President
							on the Rhode-Island Insurrection— Referred to the select Committee of
							5—adjourned at half past 4.</p>

						<p>Midsummer heat— Trees in full blossom </p>
						<p>Notice had been given yesterday in the daily Journals that <persRef
								ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley</persRef>
							the chaplain of the house of Representatives, would this day at the
							request of the friends of the late <persRef ref="moore-heman">Heman
								Allen Moore</persRef>, deliver a funeral discourse upon his decease—
							The hall was well filled, in the expectation of hearing him, but
								<persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef>, the chaplain to the Senate informed the auditory
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley had been taken ill, and from
							indisposition was unable to attend. The <persRef ref="roberts-james2"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> James A Roberts</persRef> of
							New-Bedford made the prayer, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin
							himself preached a sermon of an hour, from John 5.40. “And ye will not
							come to me, that ye <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have life.” A variation
							from the ordinary grammatical construction of the sentence which should
							be that ye <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have life— This chapter contains
							the account of the man healed at the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath
							day, a circumstance excessively offensive to the Jews at
							Jerusalem—whereupon Jesus thus expostulated with them— Toward the close
							of his discourse M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin involved himself
							in a labyrinth of discussion to reconcile free will and predestination,
							which he was quite unable to adjust— Immediately after dinner I received
							visits from the Minister of Great Britain <persRef
								ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pakenham</persRef>, and his Secretary <persRef ref="bidwell-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bidwell</persRef>— With M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham I had some conversation— I
							enquired if his negotiation with our Government on the subject of the
							Oregon territory had commenced. He said it had not.— But he said that he
							had made an explicit declaration to our Department of State that the
							British Government would in no respect interfere in the affairs of
							Texas; and he spoke of it as some what extraordinary that the fact had
							been publicly denied in the Madisonian, the official daily journal of
							the Executive— He said he had thought of addressing a note to the
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of State</persRef> on the
							subject. But he manifested no feeling on the signature of the Treaty for
							the annexation of Texas to the United States, and left me with the
							impression that Great Britain would oppose no resistance to its
							consummation— I attended public worship this afternoon at the second
							Presbyterian Church where <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> preached from 1.
							Timothy 2.5 “For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men,
							the man Christ Jesus.” The necessity of a mediation by God, between God
							and man, for the salvation of men is like predestination and free will;
							hard to be understood.— <persRef ref="child-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> David L. Child</persRef> was here this
							Evening. He says there will be War with Mexico— I doubt—</p>

						<p>Early this morning <persRef ref="livermore-harriet">Harriet
								Livermore</persRef> made her appearance here for the fourth time
							within the last twenty years, with a book which within the last six
							months, she has published at a cost of nearly 200 dollars, and for which
							there is no sale; and with a manuscript to publish which she comes to
							solicit subscriptions.— And while she is spending money profusely to
							print books which no body will purchase or read, she is so totally
							destitute that last Christmas day in New-York she had only three
							borrowed potatoes and half an ounce of dry bread for nourishment, and
							threw herself on a bed to die of hunger unless relieved by the special
							interposition of God—which came in the person of a female acquaintance
							who ministered to her wants— She breakfasted with us, and I took her
							printed book, and subscribed for the printing of the manuscript, giving
							her a five dollar bill for the whole— But I dissuaded her from printing
							the manuscript, and declined drawing up a subscription paper for her, as
							she requested. She told me she wished to preach in the Hall of the House
							of Representatives next Sunday, and I promised to aid in obtaining for
							her the permission. <persRef ref="darby-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Darby</persRef> was here to discourse concerning
							his payment of half a year’s rent for the house of which he has a lease
							from me—but he prevaricated so that I could only refer him to <persRef

								<persRef ref="hubbell-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William S. Hubbell</persRef> of the 30<hi rend="superscript"

								Eddy</persRef> of New Jersey; and the <persRef ref="foster-aaron"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Aaron Foster</persRef> was
							with them— I had about half an hour’s conversation with them—chiefly
							concerning the recent revolution in the city Government of
							New-York—accomplished for reform; and which I greatly fear will itself
							as urgently need reform before the end of the year— At the house this
							was the day for the call of petitions, but not a petition was suffered
							to be presented— There was a call of the house long protracted, which
							produced only 173 answers of names. <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> moved to go into Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, to take up the tariff bill—lost 84 to 95—but they
							went in to Committee, <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> in the
							Chair and took up the army appropriation bill.— <persRef
								ref="morse-freeman">Morse</persRef> finished his partisan Speech—at
							2. O’Clock the time came for taking it out of Committee. It was reported
							to the house with amendments—one of which an appropriation for a
							purchase of land at Newport Kentucky was rejected by yeas and nays 58 to
							96 after which the bill passed to be engrossed, and passed— And at 4.
							O’Clock the house adjourned—</p>

							on revolutionary claims to her claims, and to ask my advice, which can
							be of no avail to soften the obduracy of <persRef ref="davis-richard"

							house, <persRef ref="cranston-henry">Cranston</persRef> presented by
							leave the protest of the Legislature of Rhode-Island, against the right
							of Congress to interfere in the internal affairs of that State— And just
							as he was presenting it, his colleague <persRef ref="potter-elisha2"
								>Elisha R. Potter</persRef> went to him and asked him to tack to the
							protest a newspaper slip, on which were printed the message of the
								<persRef ref="fenner-james">Governor of Rhode-Island</persRef> to
							the Legislature, and the vote of censure by the Legislature upon the
							members, who signed the memorial upon which <persRef ref="burke-edmund4"
								>Burke</persRef> raised his select Committee— The protest when
							presented by Cranston was ordered to be laid on the table and printed.
							Some time after Burke, going to the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb"
								>clerk’s</persRef> table to examine the protest, found the newspaper
							slip tacked to it; and raised a tempest in a teapot, charging it as a
							fraud and imposition upon the house practised by the Rhode-Island
							members. Burke grossly insulted them; and the bulldogs of the democracy
							were all out upon them— Some of the whig members sustained them as well
							as they could, and they made a rather aukward apology— <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> moved to reconsider the order to
							lay on the table and print the protest— It was reconsidered. Potter then
							withdrew the newspaper slip, much against the will of <persRef
								ref="payne-william3">Payne</persRef>, and other of the rabid
							animals, who denied their right to withdraw their supplementary
							paper—but the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> decided that
							they had the right. The order to lay on the table and print the protest
							was then renewed, but they took the question of printing by yeas and
							nays. Five minutes after Burke smuggled in a protest against the
							protesters which was laid on the table and ordered to be printed much in
							the same snarl as the rest. <persRef ref="causin-john">Causin</persRef>
							made on the question to print the protest an eloquent and sound speech
							against the whole proceedings of the house on the subject— The rest of
							the day was consumed in discussing the reconsideration of a vote

							Kentucky— The reconsideration was at last denied— <persRef

						<p>The more than midsummer heat, that has continued so unseasonably long,
							has at last partially subsided, and the temperature of Spring with dewy
							fingers cold, has taken place of the premature dog-days— My sleep of
							last Night was not quiet, and I first rose this morning before three—
							Then returned to bed without sleep and up again at daylight— I wrote to
								<persRef ref="flournoy-john">John J. Flournoy</persRef> of Georgia,
							returning to him a petition to the Legislature of Georgia which he had
							sent to me to present to the House of Representatives of the United
							States— I had promised at his earnest solicitation to present a petition
							for him to the house, and he sent me the petition to the Legislature of
							Georgia—authorizing me by Letter to change its direction—and address it
							to the house— If I should do it, they would charge it upon me as
							forgery— Flournoy is a crack-brained Christian Slaveholder, who believes
							that African Slavery is sanctioned by the curse upon Canaan— At the
							house, <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> presented a memorial
							and the proceedings of a convention in this city concerning an amendment
							of the city charter.— Laid on the table and ordered to be printed— I
							presented by leave the memorial of <persRef ref="nott-eliphalet"
								>Eliphalet Nott</persRef>, <persRef ref="butler-benjamin">B. F.
								Butler</persRef> and other learned and literary men, who attended
							the late Anniversary of the National Institute, in aid of the Memorial
							recently presented from the Institute, praying for an appropriation for
							its support— I had presented the memorial of the Institute, and moved
							its reference to the joint Committee on the library. Objection had then
							been made by a single member, and the question of reference laid over
							But <persRef ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef> had considered it as
							entered under the rule, and sent the memorial to the Library Committee
							on his own authority. The auxiliary memorial presented by me this day
							was received and referred without objection.— Numerous Reports of
							Committees were received almost all pernicious— The Western harbour Bill
							was taken up, and the previous question was withdrawn, for the
							homunculus <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Douglass</persRef> to poke out
							a speech in favour of the constitutionality of appropriations for the
							improvement of Western rivers and harbours.— This brought out <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> in all his fury and <persRef
								ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> in all his casuistry, against
							Douglass and against the whole system of Internal improvement,
							federalism, consolidation and despotism— The debate was continued
							between the conflicting absurdities of the Southern Democracy which is
							Slavery and the Western democracy which is knavery, till <persRef
								ref="kennedy-andrew">Kennedy</persRef> of Indiana slumped into a
							motion to strike out the whole bill, and inserting the bill first
							reported by the Committee omitting the Illinois river. <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> Quasi speaker pronounced this
							not in order. Kennedy appealed. Adjourned.</p>

						<p>Yesterday while the house was in Session I met in the passage way outside

									>r</hi> John B. Macy</persRef> of Cincinnati, one of my fellow
							travellers from the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> to the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of last November in the Canal-boat from
							Cleveland to Hebron— He came with a <persRef ref="tallmadge-william"
								>Son</persRef> of <persRef ref="tallmadge-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tallmadge</persRef> the Senator from
							New-York and spent part of last evening with me. This morning <persRef
								ref="livermore-harriet">Miss Harriet Livermore</persRef> came again
							and breakfasted with us. She has obtained <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley’s</persRef> consent to
							preach in the hall of the house next Sunday morning at 11. He wished her
							to take the afternoon at 4. O’Clock but she declined— She was opening to
							me this morning for advice a very long and complicated story of her
							claim upon <persRef ref="livermore-edward">her deceased
								father’s</persRef> estate, in controversy with <persRef
								ref="livermore-sarah">her stepmother</persRef> but with which I have
							no right to interfere— We were interrupted by a visit, from <persRef
								ref="royall-anne">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Royall’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="stack-sarah">Sally</persRef>, from which I was relieved
							for a dollar— And I hope it relieved me also from all further cognisance
							of Miss Livermore’s family concerns.— I was all the time, labouring with
							preparation for the ceremony of presenting to the house and thereby to
							Congress, in the name of the late <persRef ref="winder-william">William
								Sidney Winder</persRef>, the camp chest of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General George Washington</persRef> used by
							him during the revolutionary War— There are circumstances of deep
							feeling in this transaction susceptible of being most invidiously turned
							against me, and to give an aukward and perhaps ridiculous aspect to the
							whole proceeding.— There was a Letter from General Washington, refering
							to the furniture of this chest, which after long and anxious search, I
							found at the National Intelligencer Office in <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles</persRef> Register of 13. May 1843.— By
							agreement with the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef>,
							immediately after the reading of the house I stated that I had this
							chest to present, and proposed that 3. O’Clock P.M. this day should be
							fixed for the operation—to which the house assented— In the interval the
							morning hour was consumed by a speech of <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Giddings</persRef> against a motion of <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> to print ten
							thousand extra copies of a report by him as chairman of the Committee of
							foreign affairs in the case of the Amistad.— The house then took up the
							western river and harbour bill, and I retired to the chamber of the
							Committee of Manufacturers, and wrote till close upon three. Then
							returned to the house, where they had just rejected the engrossment of
							the harbour Bill—and <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef>
							had moved a reconsideration— Precisely at 3 O’Clock I presented the
							camp-chest with the documents my vouchers for offering it, and an
							address, not more than five minutes in length, and offered a joint
							Resolution accepting the chest, and another of respect and sympathy to
							the family— <persRef ref="wethered-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>21. V. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>Rain—great part of the Night; followed by a dark, gloomy day— I had
							obtained from <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tinsley</persRef>, with some reluctance on his part, the
							permission for <persRef ref="livermore-harriet">Harriet
								Livermore</persRef> to preach in the Hall of the House of
							Representatives, this morning and I went with my Granddaughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> and heard her She was alone,
							and had the appearance of being solitary and desolate. She complained of
							being weak, and of having been obliged to walk from her lodgings to the
							Hall— She read the 35<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and part of the
								36<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Job, and took for her
							text Isaiah 55.6. “Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon
							him while he is near. 7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
							unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he
							will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
							8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways, my ways
							saith the Lord— 9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are
							my ways, higher than your ways, and my thoughts, than your thoughts. 10.
							For as the rain cometh down, and the snow, from heaven, and returneth
							not thither, but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud,
							that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; 11. So shall
							my word be, that goeth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me,
							void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper
							in the thing whereto I sent it.”— The discourse of an hour and a quarter
							was a commination of the judgments of God upon us as a sinful nation. It
							was a denunciation of the crimes of the age, with a multitude of awful
							threatenings to the careless, impenitent—not however so impressive as it
							had been when she preached here seven years ago. She is older, weaker,
							and is in no wise, more pleasing— Her mental hallucination has continued
							near forty years— She has not found followers to form a sect— She has
							met no encouragement from the world; but is as immovably fixed in her
							monomania, as when it first came upon her 35 years ago. After dinner I
							attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns Church where <persRef
								ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pine</persRef> read
							the evening service for the second Sunday after Easter and preached from
							1. Corinthians 15.37. “And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that
							body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some
							other grain: 38. But god giveth it a body, as it hath pleased him, and
							to every seed his own body.” From this text M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pine deduced the doctrine of salvation by Faith in Jesus
							Christ— His sermon was well written and well delivered— <persRef

						<p>My old serving man, and afterwards butler and steward <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> called on me this morning
							with a Letter to his agent for taking care of his land purchases in the
							territory of Wiskonsin— Thirty years have passed away since Antoine,
							then a Piedmontese deserter from the army of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> in his Russian Campaign,
							entered my service at Amsterdam— He was fifteen years in my service—
							Fifteen more have passed since he left me— I seldom see him— He says it
							always agitates his nerves when he comes to see me. How many
							recollections crowd upon my soul, when I see him! and what are to be the
							feelings of my last days and hours? This was a memorable day in the
							annals of the world— The Treaty for the annexation of Texas to this
							Union was this day sent in to the Senate; and with it the freedom of the
							human race— In the house it was a no less disastrous day. <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> chairman of the Committee of Ways
							and Means made his long fore-announced motion to suspend the rules to go
							into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up his
							anti-tariff bill; and after a call of the house upon which 194 members
							answered to their names, the motion was carried by a vote of 104 to 94.
							the majority consisting of that floating class of <persRef ref="janus"
								>Janus</persRef>-faces, who decide all great and critical questions,
							by holding themselves at market till the last hour, and then let the
							hammer fall to the highest bidder.— The vote against reconsidering the
							passage of the Western harbour bill had been 73 to 111— The number
							voting on the motion to take up the anti tariff was 198. probably the
							largest vote of the Session— The standing supremacy of the Slave
							representation is 112 a bare majority of the whole house consisting of
							80 Slaveholders and 32 free trade auxiliaries— This is the average
							allowing 8 Slaveholders for occasional defection from their iron rule,
							and an equal number of Laodicean freeman neither hot nor cold, and ever
							wavering between Slavery and Freedom— This day the <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> put <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">G. W. Hopkins</persRef> in the Chair and no
							sooner was the bill read than <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles

							movement by moving to strike out the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							September, and inserting the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January
							next for the beginning of the new tariff— At the very same time <persRef
								ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale Owen</persRef> the Scotch Atheist had
							a diabetic hour speech against the Tariff, and the English corn laws and
							paupers, by heart; and could not restrain himself from letting it off—
							There was a long debate whether upon the petty question to change the
							day for the bill to commence, the whole tariff controversy could be
							discussed— Ingersoll’s motion was at last rejected, and Robert Dale,
							went through his hour without <unclear>br</unclear>equent, he willily lying it over till
							the next Presidential Canvas shall be settled— <persRef
								ref="wright-joseph">Wright</persRef> followed for half an hour and

							leaving them all with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellsworth, the cane
							to be kept in custody of the Commissioner, among the curiosities of the

							of the gag-rule in the house of Representatives— The donors of the cane
							request me when that event shall occur to have the date of it added to
							the motto held by the eagle on the top of the cane— In depositing the
							cane at the patent office, I reserved to myself and my legal

							keep the cane safely— At the house, after the reading of the journal

							moved a Call, which was commenced, but soon superseded as the members
							came in. <persRef ref="pollock-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pollock</persRef>, the member from Pennsylvania, replacing the late
								<persRef ref="frick-henry">Henry Frick</persRef> was sworn in and

								<persRef ref="wright-joseph">Joseph A. Wright</persRef> of Indiana,
							concluded an agricultural hour speech against the existing Tariff of

							Hopkins and <persRef ref="coles-walter">Walter Coles</persRef>, in the

							and me for my appointment of him as Secretary of State, for his vote in
							my favour as President— After refuting this charge, White was passing to
							another ridiculous imputation the git of which was that Clay in a speech
							upon the Missouri question had spoken of black slaves and white slaves—
							The hour expired. White pleaded hard for another hour; but the house
							would not indulge him and he had so exasperated the ruling party, by
							driving them from their battery of Slander, that one of them <persRef
								ref="rathbun-george">George Rathbun</persRef>, sitting near where he
							spoke, started up and in a transport of rage turned upon him and struck

							chair— A pistol ball was fired at <persRef ref="mccauslen-william"
								>M’Causland</persRef> a member, by a Kentuckian named <persRef
								ref="moore-william3">Moore</persRef> whom he was turning out of the

						<p>Before the reconciliation took place yesterday between the parties to the

								ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M. Saunders</persRef> took the floor
							from me, for the same identical proposition; and after the
							reconciliation I thought there was no farther occasion for a Committee—
							The party majority however clung to the appointment and carried it, of a
							Select Committee of five—Saunders, myself, Dromgoole, <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Reuben Chapman</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hardin-john">Hardin</persRef> of Illinois— The selection of the
							3 Slavemongers was a sufficient indication of the use to be made of this
							Committee— Saunders notified them to meet in the room of the judiciary
							committee immediately after the adjournment of the house— Having heard
							that <persRef ref="almonte-juan">General Almonte</persRef> the Mexican
							Minister was to depart to-morrow for New-York with <persRef
								ref="almonte-maria">his family</persRef>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">to-morrow</hi>, I called at his house and took

							behalf of individuals my countrymen, prisoners at Perote, taken at Mier,
							with intreaties that I would solicit <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio"
								>President Santa Anna</persRef> for their release— That under
							present circumstances I could not justify myself for such interposition;
							but I still hoped he would return from New-York to this city, and that
							the Peace between our Countries would be preserved, and in that event
							would speak further with him on this subject— This morning, <persRef
								ref="kennedy-andrew">Andrew Kennedy</persRef> and John White asked a
							suspension of the rules to enable them to make personal explanations in
							refutation of misstatements in the Globe— The vote for suspension was 98

							first <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> and then <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> in the Chair.— <persRef

								Breese</persRef> yesterday that it would give me great pleasure to
							contribute all in my power to obtain the release of the prisoner; but
							that in the present state of our relations with Mexico, I could ask no

								ref="rathbun-george">Rathbun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="white-john6">White</persRef>.— And to be excused also from
							assigning my reasons for the request— I said I might by the rules of the

							Committees. But I preferred to be discharged from this Committee by
							authority of the house. And as the Committee would probably have
							occasion to sit this day and to-morrow, I wished that another member
							might be appointed to supply my place. The <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef> put the question and I was excused, without a

							New-Orleans then rose and announced the death of <persRef
								ref="bossier-pierre">Pierre Evariste Bossier</persRef> a member from

							Slidell pronounced a genteel eulogy upon him larded with latin and

							He offered the usual sympathising resolutions, to wear crape, to attend
							the funeral to-morrow at Noon, and to adjourn—which were adopted without

							Bossier— <persRef ref="johnson-henry">Henry Johnson</persRef> after

							perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly.
							(It was a holy and good thought—) Whereupon he made a reconciliation for

							last Thursday— From last Night to this morning a sudden and great change
							from high summer heat to a rain, chilly East wind with frequent showers
							took place;— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Henry Clay</persRef> arrived in this city yesterday, on his way
							homeward from an extensive tour to the South as far as New-Orleans— In
							the National Intelligencer of this morning is published a Letter from

								Giddings</persRef> called on me and introduced to me one of his
							constituents named <persRef ref="u">Ford</persRef>, who comes as a
							delegate to the whig convention to be held at Baltimore next Wednesday
							to nominate Henry Clay, as the whig candidate for election to the office
							of President of the United States next December— The Delegates to that
							Convention, and to that of the Convention of young men to be held the
							succeeding day at the same place are already swarming here from all
							parts of the country. Among the rest <persRef ref="gibson-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gibson</persRef>, the Mayor of
							Schenectady, who presided at the hospitable dinner which they gave me
							there last summer, called this morning with his friend a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Strong</persRef> of Geneva,
							in that State— At the house <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> moved a Resolution to cease debate in Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union upon the tariff bill on Monday,
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May, and take it into the house—
							Several of the whigs insisted that the time was too short— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J Ingersoll</persRef> moved as an
							amendment Thursday the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May— <persRef
								ref="stewart-andrew">Andrew Stewart</persRef> moved to lay the
							Resolution on the table—carried by yeas and nays 88 to 83 <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> in a burst of passion said
							well—we will pass the bill next Wednesday. The motion to go now into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the Tariff
							bill was resisted, but without avail. <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D.
								D. Barnard</persRef> made an effort to get up the Eastern harbour
							Bill but failed— The day was consumed in the dullest of hour speeches,
							with <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> in the chair, by
								<persRef ref="belser-james">James E Belser</persRef> of Alabama,
							against the tariff, <persRef ref="brodhead-richard">Richard

								ref="slidell-john">John Slidell</persRef> of New-Orleans, on both
							sides, and <persRef ref="steenrod-lewis">Lewis Steenrod</persRef> of
							Wheeling, Virginia, anti-tariff to the backbone— Four speeches, four
							hours— At half past four the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. I
							went to <persRef ref="gibert-antoine">Gibert’s</persRef> Room to sit an
							hour for my picture, but he was not there Among the strangers who called
							me out to shake hands with me this day was <persRef ref="grattan-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grattan</persRef>, the British
							Consul at Boston— This evening we were delightfully surprized by the
							arrival of <persRef key="adams-charles2">our Son</persRef> from Boston,
							which he left the day before yesterday afternoon.— <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin van Buren’s</persRef> Letter against

						<p>I attended public worship at the hall of the house of Representatives,
							with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>. The Chaplain of the
							house, <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tinsley</persRef> was there and set the tune for singing the hymns
							by two lines at a time; and I expected his long promised funeral
							discourse on <persRef ref="moore-heman">Heman Allen Moore</persRef> and
							the other members of Congress who have recently died; but instead of
							that, a <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Lean</persRef> of New-York, said to
							be a Bible Society Missionary, preached with, I think the broadest
							Scottish accent that I ever heard, from John 17.20 [“]Neither pray I for
							these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their
							word:” and especially 21. [“]That they all may be one; as thou father,
							art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the
							world may believe that thou has sent me—” This passage is from the
							awfully solemn discourse held by Jesus immediately before he was
							betrayed by <persRef ref="judas-iscariot">Judas</persRef>, and arrested
							for trial. The discourse is mysterious in the highest degree— In the
							chapter he repeated declares his unity with God the father—his own
							existence before the creation of the world and his own glorification,
							even by the crucifixion which he was about to suffer, a cup which he yet
							prayed might pass from him— I did not consider the Sermon appropriate to
							the time, or place; not yet specially adapted to promote the
							distribution of bibles— The auditory was unusually thin— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley brought the Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to my
							seat, and introduced him to me. I met there my very old acquaintance
								<persRef ref="russell-joseph3">Joseph Russell</persRef> of Boston;
							and also the <persRef ref="parkman-francis">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis
							Parkman</persRef>, who dined with us, and whom we heard preach after
							dinner in the Unitarian Church— He gave out two texts—first Micah 6.8.
							“He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
							require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
							with thy God?— ” secondly—Mark 10.17. “And when he was gone forth into
							the way, there came one running; and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good
							Master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?”— This was a
							warm and forcible exhortation to justice, mercy, and humility before
							God, which comprize the whole duty of man— In the evening we had visits
							from <persRef ref="hone-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Philip
								Hone</persRef> of New-York and <persRef ref="childs-timothy">Timothy
								Child</persRef>, member of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
								27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congresses from Rochester in that
							State. He told me that in the Globe of last evening there was published
							a Letter from <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin van Buren</persRef>
							to <persRef ref="hammett-william">William H. Hammet</persRef>, a member
							of the House of Representatives from the State of Mississippi; declaring

							on the floor of the house— <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef>
							of Ohio presented a Memorial from a Convention of inhabitants of this
							city, concerning the amendment of their corporation charter. he had
							already presented another memorial on the same subject— They are
							referred to the Committee of the whole to consider hereafter the affairs
							of the District. <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef>
							offered a Resolution calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> for [“]copies of such portions of the
							correspondence, public or private, in the years 1816, 1817, 1818. 1819
							and 1820, between our Ministers at the Court of Madrid, and the
							Department of State, between those Ministers and the Spanish Secretaries
							of State, and between the Department of State, and the Spanish Ministers
							accredited to this Government, and which correspondence may not have
							been hitherto communicated to either house of Congress, and published
							under the authority of either.— Provided however, that the President
							shall not deem it incompatible with the public interest to furnish the
							copies referred to—” Objections were made to receiving the resolution.
							Lewis moved to suspend the rules, for which I voted and which was
							carried 119 to 23 <persRef ref="davis-john8">John W. Davis</persRef>
							immediately moved the previous question. He withdrew it however at my
							request for me to move an amendment to strike out the proviso— Lewis
							after some resistance accepted the modification, and the Resolution was
							adopted without the proviso.— The house then went into committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
								>Hopkins</persRef> in the chair on the tariff bill— Weller, <persRef
								ref="ramsey-alexander">Alexander Ramsey</persRef> of Harrisburg

								M’Ilvaine</persRef> of Chester 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							District of Pennsylvania, expatiated five hours pro and con for and
							against the tariff—with various merit— Collamer’s speech bearing off the
							palm for the day— I borrowed an hour for the sitting to <persRef
								ref="gibert-antoine">Gibert</persRef> for my portrait, and he said
							he would let me off with one sitting more— There were numerous visitors
							from all parts of the Union, delegates to the whig<hi
								rend="strikethrough">h</hi> conventions to be held at Baltimore on
							the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> and second of May were in the
							house— An attempt was made to force a night Session, which failed for

							used up his hour in replying to <persRef ref="white-john6">John

							blowing the coals up to kindle again into a flame to consume Clay’s
							election hopes and my honest fame— Boyd closed his speech with another
							attack upon Clay for his vote in favour of the Bankrupt act of 1842.
								<persRef ref="smith-caleb">Caleb B. Smith</persRef> came next with a
