                        <dateline>Washington Sunday 1. December 1844.</dateline>
                        <p><date>1. IV:15. </date>Sunday.</p>
                        <p>Sun rose 7.— Set 4.39.</p>
                        <p>But I cannot see it here as at Quincy. The houses on the other side of
                            the street intercept his rising and setting beams— I attended public
                            worship morning and afternoon at the second Presbyterian church— <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> was in the pulpit; but the morning preacher
                            was <persRef ref="nourse-michael">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse</persRef>— His text was from Philippians
                            2.12—“work out your own salvation with fear and trembling 13. For it is
                            God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”
                            There is a compromise of doctrine in this text, between free will, and
                            predestination— For as God worketh in us to will as well as to do, we
                            may work out our own salvation by prayer for the will, as well as for
                            action. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox gave notice that the communion would
                            be administered next Sunday afternoon— <persRef ref="edwards-justin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Justin
                            Edwards</persRef> preached in the afternoon, from Mark 2.27.— “The Sabbath was
                            made for man”—and he went over all the topics, and repeated the
                            arguments which he had held forth at the Lord’s day convention last week
                            at Baltimore— There is error in the strictness of construction, which
                            these persons give to the precept— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards left
                            out of his text the concluding words in the verse Mark 2.27.—“and not
                            man for the Sabbath.” I quoted the whole last week at Baltimore,
                            believing as I do, that the qualification is as necessary to the
                            religious principle as the injunction itself.— Works of necessity and of
                            charity are not incompatible with the holiness of the day. D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards gave notice that he should preach
                            to-morrow evening at the Presbyterian church in 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            Street on the same subject, and should then notice the objections to the
                            consecration of the Sabbath drawn from certain passages of the New
                            Testament— The argument upon which he most emphatically dwelt was the
                            physical necessity of hebdomadal repose to the nature not only of man
                            but of horses.— In support of which he alledged facts not altogether
                            unquestionable to prove that men who labour or travel six days in the
                            week, and rest the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> perform more work, and
                            travel farther in a series of weeks, than men who allow themselves no
                            intermission. And he said there was the same testimony with regard to
                            horses— A more unequivocally authenticated fact is attested by the
                            records of the New-York penitentiary that more than four fifths of the
                            inmates of that establishment are persons regardless of the Sabbath— I
                            received this morning a letter from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> with half a post Note of the
                            Merchants Bank Boston which I forwarded to <persRef ref="boyd-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Harriet Boyd</persRef> at Green Bay, Wiskonsin Territory— And I enclosed to <persRef ref="rundle-george">George

                            of the United States, took the Chair and called the House to order— The
                            roll was then called and 175 members answered to their names— 7. new

                            moved a message to the Senate to inform them that the house was ready
                            for business, and <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved a joint Committee to inform the

                            communication he may be pleased to make to them— The Senate concurred by
                            a corresponding Message— The members of the Committee on the part of the
                            house were Cave Johnson and <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef>.— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac E. Holmes</persRef> of
                            Charleston South-Carolina moved the immediate appointment of a Chaplain—
                            The Speaker told him there must first be a joint Resolution for the
                            appointment of two Chaplains of different denominations, one by each
                            house to interchange weekly— He then moved the usual resolution— <persRef ref="pettit-john">John
                            Pettit</persRef> of Indiana moved an amendment, provided that the chaplains should
                            be paid by voluntary contribution of the members without charge upon the
                            people, and said he had prepared a subscription paper, and put down his
                            own name for 5 dollars; and if any one would give more, he would engage
                            to double any such increased subscription, and then he made a stump
                            speech— <persRef ref="v">M’Connell</persRef> moved the previous question— <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> said there was a
                            law authorizing appropriations to pay for chaplains, and <persRef ref="steenrod-lewis">Steenrod</persRef> the
                            appropriation for the present Session was already made— The Speaker said
                            these objections came too late. Pettit’s amendment was rejected by yeas
                            and nays 151 to 20. and Holmes’s Resolution was adopted without call for
                            yeas and nays. I gave notice that I should to morrow move a Resolution,
                            to rescind the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule which excludes the
                            reception of abolition petitions— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> said my motion was not in
                            order, but it was entered on the journal— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> thought they would
                            trip me up on the point of order, and thought it would be necessary to
                            move an amendment of the rules—but I assured him that rescind was the
                            word.— <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> this day 16.— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary E. E. Cutts</persRef> dined with us.</p>

                        <list><item>Parker Daniel</item></list>
                        <p>I was first up this morning at 3. O’Clock; but returned to bed and
                            between sleeping and waking lay unconsciously till a quarter before 7.
                            two hours and a half later than I should have done.— Last evening
                            <persRef ref="parker-daniel">General Parker</persRef>, Chief Clerk of the War Department called and spent an
                            hour with me— I shewed him the Note from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> of 25. Jan<hi
                                rend="superscript">y</hi> 1819. declining our invitation of him and <persRef ref="jackson-rachel">his
                            family</persRef> to dinner, and asked him if he knew in whose hand writing it was.
                            He said it was <persRef ref="butler-robert">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Robert Butler’s</persRef>— The note
                            accepting the invitation to dine on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            March 1819. is in another hand, not Jackson’s. Parker said he should
                            know it if he could see it— But it is mislaid. I know not whether here
                            or at Quincy— At the meeting of the house this day <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> from the
                            joint Committee to wait on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> reported that they had
                            performed that service, and the President had informed them that he
                            would make a communication to Congress at 12. O’Clock this day. <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">R. M.
                            Saunders</persRef> moved the appointment of the standing Committees which was
                            agreed to— In pursuance of the notice I had given yesterday— I moved the
                            following Resolution— [“]Resolved that the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                            standing rule, for conducting business in this house, in the following
                            words—‘No petition, memorial, resolution or other paper, praying the
                            abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia, or any State or
                            Territory or the Slave trade between the States or Territories in which
                            it now exists shall be received by this house or entertained in any way
                            whatever’—be, and the same is hereby rescinded.”— I called for the yeas
                            and nays— <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Jacob Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi moved to lay the Resolution on
                            the Table— I called for the yeas and nays on that motion— As the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk</persRef>
                            was about to begin the call the President’s Message was announced and
                            received— A member called for the reading of the Message. I said I hoped
                            the question upon my resolution would be taken— The Clerk called the
                            roll, and the motion to lay on the table was rejected 81 to 104— The
                            question was then put on the resolution and it was carried 108 to
                            80.—blessed ever blessed be the name of God!— The President’s Message
                            was immediately afterwards read and some debate followed how to dispose
                            of it— Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union
                            and 10000 copies of it to be printed— After some miscellaneous business
                            about 3 the house adjourned. General Parker was again here this evening,
                            and I received two pension certificates from the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of
                            Pensions</persRef>.</p>

                            declaration 26 Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> last— After I had written to
                            <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to search for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> Note and <persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving’s</persRef> Letter of 3. May
                            1817. I found them on a small file of Letters on my table, and I cut off
                            the paragraph of my Letter to my son asking him to search for them— At
                            the house 4 additional members took their Seats— Several notices were
                            given of asking leave to introduce bills among the rest by <persRef ref="burt-armistead">Burt</persRef> of a
                            bill to repeal the duty on cotton bagging and gunny cloth—by <persRef ref="black-james2">James A.
                            Black</persRef>, a bill to regulate the pay of the Army, and for other purposes—by
                            <persRef ref="phoenix-jonas">Phoenix</persRef> a bill to repeal the duty on rail road iron— By <persRef ref="dana-amasa">Dana</persRef>, a bill to
                            abolish the franking privilege and to reduce the rates of postage— I
                            required that these and all such notices should be read— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of
                            Cincinnati offered his bill for holding all the elections of the
                            electoral colleges on one and the same day throughout the Union. The
                            rule required that he should ask and obtain leave to introduce the bill,
                            and that it should be called up with Resolutions— He moved a suspension
                            of the rules, and called for the yeas and nays, of which there were
                            none, 172 ayes— His bill was read twice, and an hour’s debate sprung up
                            what should be done with it— The debate was superfluous there being no
                            opposition to the principle of the bill. At last it was ordered to be
                            referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and to
                            be printed— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> of Charleston S.C. then moved to proceed to the
                            choice of a chaplain— At the first voting there were seven or eight
                            candidates nominated among whom a methodist named <persRef ref="daily-william">Daley</persRef>, from Indiana,
                            who obtained 41 votes, the highest number for any candidate then— I had
                            voted for <persRef ref="muller-albert">Doctor Muller</persRef>, the pastor of the Lutheran English Church in
                            this city; but he had only 16 votes.— At the second vote M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Daley obtained 64 votes. I voted for <persRef ref="hale-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                    Hale</persRef> a son of <persRef ref="hale-nathan">Nathan Hale</persRef> of Boston, who is preaching here at the
                            Unitarian Church—but he was not more successful than D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r.</hi> Muller— At the third vote, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daley got
                            104 votes and was chosen— I was one of the voters for him, to get
                            through a tedious process— The house then adjourned— I received this
                            Evening a Letter from <persRef ref="magruder-allan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allan B. Magruder</persRef> of

                        <p>I had a morning visit from <persRef ref="owen-robert">Robert Owen</persRef> of Lanark, a man with whom I first
                            became acquainted in London in 1817. A speculative, scheming,
                            mischievous man. He had then succeeded in accumulating a large fortune
                            by forming a community at Lanark in Scotland, consisting of poor
                            labourers but who were said to prosper into competency and affluence and
                            contentment while they made his fortune— But he was ambitious of working
                            his system upon a larger scale, and he came to this country full of the
                            scheme of new modeling human society. He formed an establishment, in the
                            State of Indiana, named New Harmony, and delivered discourses on the new
                            organization of Society; and trumpeted abroad his Utopia till it fell
                            into ruin—his establishment was left a wreck, and he went back to his
                            own country to practice dupery again there. He had however acquired a
                            large landed property, which his Son <persRef ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale Owen</persRef> was left to
                            manage; and he after strolling about the country preaching infidelity
                            and prostitution, till they found themselves threatened with Lynch Law
                            by the rabble, and parted— <persRef ref="wright-frances">Fanny Wright</persRef> now calling herself Madame
                            D’Arusmon and going home to Dundee; and Robert Dale Owen returning to
                            Indiana, a demagogue of the first water, till he has wormed himself into
                            Congress with such fellows as <persRef ref="pettit-john">Pettit</persRef>, and <persRef ref="henley-thomas">Henley</persRef>, and <persRef ref="davis-john">John W. Davis</persRef>, and
                            <persRef ref="kennedy-andrew">Andrew Kennedy</persRef>, and <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, the scum and dregs of the political
                            cauldron— Robert Owen and Fanny Wright have now come again to this
                            Country, and he apparently as crafty, crazy as ever— He said he wanted
                            to have a long interview with me, and I promised to receive him any
                            morning from ten to twelve. At the War Department I left <persRef ref="amory-jonathan2">Jonathan

                            compared the handwriting of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> note accepting my
                            invitation to dine on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1819—with
                            that of a Letter from him to the <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef> of 1. Feb<hi

                            after sundry notices given at half past 12. Adjourned over to next
                            Monday. <persRef ref="ord-edward">Lieutenant Ord</persRef> of the army called on me, and requested my atten

                        <p><persRef ref="owen-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Owen</persRef> came again this morning, and
                            Mesmerized me for the space of an hour and a half with his lunacies
                            about a new organization of Society under the auspices of the two most
                            powerful Nations on the face of the globe—Great Britain on the Eastern,
                            and the United States on the Western Hemisphere. The materials he says
                            are abundant; and the arrangements are all of simple and easy execution—
                            He has prepared a plan in which all the details are set forth with the
                            minutest accuracy.— It is now in the hands of <persRef ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Pakenham</persRef>, but he will ask him to return it and will communicate it to me
                            for my examination— It is a plan for universal education, for which the
                            Smithsonian fund may provide the means without interfering at all with
                            my views— After the establishment of the system there will be no War and
                            no such thing as poverty— Universal competency will be the lot of all
                            mankind; and want will be unknown.— All this I had heard twenty-five
                            years ago, and the humbug is too stale.— His last departure from this
                            Country he says was in 1830. when, by his agency, <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> and
                            <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef>, settled all the differences
                            between this Country and Great Britain— Since then he has been
                            negotiating in Mexico, in Austria and Prussia, and has been working five
                            hours a day upon his great plan which he has now brought to maturity— I
                            asked him if he was acquainted with the <persRef ref="fourier-charles">Fourier</persRef> plan of a community, he
                            said yes; and personally with the man— He was no more than a Clerk in a
                            Merchant’s Counting house, ingenious and fanciful, without experience of
                            the world or knowledge of mankind— <persRef ref="mayo-robert">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Mayo</persRef> was here
                            and told me that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> meant to answer Andrew
                            Jackson’s indirect attack upon him, about the Letter to <persRef ref="fulton-william">Fulton</persRef>, in his
                            imploring Letter to <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> the Editor of the Globe— Mayo had not seen my
                            reply to Jackson’s Letter to <persRef ref="armstrong-robert3">Armstrong</persRef> in the North Bridgwater Address—
                            I gave him a copy of the Boston Courier containing it— He said that
                            Jackson was the greatest liar that this Country had ever produced and
                            that the Committee on the Fulton claim had proved it upon him— <persRef ref="u">Daley</persRef> is
                            a coloured man who brought samples of Gunpowder and black Tea which he
                            brought with him from China. <persRef ref="fischer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fischer</persRef> came with a

                            purchases of Stationery— I called at the Patriotic Bank and drew 200

                        <p>I should have done much business this day at the War and Navy Departments
                            and in the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, in
                            overhauling the unfinished business of former Sessions of Congress to be
                            replaced upon the Calendar— But Sloth creeps irresistibly upon leisure,
                            and a walk of about half an hour was my only substitute for a visit to
                            the Department and to the house— <persRef ref="kellogg-hiram">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kellogg</persRef> is the
                            President of a College at Galesburg in the State of Illinois, travelling
                            I suppose for the purpose of collecting contributions; but he asked none
                            from me. He alledged no other than curiosity, and said that his college
                            had commenced in 1837 as a school for teachers, preparatory for college,
                            and had about 140 pupils— Since 1841. it had become a college, having
                            now three classes and expecting a fourth next year—ten students to each
                            Class— <persRef ref="patterson-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson</persRef>, a member of the house from
                            Rochester, New-York called and urged me very earnestly to come out with
                            a severe declaration in the house against the Liberty
                            party-abolitionists— I distrust very much the advice of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Patterson— I told him I thought the Liberty party had taken
                            the most effectual means to demolish themselves; and as they had
                            repelled and denounced me, it would have an appearance of private and
                            personal resentment if I should retort upon them— They had done all the
                            mischief in their power— It is irreparable— There may be an occasion
                            upon which I may without impropriety express my opinion of them; but I
                            shall not seek it— Among the Letters that I received yesterday was one
                            from New-York dated 4. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>, the writer of which
                            says that canvassing a few days since with <persRef ref="poindexter-george">Governor Poindexter</persRef> at the
                            Galt house in Louisville he Poindexter said the morning when <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> had
                            the interview with me concerning the Florida Treaty he had been at
                            Poindexter’s room, and on leaving it said that it was to fufil an
                            engagement to meet me and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe on that subject.
                            But it was to meet me, and not <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>; and this
                            is an anonymous Letter— I had morning visits also from <persRef ref="thomasson-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Thomasson</persRef> and <persRef ref="pirtle-henry"><unclear>judge</unclear> Pyrtle</persRef>, from Louisville, Kentucky. the

                        <p>I attended public worship in the hall of the house of representatives,
                            where <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston</persRef>, the chaplain of the Senate began by
                            giving out to be sung <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> hundredth Psalm, reading by two lines at a
                            time; setting the tune himself, and requesting his hearers to join him
                            as far as practicable— He then made a short and fervent prayer—read the
                            12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of <persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> epistle to the Romans,
                            and preached from Philippians 3.3. “For we are the circumcision which
                            worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
                            confidence in the flesh.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston in this as in
                            many other of his discourses, very earnestly disclaimed all sectarianism
                            of forms, and all bigoted attachment to peculiar modes of worship— He
                            said there were two points upon which he had no doubt that every person
                            professing the name of Christ of whatever denomination would agree— 1.
                            To worship God in the spirit; and 2. And to place all his hopes of
                            salvation, alone upon the merits of the redeemer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Tuston’s manner is peculiarly tender and affectionate to his hearers,
                            and in this he conciliates their favour rather than by the copiousness
                            the vigour or the ingenuity of his intellect.— The Epistle to the
                            Philippians is a heart searching exhortation to concord—written in
                            prison—plaintive but not desponding—rather boastful of himself and
                            glorying in his sufferings.— It is almost entirely about himself and
                            expresses gratitude to them, as the only church that had contributed to
                            his personal support— I perceive M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston’s
                            inducement to the selection of his text— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
                                >t</hi> John’s church, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pine read the Evening
                            service for the second Sunday in Advent. The second lesson of which was
                            the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Romans which M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Tuston had read this morning— <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pine</persRef>
                            preached a short Sermon from Ephesians 1.18. “The eyes of your
                            understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of
                            his calling.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne is a pleasing preacher and a
                            very intelligent and amiable man— As I was returning home from church I

                            to leave them with me, but I declined keeping them— Visits from <persRef ref="phoenix-jonas">M<hi

                        <p>Sleepless night, caused by breakfasting on coffee yesterday morning, and
                            drinking a cup of tea last evening.— A sluggish, drowy, torpid day
                            succeeds.— At the house, <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston</persRef> opened the day
                            with a short studied prayer— On the reading of the Journal the standing
                            Committees were announced. The <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> has again appointed me chairman
                            of the Committee of Manufactures— <persRef ref="thomasson-william">Thomasson</persRef> came and told me that he and
                            another anti-Texas members of the Committee of foreign Affairs at the
                            last Session have been removed and that the Committee now are Texas. The
                            reading of the journal was no sooner finished than <persRef ref="hammett-william">Hammett</persRef> of
                            Mississippi, began to move a resolution for referring to a select
                            Committee so much of the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> message as relates to Texas—
                            <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> told him that he had a series of Resolutions ready to
                            distribute to the several standing committees the various topics of the
                            message, for which purpose he should move to go into Committee of the
                            whole on the state of the Union. Hammet immediately gave way. Dromgoole
                            made his motion, and the house went into Committee of the whole on the
                            state of the Union <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> in the Chair— Dromgoole presented ten
                            Resolutions distributing the Message to as many standing Committees—
                            Only one question was taken upon the whole series of Resolutions, and
                            they were adopted in a lump. Dromgoole then moved that the Committee
                            should rise and report which was done—and the report was adopted without
                            a word of debate. But before passing Dromgoole’s Resolutions the
                            Committee of the whole on the state of the Union had taken up <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan’s</persRef>
                            bill for holding the election of the Presidential Electors, on one and
                            the same day throughout the Union— This gave rise to a dull and tedious
                            debate chiefly raised by <persRef ref="elmer-lucius">Elmer</persRef> chairman of the Committee of elections,
                            of which the Committee soon got tired and laid the bill aside. In the
                            <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk’s</persRef> Office, I looked up the bill for the relief of <persRef ref="holmes-joseph">Joseph Holmes</persRef>,
                            and the owners of the Schooner Industry.— This Evening <persRef ref="hoar-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Samuel Hoare</persRef> called on me and told me the particulars of his
                            expulsion by mob violence from Charleston South-Carolina, where he had
                            been sent as a Commissioner to protect the personal rights of coloured
                            citizens of Massachusetts imprisoned under a Slave-law of the State. He
                            barely escaped with life and limb— I approved the whole of his conduct,
                            and advised him to see the other members of the delegation from
                            Massachusetts before proceeding home. <persRef ref="markoe-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Markoe</persRef>

                        <p><persRef ref="owen-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Owen</persRef> brought me this morning a small bound
                            printed book, by himself, a second edition, London 1841. entitled a
                            Developement of the principles and plans on which to establish
                            Self-supporting home-colonies— He left it, with me, and said he would
                            call for it again to-morrow— From the cursory glance at its contents
                            which is all that I can bestow, I find it a new edition of his old
                            exploded projects— At the house I gave notice of my intention to ask
                            leave to introduce a bill for the relief of <persRef ref="holmes-joseph">Joseph Holmes</persRef> and the owners
                            of the Schooner Industry. After some other interlocutory motions
                            <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> asked the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> what was the regular business of the day, and
                            he answered the call of the States for Petitions— Giddings then called
                            for the Order of business and the Speaker announced Petitions in order
                            from the State of Maine.— There were none from Maine— One or two from
                            New-Hampshire. The call came at once upon Massachusetts. I had only
                            three petitions to present. 1. from <persRef ref="andrews-john4">John P. Andrews</persRef> of Salem for the
                            promotion of universal peace— Referred to the Committee of foreign
                            Affairs. 2. from <persRef ref="jarvis-edward">Edward Jarvis</persRef> and <persRef ref="thornton-john">J. Wingate Thornton</persRef> Committee of the
                            American Statistical Association, a memorial concerning the errors in
                            the census of 1840— I moved its reference to the Committee of Statistics
                            of the last Session if it still existed, and that it should be printed.—
                            The Speaker said that was a select Committee only for the Session and
                            did not now exist— I then moved the reference to a select Committee of 9
                            which was adopted—but objection was made to the printing— <persRef ref="king-preston">Preston King</persRef>
                            called for its being read. The <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk</persRef> read about 5 minutes—till they
                            tired and dispensed with the further reading.— a motion was made to lay
                            the motion to print on the table—carried 101. to 79.— 3. Petition from
                            <persRef ref="kingsland-ab">A. B. Kingsland</persRef> and 4 other residents in the City of New-York for the
                            abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia— I moved its reference
                            to the Committee on the district. <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of Georgia objected to its
                            reception. <persRef ref="brown-william12">Brown</persRef> of Indiana moved to lay the objection on the table,
                            lost by yeas and nays 90 to 99. Question on the reception of the
                            Petition 107 to 81.— <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef> moved to lay the petition on the
                            table—lost 88 to 99 and it was referred to the Committee on the
                            District— Much matter for reflection on these proceedings.— The call for
                            petitions proceeded till they came to Ohio—and when Giddings rose a
                            motion to adjourn was made and carried— <persRef ref="connell-john">John Connell</persRef> was here this

                        <p><persRef ref="owen-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen</persRef> came again this morning for his book. I told
                            him I had cursorily looked over as much of it as my time would allow,
                            and that I had not been able to bring my mind to the approbation of his
                            plan— He went over the same preamble that I had heard from him 27 years
                            ago in London; which he had afterwards crowded upon me year after year
                            here, when I was Secretary of State and President, and from which I have
                            hoped for the last fifteen years that this Country was forever
                            delivered.— He said he wanted his book now; but he would send it to me
                            again to be examined and studied at my leisure; for it required profound
                            study to understand it— It was to change the basis of human society; to
                            put every individual of the human race in the proper place to promote
                            his own happiness, and needed only to be put into operation to
                            accomplish its purpose. At the house <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Douglas</persRef> of Illinois gave notice
                            that he would at an early day move for leave to introduce a bill to
                            establish a new territory with a strange name— <persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef> of Alabama moved
                            to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of
                            the Union to take up the Bill N. 2. reported at the last Session from
                            the Committee on the Territories— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> insisted upon the preference to
                            his bill for holding the election of Presidential electors throughout
                            the Union one and the same day. Houston yielded the precedence— The
                            house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and
                            first took up Duncan’s bill— <persRef ref="elmer-lucius">Elmer</persRef> and <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef> still nibbled at
                            the Bill, till Duncan proposed an entire substitute for his bill
                            accommodated to their projected amendments. It was adopted by the
                            Committee, and laid aside to be reported to the house—but <persRef ref="dromgoole-georg">Dromgoole</persRef> was
                            still dissatisfied, and offered another entire substitute of his own,
                            which the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> decided came too late, but said it might be offered in
                            the house. Houston’s Bill for reducing and graduating the price of the
                            public lands was then taken up— It proposes to authorise the sale of all
                            the public lands which have been 5 years upon sale for one dollar an<hi
                                rend="italic"> </hi>all that have been ten years upon sale for 75
                            cents—all that have been 15 years in the market for 50 cents, and all
                            that have been 20 years on hand for 25 cents an acre— This bill was
                            supported by Houston, by <persRef ref="sample-samuel">Sample</persRef> and <persRef ref="davis-john8">John W. Davis</persRef> of Indiana, and
                            opposed by <persRef ref="collamer-jacob">Collamer</persRef> of Vermont, and by <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> of Ohio— It will break up
                            the whole system of the sales of the public lands, and will give them
                            away— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> was here this evening.</p>

                        <p>Much of this morning was consumed in a fruitless search for the pamphlet
                            statement of the proceedings in the United States Courts in the case of
                            the Amistad Negroes There are numerous documents relating to that case
                            to oppose a bill and report from the Committee of foreign Affairs at the
                            last Session of Congress, essentially necessary, but which I have not
                            now at hand— At the house, <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Douglas</persRef> of Illinois gave notice of a motion
                            for the purchase of certain copies of <persRef ref="greenhow-robert">Greenhow’s</persRef> history of Oregon
                            California &amp;c— The name of the new Territory which he proposes to
                            establish is Nebraska— <persRef ref="yulee-david">Levy</persRef> the delegate from Florida, obtained an order
                            to print 5000 copies of the Constitution of Florida reported in 1839.—
                            The call for petitions was resumed.— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> presented successively 7.
                            abolition petitions, memorials and resolutions and objection was made to
                            the reception of them all.— <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> of South Carolina, enquired if the
                            question of reception was debateable—the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> answered that it was,
                            whereupon Rhett said he wished to debate it— They were all laid over
                            accordingly one day for debate, except a memorial from Ashtabula County
                            for the abolition of the Slave-representation, which was laid on the
                            table by yeas and nays 135 to 54.— <persRef ref="dodge-augustus">Augustus C. Dodge</persRef>, delegate from the
                            Territory of Iowa presented a memorial asking admission into the Union
                            and a copy of their Constitution which after some discussion was
                            referred to the Committee on the Territories— The Committees were called
                            for Reports, but the only one presented was by <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>
                            Chairman of the Committee of foreign Affairs.— A joint Resolution for
                            the annexation of Texas to the United States, in exactly the same words
                            with a joint Resolution presented two or three days since to the Senate
                            by <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">George M’Duffie</persRef> of South-Carolina— The Resolution was read twice,
                            referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union and
                            Ingersoll gave notice that he should call it up for consideration, on
                            Monday the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this month— The annexation is to
                            be a complete ratification of the Treaty signed on the 12<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> of April last, and rejected by the Senate— Ingersoll moved
                            also the printing of 5000 copies of the map of Texas which was agreed
                            to— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> who is a member of the Committee of foreign Affairs gave
                            notice that the report of the Committee was not unanimous; that no
                            discussion of it had been allowed in the Committee and that all he could
                            do was to protest against it, as unconstitutional in form and substance,
                            and tending directly to the dissolution of the Union— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>A budget of Newspapers every morning from various quarters, draw my
                            attention to articles upon all sorts of subjects and wear away my time like the
                            melting of a candle till I am obliged to attend my duty at the house
                            without leaving upon my memory any thing but a blank— I reached the
                            capitol this morning at a quarter past 11— I went into the library room
                            of the Supreme judicial Court and borrowed the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            volume of <persRef ref="peters-richard2">Peters’s</persRef> Reports containing the case of the Schooner Amistad
                            and her African Negroes— I found <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> and <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M Saunders</persRef> in
                            conclave there together.— The librarian there asked me if I was born on
                            the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July— I said I was.— He said that his
                            reason for asking the question was that it was his own birthday, fifty
                            years later. I went into the Hall where the Supreme Court were in
                            Session, and saw the seven judges in their chairs—<persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Taney</persRef>, <persRef ref="story-joseph">Story</persRef>, <persRef ref="mclean-john2">M’Lean</persRef>,

                            arguing a cause before them— At the house, the select Committee on the

                            in the census of 1840 was announced. John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts,
                            <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Robert Barnwell Rhett</persRef> of South Carolina, <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Kenneth Rayner</persRef> of

                            before the house sundry communications—from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> and the

                            the corporation of the city of New Orleans, upon the Catastrophe on
                            board the Steamer Princeton— They reminded me of the deputation from
                            Troy to <persRef ref="tiberius">Tiberius</persRef> to condole with him on the death of <persRef ref="drususjuliuscaesar">his Son</persRef>, many
                            months after the event; which he answered by condoling with them for the
                            death of <persRef ref="hector">Hector</persRef>— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan</persRef> called up his bill for

                            till he tried but failed to carry the previous question.— Adjourned over

                            plea was touching by its simplicity—and urged in language evidently
                            betokening former ease and comfort and actual urgent want— <persRef ref="royall-anne">M<hi

                            which <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> has published an answer— He said he had been
                            engaged as an editor and writer for newspapers in sundry places, and he
                            was now connected with the Baltimore Patriot— That he wished to give
                            some account of Ingersoll’s publication, and for that purpose to see my
                            address which gave rise to it— I gave him a copy of each of the three
                            papers containing the addresses of 7. October 30 Oct<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> and 6. November, at Boston, Braintree and North Bridgwater.
                            I wished to have some conversation with him on the whole subject but

                        <p>About Sunrise this morning, the Globe of last Evening was brought to me
                            containing the address of <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron V. Brown</persRef> “to the public at large and to
                            the Constituents of the Hon. John Quincy Adams in particular.” This is
                            the third of the gang of conspirators who opened their batteries on me
                            in the Globe of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March last, and whom I
                            exposed in my addresses at Boston—Braintree and North Bridgwater— The
                            Lion and his two Jackals are now out— The first tool of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> <persRef ref="erving-george">George
                            W. Erving</persRef> is yet to be heard from— I must reply at leisure to them all.
                            But the whole tissue of falsehood of Jackson’s Erwin Treaty is abandoned
                            without an attempt to support it— I attended public worship at the Hall
                            of the House of Representatives where <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston</persRef>
                            preached from Luke 22.31. [“]And the Lord said, <persRef ref="peter">Simon</persRef>, Simon, behold,
                            Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; 32. But I
                            have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Tuston speculated after his own manner upon the extraordinary
                            circumstances under which S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Peter was prayed for
                            by Jesus Christ himself; and started an enquiry whether it was a special
                            personal, and exclusive favour granted to Peter, or a general blessing
                            bestowed upon all believers. That there was some specialty in it was
                            beyond a doubt because he was accosted twice by name—Simon—Simon—but
                            as the whole life of Jesus was one continued dispensation of favours and
                            he went about doing good, there was encouragement for every one to hope
                            that he too in his troubles and trials, his temptations and distresses
                            was though unconsciously guarded and sustained by the prayers of the
                            redeemer of the world.— There is cheering benevolence in the thought,
                            and internal evidence that it sprang from a tender and affectionate
                            heart— <persRef ref="u;u">Two young men brothers by the name of Tracy</persRef>, were introduced to
                            me after the service by a member from Connecticut.— After dinner I
                            attended Church at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s, where <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Pine</persRef> read the Evening prayer for the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
                            Sunday in Advent and preached from 2. Corinthians 5.17. [“]Therefore if
                            any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away:
                            behold all things are become new”— A rational essay upon regeneration
                            with an eloquent and pathetic account of his own experience. S<hi

                            the morning service began; but was extinguished so that it was not

                        <p>This day a grate for burning Lehigh Coal was put up in my writing chamber
                            instead of the open hearth and chimney corner in which for the last six
                            winters I have been in the practice of burning wood— Few persons can
                            imagine how gravely the comfort of my life is affected by this trivial
                            incident of mere personal habitudes— Seven months of the year from the
                            first of October to the last of April, I can write only by the side of a
                            fire— For as long a time, I need the convenience of a morning and
                            evening lamp; from 6 to 8 hours every day.— These are the hours of
                            labour for the day—the hours of solitude and of toil.— I must light my
                            fire and my lamp every morning and my capacity to write depends upon the
                            temperature of the atmosphere operating upon my sense of feeling.— The
                            experiment of the coal fire is now again to be tried; heretofore it has
                            not suited me so well as wood— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings</persRef>, <persRef ref="tilden-daniel;tilden-martha">M<hi

                                rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hamlin</persRef> paid me a
                            morning visit— At the house, the first business was the question upon
                            the engrossment of <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan’s</persRef> Bill, for holding the election of Electors

                            day throughout the Union— Duncan demanded the yeas and nays and they
                            were taken 187 ay—and 1. Nay—<persRef ref="woodward-joseph3">Woodward</persRef> of South-Carolina— <persRef ref="black-james2">James A. Black</persRef>
                            only of the South Carolina delegation voted for the bill— <persRef ref="burt-armistead">Burt</persRef>,

                            without an opposing vote— <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> of New-Hampshire moved a suspension of
                            the rules for a motion to print 10000 copies of the majority and

                            87. motion lost. <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> asked leave to introduce a bill to extend the
                            right of suffrage in the city of Washington— Campbell objected, that
                            there was a bill before the house reported by the Committee on the
                            District containing the same provision. Weller moved and carried a
                            suspension of the rules—62 to 124. Weller introduced his bill, and
                            pressed for its immediate passage; but objections were started in his
                            own gang, and the bill was referred to the Committee on the District.—
                            Duncan moved and carried a suspension of the rules to introduce a bill
                            for establishing the territory of Oregon and other purposes, which was
                            referred to the Committee on the Territories. The annual reports of the

                        <p><persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> had in the middle of the Night a fit of coughing incessant for
                            nearly an hour, and distressing to herself and to me, more than words
                            can record.— I was up, between two and three and returning then again to
                            bed lost two of my morning hours from the consciousness of existence and
                            the capacity for action.— At the house after notices given by several
                            members of their intention to ask leave to-morrow or on some subsequent
                            day to bring in sundry bills, <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vinton</persRef> moved a

                            carried; and a budget of crudities of every sort and description issued
                            forth as always happens on resolution days— The first move was by
                            <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef> of Maine was to print ten thousand copies of the

                            being made the Resolution of course went over one day— But Hamlin
                            enquired if he could now cut off debate when the resolution shall come
                            up in order— The <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> said he could by now moving the previous

                                >now</hi> be put;[”] and it could not be in order when a positive
                            rule of the house forbade the taking of the question <hi rend="italic"
                                >now</hi>— The Speaker said no debate was in order now, but that
                            although the form of the previous question was, shall the main question
                                <hi rend="italic">now</hi> be put—it might be moved now and
                            postponed to another day, because without the second of a majority, it
                            could not be put at all— <persRef ref="cranston-henry">Cranston</persRef> intreated of Hamlin as a personal
                            favour to withdraw his motion for the previous question but he would
                            not. <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> moved a resolution that the tariff act of 1842
                            should be modified so far as respects foreign wines, where it conflicts
                            with Treaties or is otherwise objectionable—also that a nominal duty be
                            imposed on all free articles for the precise ascertainment of them—
                            <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of Georgia moved to strike out nominal and insert revenue which
                            produced shouts of laughter— Ingersoll was advised to change his motion
                            into an enquiry of expediency.— This he was glad to do, and in that form
                            his motion passed— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> produced a Letter from <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p><persRef ref="rothwell-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rothwell</persRef> one of the members of the Committee of 3.
                            who invited me to deliver a Lecture at the New, unfinished Baptist
                            Church in E. Street near the general Post Office, and to whom I promised
                            to perform that service came this morning and said they had fixed upon
                            next Friday evening from 7 to half past 7, and that he would call upon
                            me with a carriage at that time— I spoke of the necessity of strong
                            light, and said I should be glad to see the place where I am to read. He
                            said it should be open between 2. and 3. this afternoon. I had summoned
                            a Meeting of the <persRef ref="collamer-jacob;woodward-joseph3;hudson-charles;lumpkin-john;darragh-cornelius;hale-john;moseley-william3;cranston-henry">Committee of manufactures</persRef> to meet in their chamber this
                            morning at 11. O’Clock— By a most vexatious incident The Clock in my
                            writing chamber ran down and stop’d just at that time, so that I was
                            belated in reaching the Capitol, by half an hour. I found every member
                            of the Committee present in the chamber when I arrived and apologized to
                            them for my tardiness— I then said I had called them together merely to
                            organize the Committee—to tell them I had nothing to lay before them,
                            and to take their Commands. If any other member of the Committee had any
                            thing to propose, they would now receive his communication— The word
                            manufactures was not in the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message, and there was nothing
                            referred to the Committee by the house— I proposed therefore to record a
                            minute of the meeting and adjourn without day to be called again, if any
                            reference should be made by the house, or any member of the Committee
                            should desire it— Which was forth with unanimously agreed to— I went
                            down to my seat in the house— A page named <persRef ref="u">Cox</persRef> came and said, a few
                            minutes before the house was called to order, that <persRef ref="sangster-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Sangster</persRef> wished to speak with me at the door— I went to the
                            door at the side—then to the central door but no one accosted me. I
                            turned back and some one said the man is in the lobby— I went into the
                            lobby—a man came up to me, and said you are wrong, you are wrong, and I
                            will kick you— He then passed his right hand before my face and drew it
                            back to strike me— I seized his two arms with my two hands and held them
                            till the by standers came up and took charge of him. I returned to my
                            Seat— They afterwards arrested the man— A magistrate came and in the
                            Speaker’s room sent for me, took my affidavit of the assault, and
                            committed Sangster to answer for it. <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef> of

                        <p>There was no room left on my page of yesterday to notice the proceedings
                            of the house— They consisted of little more than two speeches, both in
                            form against <persRef ref="phoenix-jonas">Phoenix’s</persRef> bill to repeal the duties on rail-road iron, but
                            directly opposite to each other in principle one from <persRef ref="foster-henry2">Henry D. Foster</persRef>
                            hot for a protective tariff and one from <persRef ref="payne-william3">W. W. Payne</persRef> of Alabama, red hot
                            against the protective tariff, and foaming for a horizontal duty of 20
                            per cent— <persRef ref="hammett-william">Hammett</persRef> of Mississippi, saw they were coming to slippery
                            democratic ground, and moved to lay the whole subject on the table,
                            which was carried by yeas and nays 155 to 40— I said I was willing to
                            lay the Bill on the table, if <persRef ref="burt-armistead">Burt’s</persRef> bill to repeal the duty on Cotton
                            bagging and gunny cloth should go on the table also— But <persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef> said no
                            more bargains, and the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> said there must be no debate on a motion
                            to lay on the table— Burt’s bill had been twice read and referred to a
                            Committee without a word of opposition or remark. <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> gave notice
                            that he would this day offer a joint Resolution for the annexation of
                            Texas to the United States; and this day he did introduce it— Twice read
                            and he moved its reference to a Committee of the whole on the state of
                            the Union— <persRef ref="hamlin-edward">E. S. Hamlin</persRef> of Ohio moved its reference to a Committee of
                            one member from each State, with instructions to report upon five
                            questions. The question of commitment to the Committee of the whole on
                            the state of the Union was taken by yeas and nays and carried 109 to
                            60.— <persRef ref="pollock-james">Pollock</persRef> gave notice of his intention to ask leave to introduce a
                            bill or resolution, to submit the question of the annexation of Texas to
                            the People— A Message was received from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, with the brawling
                            correspondence between <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef ref="shannon-wilson">Shannon</persRef> and the Mexican Minster of
                            foreign Affairs <persRef ref="rejon-manuel">Manuel Cresencio Rejon</persRef>— The Message rails at the Mexican
                            Government with the temper of a common scold, and concludes by saying
                            that although we should be fully justified in declaring War against
                            them, he will not recommend that, but only that we should take Texas and
                            then if Mexico makes war upon us, all the responsibility of it shall
                            rest upon her.— The Message was referred to the Committee of foreign
                            Affairs. The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> in the Chair and took up the Bill for graduating the
                            price of the public Lands. <persRef ref="ficklin-orlando">Orlando B. Ficklin</persRef> made a fiery speech for
                            the Bill, and <persRef ref="causin-john">Causin</persRef> of Maryland a warm one against it— <persRef ref="hardin-john">John J. Hardin</persRef>
                            of Illinois from the Post-Office Committee reported a Bill to reduce
                            postage— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> and <persRef ref="frye-thomas">his Son</persRef>, <persRef ref="hall-david">David Hall</persRef> and a
                            <persRef ref="thomas-john7">Doctor Thomas</persRef> were here; and a young man named <persRef ref="sears-philip">Sears</persRef>.</p>

                        <p>I read this morning the whole correspondence communicated yesterday with
                            the message of the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, and see the subjugation of this Union to
                            the double slave representation with deplorable certainty of proof— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John
                            C. Calhoun</persRef> and South Carolina are in the ascendant, and an internal
                            convulsion in Mexico happens at this moment as if by interposition of
                            the evil principle to help him to consummate his abominable purpose— The
                            prospect is deathlike— I found the house in Session. <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Joseph Vance</persRef>
                            chairman of the Committee of claims was calling for the orders of the
                            day—private business— <persRef ref="hardin-john">Hardin</persRef> wanted to get up the Post-Office Bill—
                            <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> wanted to suspend the rules for
                            notices of Bills, and <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron V. Brown</persRef> for Reports of Committees. After
                            two or three votes without a Quorum Dromgoole got the house into
                            Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> in the
                            chair— The bill for graduating the price of the public lands was the
                            unfinished business and <persRef ref="smith-robert4">Robert Smith</persRef> of Illinois had the floor from
                            yesterday. Dromgoole moved to postpone it and said there were certain
                            modifications of it about which its friends were in treaty with one
                            another— To this postponement Robert Smith consented and Dromgoole moved
                            to take up the Sub-treasury Bill, reported by him from the Committee of
                            Ways and Means at the last Session— It was taken up without opposition,
                            and after two or three Sections of it had been read by the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">clerk</persRef>, the
                            further reading of it through was dispensed with and it was read by
                            Sections.— The Clerk had read through the first Section and begun upon
                            the second, when seeing it was going to pass without a sign of life from
                            the opposition I rose and enquired if the first section of the Bill
                            constituting certain vaults in the Treasury building The Treasury of the
                            United States, was the same, as in the old Sub-treasury repealed Law— It
                            was. I moved to strike out the first section of the Bill— The chairman
                            pronounced it not in order, and the question upon it was not suffered to
                            be put.— I gave my reasons however in substance that it annuled the
                            proviso in the Constitution that no money shall be drawn from the
                            Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by Law— This started
                            a debate which continued till half-past 4. when the committee rose and
                            the house adjourned— In the Evening I delivered my Lecture on Society
                            and Civilization at the new Baptist Church— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> passed the

                        <p>There were about 50 persons present last Evening at the delivery of my
                            lecture at the new Baptist Church in E. Street—among whom were <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi

                            who after the lecture were introduced to me.— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                            Bacon said she came from Boston, and she cordially invited me to their
                            house on the College hill— <persRef ref="sewall-thomas">Doctor Sewall</persRef> with his niece, and <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi

                            me— This morning <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> called upon me in high
                            spirits— His bill for the relief of the <persRef ref="blight-julia;crary-cornelia;ludlow-mary">heirs</persRef> of <persRef ref="fulton-robert">Robert Fulton</persRef>, having
                            again passed the Senate— One of the principal obstacles to the passage
                            of this bill hitherto has been the false denial by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef> of his
                            own military order for the employment of a Steamboat of Fulton’s in the
                            public service.— The order under his own hand has been produced but he
                            has not retracted his denial. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell intreated
                            me not to notice this exemplification of Jackson’s memory when the bill
                            shall be before the house— The business of this day in the house of
                            <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole’s</persRef> subtreasury bill— He had moved last evening a resolution to
                            report it to the house in 30 minutes after it should next be taken up in
                            Committee of the whole; but the house adjourned without taking the
                            question upon that motion.— This morning he modified it so as to allow
                            2. hours instead of 30 minutes for debate—this was carried— The house
                            went into Committee of the whole, <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> in the chair, and the two
                            hours were occupied by <persRef ref="henley-thomas">Henley</persRef> of Indiana and others of the democracy, in
                            vilifying the whigs and <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>.— Not a whig was suffered to get the
                            floor, and Cave the chairman gave it in flagrant partiality to Henley in
                            competition with <persRef ref="clingman-thomas">Clingman</persRef> of North Carolina.<space/><persRef ref="white-benjamin">A new member from Maine</persRef>
                            took the floor 5 minutes before the time fixed for reporting, and opened
                            a flood of stench and filth upon the whigs He was interrupted by the
                            report to the house, which the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> had no sooner announced than he
                            started up and continued his speech begun in Committee. <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Barnard</persRef> objected to this as violating the rule that no
                            allusion shall be made in the house to what has passed in Committee; bu
                            the Speaker sustained the Mainiac. But his own party soon got weary of
                            him— One moved the Committee to rise— Another moved the previous
                            question, and he gave up. I moved again to strike out the first Section—
                            The Speaker said it was not in order. The question of engrossment was
                            carried by yeas and nays<space/>to 64. The question on its passage<space/>to 69.
                            close party votes— Adjourned at half past 3.</p>

                        <p>The Speakers in the debate of yesterday, besides those mentioned on the

                            New-York District—Orleans and Niagara District resident at Lockport; a

                            Alabama— Hunt alluded to the democratic nomination at Saginaw for the
                            Legislature of Michigan of <persRef ref="birney-james">Birney</persRef> the Liberty party candidate for the
                            Presidency—which operated like a spark upon a barrel of gunpowder.— The
                            scene was ludicrous. <persRef ref="daily-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>Daily</persRef> the Chaplain to the
                            House of Representatives, has since last Tuesday made the daily two
                            minutes morning prayer from the Speaker’s chair— This morning I heard
                            him preach from Psalm 72.16. [“]There shall be a handful of corn in the
                            earth upon the top of the mountains: the fruit thereof shall shake like
                            Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth 17.
                            His name shall endure forever. His name shall be continued as long as
                            the Sun: and men shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him
                            blessed. 18 Blessed be the Lord God; the God of Israel, who only doeth
                            wondrous things— 19. And blessed be his glorious name forever. And let
                            the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and amen.” The subject of
                            the Sermon was the rapid growth of Christianity; and the delivery was
                            the ne plus ultra of rant and vociferation.— It was upwards, of an hour
                            long—rambling and desultory—interspersed after the methodist manner with
                            little narrative pathetic anecdotes, and with microscopic descriptions
                            of corn on the top of mountains, and the process of nature in the growth
                            of grass.— After the service was over M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily came
                            and shook hands with me at my seat. <persRef ref="sewall-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sewall</persRef> and

                        <p><date>23. V:15. </date>Monday.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation yesterday with <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gouverneur</persRef> he
                            told me that while never doubting of the moral obligation resting on him
                            to inform me of the Letters from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef> to <persRef ref="monroe-james">President Monroe</persRef>,
                            extracts from which he gave me; he had been somewhat embarrassed as to
                            the properest manner for him to proceed in the case— The partizans of
                            Jackson would certainly assail him as in confederacy with me, and would
                            bring against him the charge of betraying the confidence of private
                            correspondence, and Jackson might deny his own Letters, and charge him
                            with forgery as he had charged me with forging my own diary. He said he
                            had consulted <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>, and other friends in this emergency, by
                            whose advice he had drawn up a paper which he proposed to publish in the
                            National Intelligencer signed G. which he read to me; upon which he
                            would be glad to have my advice, and after which I might make such use
                            of the extracts from Jackson’s Letters, and other information received
                            from him as I think proper— He told me further that General Scott had
                            assured him there were two Officers of the army now in this city, who
                            were here in February 1819. and then knowing to my consultation with
                            Jackson about the Florida Treaty— But that he was not permitted to
                            divulge their names.</p>
                        <p>This day at a quarter past 12 I found the house in Session, and the
                            <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> calling the Committees for Reports.— This was the day upon which
                            <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> had given notice that he would call up for
                            consideration in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, the
                            joint Resolution reported by him from the Committee of foreign affairs
                            for the annexation of Texas to the United States, according to the
                            Treaty of 12 April last, rejected by the Senate. But he only moved a
                            resolution to print 10,000 copies of the map of Texas, at a cost not
                            exceeding 12 cents a copy, instead of his former resolution for 5000
                            copies at not exceeding 7 cents a copy— But <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Stephen A. Douglas</persRef> of
                            Illinois introduced another joint Resolution for the re-annexation of
                            Texas to the United States according to the Louisiana Treaty of 1803.—
                            <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron V. Brown</persRef> reported from the Committee on the Territories the bill
                            for the establishment of the territory of Oregon— The Resolutions and
                            notices of Bills Resolutions were numberless— Charles J. Ingersoll
                            presented by special request a petition for the abolition of Slavery,
                            and the application of all the proceeds of the Sales of the public Lands
                            to indemnify the owners of the Slaves for their Loss of them as
                            property— He moved reference to a Committee; but the House laid the
                            petition on the table by yeas and nays 117 to 49. After a hard struggle
                            to keep down the call for the yeas and nays, the house adjourned over to
                            Thursday.</p>

                        <p><persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef> of Utica came in this morning for a short visit on his
                            way to Richmond, Virginia, to see his cousin <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Treadway</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef ref="clark-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Crane</persRef>— I went to the
                            Navy Department with the Letter of <persRef ref="derby-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary Derby</persRef>,
                            in behalf of her brother, <persRef ref="townsend-horatio2">Horatio Townsend</persRef> which I wished to recommend
                            to the Secretary of the Navy <persRef ref="mason-john5">John Y. Mason</persRef> But he was gone upon a
                            Christmas frolic to Virginia, and <persRef ref="morris-charles">Commodore Charles Morris</persRef>, acts as
                            Secretary in his absence— I read M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Derby’s Letter
                            to Commodore Morris, who doubted whether the favour solicited for M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Townsend was within the competency of the
                            Department without an application to Congress— But he took M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Derby’s Letter which he said he would refer to
                            the <persRef ref="dayton-aaron">4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Auditor</persRef> the Officer upon whom the decision
                            will rest. I then passed into the War Department and had a long
                            Conversation with <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>, now Commander in chief of the Army.— He
                            commenced it by observing that he had read the Article in the National
                            Intelligencer of this morning signed G.—being that which M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Gouverneur read to me the day before yesterday.— He said
                            that behind that Article there was a great mass of evidence which he had
                            seen— That there were now in this city, two persons, who were in <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
                            Jackson’s</persRef> apartment in February 1819. when I went there to consult him
                            on the subject of the Florida Treaty— That they had recently each
                            communicated the fact to the other and to him— They perfectly agreed in
                            their recollection; but they had laid him under an injunction of honour
                            not to disclose their names I said that I should probably in the course
                            of next Spring or Summer address my Constituents again upon this
                            subject; and I asked if I might state this fact as he had stated to me,
                            without naming the persons, but vouching him for the fact—he said I
                            might— That it was due to historical truth. And he deemed it the duty of
                            every man to bear testimony to historical truth especially when the
                            character of another was implicated in the fact. <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Gouverneur</persRef> had told me that these two persons were Officers in the army.
                            I said to Scott that if Officers of the army, bound by the laws of
                            honour thought they could withhold their names from testimony of facts
                            known to them I would not insist upon their names.— He said—I do not say
                            they are officers of the army.— I asked him to call at my house; and
                            said I would shew him the volume of my Diary for 1819— He said he would—
                            <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> was here this evening and said a young
                            man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Sangster</persRef>, a nephew of <persRef ref="sangster-thomas">the man now in prison for

                            from prison, by discharging so much of the Justices warrant as required
                            bonds for keeping the Peace— I said I was so far as concerned myself
                            perfectly willing to release him if any security by himself or his
                            friends that he would keep the Peace with me and with all others.</p>

                        <p>Christmas</p>
                        <p>I can give no reason satisfactory to myself for having neglected
                            attending upon the religious public services of this day— Never in my
                            life have I more needed Faith and Hope in the promises of the gospel for
                            relief from anxieties from sources public and private— Never more
                            fervent prayer for direction from above to direct me in the short
                            remnant of the path before me— I have wasted the day with out being
                            aware of my remissness till the day was gone— To the church of which I
                            am a member there are no religious holidays, save the Christian Sabbath;
                            but personally I sympathise with those who solemnize the two
                            anniversaries Christmas and Easter—the birth and the resurrection of
                            Jesus. I had a morning visit from <persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef> the Sculptor, who has been
                            passing some time at Boston, New-York and Philadelphia— He has been
                            making for a company of subscribers a bust of the late <persRef ref="channing-william">Doctor William
                            Ellery Channing</persRef>, and has made a model for an equestrian Statue of
                            Washington He said the sublimest event in the life of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> was the
                            surrender of his Commission at the close of the War of Independence— His
                            Statue was to be commemorative of that act. He had intensely studied for
                            the likeness the bust by <persRef ref="houdon-jean">Houdon</persRef>, and his Statue at Richmond— He had
                            copied his uniform, now a relic at the patent Office, and his hat—and
                            his purpose was to exhibit his person exactly as he was in life. He
                            hoped to be employed by Congress to do this work; and he wished me to
                            see his model, for which purpose I promised to meet him to-morrow
                            morning at 11. in the library room of Congress— The day was uncommonly
                            beautiful and mild— Before dinner I took a walk round the Capitol
                            hill—passed on my return homewards, in the Pennsylvania avenue by the
                            ruins of a Confectioner’s shop consumed this morning by fire— Morning
                            visit from <persRef ref="baldwin-john2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> one of the largest claimants
                            of indemnity from Mexico; with <persRef ref="u">his son</persRef>, a boy of 11 or 12 years old, who
                            brought a beautiful posy as a present to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>

                            about the release of <persRef ref="sangster-thomas">Thomas Sangster</persRef> from prison; and with a Letter from

                            him, admitted him last evening to bail upon a certificate of a physician
                            that he had examined him, and found him of sane mind, and upon laying
                            <persRef ref="u">his nephew</persRef> under bond of 1000 dollars for his appearance at Court next
                            week, and keeping in the mean time the peace— His Letter to me is
                            respectful and apologetic, expressing great regret at his assault,
                            attributing it to sudden and uncontroulable passion</p>

                            here this morning with a little Granddaughter— Her object was to obtain
                            my consent to cancel the lease for ten years which her husband took of
                            the house next door to <persRef ref="u">Captain Marbury’s</persRef>, and of which little more than
                            two years have elapsed— The first years rent was allowed for repairs;
                            the second is only paid; and they have already left the house, on a
                            pretence that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darby found it unhealthy— I
                            declined canceling the lease; but said I would readily agree to transfer
                            it to any other good tenant.— I went between 11 and 12 to the Congress
                            Library where I met <persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef>, and in the Senate’s judiciary Committee
                            room saw his model for the equestrian Statue of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>— He is in
                            uniform with epaulettes breeches and boots, with a military cap in his
                            right hand as if in the attitude of a departing salute, and holding the
                            horse by the bridle with the left hand— The horse is the horse of <persRef ref="aurelius-marcus">Marcus
                            Aurelius</persRef>; and I said to him if he should have the work to do I should
                            advise him to bestow his principal labour on the horse.— He is very
                            enthusiastic in the passion to obtain the undertaking of the work, and
                            says if he does obtain it, with that he will close his career— In the
                            house, a motion was made to reconsider the vote of Monday for the
                            engrossment of the mileage bill, and the discussion was postponed to the
                            3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of January— <persRef ref="Charles J. Ingersoll">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> wormed in a
                            bill providing that the children of Citizens of the United States born
                            abroad shall be deemed native citizens, referred to the judiciary
                            Committee.— <persRef ref="hammett-william">Hammett</persRef> of Mississippi presented a memorial from a coloured
                            man named <persRef ref="couch-william">William Couch</persRef> of Fairfield Connecticut now free; claiming a
                            pension for services in the revolutionary War, while he was a slave. It
                            was referred to the Committee on revolutionary pensions.— I introduced
                            the Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="holmes-joseph">Joseph Holmes</persRef> and the owners and crew of the
                            Schooner Industry, referred to the Committee on Commerce— <persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef> moved
                            a reconsideration of a resolution adopted on Monday authorising the
                            <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerk</persRef> of the house to grant leave of absence to an assistant clerk named
                            <persRef ref="lusk-robert">R. M. Lusk</persRef> for six weeks on account of ill health, and to appoint a
                            temporary clerk at the same salary during his sickness. Houston had
                            voted for the resolution, unaware of the double Salary—on discovering
                            that, his conscience smote him he moved the reconsideration and started
                            an hour of debate which ended where it began— <persRef ref="belser-james">Belser</persRef> of Alabama moved to
                            suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the

                            for Resolutions. Belser renewed his motion. The house refused to go into

                            rain, first warm, then growing cold and turning finally to a cold
                            snow-storm— <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef> had come here with the intention of going
                            no further South than Richmond—but he received last Evening a Letter,
                            from a young Lady of Albany, a family connection, named <persRef ref="u">Heard</persRef>, earnestly
                            intreating him to escort her, as far as Charleston South Carolina, on
                            her way to Mobile, where she is going to reside as governess in a
                            private family— He feels himself obliged to go, and took leave of us
                            this evening, and went on board the Steamer for Fredericsburg to pass
                            the night—her hour of departure being 3 in the morning. I found the
                            house again in Session and <persRef ref="hammett-william">Hammett</persRef> of Mississippi had formally put the
                            question to <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> when he intended to call up his
                            resolution for the annexation of Texas, and he answered next Monday.—
                            <persRef ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef> chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs moved to suspend
                            the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to
                            take up bill N. 214. limiting the number of commissioned and warrant
                            officers in the navy, and regulating the complements of crews on board
                            of vessels of war, and for other purposes. C. J. Ingersoll said he
                            should move to take up a Bill for distributing a sum of money received
                            for indemnities by a recent Convention with Peru— The house went into
                            Committee, <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> in the chair— Parmenter and Ingersoll, each
                            moved to take up his bill; but the chair said the unfinished business in
                            Committee was the bill for reducing and graduating the price of the
                            public Lands, upon which <persRef ref="smith-robert4">Robert Smith</persRef> of Illinois had the floor. He
                            ranted an hour upon the cruel injustice of making the poor settlers in
                            the new States pay a dollar and a quarter an acre for their lands He was
                            followed by <persRef ref="mcclernand-john">John A. M’Clernand</persRef> another land griping patriot from the
                            same State for another hour.— <persRef ref="smith-caleb">Caleb B. Smith</persRef> of Indiana then took the
                            floor but the house were weary of the debate, and the Committee rose
                            without coming to a conclusion. A report from the <persRef ref="bibb-george">Secretary of the
                            Treasury</persRef> was received with the annual report of the superintendent of
                            the Coast survey—and 500 extra copies were ordered to be printed— Sundry
                            private bills from the Senate were twice read and referred to the
                            appropriate Committees— A motion was with difficulty ushered in that
                            when the house should adjourn it should be till Monday—which was carried
                            by yeas and nays, 81. to 68.— I rode home in the Snow-Storm.</p>

                        <p>The snow continued part of this day, and then cleared off cold— <persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis Johnson</persRef> called here this morning, and
                            informed me of the present state of the claim of the legal
                            representatives of the late <persRef ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef> upon the Government of the
                            United States— He said its prospects were not promising— That the
                            decision was delayed, but that the <persRef ref="mcculloch-james">comptroller’s</persRef> objections to further
                            allowance were in no degree relaxed— He said he had examined the
                            original claim to see how much of it had been rejected, and found it
                            exceeded 60,000 dollars.— He gave me to read a Letter from <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolf</persRef> the Attorney of the <persRef ref="otis-nathaniel">brothers</persRef> <persRef ref="otis-ellen">widow</persRef> and
                            <persRef ref="otis-francis;otis-george3;otis-john3;otis-leocadia;otis-manuel">children</persRef> at New-Orleans; stating that the judge of probate there
                            declined issuing Letters of Administration upon the brother’s estate,
                            because there were no effects of his within that probate jurisdiction—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson supposed it would be necessary that
                            the widow should authorise some person to take out Letters of
                            Administration here for her benefit and that of her children— The
                            question between the children born before and after marriage is yet
                            unsettled— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings</persRef> was also here this morning,
                            and suggested to me the expediency of an address to the people before or
                            about the close of the present Session of Congress, by the members
                            opposed to the annexation of Texas; following up that which was issued
                            at the close of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress.— I told him I
                            thought it would be highly advisable, if the deed should not be
                            perpetrated at the present Session— He thinks there is no danger of the
                            passage of that measure, even in the house of Representatives at this
                            Session— I fear he does not sufficiently weigh the despotism of the
                            party drill.— He says there are forty members of the majority who will
                            vote against every plan of annexation. I dread the effect of the
                            revolution now raging in Mexico.— I agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Giddings to speak further with him on this subject.— I had received a
                            Letter from <persRef ref="ellis-william2">William Ellis</persRef> of Dedham, with a certificate of<space/>days
                            service of <persRef ref="dunbar-peter">Peter Dunbar</persRef> in the revolutionary War; necessary to complete
                            the 6 months required to entitle him to a pension— I intended to take
                            these papers to the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of pensions</persRef> this morning, but found I
                            had left the certificate with my list of petitions in my draw at the
                            house— I went and found them there, and brought them home; but it was
                            too late to take them to the Office of the Commissioner of Pensions.</p>

                        <p>Heard <persRef ref="daily-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily</persRef> the chaplain of the house of
                            Representatives in their Hall. His text was Isaiah 63.1. [“]Who is this
                            that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is
                            glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I
                            that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. 2. Wherefore art thou red
                            in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the
                            wine-fat? 3. I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the people there
                            was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them
                            in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I
                            will stain all my raiment. 4. For the day of vengeance is in my heart,
                            and the year of my redeemed is come.” The discourse was an exposition of
                            this passage of <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef> by analysis— It is in the form of a dialogue, by
                            question and answer. The Title to this chapter in my Bible is Christ
                            sheweth his power to save—and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily gave it the
                            same interpretation— He said that th signification of Edom was red
                            earth—and that of Bozrah was affliction or distress—and that it
                            undoubtedly meant Jesus Christ— And the irresistible power of Christ in
                            the gospel. The Sermon was upwards of an hour long, for which he
                            apologized by saying he feared he had detained the auditory longer than
                            they were accustomed to be kept as he came from a part of the Country
                            where the preacher was allowed to discourse just as long as he pleased.
                            He was as vociferous and as hyperbolical as he had been last Sunday. As
                            a specimen of his figures of speech he said it was as extravagant and
                            absurd to think of arresting the prevalence of the kingdom of Christ as
                            it would be to cool the bowels of Aetna with a dew-drop, or to
                            extinguish the internal fires of Vesuvius with a Lady’s smelling bottle—
                            As I was walking home I met in the Avenue <persRef ref="owen-robert">Robert Owen</persRef>, who gave me a
                            small pamphlet containing what he calls his manifesto, that is in three
                            papers published in the National Intelligencer and the Globe his plan
                            for revolutionizing the world. And he said he would bring me to-morrow
                            the book which he lent me once before.— In the afternoon at S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef> alone,
                            read the evening service for the Sunday after Christmas, and preached
                            from Matthew 25.14. [“]For the kingdom of Heaven is as a man travelling
                            into a far Country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them
                            his goods 15. And unto one he gave five talents to another two; and to
                            another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
                            straightway took his journey.”</p>

                        <p><persRef ref="owen-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen</persRef> came this morning and brought me again the
                            book which he had lent me before— I had wasted a long hour in reading
                            his manifesto which he gave me yesterday, a farrago of confused,
                            indefinite ideas, the only clear and distinct proposition in which is
                            the formation of a community in or near Washington, to revolutionize the
                            world, from a world of wretchedness and bad principles to a world of
                            wealth ad libitum, of Peace of Plenty and of Love, without religion—to
                            begin which considerable funds will be required, and an appropriation of
                            not less than three Millions of dollars— He borrowed in return my
                            Lecture upon Society and civilization, which he said he regretted not
                            having heard, but which being precisely at the opposite pole from his
                            system, he will estimate, if he reads it, much as I do his manifesto.—
                            The Sheriff of the County had notified me to attend this morning between
                            10 and 12. O’Clock the grand jury of the criminal court at the
                            City-Hall. I went accordingly, at half-past ten— The court was in
                            session, and they were about to swear in the grand jury— Nineteen men
                            were accordingly sworn, and the judge (<persRef ref="dunlop-james">Dunlop</persRef>) made them a very brief
                            charge in a tone of voice so low, that I heard scarcely a word that he
                            said— They then retired to their chamber— I was sworn as a witness by
                            the Clerk of the Court <persRef ref="brent-w">William Brent</persRef> and the grand-jury immediately
                            afterwards sent for me to their room. I went and related the
                            circumstances of <persRef ref="sangster-thomas">Thomas Sangster’s</persRef> assault upon me; and having stated
                            the facts I said I was aware, that it was not in my power to remit the
                            breach of the peace, but I might without impropriety say, that so far as
                            personally concerned myself I should be glad to see M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Sangster discharged without further prosecution—that he had
                            not struck me, nor had I suffered the slightest injury from him— I knew
                            not what was the occasion of his movement against me, but I had received
                            a Letter from him, apologizing for it, expressing great regret at what
                            he had done, and assuring me that it was from a sudden impulse of
                            passion under influences which he could not controul— From that moment
                            all resentment had vanished from my mind— The Letter was in the style
                            and language of a Gentleman— I understood he had been an Officer in the
                            army, and had faithfully served his country. I should therefore deeply
                            regret if he should be severely dealt with for his mere attempt upon
                            me.— In the house the morning was consumed in a debate upon a Resolution
                            of <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> from the Committee of foreign Affairs for having a
                            map of the United States engraved for the use of the members, which was
                            carried— The death of <persRef ref="fulton-william">W. S. Fulton</persRef> Senator from Arkansas was announced
                            and the house adjourned.</p>

                        <p>The closing day of every year is the special season for retrospection,
                            for thanksgiving, for self-examination; for repentance— It bears every
                            year with increasing gravity upon the conscience and at the stage of
                            life which I have attained, every year with more irresistible
                            demonstration of the decay of body and mind— I am sinking under them—yet
                            I struggle to keep my head above the surface of the flood— My last
                            nights repose was disturbed— I know not from what cause. I rose between
                            3 and 4 with an aching head; and returned for two more hours of waking
                            dreams.— <persRef ref="tilden-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel R. Tilden</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives from Ohio, brought me
                            some days since a small album, with a note saying that he had purchased
                            it for his little daughter <persRef ref="tilden-sarah2">Sarah</persRef>, and requesting me to write something
                            in it. These requests thicken upon me greatly to my annoyance; and the
                            time they consume, and the impotence of mind which they disclose is a
                            continual source of self reproach and mortification— A Sonnet for Miss
                            Tilden’s Album occupied the morning— At the house <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">John W. Tibbatts</persRef> asked
                            leave to introduce a Bill to authorise the People of Texas to form a
                            State Constitution of Government, and for the admission of the State
                            into the Union—and a joint Resolution pledging the protection of the
                            United States to the People of Texas till the question of re-annexation
                            shall be settled. <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> objected to the introduction of these measures
                            without previous notice, whereupon Tibbatts turned his motion into a
                            notice for to-morrow or some subsequent day.— <persRef ref="belser-james">James E. Belser</persRef> of Alabama
                            gave notice of his intention to move a joint Resolution for the
                            annexation of Texas to the United States.— <persRef ref="houston-george">George S. Houston</persRef> of Alabama
                            moved a suspension of the rules for a Resolution to cease debate on the
                            land graduation bill in committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union, and to report it to the house this afternoon—but the vote on his
                            motion by tellers was 49 to 74 no second.— The Committees were then
                            called for Reports, and many were made for notice hereafter— <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef>,
                            chairman of the military Committee reported in favour of two National
                            foundries— <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> chairman of the Committee of foreign
                            Affairs attempted to get entered on the Journal that he had presented a
                            report and bill in favour of <persRef ref="ledyard-henry">Ledyard</persRef> when he had neither report nor bill
                            prepared. He said indisposition had prevented him. <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef> of
                            Maine moved a reconsideration of yesterdays vote, ordering a 20 inch map
                            of the United States for the use of the members— The vote was
                            reconsidered, and the Resolution laid on the table— <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> and
                            <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> went to an Evening party at <persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Commander Wilkes’s</persRef>. <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
