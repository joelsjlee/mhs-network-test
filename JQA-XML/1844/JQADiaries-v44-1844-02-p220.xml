						<p>I attended this morning the meeting of the <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph;davis-garrett;burke-edmund4;sample-samuel;morse-freeman;giddings-joshua;burt-armistead"
								>select Committee</persRef> on the Resolves of the Massachusetts
							Legislature. The attendance was punctual, and by a quarter past ten, all
							the members of the Committee were assembled in the chamber of the
							Committee of manufactures, except <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Thomas W.
								Gilmer</persRef>, who came in a quarter of an hour later— I moved an
							adjournment to this day week, on two grounds— First, that since the last
							meeting of the Committee I had received a new set of Resolves from the
							present Legislature of Massachusetts of the same import with those of
							the last Legislature with one exception which was merely the correction
							of an error by the introduction of the word including, instead of the
							word excluding with reference to Indians.— Secondly that I had not yet
							finished the draft of a Report which I proposed to submit to the
							consideration of the committee— I had twice attempted unsuccessfully to
							obtain the reference to this Committee by the house of the new Resolves
							of the Legislature of Massachusetts— Next Monday will be the regular day
							for presenting them to the house, and I shall then again move their
							reference to this Committee— Gilmer was very urgent to make immediate
							report, and had one ready but would not read it until mine should be
							read. I stated what the general purport of my argument would be; and
							Gilmer read a part of his report, to justify the refusal to receive
							petitions— After much discussion Ingersoll moved to adjourn to this day
							fortnight, which was carried 6. to 3. Burke and Burt voting with Gilmer,
							and Ingersoll and Garret Davis with our minority of four. Gilmer moved
							again to report the journal of the Committee now to the house— Rejected
							6. to 3. the same vote as on the adjournment— In the house, <persRef
								ref="mccauslen-william">M’Causelen</persRef>, a half-way house man,
							between Slavery and Freedom, occupied not quite the whole hour in a
							speech on both sides of the question but inclining against retaining the
							gag-rule from motives of expediency.— When he finished Giddings rose and
							after some chicanery obtained the floor; but had barely time to commence
							his speech when the morning hour expired. The bill authorising the
							transfer of naval appropriations was on its passage for engrossment and
							after the adoption of an amendment proposed by <persRef
								ref="brown-milton">Milton Brown</persRef> passed by yeas and nays
							101. to 68. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> in the Chair— Indian
							appropriation Bill— No conclusion.</p>

						<p>There was a fall of snow last Night sufficient to cover the ground, which
							melted off in the course of this day This was the day to which the
							select Committee on Copy-rights, internal and international was
							adjourned; but I received yesterday notice from <persRef

							that the meeting was adjourned to this day week the 9<hi

							Missouri to take up the Resolution reported by the Committee of foreign
							Affairs, of the inexpediency of meddling with the Oregon territory
							questions at this time.— but the Committee by a vote of 60 to 59.
							refused to take it up.— Then at the motion of <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef>, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, they
							took up the Indian Appropriation Bill and made some progress in the
							consideration of that— This morning, the report of the Committee on the
							Rules was taken up; and <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings</persRef> finished his hour
							speech, which he had barely commenced yesterday.— When he finished
								<persRef ref="hammett-william">William H Hammett</persRef> of
							Mississippi took the floor; but the hour was expiring, and a message
							came in from the Senate, announcing the death of <persRef
								ref="porter-alexander">Alexander Porter</persRef>, a Senator from
							the State of Louisiana, whereupon <persRef ref="slidell-john"
								>Slidell</persRef> the member from New-Orleans, read a cold blooded
							obituary eulogy upon the deceased, <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Joseph
								Vance</persRef> of Ohio pronounced another short frothy panegyric
							upon him, and the usual resolutions were adopted to wear crape and to
							adjourn. Porter was one of the uptarts of Fortune who compose the
							Government of this Union— He was an Irishman—son of a <persRef
								ref="porter-james2">patriot</persRef> executed in one of the Irish
							rebellions, and emigrated with <persRef ref="porter-anna">his
								mother</persRef> first to Tennessee and then to Louisiana— He was a
							man of fine talents, amiable disposition, pleasant temper, benevolent
							heart elegant taste and classical acquirements— His death is a grievous
							loss to the Country, for he will be succeeded by a Stinkard. After the
							adjournment, I went first into Law Library and looked into <persRef
								ref="lofft-capel">Lofft’s</persRef> reports for the case of the
							negro <persRef ref="somerset-james">James Somerset</persRef>; and then
							into the Supreme Court where <persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter

							of Philadelphia— Jones is for the heirs of Girard, and was as drowsy as
							the sound of falling waters— <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> gave me one of the

						<p>The name of <persRef ref="hutchinson-israel">I. P. Hutchinson</persRef>
							on which appears on the page of yesterday is that of a person with whom

							occasional services of a diplomatic character in Portugal, now before

								<persRef ref="yulee-david">David Levy</persRef>, the Jew Delegate

							requesting the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to give

							the Slavers do not instantly lay it on the table, it will start a
							question of the severest trial that I have ever undergone.— I ought
							perhaps to pray that it may not come— If it does, I pray for Prudence
							and Fortitude— No intemperance— No flinching— David was silenced for
							this time— The report on the rules should have come up; but <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> of Alabama moved its
							postponement first to Monday and next till Tuesday, on a pretence that
							Hammett who had the floor was unwell, though <persRef

							20.8. [“]Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” His subject was the
							same with that of <persRef ref="edwards-justin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Justin Edwards</persRef> the Sunday before last, but
							neither of them appears to me to understand the true character of the
							institution, or the import of the precept— The answer of Jesus Christ
							himself to the charge against his disciples of violating the Sabbath,
							gave the true measure of its design. He gave an instance of a case in
							which <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> under the craving of hunger
							had broken through the positive injunction of the law, which reserved
							the shew-bread in the sanctuary for the use of the priests, and then he
							added that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath— It
							is a day of rest from the ordinary labours of the week; but not a day of
							useless idleness, or of exemption from the duties of social life; of
							Justice, benevolence, and humanity. To a minister of religion himself,
							instead of being a day of idleness or even of repose it is emphatically
							a day of labour, and there is no portion of time more suitable for the
							performance of any service of kindness and beneficence to others, than
							the Sabbath day— Neither M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin nor M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards understand this— They receive the
							commandment in its rigour to the letter and condemn the mind of man to
							total inaction one day in seven— And they subject his body, to the same
							Law— This doctrine is so unreasonable that the common sense of mankind
							revolts against it— The attempt to make this periodical idleness an
							article of religion is not merely fruitless—it produces aversion to the
							religion itself of which this is given out as a precept— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards for preaching the same doctrine in
							a church here on the evening of the same day on which he had delivered
							it in the Hall, bred a riot which insulted and silenced him. The hall
							this day was well filled, by a respectable auditory— After dinner I
							attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church where <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the evening prayer for Septuagesima Sunday and made a brief
							exhortation from Matthew 11.28. [“]Come unto me, all ye that travail and
							are heavy laden, and I will refresh you”—taken from the communion
							service which had been administered this morning.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley is recovering from a long and
							severe illness, and is very feeble. The Church is entirely renovated—
								<persRef ref="cutts-richard">Richard S. Cutts</persRef> was here

							stood mute, and the Jew took nothing by his motion— I asked him to show

							of seven negroes who escaped from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Augustine, and were indicted for robbery and murder at Quay Biscayine on

							against the negroes was produced except the indictment— I doubt whether

							inclined to believe that the best policy would be to let them terminate
							the tenth Article of the Treaty— The call for petitions began with a

							proceeded from New-York northward— I offered the Massachusetts
							Resolutions of the present Session— <persRef ref="burt-armistead"
								>Burt</persRef> objected to their being received; and after much
							chicanery, by yeas and nays they laid on the table the objection 74 to
							91. I presented sundry other petitions one of which in the identical

							referred to the committee—to another objection made and reception
							refused 73 to 75. I moved a call of the house; refused and adjourned.— A

						<p>The name of the Portuguese Minister Resident who visited me last Evening,
							is the <persRef ref="figaniere-joachim">Chevalier J. C de Figaniere e
								Morao</persRef>, and he came to speak of a correspondence between
							him and our department of State, in which he complains of the duties
							levied upon Portuguese wines, by the Tariff of 1842, as violating the
							stipulation of our Treaty with Portugal, that the duties levied upon
							Articles the produce of Portugal shall not be higher than upon the <hi
								rend="italic">like</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">Articles,</hi> the growth and produce of any other
							Country— He insists that <hi rend="italic">like</hi> Articles as
							respects wines, have reference only to the colour—red or white, and that
							we can levy no higher duties upon Madeira, than upon all other white
							wines, and no higher duties upon Port, than upon all other red wines— A
							message of the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> has
							referred this subject to Congress, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Figaniere came to tell me that the Committee of foreign Affairs would
							this day present a report favourable to his views, and to ask my support
							to it.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morão was quite dissatisfied with
							his failure to convince <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

							grave was not a like Article with London particular Madeira, and much
							pleased that his reasoning was acknowledged by <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upshur</persRef> to
							be extremely strong.— At the house this day, after two or three
							intrusive preliminaries, the report on the rules came up, and <persRef

								Elmer</persRef>, chairman of the Committee of Elections, called up
							the report of that Committee on the contested general ticket elections—a
							privileged subject which is to override every thing else— The first
							atchievement was to take it out of the Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union to which it had been referred, and where the previous
							question could not be started. <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> made the motion— Elmer acquiesced. <persRef

								>Beardsley</persRef> sitting as Speaker decided it against him, and
							the house by yeas and nays 117 to 62 sustained the Speaker.— By a
							similar, though not quite so strong a vote, the Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union was discharged, 107 to 73. and Lucius Quintius
							Cincinnatus bestowed all his tediousness upon the house till four
							O’Clock when they adjourned— <persRef ref="kennedy-andrew"

						<p>The Snow fell in the night, so that the ground and the roofs of the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wakeman</persRef> came and had a full
							hour’s conversation with me. He is a young man from Herkimer County in
							the State of New-York—an entire Stranger to me; but whose object was to
							ask questions of my opinions upon various subjects chiefly relating to
							Slavery, and also of advice to him for his own conduct— He said he was
							in very narrow circumstances, but was desirous of devoting himself to
							the profession of the Law. His most immediate and urgent enquiry was
							whether his best course would be to commence off-hand the study of the
							Law, or to begin by acquiring the preliminary foundation of a college
							education— I told him that if his purpose was to become eminent in the
							profession, he must lay his foundation broad and deep. He must commence
							by making himself master of college learning; but if he aspired to
							nothing further than qualification for the practice of a village lawyer,
							he might pick up his classical and his law learning together, and with
							an industrious use of the long and tedious leisure which he would have
							in waiting for employment of all his time in practise he could easily
							gather general and particular knowledge, at the same time.— <persRef
								ref="espy-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Espy</persRef> the
							storm-breeder came with a complaint that the Committee of Ways and Means
							were about to retrench the appropriation for some small interloping
							office under the War department with which he has been allowed for the
							last two years to pursue his study of Storms. He said he had
							cotemporaneous observations made at 150 military stations the results of
							which he had reported to the <persRef ref="porter-james">Secretary of
								War</persRef>, and his report had been communicated with that of the
							Secretary accompanying the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President’s</persRef> annual message to Congress—and he shewed me
							ninety engraved maps on which were marked the direction of all the
							storms at the several Stations of observation, all confirmative of his
							theory— At the house the day was again consumed on the general ticket

						<p>The concert last Evening was of the <persRef ref="hutchinsonfamily"
								>Hutchinson family</persRef>—three men, brothers and one girl of 16
							or 17. a sister, part of a family of 13 children born and raised in New

							on the violencello and sings. The third growls the base and they sing
							trios, and some times quartetts with the sister, grave and gay, pathetic
							and doggerel, with words and music composed by or for themselves— They
							sent me five tickets for myself and my family, by <persRef
								ref="hale-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hale</persRef>, a
							member of the house from New-Hampshire with an urgent invitation to
							attend— After the concert was over the eldest of the brothers came,

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis Johnson</persRef> came this
							morning with an authenticated affidavit of the <persRef ref="otis-ellen"

							and <persRef ref="potter-emery">Potter</persRef> of Ohio absent—

							and<space/>Sections of amendment to it printed since the last meeting of the

							copy right property; fit for nothing but to multiply litigation, and not
							even touching upon the subject first referred to the committee, a
							Memorial for an international copyright Law— After the reading of the
							Bill and amendments I suggested a question of the expediency of any
							change in the existing copy-right Laws— But there was not time to
							discuss the question, and the Committee adjourned to meet again when
							notified by the Chairman— The house again consumed the day on the
							general ticket election question— <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Jacob

								ref="stephens-alexander">A. H. Stevens</persRef> of Georgia,
								<persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron Vail Brown</persRef> of Tennessee

								ref="norris-moses">Moses Norris jun<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at Sunrise 16.</p>
						<p>I called this morning at the Office of the first comptroller, <persRef
								ref="mcculloch-james">M’Culloch</persRef> at the Treasury Department
							to urge upon him as far as was within my competency, the equitable
							claims of the legal representatives of <persRef ref="otis-william3"
								>William Otis</persRef> to a further allowance for interest, on the
							amount of his claim, which has been allowed and paid— I went at the
							request of <persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lewis Johnson</persRef> the Administrator—and expressed to the
							comptroller my opinion and my desire that the further allowance of
							interest should be made in order that justice so far as it is within the
							power of the government to administer it should be done to the claim a
							man utterly ruined and who died in prison, for the faithful discharge of
							his duty as a public officer; with a large sum of money due to him as is
							now acknowledged, due to him by the Government at the time of his death—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Culloch stated, that there had been
							repeated settlements of this claim before he came into office; and one
							since, by him with the late <persRef ref="key-francis">Francis
								Key</persRef>, Counsel for the Administrator— This settlement
							allowed all that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Key had claimed and he
							was perfectly satisfied with it—but in order to sanction it the opinion
							of the late <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Attorney General Legaré</persRef>
							had been taken— This was generally unfavourable to the claim but
							contained an intimation that the claim if just as then presented was
							good, it would be so for more interest, and this he took to be the
							origin and only foundation of the present claim— He promised, however to
							revise his decision on the case and to refer it again to the <persRef
								ref="nelson-john">present Attorney General</persRef> for his
							opinion— I deposited at the Patriotic Bank 13. Notes at 60. 75 and 90
							days from the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December, the day of
							the Sale of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s</persRef> effects—those at 60 days,
							being payable next Tuesday.— I left them for collection— I called next
							at the Office of the Register of the Orphans Court, and left the Bill of
								<persRef ref="u">Doctor Hall</persRef> sworn to by him, for medical
							attendance upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T B. Johnson— I thought
							it necessary to have the certificate of the judge that it should pass,
							before paying it. I was promised it should be sent to me next Tuesday.
							At the house the everlasting general ticket election again consumed the
							day.— <persRef ref="norris-moses">Moses Norris jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> of New-Hampshire wasted the first hour,
								<persRef ref="chappell-absalom">Abraham Chappell</persRef> of

								Jameson</persRef> of Missouri; closing for the day with <persRef
								ref="lumpkin-john">John H. Lumpkin</persRef> of Georgia till the
							adjournment after 5— I made an escape from the house while Norris was

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at Sunrise 14—</p>
						<p>I attended public worship this morning at the Representative Hall where
							the <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">chaplain of the house</persRef>
							performed divine service with so much brevity that it seemed as if he
							thought his great official duty was to try in how little time he could
							turn it off. The whole job took him not more than three quarters of an
							hour. The text of his discourse was from Philippians 1.28. “And in
							nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token
							of perdition, but to you of salvation and that of God.”— The latter part
							of the verse— He spoke without notes—said nothing which could fix itself
							upon the memory—nothing but dull commonplace devotion, without even that
							fervour which betokens the sincere conviction of <persRef
								ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> of the truth of his own doctrines.— He defined not
							very accurately the meaning of the word token, but did not clearly
							specify those whose perdition was evidently betokened.— Nor what the
							token was. This man’s election as Chaplain to the house is a problem— So
							is the facts that last week a subscription paper was circulated round
							the Hall for printing his Sermon upon Faith, delivered the Sunday before
							last.— The auditory this day was very small— I walked home, and after
							dinner attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, where
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the evening service for Sexagesima Sunday and
							the Bishop of Vermont <persRef ref="hopkins-john2">Hopkins</persRef>
							preached from Hebrews 2–15 “And deliver them who through fear of death
							were all their life-time subject to bondage.” What a contrast to the
							Sermon of the Chaplain— The Bishop’s discourse was on the fear of death
							inherent in the nature of man—on his subjection to bondage throughout
							life by that fear; and on redemption from that bondage by sincere faith
							in Christ the redeemer— A close compact argument, all flowing from and
							returning to the text. Death—bondage—redemption—what intense feeling!
							what absorbing interest—what searching pathos—are interwoven with the
							solemn discussion of these topics! The bishop seized upon them, and
							familiarly handled them all—in composition of refined and elegant
							simplicity—in a tone of delivery kind, affectionate and deeply
							impressive— It is long since I have heard an appeal so eloquent to my
							own conscience, and when the enquiry came to every hearer, whether <hi
								rend="italic">he</hi> could safely and confidently rely upon his own
							right to the blessing of that redemption from that bondage of the fear
							of death, my conscience smote me, and the involuntary tear stole down my
							cheek— I had never before to my remembrance heard the name of bishop
							Hopkins— I shall remember him as long as any trace of Memory remains
							upon my brain— <persRef ref="child-david">David Lee Child</persRef> this
							morning came in from New-York, and spent three hours of this Evening
							with me— Will the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> exclude
							him from the Hall?</p>

						<p>The winter is relaxing and I trust, I shall suffer no more this season of
							disqualification for writing, by the severity of the cold— This has not
							been unusually great here; but the harbours of New-York and Boston have
							been frozen over, and the navigation of Long-Island Sound for some time
							interrupted.— At the house this day, <persRef ref="clinch-duncan">Duncan

							Representatives from the State of Georgia— <persRef
								ref="rockwell-julius">Julius Rockwell</persRef>, and <persRef

							Massachusetts; and <persRef ref="abbott-amos">Moses Abbott</persRef> is
							daily expected having at last been elected from the third
							district—thereby completing the representation of Massachusetts in the
							present Congress— In the house this day the report of the Committee of
							Elections on the right of the spurious general ticket members, was
							resumed— <persRef ref="french-richard">Richard French</persRef> of
							Kentucky gave an hour of his most elaborate nonsense to prove that the
							districting Section of the Apportionment act of 1842. was not law,
							because <persRef ref="blackstone-william">Blackstone</persRef> defines
							Law to be a rule of conduct, and a rule of action— Then followed
								<persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Samuel F. Vinton</persRef> of Ohio with
							a sound, logical and conclusive argument in support of the districting
							section in which he pointed out some of the absurdities of <persRef
								ref="douglas-stephen">Douglass’s</persRef> report which Douglass by
							frequent interruptions vainly attempted to defend. <persRef
								ref="black-edward">Edward J. Black</persRef> of Georgia then assumed
							that the objection to the general ticket elexctions was a proposition to
							expel 21 members from their seats and to disfranchise the four States
							which sent them. And then he raved his hour about the horrible injustice
							and atrocious tyranny of expelling 21 members and disfranchising four
							Sovereign States, when the members have committed no offence and are not
							even charged with any crime— This shuffling trick of misstating the
							Question, and setting up a man of straw to make a pompous demonstration
							of knocking him down, is a measure of the capacity of Edward Black, and
							of the majority of this house—for his vapid absurdities passed for
							argument as cogent as if it had pointed directly at the question before
							the house— <persRef ref="dickinson-david2">David W. Dickinson</persRef>
							of Tennessee came next and bore down more upon his Colleagues <persRef
								ref="brown-aaron">A. V. Brown</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, for voting themselves for

						<p>I called at the Patriotic Bank, and deposited 22 dollars and 77 cents

							the six notes that I left there last Sunday payable in 60 days, four
							have been paid, and two protested. I left them however at the bank,
							supposing that promissors or endorsers may call and pay them in a few
							days— At the house, another long and tedious day was consumed in
							discussing the questions upon the general ticket elections. The debate
							of the morning was commenced by <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Hugh A.
								Haralson</persRef> of Georgia, and continued by <persRef

							and to escape an hour or two of soporifics left the Hall and went into
							that where the Supreme Court were in Session to see what had become of
								<persRef ref="girard-stephen">Stephen Girard’s</persRef> Will and

							nearly deserted, and <persRef ref="morehead-james">Governor

								<persRef ref="crittenden-john">Crittenden</persRef> sitting at his

							2.—the whigs refusing to vote Then followed the names of every member
							from the 4 general ticket States, all declared duly elected: and the
							yeas and nays were taken upon each member separately in the delegations
							of New-Hampshire and Georgia till about 8. O’Clock when the adjournment
							was carried.</p>

							Gilmer read his report on the Resolves.— Such a report as might be

							called for the consideration not of the Resolutions at the close of
							Gilmer’s Report; but of the Resolution he had offered at the first
							meeting of the Committee—that the amendment proposed by the Legislature
							of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended— I enquired if any other
							member of the Committee wished to submit his views— Ingersoll and Burke
							said they purposed so to do— I objected that it was premature to take
							the final question, before all the members had communicated their
							opinions— But Gilmer was this day nominated, and by the Senate
							immediately confirmed as Secretary of the Navy; and Sample urged the
							necessity of an immediate vote on the main question, that Gilmer might
							make his report to the house, before resigning his seat as a member. I
							moved to insert on the minutes that the question was taken to
							accommodate a member about to cease to be of the Committee— But all the
							members of the Committee except Giddings voted against this— Gilmer
							sneeringly thanked me for my kindness— I answered him that he might
							economize his thanks, that I had too much experience of the character of
							his kindness to have any such to offer him in return. I moved the
							resolution at the close of my report, to postpone the further
							consideration of the Resolves to the first Monday of next December.—
							This was rejected on the final vote— Gilmer Burke, Burt, Davis,
							Ingersoll and Sample voted for Gilmer’s Resolution— Giddings and I voted
							against it; and Morse asked to be and was excused from voting. It was
							then agreed that Gilmer should make his report also signed by Burt to
							the house— That when Ingersoll and Burke should be ready another meeting
							of the Committee should be called when their reports should be read and
							with mine, and the journal be reported to the house—and the Committee
							adjourned— In the house <persRef ref="kennedy-john">John P.

						<p>I received last evening a Report, by <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef> as Chairman of a joint Committee of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts, with two Resolves, concerning the annexation of Texas to
							the United States. It is to be seen, and of deep importance, what the

								<persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Clintock Young</persRef>—chief Clerk of the Treasury Department
							with a bundle of papers prepared to be reported to the House in answer
							to a Resolution offered by me of enquiry into the condition of the
							Smithsonian fund.— I looked over some of the papers and found they
							contained a part of the information that I wanted— He said the report
							would be sent in this day—but he afterwards wrote me a note advising me,
							that the <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary</persRef> had gone to
							visit the Princeton a new Steamer just arrived and that the Report would
							be sent in on Monday— <persRef ref="mather-sarah">M<hi

							at Brooklyn, Long Island, inventress of a Submarine Telescope, an
							instrument for seeing objects deep under water; such as the bottoms of

							Congress would purchase her invention, and has a memorial to that effect
							before the Committee of Naval Affairs— I promised to converse with
								<persRef ref="parmenter-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parmenter</persRef> now chairman of that Committee on the subject.
							As I entered the house a man by the name of <persRef ref="u"
								>Skinner</persRef> stop’d me with a Letter of introduction from
								<persRef ref="foster-ephraim">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ephraim

							empty— In the Law Library for a volume of Pennsylvania Laws which was
							not there. At the Congress Library where I found the first volume of the
							fourth series of American Archives p. 1524. and the Annual Register for
							1775— The house adjourned at 4— There was a duel yesterday between two

									>r</hi> Musgrave</persRef>, a presbyterian clergyman from
							Baltimore— His text was 1. Corinthians 16.22. “If any man love not the
							Lord Jesus Christ; let him be Anathema Maranatha.” This with the
							preacher’s exposition might be termed a cool hundred of eternal
							damnation— He first notice the peculiar position of this malediction at
							the close of the epistle—between the salutation of the Apostle with his
							own hand, and the benediction upon those to whom the Letter was
							addressed— He said it was <persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> custom to
							employ an amanuensis to write his apostles, and then to address them in
							a salutation and benediction with his own hand, and that it was in this
							manner that this curse had been so emphatically denounced— He then
							explained the meaning of the words— Anathema was a greek word meaning to
							separate, set apart, or devote. Maranatha was Hebrew, meaning the Lord
							cometh, or, May the Lord come— He said there were in the Hebrew ritual
							three degrees of devoting to a curse of which Maranatha was the third,
							and signified total destruction.— Then he noticed the comprehensive
							universality of the curse— If “<hi rend="italic">any</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">man</hi>” and so forth, and then he defined the <hi
								rend="italic">Love</hi> of Christ—to love him was to obey his
							commandments, by their fruits ye shall know them.— And every man
							professing to be a Christian must understand that this condemnation if
							he incurs it is eternal, and that it will be perfectly just— In
							credulous Odi— It cannot be so. But it may perhaps not be amiss to be
							told so. A commination which has even a colour of authority from
							Scripture, deserves to be seriously listened to, and deliberately
							considered— Its tendency is to purity and righteousness— Take the
							warning and be safe— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Musgrave came to my

						<p>I called this morning at the Department of State, and read to the
							Secretary <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Abel P. Upshur</persRef> a Letter I
							had received from <persRef ref="palfrey-john">John G. Palfrey</persRef>,
							now the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, concerning a
							demand of certain documents relating to land-grants, from the British
							Colonial Government of New-Brunswick— This demand has been repeatedly
							renewed, through the Department of State and the British Minister here
								<persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fox</persRef>—without obtaining the documents or as yet an answer
							from the Government of New-Brunswick— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Upshur said he would repeat the application, and the New Minister from
							Great-Britain <persRef ref="pakenham-richard">Sir Richard
								Pakenham</persRef> having arrived in this Country, and being
							announced as having been yesterday at Baltimore, would probably be here
							in a day or two, and might bring some decision upon the subject from the
							Government in England— I stated to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upshur
							the gross error detected in the printed census of 1840. principally, in
							the return of 133 insane and idiot coloured people, in the town of
							Worcester Massachusetts; and wished to know whether the error was in
							printing the census or was on the original return— They were examined
							and the error was found there— I went into the Library, and there found
							at last an Edition of the Laws of Pennsylvania containing the act
							incorporating the first abolition Society; and <persRef
								ref="greenhow-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenhow</persRef> promised me a copy of it— At the house this was
							the day for the call of the States for Petitions; and I had scarcely
							taken my Seat, when the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef>
							called out Petitions are in order from the State of Massachusetts. I had
							forgotten that the call would thus commence, and presented ten or a
							dozen which I had not yet entered upon my list— <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund4">Edmund Burke</persRef> presented a petition from
							22 members of the Legislature of Rhode-Island, praying for an
							investigation of the conduct of <persRef ref="tyler-john">President
								Tyler</persRef> in the <persRef ref="dorr-thomas">Dorrite</persRef>
							insurrection, and into the right of the present members to hold their
							seats. He moved its reference to a select Committee of five, and at the
							suggestion of <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef>, that it be
							printed—both which after much agitation, and several takings of yeas and
							nays were both carried— The abolition and anti-slavery petitions were
							generally treated very contemptuously by the house. The call went
							entirely through the States and Territories.— The report of the <persRef
								ref="spencer-john">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> on the
							present condition of the Smithsonian fund was sent in of which <persRef
								ref="young-mcclintock">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Young</persRef> apprized me by a private note. I moved its reference
							to a select Committee of 9. and that with the Documents it should be
							printed. Burke moved its reference to the joint Committee on the
							Library. To this I objected and assigned my reasons, whereupon Burke
							unexpectedly to me withdrew his motion; and mine was carried. Adjourned
							over till Wednesday— I walked home— Beautiful weather.</p>

							and below the water line, and carrying 24. 42 pound Carronades, and on
							her main deck two enormous wrought iron cannon, with barrels of 14
							inches diameter, chargeable with 40 pounds of powder, and discharging a
							ball of 225 pounds weight— This vessel a gimcrack of sundry other
							inventions of <persRef ref="stockton-robert">Captain Stockton</persRef>
							himself, was built under his directions, and is commanded by him— She
							was ordered round here to be exhibited to the <persRef ref="tyler-john"

								ref="upshur-abel;spencer-john;porter-james;nelson-john;gilmer-thomas;wickliffe-charles"

							Senators, and for this day at 11. O’Clock, Captain Stockton had issued a
							card of invitation to every member of the house of representatives
							besides a general one in the National Intelligencer of this morning.—
							Holmes’s motion to adjourn over the day, was carried by evading the call
							for the yeas and nays, and even the call for tellers.— This morning,
							after a call at the Bank of the Metropolis to deposite a check for 600
							dollars, which I received from the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef> yesterday, and to draw 100 dollars for the daily

								>John’s</persRef> widow’s account against the Estate of <persRef

								<persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>, to
							Greenleaf’s point, and thence embarked in the Princeton’s barge on board
							of that vessel— I was punctual to the hour of 11. and the first of the
							company that came. Captain Stockton received me with great politeness,
							and shewed me all the machinery of the ship. Afterwards upwards of 100
							members of the house came on board. The two great guns are called the
							Peacemaker and the Orator, a salute was fired from the Carronade’s, and
							the Peacemaker was three times discharged. The vessel was steamed down
							12 miles to Fort Washington and back to her moorings opposite
							Greenleaf’s point. A plentiful cold collation was served— We reached
							home at 4. P.M.</p>

							general consent of the house I moved that the use of the Hall should be
							granted for next Tuesday evening to the American Bible Society, which
							was adopted without opposition— There were Resolutions of the
							Legislature of the State of Indiana for the occupation of the Oregon
							Territory, referred last Monday to the Committee of foreign Affairs— The
							Committee had already reported against the measure; and their report was
							before the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. <persRef

							the Committee of Foreign Affairs had suffered the reference to be made;

							then— This day he was not in his seat—and so his motion for
							reconsideration was postponed till tomorrow. Next came the report of the
							Committee on the rules— <persRef ref="burt-armistead">Armistead
								Burt</persRef> of South-Carolina, made a furious hour speech against
							the abolitionists, and grossly insulted <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel"
								>Beardsley</persRef>; and defied him— When he closed <persRef

							pension bill—rose after four O’Clock, and the house adjourned.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="washington-george">Washington’s</persRef> birthday—</p>
						<p>As I was returning from the house yesterday a man by the name of <persRef
								ref="pennington-john">Pennington</persRef> stopped me in the avenue
							and intreated me to attend at half past 7 in the evening a lecture which
							he would deliver on a system of aerostation or of aerial steam
							navigation, of his invention— In rather weak compliance with his urgency
							I took his ticket and went and heard his lecture by which it was
							apparent that the man was a monomaniac— He had a very complicated
							machine, with a printed pamphlet, and engraving of his machine, second
							edition, which in a very confused manner he attempted to explain— There
							were only five or six persons present, and his lecture of half an hour
							consisted chiefly of complaints that he had been charged with insanity
							and of arguments to shew that he was of perfect sound mind— I had lost
							my time; but I could reflect and compassionate the frailty of human
							nature— This day at the house <persRef ref="kennedy-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kennedy</persRef> introduced <persRef
								ref="causin-john">John M. S. Causin</persRef> member from the first
							and <persRef ref="brengle-francis">Francis Brengle</persRef> from the
							second Congressional District of Maryland who were sworn and took their
							Seats— The member from the<space/>district also afterwards came in— <persRef
								ref="dellet-james">James Dellet</persRef> of Alabama a whig Slave
							monger made an hour speech for the gag and against <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> and me, full of frothy
							eloquence and invective— The Slavers have become bolder with the arrival
							of the Maryland delegation, and having now ascertained that they will
							carry the restoration of the gag the three successive Speeches of
								<persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="burt-armistead">Burt</persRef> and Dellet have exhibited a
							regular ascending graduation of overbearing insolence and bullying. To
							leave it all without reply, would be tame submission. To reply in the
							same tone might breed a brawl, for which I should be held responsible by
							the public.— To say just what will be proper and nothing more requires
							counsel from above— May it not be withheld— When Dellet’s hour closed
								<persRef ref="rogers-charles2">Charles Rogers</persRef> of New-York
							obtained the floor for to-morrow. There is a bill to repeal the
							distribution Law introduced by <persRef ref="payne-william3"
								>Payne</persRef> of Alabama— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> moved its reference to the Committee of Ways
							and Means which was carried— <persRef ref="henley-thomas"
								>Henley</persRef> of Indiana moved a suspension of the rules, to
							offer a Resolution, joint, for closing the Session in May— The vote was
							announced 108 to 54. Exactly two thirds; but the <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> voted in the negative and
							declared the rules were not suspended— The house went into Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union, Campbell in the chair, and took up
							the pension appropriation bill which was debated, and finally reported
							to the house—previous question, and adjourned— I had gone into the
							Senate Chamber—heard an excellent Speech of <persRef ref="choate-rufus"
								>Choate</persRef> on the Oregon question, and had some conversation
							with <persRef ref="huntington-jabez">Huntington</persRef> and <persRef

								>Francis S. Key</persRef> since deceased.— He now considers it
							however as extorted from him by duress, and such engagements never are

								<persRef ref="mcculloch-james">M’Culloch</persRef> and his offer to

							the God of Justice be his guide and guard—and the God of Mercy protect

							this error was the cause of another— The suspension of the rules was
							actually carried and the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> on
							the strength of former precedents decided that Henley might offer his
							resolution now.— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef>

						<p>A considerable number of private bills were reported yesterday by the

								<persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> called in the evening, and we settled the accounts
							between him and the estate of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Thomas

							by his giving me a check on the same bank for 37 dollars and 37 cents,
							in payment of his note for articles purchased by him at the auction sale
							of 11. December. This morning I returned the visit of <persRef
								ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pakenham</persRef>, the new Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
							Plenipotentiary from Great-Britain; who brought me a Letter of
							introduction from <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
							Everett</persRef>— He has a Secretary with him; a young man, by the name
							of <persRef ref="bidwell-john">Bidwell</persRef>— At the house the day
							was consumed in debate on the report on the rules. <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef>, who had the floor,
							withdrew his motion to recommit the report, whereby <persRef

							Report after the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule and insert
							another set of his own selection, with revival of all the rules of
							despotic majorities—and he moved to postpone the further consideration
							of the subject till next Tuesday, and that his proposed amendment should
							be printed— Dromgoole’s object now is to conjure up debate upon many
							other points and mingle them with the gag-question, and entangle them
							all together so as to evade the direct question upon the gag—alone of
							the issue of which so taken, he is afraid— Numbers of the Northern
							Democracy, afraid of their constituents if they vote for the gag, and
							afraid of losing the vote of the South for <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> if they vote against it
							suffer Dromgoole to lead them by the nose to relieve them from voting
							directly upon that question at <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> moved as an amendment to his amendment to strike
							it all out, and substitute the rule, that all abolition petitions shall
							be received and laid on the table without any other action of the house
							upon them— Then came a debate upon that, and <persRef
								ref="steenrod-lewis">Steenrod</persRef> moved to lay the whole
							subject on the table—rejected by yeas and nays 82 to 112. I enquired
							what had become of <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> minority
							report and called upon <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef>
							who had signed it—whereupon Dromgoole broke out again with the
							pretension that there is no right to make minority reports. <persRef
								ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hamlin</persRef> moved the previous question
							but withdrew it at Chapmans request he promising to renew it— He then
							came out with a dogged attack of a quarter of an hour upon me, and
							closed with the previous question. I asked five minutes to reply, but
							was refused— Adjourned before 4.</p>

						<p>The further consideration of the report on the rules was postponed

								>Dromgoole’s</persRef> amendment was ordered to be printed— I
							received visits last evening from the <persRef ref="cox-samuel">Rev<hi

								Cox</persRef> of Brooklyn Long-Island, the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi

								Smith</persRef> and another clergyman from New-York with <persRef
								ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> the
							pastor of the second presbyterian church— The others are here to attend
							the meetings of the Washington Bible Society next Monday and of the
							American Bible Society, in the Hall of the house of Representatives next
							Tuesday evening.— This morning I attended public worship at the Hall.
							Notice had been given in the National Intelligencer of yesterday
							morning, that <persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tinsley</persRef> would preach, by request upon a
							particular subject—which had somewhat excited my curiosity— But his text
							was Hebrews, 4.14. [“]Seeing that we have a great high priest, that is
							passed into the heavens, Jesus, the son of God, let us hold fast our
							profession. 15. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched,
							with the feeling of our infirmities.” The most hacknied, and most
							unedifying of all the calvinistic doctrines—the atonement. After dinner,
							being a little belated at the second Presbyterian Church, I found D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cox of Brooklyn, reading the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of 2. Corinthians and commenting
							as he went along. Afterwards he took for his text the last four verses
							of the same chapter 18. “And all things are of God, who hath reconciled
							us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
							reconciliation; 19. To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the
							world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
							committed unto us the word of reconciliation 20. Now when we are
							Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you
							in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God. 21. For he hath made him to
							be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness
							of God in him.” The atonement again—but here rolled up in all the
							metaphysical subtleties of <persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef>.
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cox is a perfect master of them, and
							deals them out with unsparing hand. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cox
							has an answer at hand for every objection to the doctrine of atonement;
							but the misfortune is that he often states the objection stronger than
							the answer— In the evening with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and our granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef>, I attended at Trinity Church, where <persRef
								ref="stringfellow-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stringfellow</persRef> was reading prayers for the first Sunday in
							lent, after which the <persRef ref="tyng-stephen">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Stephen H. Tyng</persRef>, a son of
							my old friend <persRef ref="tyng-dudley">Dudley Atkins Tyng</persRef>,
							preached from Luke 2.34— [“]Behold this child is set, for the fall, and
							rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken
							against— 35. that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed”—a
							discourse of some originality—and not ineloquent— The house was crowded.
								<persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here at tea.</p>

						<p>I despatched a Letter to <persRef ref="fahnestock-levi">Levi

								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> club at Baltimore in answer
							to one from them with an elegant walking stick from Ashland which I
							declined accepting, and promised an answer to their Letter which from
							mere embarrassment what to say I have procrastinated till <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john">J. P. Kennedy</persRef> has twice hinted to me
							their impatience to receive it— At the house it was the regular
							bi-weekly day for the call for Resolutions, before which sundry
							Executive communications were laid before the house— One of them a
							message from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> saying
							that he had appoved the bill authorizing the transfer of naval
							appropriations from one head of expenditure to another; but that it was
							of no avail—he recommends further legislation upon the subject; and also
							for the construction of several ships of war like the Princeton, but of
							a larger class— More naval appropriations. Referred to the Committee of
							Naval affairs, of which <persRef ref="parmenter-william"
								>Parmenter</persRef> is chairman since <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise’s</persRef> resignation— I spoke to him about this message—but
							he told me that Committee would not propose any increase of the Navy
							Appropriations— <persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin">Bidlack</persRef> moved
							a suspension of the rules to take the question upon a resolution of
							enquiry moved by him heretofore about coal and iron— I said I was
							perfectly willing to vote now, and in favour of his resolution, if the
							house would extend the favour to other Resolutions in the same
							condition— Bidlack withdrew his motion— Among the Resolutions offered
							was one by <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> of enquiry of
							the <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Postmaster General</persRef>, about
								<persRef ref="hill-isaac">Isaac Hill’s</persRef> contracts to
							furnish Blanks paper and twine to that Department. Adopted.— I offered a
							call upon the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of State</persRef>
							whether any gross errors have been discovered in the official returns of
							the Census of 1840 printed under the direction of the State Department—
							I expected objection to this call; but there was none— It was adopted as
							were many others among them two of three anti-abolition abstractions
							moved first by <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> and then by
								<persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South Carolina,
							which occasioned much confusion, but were carried by almost unanimous
							votes—adjourned about 5. O’Clock— In the Evening I attended at the
							Presbyterian Meeting house at 4 1/2 street a Meeting of the Washington
							Bible Society, at which <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Matthew S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair Clarke</persRef> presided—
							Resolutions were offered and addresses delivered by <persRef

							and by <persRef ref="hudson-charles">Charles Hudson</persRef>, the

								<persRef ref="king-james2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Gore

								ref="spence-thomas">Thomas A. Spence</persRef>, member from the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> congressional district of Maryland, who
							was sworn and by taking his seat completed the delegation from that
							State in the house— After some of the usual casual preliminaries, the
							report on the rules, with <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole’s</persRef> amendment and <persRef ref="johnson-cave"
								>Cave Johnson’s</persRef> amendment to that were resumed— Johnson
							made an hour speech, in support of his amendment which was to substitute
							instead of the gag-rule, another in these words—“that the rules of the
							last Session of Congress be, and are hereby adopted for the government
							of the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress except the 25<hi

							all memorials, petitions, or other papers relating to Slavery, or the
							Slave trade between the States and Territories, or in any way connected
							with it, shall be received by the house, and laid upon the table without
							debate”— His argument was that the gag rule, refusing to receive
							petitions, could not be sustained— That it was lost by Southern whig
							votes, and he read over the names of all the Southern members who voted
							for rescinding the rule. Then commenced the chicaery of moving for the
							previous question, and reconsideration, and laying on the table; and to
							divide the question, and every species of subterfuge— Cave’s amendment
							was finally rejected by yeas and nays 35 to 143. The question next came
							upon Dromgoole’s amendment to strike out the whole report of the
							Committee after the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule and insert
							another whole body of rules proposed by him; <persRef
								ref="schenck-robert">Schenk</persRef> moved to divide the question
							so as first to take it on the whole amendment of Dromgoole, except the
							gag rule, and one other and then separately on each of them. In this way
							a direct question was taken on the gag-rule which was rejected by a vote
							of 86 to 106. a majority of 20 against the rule— But it was in vain.
								<persRef ref="barringer-daniel2">Barringer</persRef> of North

						<p>Dies Irae.</p>
						<p>I had received an invitation from <persRef ref="stockton-robert">Captain
								Robert F. Stockton</persRef> to another party of pleasure, with the
							Ladies of my family, on board the War Steamer Princeton. We declined the
							invitation, as I could not intermit my attendance at the house, and
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">daughter</persRef> were expecting the arrival of
							our friends <persRef ref="stockton-francis;mcknight-anna">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> F.
								B. Stockton</persRef> who came to spend a few days with us— <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef> had a separate
							invitation, and went to the ill fated party— I had engaged also to dine
							at 6. O’Clock this evening with <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Winthrop</persRef> in company with <persRef ref="pakenham-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham</persRef> the new
							British Minister— At the house, the report on the rules was resumed.—
								<persRef ref="barringer-daniel2">Barringer’s</persRef> motion for
							the reconsideration of the vote on <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole’s</persRef> rules of 40 and 41. was rejected by yeas and
							nays 55 to 115.— The question then recurred on the adoption of the
							report as amended by the several votes on Dromgoole’s substitute.
								<persRef ref="davis-richard">R. D. Davis</persRef> said if this
							should be rejected the house would be without rules—whereupon <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> moved to lay the whole
							subject on the table— The vote on this motion as taken by yeas and nays
							was 85 to 90. but after the whole roll had been called and all the
							answers given the Slavers plied their northern democratic allies with
							personal menace and intreaty, till three of them changed their votes
							from no to aye and the motion to lay the whole subject on the table was
							carried 88 to 87— One of the three <persRef ref="yost-jacob">Jacob S.
								Yost</persRef> of Pennsylvania changed his vote after enquiring of
							the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> if the vote should now
							be to lay on the table the subject might be resumed, without a vote of
							two thirds, and receiving his answer, that the rules of the house were
							always under the controul of a majority, by giving one day’s notice— An
							equivocation— <persRef ref="reding-john">Reding</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire moved a reconsideration of the vote to lay the whole
							subject on the table— <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> moved
							to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table which was carried.— A
							call of the house was moved and rejected— Adjourned at half past 3. I
							went into the chamber of the Committee of manufactures and wrote there
							till six. Dined with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pakenham and his Secretary <persRef ref="bidwell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bidwell</persRef> were there While we
							were at dinner <persRef ref="barney-john4">John Barney</persRef> burst
							into the chamber; rushed up to <persRef ref="scott-winfield">general
								Scott</persRef> and told him with groans that the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> wished to see him— That the
							great gun on board the Princeton, the Peacemaker had burst and killed
							the Secretary of State <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Upshur</persRef>, the
							Secretary of the Navy <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">T. W.
								Gilmer</persRef>, <persRef ref="kennon-beverley">Captain Beverley
								Kennon</persRef>, <persRef ref="maxcy-virgil">Virgil
							Maxcy</persRef>, a <persRef ref="gardiner-david">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Gardiner</persRef> of New-York and a
								<persRef ref="armistead">coloured servant</persRef> of the
							President, and desperately wounded several of the crew— General Scott
							soon left the table— <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> shortly after—also
							the <persRef ref="bayard-richard">Senator Bayard</persRef>— I came home
							before 10. in the Evening.</p>

						<p>When I came home last evening I found our friends <persRef
								ref="stockton-francis;mcknight-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> F. B. Stockton</persRef> here—
							Also <persRef ref="thom-george">Lieutenant Thom</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="davis-charles2">Charles A Davis</persRef> had been here, and
								<persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H. Adams</persRef> was returned
							from the Princeton. Hull had witnessed the dreadful Catastrophe— Besides
							the <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel;gilmer-thomas;kennon-beverley;maxcy-virgil;gardiner-david;armistead"
								>six persons</persRef> killed upon the spot, several persons of the
							crew were mortally or severely wounded. <persRef ref="stockton-robert"
								>Captain Stockton</persRef> himself and <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Thomas H. Benton</persRef> the Senator from Missouri were stunned
							by the wind of the commotion and unsettled in mind by the commotion.—
							The Sensations of my bosom on the occurrence of this catastrophe of
							yesterday are so profound, so complicated so mingled up of unassociable
							elements that I dare not indulge them— This morning <persRef
								ref="miller-mitchell">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Miller</persRef> Secretary of the Washington Bible Society, came
							with three copies of the report of the proceedings of the American Bible
							Society for me to sign, as the presiding officer at the meeting— And he
							requested me to go with him to the Office of the National Intelligencer
							to obtain the insertion of these proceedings in that paper— He said that
								<persRef ref="brigham-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brigham</persRef> the Secretary of the Society had been twice
							yesterday to the Office, without succeeding to see either of the
							Editors, <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>; and had been obliged to leave
							the City yesterday afternoon— I accordingly went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller to the Office. Neither Gales nor
							Seaton was there; but I gave the minutes of the meeting signed by me, to
							the foreman with a request that they might be published in the paper,
							which he promised that they should be. At the house immediately after
							the reading of the journal, a message was received from the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, announcing the lamentable
							catastrophe of yesterday, bewailing the loss of his two Secretaries with
							others, and hoping that Congress will not be discouraged by this
							accident from going on to build more and larger war Steamers than the
							Princeton.— <persRef ref="hopkins-george">George W. Hopkins</persRef>
							moved the usual sympathising resolutions, adapted to the occasion, and
							the house adjourned over to Monday.— Hopkins, myself, <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, were appointed a
							Committee on the part of the house to join a like Committee of the
							Senate, of arrangements for the attendance of both houses in a body at
							the funeral of the two Secretaries. We went to the Senate chamber, where
							that body had just assembled and their Secretary <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef> was reading the
							journal of yesterday</p>
