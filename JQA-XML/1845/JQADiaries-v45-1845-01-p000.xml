						<p>The whig members of the Massachusetts delegation in the house of
							Representatives had agreed to meet at my house this morning at 10
							O’Clock, before the crowd of visitors should be coming to consult
							together upon what we shall do in the critical state of public affairs,
							and whether any joint action on our part may be advisable— <persRef
								ref="abbott-amos;baker-osmyn;grinnell-joseph;hudson-charles;rockwell-julius;winthrop-robert"
								>Six of them</persRef>, came, all of the right complexion, except
								<persRef ref="king-daniel">Daniel P. King</persRef>, and we had some
							desultory conversation, without coming to any satisfactory result. We
							were soon interrupted by the entrance of other visitors, a stream of
							whom came and went for the space of 3. hours. The weather betokened May
							rather than January, and all the world was abroad— Great numbers of
							members of both houses of Congress were here, and among them several of
							the bitterest political opponents that I have in the world— The personal
							hatred of the Southern Slaveholders against me is evidently much
							envenomed by the extinction of the petition gag rule, and my position as
							the head of the anti-Slavery movement in this Country, disavowed by the
							whole body of abolitionists, and bound hand and foot, and chained to a
							rock as I am by the Slavemonger brood linked together with the mongrel
							democracy of the North and West— When the throng had passed away, about
							3. O’Clock I walked out and paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Madison</persRef>— I found there <persRef ref="dickinson-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickinson</persRef> of Troy, and two
							or three others— In the evening I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="elliott-jesse">Commodore Jesse D. Elliott</persRef>, who gave
							me a bronze medal which he has had struck in honour of <persRef
								ref="cooper-james">J. Fenimore Cooper</persRef>, for his vindication
							of the Commodore’s character in his naval history of the United States.
							He related to me the circumstances which induced him to have this medal
							struck, and the distribution which he proposed to make of it. He related
							to me also his pilgrimage to the holy land, and mentioned to me many of
							the curiosities which he collected there, and of which he has made a
							donation to the Girard college. </p>

						<p>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="elliott-jesse"
								>Commodore Elliott</persRef>, with one of his medals, and a
							direction “For <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, from His
							old friend J. D. Elliott” which he requests me to forward to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— He also requests me to furnish him
							with a list of all the historical Societies to which I had suggested to
							him the idea of his sending a medal each, and that I would forward the
							medals to them; and one to the representative of <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> as an heir-loom— I saw him
							afterwards at the house without the bar, and promised to perform his
							requests— He was to leave the city this afternoon to return to
							Philadelphia where he is stationed in command of the Navy-Yard— My
							opinions and feelings have been ever since the duel between <persRef
								ref="barron-james">Baron</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="decatur-stephen">Decatur</persRef> very unfavourable to
							Commodore Elliott, but I have not tried him as a judge or juror, and I
							could not justify to myself a repulse of the courtesy and personal
							respect which he now manifests to me; in the midst especially of that
							league of villainy and power combined against me and plotting the
							destruction of my life and my good name.— In the house <persRef
								ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef> of Kentucky asked leave to
							introduce a Bill to authorise the People of Texas to form a State
							Constitution of Government and for their admission into the Union, as
							one of the original States—and a joint Resolution pledging the
							protection of the United States against all foreign interposition in the
							interval. But the house refused to suspend the rules to let them in— The
							Rhode-Island question then came up—and first <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund4">Burke’s</persRef> motion to print 10,000 copies
							of the majority and minority Reports of the Committee on the Rhode
							Island Memorial, instead of 5000 copies of the majority report alone
							which he had first moved. <persRef ref="burt-armistead">Burt</persRef>
							of South Carolina moved to lay the Resolution on the table. Lost by yeas
							and nays 78 to 100. Burke moved the previous question on his resolution
							but he could not obtain a majority to second him— He then modified his
							resolution back to the original number of 5000, and moved again and
							carried the previous question— The vote for printing 5000 copies was
							carried 102 to 80. and then the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef> announced the Resolutions with which the majority
							report concluded were the subject under consideration of the house— The
							Resolutions are seven in number, rabid with mock democracy— <persRef
								ref="elmer-lucius">L. Q. C. Elmer</persRef> commenced a speech
							against them but was arrested at the expiration of the morning hour— The
							rest of the day was snarling upon the land Bill— First Assembly. </p>

						<p>The debate on the Land robbery Bill yesterday had become so vapid, that
							while <persRef ref="smith-thomas11">Thomas Smith</persRef> of Indiana
							was hammering out his hour upon it, I went into the Senate, and heard a
							debate on another Land-pilfering Bill, quite as dull as that I had
							escaped from in the house. I met there <persRef ref="calderon-angel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calderon de la Barca</persRef>,
							the Spanish Minister, who asked me, when I proposed to publish my
							translation of <persRef ref="wieland-christoph">Wieland’s</persRef>
							Oberon I told him I did not intend it should ever be published— I had
							made it as a school exercise in learning German, and though far more
							literal, it could bear no poetical comparison without <persRef
								ref="sotheby-william">Sotheby’s</persRef> translation, which had
							cured me of all temptation to publish mine. He said his reason for
							asking me the question was that he had made a Spanish translation of the
							Oberon, much as I had made mine, in my daily walks about the streets,
							and out of the gates of Berlin— He did not like Sotheby’s translation
							for two reasons— First because he had changed the form of the Stanza,
							from the light airy Ottava rima, for the heavy, cumbersome ten lines
							closing with an Alexandrine, thereby changing entirely the character of
							the Poem; and secondly, because he had omitted the sprightly tale of
							January and May— How M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calderon came to
							know any thing about my translation of Oberon, I know not, and did not
							enquire. I suppose it was from <persRef ref="everett-alexander"
								>Alexander H Everett</persRef>. At the house this day immediately
							after the reading of the Journal <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles"
								>Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> moved a suspension of the rules to
							go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the
							joint Resolution, reported by the Committee of Foreign Affairs, for the
							annexation of Texas to the United States, according to the Treaty of 12.
							April last rejected by the Senate— This was carried by yeas and nays 107
							to 63— <persRef ref="hopkins-george">George W. Hopkins</persRef> was
							chairman of the Committee, and the joint resolution was taken up—
								<persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> then moved his project
							of annexation as an amendment to the Resolution reported by the
							Committee, and <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Douglass</persRef> moved
							his project as an amendment to the amendment— <hi rend="italic">The
								first</hi> question was thus upon Douglass’s project—but C. J.
							Ingersoll made his hour Speech on the bare question of annexation— He
							scarcely glanced at the questions of right and of Constitutional power,
							but very positively affirmed that the annexation of Texas would not
							produce a rupture either with Mexico or with England. <persRef
								ref="belser-james">Belser</persRef> of Alabama followed with an hour
							speech. Committee rose— Adjourned—</p>

						<p>I despatched this morning <persRef ref="elliott-jesse">Commodore

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Clay</persRef>, with a Letter by

							called on him at <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef> hotel,
							and said to him that I did not see any objection to his presenting a
							bronze medal to each of the foreign ministers— Though there might be
							some objection to his receiving presents from them in return. He then
							told me of presents that he had made to the <persRef ref="saidbinsultan"
								>sultan of Muscat</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="ibrahimpasha"
								>Son</persRef> of the <persRef ref="muhammadali">Bey of

								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caleb
								Cushing</persRef> had arrived there this morning; returned from his
							successful mission to China—in which he has succeeded to negotiate an

							from certain quakers of the city of New-York, presented by <persRef
								ref="phoenix-jonas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							casting vote of the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> 87 to
							87.— <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> had previously made

							Alabama with repudiating her debts— <persRef ref="bayly-thomas3"
								>Baily</persRef> moved to go into Committee of the whole on the

							Texas—which was done.— <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Douglass</persRef>
							wanted to speak upon his own amendment, but not having his papers with
							him, was not ready; he moved the Committee to rise but they refused—
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> advised him to withdraw
							his preamble and let the debate proceed on his first Resolution, which
							was the simple proposition that Texas should be annexed to the United
							States; Douglass assented—<persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, made an hour speech against annexation, and
								<persRef ref="payne-william3">W. W. Payne</persRef> a furious one in
							favour of it— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> then

						<p><date>5. VI.10. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>Public worship in the Hall of the House of Representatives. The
							prayer—the singing, and the reading of a chapter of the Bible, were
							performed by <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tustin</persRef> the Chaplain of the Senate— The Sermon
							was preached by <persRef ref="olin-stephen">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Stephen Olin</persRef> the President of the Wesleyan
							University at Middletown, Connecticut— His text was John 14.1. “Let not
							your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me.”— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Olin is a man upwards of 6. feet tall;
							framed for a ploughman or a wood cutter— With an anxious, deeply
							thoughtful, not unpleasing countenance, sprawling limbs, and great
							aukwardness of gesticulation. But he preaches with out notes—with
							uninterrupted fluency, plain but very appropriate language, close
							argument, well chosen, and at times elegant elocution— After some verbal
							criticism upon the two moods in the application of the verb believe, the
							doctrine that he derived from the text was that Jesus Christ assuming as
							a fact that the disciples to whom he spoke believed in God, warned them
							that this belief was of itself not sufficient to satisfy the wants of
							their nature— That belief in God was taught by the visible creation— But
							the belief in God, is a barren and profitless creed unless subsidiary to
							it is the belief of a responsible hereafter to the existence of man; and
							to this the belief in Christ is indispensable— This appears to me, a
							very ingenious exposition of the text, and the developements of the
							argument were all consistent with it, judiciously selected and happily
							combined— The house was crowded, and the auditory chained in attention
							for an hour and a quarter.— After the service I returned the visit
							received on Friday, from <persRef ref="benton-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Hart Benton</persRef>, Senator
							from Missouri—the first in a period of 25 years of a common residence of
							him and me in this city.— <persRef ref="benton-elizabeth">His
								wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="benton-john">son</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="fremont-jessie;jones-elizabeth;jacob-sarah">three
								daughters</persRef> were there, and <persRef ref="fremont-john"
								>Lieutenant Fremont</persRef>, his son in Law— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef ref="pyne-smith"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the Evening
							service for the second Sunday after Christmas and preached from Hebrews
							13.5. “Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
							with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee,
							nor forsake thee.” An exhortation to contentment. <persRef
								ref="mason-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Mason jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> told me that the grand jury
							had indicted <persRef ref="sangster-thomas">T. Sangster</persRef>, and
							said he hoped I would not interpose to screen him from punishment.
								<persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Richard D. Cutts</persRef> was here

						<p>My conversation with <persRef ref="parker-daniel">General

							engagement to attend the Lecture of <persRef ref="upton-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Upton</persRef> against the annexation
							of Texas which was announced for 7 in the evening— It was half past 7
							when I went to concert hall, but not a soul was there— I had another
							engagement at half past 8. and walked home to meet it— I had received a
							written invitation from <persRef ref="jefferson-f">F.
								Jefferson</persRef>, <persRef ref="davis-james3">James N.
								Davis</persRef>, and <persRef ref="delano-william">William J.
								Delano</persRef>, a Committee of invitation of the Columbia

							celebration of their 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> anniversary— I
							had accepted this invitation; and at half past 8. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Delano came in a carriage and accompanied me to Congress hall— The
							supper was plentiful but not luxurious— The beverage cold water, coffee
							and lemonade— The company, about 70., journey men printers— F. Jefferson
							President— The invited guests, besides myself were <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">W. W. Seaton</persRef>, Mayor of the City,
								<persRef ref="severance-luther">Luther Severance</persRef>, Member
							of Congress from Maine, and Editor of a Newspaper there, and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallagher</persRef> a member
							of the Senate of Virginia. The exclusion of all spirituous liquors, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson said was an experiment, and it
							succeeded admirably well— There was much hilarity, but no disorder nor
							indecency— The regular toasts were given in continual succession— The
							volunteers complimentary to the invited guests, and drew a speech and a
							sentiment from each of them— I left them and came home shortly before
							midnight— At the house this day, after short preliminaries the rules
							were suspended to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the

							the Resolutions for the annexation of Texas to the United States.

							his hour not in the discussion of the Texas question but in exposing the

							election— when his hour expired—<persRef ref="yancey-william"
								>Yancey</persRef> a new member from Alabama moved the Committee to

								<persRef ref="mangum-willie">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mangum</persRef> the President of the Senate had informed him that
							he had not the power to grant the use of that hall, and that the members

							I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen I would make the motion— A
							young man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Cheever</persRef>, a resident
							of this city, came, with <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> a citizen
							of Wrentham, Massachusetts and of course one of my constituents— The

							Leavitt but had merely directed that until the arrangements should be

							from any seat that he should take— I found <persRef ref="hale-john">John

							declared their opinion that the annexation of Texas would increase,

							were read and referred to the Committee of the whole House on the State

						<p>When I made the motion yesterday in the house that the use of the Hall
							should be granted to <persRef ref="owen-robert">Robert Owen</persRef>
							for the delivery of four weekly lectures, upon his projects of
							reformation in human Society, there was evidently a majority of the
							house favourable to the motion. But two large classes of the members
							were startled— The whigs generally who generally entertain strong
							prejudices against the man, and his projects— And the Southern
							Slave-mongers—in a state of perpetual panic, and who suspected that I
							made this motion only to get a precedent settled, and to ask the use of
							the hall hereafter for some abolition or anti-slavery meeting— <persRef
								ref="arrington-archibald">Arrington</persRef> of North-Carolina
							moved to lay the resolution on the table— This was by a considerable
							majority refused— <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of
							Georgia, and <persRef ref="reding-john">Reading</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire successively moved to adjourn— Black failed, but Reding
							succeeded and the question was not taken. This morning M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen came, and said he heard from <persRef
								ref="owen-robert2">his son</persRef>, and some of his friends that
							the objection was to the expence of lighting up the Hall, and that he
							would compress his discourses so as to ask the use of the Hall, for only
							two evenings, on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month and
							the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February— I called and balanced
							my Bank book at the Bank of the Metropolis— Then at <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-samuel">Samuel L. Gouverneur’s</persRef> but the
							Servant told me he was gone to his farm in Virginia.— At the house
								<persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> formed his prayer for the day; being the
							anniversary of the battle of New-Orleans.— I called up the question upon
							my motion to grant the use of the hall to Robert Owen, and modified it
							so as to ask it only for two nights— <persRef ref="hammett-william"
								>Hammett</persRef> the Irishman of Mississippi, opposed it on the
							pretence that he would never vote for granting the use of the hall for
							any purpose other than its appropriate use.— Arrington moved again to
							lay the resolution on the table and it was carried by yeas and nays 91
							to 63— 24. whigs among the ayes.— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> introduced by leave another Bill for the
							annexation of Texas, which was twice read and referred to the Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union— <persRef ref="burke-edmund4"
								>Burke</persRef> offered inflammatory Resolutions of the Legislature
							of New-Hampshire, concerning the <persRef ref="dorr-thomas"
								>Dorr</persRef> controversy—but they were not received— <persRef

							idea of offering a Resolution to refer this question to the decision of
							the Supreme Court of the United States.— But there is no doubt that
							constituted as it is, with a majority of slaveholding judges on the
							bench, they would decide that Congress in the power of admitting new
							States into the Union, have the power incidental to it of acquiring by
							purchase the territory of which new States may be formed— And that the
							power of declaring War carries with it the power of acquiring territory
							by conquest.— The real constitutional incompetency of congress is that
							of conferring the civil and political rights of citizens of the United
							States upon the people of the acquired territory, and of holding them to
							the duties of allegiances, without their own consent.— This objection is
							insurmountable; but the Supreme Court would consider it settled by the
							precedents of Louisiana and Florida. At the house this day <persRef

							be neither Slavery nor involuntary Servitude— His first attempt was
							pronounced by the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> to be not
							in order— At the second he moved a suspension of the rules, and called
							for the yeas and nays— The vote was 92 to 82. a majority of ten for the

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">Brevet, major-general, and
								Quarter-master General Jesup</persRef>, and I had a conversation of
							nearly three hours with him. He was on the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January 1809. appointed a second lieutenant of infantry
							in the army of the United States, and has continued in the service ever
							since— At an early period he became a higly confidential officer and
							during the War with Great Britain was sent in secret and confidential
							mission to watch the movements of the Hartford Convention, and to keep
								<persRef ref="madison-james">President Madison</persRef>, and
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, then Secretary of War constantly advised of them.
							From that time till the close of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							administration; he was in the intimate confidence of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, and was often consulted by him
							with regard to the measures of his administration— He was so
							particularly upon the secret mission of <persRef ref="graham-george"
								>George Graham</persRef> to Galveston in 1818.— Jesup gave to
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> the
							information upon which he procured at the Department of State, the copy
							of my instructions to George Graham on his departure upon that mission.—
							Jackson has always been friendly to Jesup, and supported him against the
							intrigues and persecutions of Jesup’s enemies during Jackson’s
							administration and that of his successor <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Van Buren</persRef>.— He confidently believes that <persRef
								ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef>, did pretend that he
							had brought the Spanish Government to agree to a Treaty making the Rio
							del Norte the boundary— He said he had made the late <persRef
								ref="baldwin-henry">judge Baldwin</persRef> believe it; and also
								<persRef ref="benton-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Benton</persRef>—and he was under a strong impression that Erving
							had attempted to shake M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							confidence in me.— This conference detained me till near one O’Clock
							before I reached the house. The hour had been occupied in receiving
							numerous reports and Resolutions of Committees, and two or three bills
							of no importance had been passed— The last was a Resolution reported
							from a Committee by <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal
								Hamlin</persRef>, for an allowance of pay to <persRef
								ref="goggin-william">Goggin</persRef> while he contested the
							election of <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef>— But without

								Hopkins</persRef> in the chair; and <persRef ref="kennedy-john">John

						<p>In the hall of the house of representatives the services of the morning

							the chaplain of the house at the last Session of Congress, and <persRef
								ref="daily-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily</persRef>
							the present chaplain. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher began by
							reading the first Psalm, and a beautiful trinitarian hymns from the hymn
							book which he requested the auditory to sing. But he not being able to
							set the tune himself, whatever melody they made in their hearts, there
							was little harmony in their voices. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tinsley made the prayer before the Sermon, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fisher preached from John 19.5—the last words of the verse—
							“Behold the man!” [“]Ecce homo”— The argument of the discourse was the
							divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ— The God— Man—
							Fervent—fluent—vehement, the contrast between the omnipotence of God,
							and the impotence and agonies of the man, formed the field of
							commonplace eloquence for Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Methodist
							pulpit oratory.— All the passages of <persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul’s</persRef> epistles which speak of Jesus Christ as him—by
							whom God made the worlds, all the passages in the Prophets and Psalms,
							applied by S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul to Jesus Christ were
							cited, to prove that Jesus Christ was God; and then all the incidents of
							the trial before <persRef ref="pontiuspilate">Pilate</persRef> and of
							the crucifixion— Each of these theories taken by itself is to me a
							tremendous trial of faith—combined together and pressed upon my
							conscience at once my reason revolts at the thought— I cannot believe
							it, and the more intensely and peremptorily it is urged the more my
							conscience stiffens against it— The house was well filled and the
							auditory very attentive listeners— After the service was over, the
							preacher with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daly and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tinsley came and shook hands with me. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Tinsley told me that he had been to
							Philadelphia, and had a tumour taken out of his forehead which had
							confined him ten days; and that by coming out too soon he had contracted
							a severe catarrhal cold— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s church, <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pyne</persRef> read the Evening service for the first Sunday after
							the Epiphany, and preached from Romans 5.1. “Therefore being justified
							by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The
							justifying which makes peace with God through Jesus Christ, is a clear
							intelligible theme, and was admirably handled by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pyne. <persRef ref="cutts-richard2;cutts-mary">Richard and

								Woodbury’s</persRef> discourse last Evening was of about two hours
							duration, delivered with great rapidity; replete with various and minute
							details of modern and especially American improvements in the Arts and
							Sciences, physical, moral, political and intellectual, tinged throughout
							with the wormwood of democracy—like ocean brine boiled down to freshen
							it, with a mawkish tang of the salt remaining in the taste— It was a
							defence of our national character against the reproach of neglecting the
							progress of Science— He drew from the nature of our democratic
							Government the inference that scientific improvement must be the result
							of individual exertion and private enterprize, and enumerated a great
							multitude of American inventions from <persRef ref="fulton-robert"
								>Fulton’s</persRef> Steamers, and <persRef ref="whitney-eli"
								>Whitney’s</persRef> Cotton-gin, to the Western Railroad—the
							Fairmount waterworks at Philadelphia, and the Croton aqueduct at
							New-York— Then he touched lightly upon the promotion of Science which
							the Government has actually patronized, the Survey of the Coast, the
							Astronomical observatory and the exploring exhibition— He made out on
							the whole a very good case, and closed with a liberal exhortation to
							Congress to foster Science within the Constitutional limitations, and to
							interweave together the capabilities of the National-Institute and the
							Smithsonian fund. Immediately after he closed, <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">W. W. Seaton</persRef> took the chair of the
							meeting; a vote of thanks was passed for the discourse, with the request
							of a copy for publication and the meeting was dissolved— This morning a
							poor old deaf clergyman by the name of <persRef ref="lane-joshua2"
								>Joshua Lane</persRef> came again to solicit charity, and another
							named <persRef ref="u">Carter</persRef> came for a contribution to build
							a Presbyterian church at Gettysburg Pennsylvania— He brought me a Letter
							of recommendation, but I thought that Gettysburg should pay for building
							its own churches. At the house, <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Edmund
								Burke</persRef>, by a suspension of the rules carried by yeas and
							nays 106 to 32. introduced a new Bill for the annexation of Texas, twice
							read and referred to the committee— <persRef ref="bowlin-james"
								>Bowlin</persRef> of Missouri— <persRef ref="hardin-john"
								>Hardin</persRef> of Illinois and <persRef ref="severance-luther"
								>Severance</persRef> of Maine, made hour speeches in Committee for
							and against the annexation of Texas— <persRef ref="hammett-william"
								>Hammett</persRef> got the floor and the Committee rose— I moved a
							call upon the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for
							information— Objection was made I moved a suspension of the rules but
							agreed to take the question tomorrow. </p>

								<persRef ref="butler-benjamin">Benjamin F. Butler</persRef> at

							them to Major Lewis, who told him in candour yesterday that copies of

						<p><date>17. IV:30. </date>Friday.</p>
						<p>This day was signalized by a memorable devlopement of democratic
							defalcation.— <persRef ref="taylor-william11">Taylor</persRef> chairman
							of the Committee of Accounts, asked leave to make a report, which was
							granted without opposition— The report was a statement not remarkably
							lucid, that of the sum of <unclear>237000</unclear> dollars received by <persRef
								ref="mcnulty-caleb">Caleb J. M’Nulty</persRef> Clerk of the House on
							account of its contingent fund there is a defalcation of about 45000
							dollars; for which he gives no account, and that he has drawn from the
							treasury large sums, and placed them in the hands of sundry persons in
							the city of New-York and in the State of Ohio.— He has not only failed
							to account for these deficiencies to the Committee, but has repeatedly
							disregarded their calls upon him for his attendance before them. The
							report concluded with three Resolutions. 1. That Caleb J. M’Nulty be
							dismissed from the Office of Clerk of the house. 2 That the <persRef
								ref="bibb-george">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> be directed to
							institute forthwith the necessary legal proceedings to ascertain and
							secure the balance of public money due from him as Clerk of the house 3.
							That the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President of the United
								States</persRef> be requested to cause criminal prosecution to be
							commenced against Caleb J. M’Nulty late Clerk of the House of
							Representatives, for an embezzlement of the public money, and all
							persons advising or know or willingly participating in such
							embezzlement, according to the provisions of the act of Congress
							approved 13. August 1841.— <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef>
							of Ohio presented a Letter from a commercial house in New-York,
							acknowledging a credit to M’Nulty on their books of 30000 dollars— And
							Weller pledged his personal conviction that whatever may have been
							M’Nulty’s conduct, the public will not lose a dollar by him. <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved an order to the
								<persRef ref="lane-newton">Sergeant at arms</persRef> to <hi
								rend="italic">arrest</hi> M’Nulty and bring him before the house. I
							moved to strike out arrest and insert <hi rend="italic">summon</hi>
							which was debated, but the arrest was sustained— Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
								>Hopkins</persRef> in the chair— <persRef ref="hammett-william"
								>Hammett</persRef> spoke about ten minutes, when the Sergeant at
							arms returned with M’Nulty who took his place at the Clerk’s table as
							usual— The Committee of the whole, rose the Resolutions of the Committee
							of Accounts were read to M’Nulty— He gave some explanations, and
							promised that not a dollar should be lost— The subject was postponed
							till to-morrow 2. P.M. he in the mean-time, suspended from his functions
							as clerk to be performed by the assistant clerk, <persRef

						<p>Roused from bed earlier than my usual hour I found the difficulty of
							writing so great that I was compelled to postpone the journal of
							yesterday and was able only to write a short answer to a Letter from my
							granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine
								Adams</persRef> at <persRef ref="sedgwick-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sedgwicks</persRef> school at
							Lenox—Massachusetts— I found after much search several of the volumes
							which I need, in preparation to address the house on the Texas question.
							At the house <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Joseph Vance</persRef> Chairman
							of the Committee of claims, succeeded in a motion to go into Committee
							of the whole, <persRef ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> of
							Kentucky in the chair; to take up the Calendar of private bills from 12
							O’Clock to 2. Several private bills were disposed of and among the rest
							that for the relief of <persRef ref="allyn-francis"
							>Captain</persRef><space/>and the owners of the ship Cadmus for the passage
							of <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef> and his family
							from Havre to New-York in 1824.— It was after considerable debate laid
							on the table— A shabby proceeding on the part of the Government— At 2
							O’Clock the Committee rose, and the report of the Committee of accounts
							in the case of <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Jacob B. M’Nulty</persRef>
							the Clerk of the house was resumed— He did not make his appearance— He
							had promised yesterday that on the return of his accounting Clerk
								<persRef ref="kershaw-john">Kershaw</persRef>, he would settle his
							accounts with the Committee in the space of half an hour— His Clerk
							Kershaw arrived last night, and was before the Committee this morning.
							He had a large mass of papers which the Committee had not time to
							examine, and produced a certificate that M’Nulty had a credit for 29000
							dollars at the Bank of America in New-York— When the committee asked an
							order for the money, he said the Clerk must do that himself.— After two
							or three enquiries without satisfactory answer, <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved the question, on the
							first Resolution reported by the Committee of Accounts dismissing
							M’Nulty as clerk of the house 196 members answered ay—not one voice in
							the negative voice— The second resolution passed without counting, and
							the third after debate 170 to 4. <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> made an apology for having credited what M’Nulty
							had told him yesterday, but said he still believed there would be no
							loss of money to the public. <persRef ref="hopkins-george">George W.
								Hopkins</persRef> moved to suspend the rule of the house requiring
							that the election should be held viva voce, and moved that <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">Benjamin B. French</persRef> be appointed
							Clerk of the house, which passed by an unanimous vote— The <persRef

							adjourned. Evening with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and

						<p>At the hall of the house of Representatives this morning, the prayer was
							pronounced by <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tuston</persRef>, the Chaplain of the Senate and a
							Sermon of an hour and a quarter was preached by <persRef
								ref="colton-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton</persRef>
							a chaplain in the Navy, who visited me not many days since— His text was
							from 1. Kings 18.43. a small part of the verse— “Go up now, look toward
							the Sea.” Upon this eccentric, if not whimsical text, an earnest,
							searching, and deeply affecting discourse was delivered on the peculiar
							character, condition, and claims of the <hi rend="italic">Sailor</hi>—
							He enumerated the qualities of benevolence, of profuse generosity, of
							improvidence, of superstition, of sympathy with distress, of lavish
							bounty, of unconsciousness of danger, of resentment for unjust
							imputation, and ready submission to punishment for real misconduct—of
							docility to kind treatment and disinterested advice; and of resignation
							in disease and death— The fair side of the Sailor was fully exhibited—
							Its blemishes veiled or tenderly touched. Then followed a description of
							the <hi rend="italic">condition</hi> of the Sailor—full of hardship
							teeming with danger; exposed to the treachery of the elements, of
							temptation, of his own passions, of the landsman and the landswoman, he
							always needs a guardian— Lastly his claims, upon the justice, the
							sympathy, and the guardianship of his Country. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Colton closed with an impressive and pathetic appeal to the
							legislative portion of his auditory, reminding them gently of their duty
							to cherish, and protect, and purify this precious class of servants to
							the community of their fellow men. He called to their remembrance the
							unspeakable importance of the Sailor’s services to the necessities, to
							the comforts and enjoyments of every other profession of civilized life—
							And he specially urged the duty of confirming, and universalizing the
							Sailors temperance by withdrawing from them all supplies of spirituous
							liquors— The house was crowded, and the attention to the Discourse
							exemplary.— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.
								B. J. Frye</persRef> dined with us, and while we were at dinner came
							in <persRef ref="adams-john3">passed Midshipman John Quincy
								Adams</persRef>, from Norfolk, just returned from a cruize on the
							coast of Africa— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef>
							read prayers for Septuagesima Sunday, and preached from Romans 15.4.
							“For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
							learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
							have hope.[”] </p>

						<p>I had hesitated down to the present day, whether to address the Committee
							of the whole house on the state of the Union upon the various projects
							for the annexation of Texas to this Union which have been so long under
							consideration, or to sit and witness in silence the perpetration of the
							wrong, which I too clearly saw was unavoidable— I had collected numerous
							documents for reference to them, and took with me sundry volumes this
							morning to the house. About half an hour was consumed on miscellaneous
							subjects— <persRef ref="hardin-john">Hardin</persRef> from the Committee
							on Post Offices and Post-roads, reported an amendatory bill, for one
							which had been recommitted to them for reducing the rate of postage—
								<persRef ref="bayly-thomas3">Bayly</persRef> from the Committee of
							foreign Affairs reported a Bill for the relief of <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>, which was
							referred to a Committee of the whole house. A message from the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> which had lain two days on the
							table was now presented, and proved to be a communication of the Treaty
							with China, negotiated by <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>, now ratified with
							the unanimous advice and consent of the Senate— The message recommends
							an appropriation for a regular diplomatic mission to China— At my motion
							it was read; referred to the Committee of foreign affairs and ordered to
							be printed— Sundry other communications from the executive departments
							were presented and disposed of—laid on the table or referred Sixteen
							bills from the Senate were read twice and appropriately referred—
								<persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jameson</persRef> of Missouri presented
							Resolutions of the Legislature of that State in favour of the annexation

							consummate this transaction. I then obtained the floor, and at the

								<persRef ref="daniel-john">Daniel</persRef> of North-Carolina,
								<persRef ref="stone-alfred">Stone</persRef> of Ohio, <persRef

						<p>Funeral of Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> William Hawley. </p>
						<p>In the Hall of the house of Representatives, this morning the chaplain of
							the house, <persRef ref="daily-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daily</persRef> preached from Isaiah 33.20. “Look upon Zion, the
							city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet
							habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the
							stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords
							thereof be broken. 21. But there, the glorious Lord will be unto us, a
							place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,
							neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.”— This language, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily said was figurative— Zion was the
							Christian Religion, and Jerusalem was the Church of Christ— The quiet
							habitation, was the Peace on earth and good will to men, proclaimed by
							the Angels at the birth of Christ; and in God’s own due time this peace
							will become universal throughout the habitable globe, and Jerusalem a
							quiet habitation— The tabernacle not to be taken down is typical of the
							stability of the Christian Religion.— The gates of hell shall not
							prevail against it. the exposition of the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> verse partook of its obscurity— The translation is
							obviously defective— That the glorious Lord should <hi rend="italic"
								>be</hi> a place of broad rivers and streams, gives indistinct
							ideas, which the comment of the preacher did not elucidate—but he
							dramatized the exclamation of old <persRef ref="simeon"
							>Simeon</persRef>, and the sword of the Lord and of <persRef
								ref="gideon">Gideon</persRef>, and swung round in his hand the
							quarto Bible and told a story of a young man who on a voyage down the
							Ohio to New-Orleans, stop’d into a shop to purchase the history of the 4
							kings meaning a pack of cards—instead of which the shopkeeper persuaded
							him to take a bible. 15 years afterwards the same man passing upwards
							through the same city of Cincinnati with a beautiful wife, three lovely
							children and an affluent fortune, told the shopkeeper that they were all
							fruits of his Bible substitute for the history of the 4 kings— The house
							was crowded, and a choir from one of the methodist churches, sung two
							hymns one of them “How beauteous are their feet.” At 3. after dinner, by
							invitation from the vestry of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							church, I went to the late residence of <persRef ref="hawley-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> and walked in

							the funeral service were performed, and a sermon preached by the
								<persRef ref="tyng-stephen">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Stephen H Tyng</persRef> of Philadelphia, from Hebrews 9.27.— [“]It
							is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.” The
							church was so excessively crowded that it was with great difficulty that
							I got in and reached a seat. <persRef ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham</persRef> with whom I walked
							in procession did not enter the church The body was interred in the

							a bill introduced by him, to purchase 1500 copies of a history of Oregon
							Calefornia &amp;c for the use of the house, and in the use of them to

								>Greenhow</persRef> book bill and it was done. <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> railed and raved, insisting
							that the question had not been understood, and must be put again— The
							chairman stuck to his text— Cave Johnson moved again to lay the
							book-bill aside and take up the Oregon bill, but lost the vote, and
							started a sneaking debate of two hours about the honesty or the shame of
							purchasing books at the public expense for the private use of the
							members themselves—half a dozen dirty amendments were moved and all
							rejected, till the bill was laid aside to be reported and the Oregon
							bill again taken up. The first section was read, and <persRef
								ref="hammett-william">Hammett</persRef> moved the Committee to rise
							and report and pass the book bill— Committee rose and reported the bill.
							Douglass moved the previous question on engrossment. Cave Johnson moved
							to lay the bill on the table and called yeas and nays 84 to 94. Yeas and
							nays on the passage of the bill— Yeas and nays on the passage of the
							bill 107 to 79. A. V. Brown then moved to go into Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union again which was carried— The first section of
							the Oregon Bill was read and Brown moved to strike out 9. from the
							Northern boundary in the bill, to read 54.40 instead of 54.49. whereupon

						<p>Morning call from <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Todsen</persRef>, who told me he was now employed in
							making some translation for the Department of State, because they could
							find no other person here who could do the work—for they were extremely
							hostile to him for his political opinions.— The doctor would have been
							more communicative, but <persRef ref="owen-robert">Robert Owen</persRef>
							came in and he withdrew. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen gave me to
							read an address which he said he had determined to make directly to both
							houses of Congress, requesting the use, first of the Senate chamber, and
							then of the Representative Hall, to deliver three Lectures upon his
							system for the improvement of human Society— He intimated a wish, that I
							should present his Memorial to the house which I consented to do, but he
							read to me a separate paragraph, on a small slip of paper which he
							wished to introduce into his address, and which affirmed that I had a
							favourable opinion of the usefulness of his system.— I told him that I
							could not permit the introduction of my name, and that if I should it
							would of itself be fatal to his application.— He acquiesced.— At the
							house, the day was spent in calling for Reports of Committees, and the
							States for Resolutions, which would give no rise to debate— I asked
								<persRef ref="king-preston">Preston King</persRef> if he intended to
							move a Call on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for the
							correspondence in the negotiation for Oregon.— He said no—because it
							would be taken as a symptom of hostility to the administration— But if I
							would move the call, he would vote for it. The house had been some time
							in Session when I took my seat— A bill from the Senate to establish the
							Smithsonian Institution, had been received read and referred to the
							Committee of the whole on the State of the Union. After all the
							Committees had been called, the States beginning with Maine were called
							for Resolutions.— <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> moved an
							order to the clerk to suspend the compilation of a tenth volume of U.S.
							Laws ordered at the last Session of Congress, till a joint Resolution
							for a new Edition of U.S. Laws, pending before the Senate shall be
							disposed of by Congress. Carried— Burke moved also an investigation by
							the committee on the expenditures of the Navy department, of a swindling
							contract with <persRef ref="zabriskie-james">James C.
								Zabriskie</persRef> of New Jersey; and he presented a paper
							containing evidence of the filthiness of this contract. He moved the
							previous question, and the resolution was adopted— I moved a call upon
							the President for copies of the negotiation for the Oregon— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> attempted to evade
							the call but it was carried by yeas and nays 166. to 4— <persRef
								ref="woods-enoch">Enoch Woods</persRef> here, a beggar. </p>

						<p>Select Committee Errors of the Census. At 10 this morning Meeting of the
							select Committee on the memorial of <persRef ref="jarvis-edward">Edward
								Jarvis</persRef> and <persRef ref="thornton-john">J. Wingate
								Thornton</persRef> for the American statistical Association
							concerning the errors of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> census— It
							was but a quarter before 11. when a Quorum was formed— <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">R. Barnwell Rhett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="rayner-kenneth">Kenneth Rayner</persRef>
							<persRef ref="foster-henry2">Henry D. Foster</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="cary-shepard">Shepherd Cary</persRef>, four members of the
							Committee being absent— I read a few pages of the memorial, but the
							warder of the Committee rooms soon gave us notice that the house was in
							Session, and we adjourned to next Wednesday 10. O’Clock— I found the
							house engaged in the consideration of resolutions the call of the States
							for which had not been completed yesterday. Among those adopted
							yesterday was one offered by <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
								>Hopkins</persRef> that copies of all the printed bills and of the
							Calendar of the house should be regularly laid on the Reporters desks.
								<persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef> now moved a
							reconsideration of this Resolution—on this question the vote by rising
							was 67 to 41. no Quorum. The yeas and nays were called— I asked if all
							the printed documents of the house were to be laid, on the desks of all
							the reporters, 30 in number— The <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef> did not know. I asked if the Speaker did not
							understand the meaning of the Resolution— He said I was as able to
							understand the order as he was.— The vote to reconsider was 119. to 32.
							and then the resolution was laid over for debate— <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Reuben Chapman</persRef> offered a Resolution
							yesterday and moved the previous question, that the members of the house
							consider that the public offices of the Union ought to be distributed
							among the States, according to their federal population— I enquired if
							he had considered the bearings of his resolution upon the constitutional
							executive power of appointment to Office. He said that it was nothing
							but the opinion of the members of the house— His motion for the previous
							question failed— I said I wished to debate the Resolution and it was
							laid over.— <persRef ref="belser-james">Belser</persRef> moved to
							suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union to take up the Oregon Bill.— I urged a postponement of some days
							for <persRef ref="greenhow-robert">Greenhow’s</persRef> book, and for
							the answer to the call upon the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> for the state of the negotiation But the house
							went into Committee— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef>,
							Belser and <persRef ref="bowlin-james">Bowlin</persRef> made hour
							speeches for the immediate passage of the Oregon Bill—the Committee then
							rose the House went again into Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union passed three appropriation bills and adjourned. </p>

							called on me this morning and said he had received a number of copies of
							his newly published book from New-York, and would send me one which he
							did— Its title is the [“]Book of the new Moral World, containing the
							rational system of Society, founded on demonstrable facts developing the
							Constitution and Laws of human nature and of Society”— This is an octavo
							volume of 264 pages in very small type, and contains the system which he
							has been forty years preaching, without running himself entirely down
							and without being discouraged by failure— At the house <persRef
								ref="henley-thomas">Henley</persRef> of Indiana moved that 25000
							copies of the report of the Committee on Patents, without the list, and
							3000 copies of the whole report be printed—objection made, he moved to
							suspend the rules—carried— <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef>
							moved to reduce the number to 15,000 lost—and the resolution was
							adopted— <persRef ref="hardin-john">Hardin</persRef> moved to go into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up his
							Post-Office-bill— The house went into Committee, but when Hardin moved
							to take up his bill the Chairman, (Weller) said that the Oregon
							territory Bill was the first subject before the Committee upon which
								<persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi had
							the floor; which he declined to yield, and so he wore out his hour in a
							fourth declamation for the establishment of the territory of Oregon.— He
							was followed for another hour by <persRef ref="mcclernand-john"
								>M’Clernand</persRef> of Illinois; and he, by <persRef
								ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale Owen</persRef>, who first infused a
							small spice of variety into the debate by declaring his readiness to
							vote for the bill, but intimating that immediately upon the heel of it
							he will call up his joint resolution offered and urged by him at the
							last Session, that the 12 months notice stipulated by the Convention of
							1827. of joint occupancy, of its annulment should be given to
							Great-Britain— Owen made also some objection to the section of the bill
							promising grants of lands to settlers.— <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph"
								>Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> opposed the bill— While he was
							speaking <persRef ref="tyler-john3">John Tyler jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi></persRef> brought in a Message from the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, which in the expectation that
							it related to this subject, but which proved to be a mere communication
							from the <persRef ref="ford-thomas">Governor of Illinois</persRef> upon
							Reports of the decisions of the U.S— Supreme Court— <persRef
								ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hamlin</persRef> of Maine then made a fiery
							speech for Oregon and against England— <persRef ref="elmer-lucius"
								>Elmer</persRef>, <persRef ref="hunt-washington">Washington
								Hunt</persRef> offered a few remarks. <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"
								>Winthrop</persRef> moved to strike out the first section of the
							Bill— <persRef ref="brown-aaron">A. V. Brown</persRef>, offered two
							amendments—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— In the Evening,
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> went to the Assembly— <persRef ref="connell-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> partook with

								Persico</persRef> came this morning to solicit my influence in his
							favour, for employment to execute a colossal equestrian Statue of
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> in Bronze, to
							be located South of the Southern wing of the Capitol, for which he has
							applied by Memorial to the Senate The library committee on the part of
							the Senate have reported favourably upon his memorial, and he wishes me
							to speak a good word for him to <persRef ref="marsh-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George P. Marsh</persRef>, or <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edmund
								Burke</persRef>, or <persRef ref="lyon-lucius">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lucius Lyon</persRef>, who are the
							members of the Library Committee on the part of the house. I promised to
							speak to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marsh— I found the house in
							session— <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef> from the
							Committee on the Militia had reported a joint-Resolution for an
							appropriation of 50000 dollars for <persRef ref="colt-samuel">Samuel
								Colt’s</persRef> water-proof cartridges— A gimcrack new invention
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.
								<persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M. Saunders</persRef> from
							the Committee on the judiciary had reported a bill professedly for
							altering and amending the naturalization laws, but in substance utterly
							impotent and delusive— An insulting mockery to the native American
							petitioners for a noviciate of 21 years as the condition of
							naturalization— <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> moved a
							Resolution to take the Oregon territory bill out of Committee at two
							O’Clock P.M. to morrow, and called for the previous question—the
							Resolution was carried by yeas and nays 94 to 65. after which the house
							went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Weller in the
							chair, and <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron V. Brown</persRef>, chairman
							of the Committee on the territories, presented three wretchedly drawn up
							amendments, to remove as he said objections which had been made
							yesterday.— <persRef ref="hunt-washington">Washington Hunt</persRef>
							made a short feeble and pointless speech against the Bill— <persRef
								ref="morris-edward">Edward Joy Morris</persRef> followed in the same
							course, willing to give notice to the British Government that the joint
							occupation convention is abrogated and annulled, but not to pass any
							further act of Legislation upon the subject at present— <persRef
								ref="douglas-stephen">Douglass</persRef> of Illinois raved an hour
							about democracy, and anglophobia, and universal empire— <persRef
								ref="severance-luther">Severance</persRef>, answered by a cool,
							sensible and moderate speech; opposed to the whole Bill; and even to
							giving the notice of annulment of the joint occupation convention.— I
							spoke about half an hour, remonstrating against the heedless haste with
							which the bill is to be driven through the house, without waiting for
							the book they have decided to purchase, or for the answer of the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to the call for the
							documents of the negotiation— I declared myself willing to give the
							notice of annulment to the British Government, and to constitute the
							territory to take effect after the expiration of the term of notice
							Aaron V. Brown answered me— Committee rose— Adjourned. </p>
