						<p>Not a day passes, but I receive some pamphlet or book from the author,
							besides ten or twelve daily Newspapers which now come twice a day by the
							morning and evening Mails— They absorb so much of my time, that I have
							scarcely any left for my proper business, which is thus lamentably
							neglected, and they scatter my attention and my spirits over such a
							multitude of subjects that they make it impossible to concentrate my
							thoughts and action upon any one. This is inexpressibly painful to me,
							and yet I am utterly unable to devise a remedy for it— I received
							yesterday a duodecimo volume of 276. pages, printed at Boston, and
							entitled Vindication of Russia, and the <persRef ref="nicholas-i"
								>Emperor Nicholas</persRef>, by <persRef ref="hitchcock-david">David
								K. Hitchcock</persRef>; and this morning a Discourse before the
							Society of the Sons of New-England, of the City and County of
							Philadelphia, on the history of the early settlement of their
							Country—being their first anniversary—delivered December 21 1844. by
							their President <persRef ref="breck-samuel">Samuel Breck</persRef>— who
							with <persRef ref="breck-samuel2">his father</persRef> in 1791. removed
							from Boston to Philadelphia, and has resided there ever since. His
							father removed in discontent at being as he thought overtaxed at Boston.
							Yet dulces reminiscitur Argos— In the house after the usual number of
							spiteful, and stupid preliminaries by the patent democracy of the house
							they went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
								<persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> in the chair upon the
							Oregon territory bill— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef>
							who had taken the floor yesterday made an excellent speech against the
							bill and was answered with brutality by <persRef ref="cary-shepard"
								>Shepherd Carey</persRef> of Maine and <persRef ref="kennedy-andrew"
								>Andrew Kennedy</persRef> of Indiana— <persRef ref="morse-freeman"
								>Morse</persRef> and <persRef ref="severance-luther"
								>Severance</persRef>, had a sparring bout with Shepherd Carey and
								<persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef> about the
								<persRef ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty.— I moved
							as an amendment for the first section of the bill, that the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> should cause to be notified to
							the British Government that we annul and abrogate the joint occupation
							convention of 1827— My amendment was lost by tellers 75 to 77. <persRef
								ref="hammett-william">Hammett</persRef> moved in substance the same
							amendment as the last section of the bill, and it was carried by tellers
							79 to 77.— Winthrop moved an additional section, prohibiting Slavery
							throughout the territory. Carried by tellers 85 to 66. Sundry other
							amendments were proposed and rejected, and the bill was thus reported to
							the house— Then came the previous question. Carried— Motions to adjourn—
							That the amendments might be printed. Rejected— In order to make it the
							unfinished business of Monday Morning the previous question was put and
							carried, and then the house adjourned without taking the main question.
							In the evening with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef>, I attended an Amateur
							Concert.</p>

						<p>The winter has come at last with its severity of frost but with the smile
							of bright sunshine— The Newspapers had announced that divine service
							would be performed in the hall of the house of representatives this
							morning by the chaplain of the Senate <persRef ref="tustin-septimus"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston</persRef>; but at a
							quarter past 11. I found a stranger, said to be <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whelpley</persRef> of New-York, in the
							midst of a discourse upon the education of children— Its tone was rather
							that of a dissertation or Lecture than of a Sermon, and if he had taken
							a text there was nothing in the text of the discourse to indicate what
							it was— The speaker had not much the appearance of a clergyman but his
							speech was an exceedingly earnest exhortation to his hearers, and
							especially to the Parents to fulfil their duties in the education of
							their children— There was nothing new in the argument, and nothing
							remarkable in the Style which was plain or the delivery which was
							without rant or affectation— The common-place topics were handled with
							good sense and simplicity and with impressive fervour— The discourse
							brought to my mind the admirable Sermons of <persRef
								ref="tillotson-john">Tillotson</persRef> upon education, but my
							recollection of them was not sufficiently distinct to warrant the
							conjecture that they had furnished ideas to the discourse of this day.—
							After the service and before dinner I received visits from <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

							your light so shine before men that they may see, your good works and
							glorify your father which is in heaven” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pyne’s christianity is all summed up in benevolence and that I believe
							is what constitutes its excellence above all other systems of religion
							or morals that were <unclear>. . .</unclear>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne pointed his
							hearers to the stress laid in this precept of Jesus to his disciples on
							the influence of example and observed how it was carried out by Jesus
							himself through How the immediate and remote purpose of every miracle
							that he performed was to do good—and he exhorted his hearers in every
							action of their lives to scrutinize their own motives, and before
							acting, to ascertain by self-examination, if their light so shines as to
							exhibit good works, and tend to the glory of God— He gave notice that
							during the approaching lent there would be service alternate days at the
							churches.</p>

						<p>The severe cold of the season brought on again the racking cough with
							which <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> had been
							afflicted from the time of her return to this city last October but
							which had much subsided. all day yesterday she suffered cruelly with it,
							and the whole night without respite of ten minutes till half past 4 this
							morning. She kept her bed all this day— I attended the house at its
							first meeting. There were not 60 members present— The usual pressure of
							interloping business occurred, and I addressed the <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> three or four times before he
							would hear me— I asked him if this was not the regular day for the call
							of the States for Petitions.— He said the first business of the day was
							the unfinished business of Saturday the questions upon the amendments
							reported by the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to the
							Oregon territory Bill. I said I took it for granted that those questions
							would not be taken till the house should be full. In the mean time I
							asked leave to present a memorial from <persRef ref="abert-john">John J.
								Abert</persRef> and five others a Committee of the National
							Institute asking aid from the Government—together with sundry documents—
							The Speaker said it could only be received with the unanimous consent of
							the house—and after a pause he said the Chair hears no objection and the
							Memorial was received— I moved its reference to a select Committee of
							five, requesting that my name might not be of the number, considering
							myself as one of the petitioners— The motion was agreed to without
							opposition— I went to <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
								Ingersoll</persRef> and asked him to give me five names to recommend
							to the Speaker for the Committee— He accordingly gave me 5 names, but my
							own was at the head of them. I struck it out and inserted that of
							Ingersoll himself in its place— I changed one other of the names, and
							sent the list, by <persRef ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef> the
							Clerk to the Speaker. A debate of two hours arose, about a bill from the
							Senate concerning the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; in which all the
							members from Maryland took a deep interest— Then came the questions on
							the Oregon territory Bill. <persRef ref="brown-aaron">Aaron V.
								Brown</persRef> moved that a separate question should be taken on
								<persRef ref="hammett-william">Hammett’s</persRef> amendment
							requiring the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to give

								>Campbell</persRef> demanded a separate question on <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop’s</persRef> amendment prohibiting
							Slavery throughout the territory. It was carried by yeas and nays 121 to

								Levering</persRef>, the Letter writer for the Baltimore Sun— He is a

								Levy</persRef> the delegate from Florida moved a call on the
								<persRef ref="wilkins-william">Secretary of War</persRef>, on the
							progress made in fortifications, on the Florida reef, and an estimate
							for their continuance— After two abortive attempts of <persRef

							report from the Committee of Commerce, he succeeded in obtaining a
							suspension of the rules for half an hour to receive reports from

							of which the only one worthy of notice was made by <persRef

							Military affairs, a bill to establish a military asylum for the relief
							of invalid soldiers— A miniature Greenwich hospital— Twice read, and
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—and at

							chairman of the Committee of Claims moved to go into Committee of the

							the first and fourth Friday’s of each month are devoted to the passage

							ordered to be engrossed for a third reading. During this process I went
							into the Senate chamber and heard a debate on a Post-Office Bill now

						<p>The morning was absorbed in writing and desultory reading of passages in
							the pamphlets which came to me daily by the mails— In addition to which
								<persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Commander Charles Wilkes</persRef>,
							sent me a few days since for my perusal three large Quarto Volumes,
							being the account of the exploring expedition fitted out by the
							government of the United States, and accomplished under his command in
							the years 1838, 39. 40, and 41, and 42. I only opened the book this
							morning, and could read a few pages of the introduction when the time
							came for repairing to the house.— There I found them already engaged in
							the consideration of private claims— <persRef ref="leonard-moses"
								>Leonard</persRef> of New-York had prevailed on the house to
							discharge the Committee of the whole from the consideration of a bill
							from the Senate authorising the <persRef ref="bibb-george">Secretary of
								the Treasury</persRef> to make arrangement or compromise with any of
							the sureties or bonds given to the United States by <persRef
								ref="swartwout-samuel">Samuel Swartwout</persRef> late collector of
							the customs at New-York— <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef>
							chairman of the Committee of claims moved a suspension of the rules to
							take up and act upon the private bills reported yesterday from the
							Committee of the whole; which after some officious interruption from
								<persRef ref="yulee-david">Levy</persRef> the delegate from Florida
							was finally carried. 65 bills and joint Resolutions were thus taken up
							and passed without opposition. Upon three debate arose. A bill for the
							relief of <persRef ref="campbell-james3">James S. Campbell</persRef>, an
							old claim of indemnity for loss sustained during the War of
							Independence, which after a tenacious discussion was laid on the table—
							The bill to authorise the Secretary of the Treasury to compromise with
							any of the sureties of Samuel Swartwout, was tamely debated till
								<persRef ref="caldwell-george">Caldwell</persRef> moved to lay it on
							the table and called the yeas and nays which were 96 to 58. <persRef
								ref="jones-george4">G. W. Jones</persRef> moved a reconsideration,
							but could not get the yeas and nays and the rediscussion was postponed
							till next Monday.— Then came the bill for the relief of the heirs of
								<persRef ref="watson-james">James C. Watson</persRef>, deceased. A
							Georgia Slave-trade speculation— Seminole Indian negro Slaves, taken
							prisoners by Creek Indian allies of the United States said to have been
							promised by <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">General Jesup</persRef> as
							spoils of War to the Creeks—sold by them to Watson for 14600 dollars;
							but refused to be delivered to Watson’s agent, because General Jesup had
							promised to restore them, and they were actually restored to their
							Seminole masters, and so the United States are to indemnify Watson for
							the loss of his bargain— It was debated a full hour, and then <persRef
								ref="hammett-william">Hammett</persRef>, moved the previous question
							on the engrossment of the bill— I moved to lay it on the table— The
							house adjourned— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><persRef ref="daily-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Daily</persRef> preached this morning in the hall of the house of
							Representatives from Revelation 21. and part of the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> and 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							verses— “And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying—there shall be
							no more death”— This is but a small part of the two verses, but there
							was to me deep pathos in the text for I had just received a Letter from
								<persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef> at Medford
							with the sad tidings of the decease last Tuesday morning the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month of <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Abby S.
								Angier</persRef> eldest daughter of my deceased brother <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">Thomas</persRef>— A most lovely, amiable and
							accomplished woman, at whose newly finished and well furnished dwelling
							house I had passed a pleasant evening, but two or three days before I
							last left home to come here— The bereavement to <persRef
								ref="angier-john">her husband</persRef>, to <persRef ref="adams-ann"
								>her mother</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>sister</persRef> is irreparable, and the loss to the community much
							to be lamented.— A discourse upon death though from the most vociferous
							methodist that I ever heard, fell with deep impression upon my mind—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily’s fluency never fails him, but
							the straining of his voice and the violent accompaniment of his
							gesticulations keep me often in alarm lest he should burst a blood
							vessel in the midst of his discourse. Yet after he has finished there is
							very little; and seldom any thing left upon my memory— The double nature
							of man, matter and mind, body and soul, the mortal and immortal part,
							the universality of death and the mystery of the resurrection of the
							body formed the theme of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily’s
							declamation, and the final consummation of the promise from heaven that
							there shall be no more death is the Christian religion and the bible—
							There was a dramatic scene of the death bed of the father of a family
							which had it not been used up, would have been affecting— The choir from
							the Wesleyan methodist church sang the 100<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> psalm, and the hymn— There is a land of pure delight.—
							After the service I called at <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge
								Cranch’s</persRef> and informed them of the death of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier— I visited also at <persRef
								ref="coleman-samuel">Coleman’s</persRef> National Hotel, <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Webster</persRef> and his family.— His sons <persRef

								Webster</persRef>, a <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and Miss Fletcher</persRef> were all there— After dinner
							at Saint John’s church <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the service for the first Sunday in
							Lent, and preached from Psalm 4.4— “Commune with your own heart, upon

						<p>The address to the People of the United States of the State Convention of
							the Commonwealth of Massachusetts held at Boston on the 29<hi

							January and the report of <persRef ref="archer-william">William S.
								Archer</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations of
							the Senate, against the joint resolution sent to them by the house for
							the annexation of Texas to the United States, absorbed this morning’s
							hours till I went to the house— These two State papers, form a perfect
							parallel and contrast of intellect politics and morals, between Virginia
							and New-England— They are upon one and the same subject, and embrace the
							same topics. Archers report is a Daguerrotype miniature portrait of
							Virginia— <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster’s</persRef> address is a
							full length likeness of New-England, or rather of Massachusetts. For
							Webster’s mind though native of New-Hampshire, and graduate of
							Dartmouth, has been moulded by thirty years of association with
							Massachusetts, to the Boston standard of thought, and the mental scale
							of Harvard— At the house, the bill for the relief of the heirs of
								<persRef ref="watson-james">Samuel C. Watson</persRef>, with the
							question to lay it on the table pending over it was the unfinished
							business from Saturday—but this day and to-morrow had been specially
							assigned for the business of the territories; and after not more than a
							quarter of an hour of smuggling, the rules were suspended, and the house
							went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">John W Davis</persRef> in the chair.— <persRef
								ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale Owen</persRef>, had introduced, a
							substitute for the Bill from the Senate to dispose of the Smithsonian
							bequest. Without reading it was ordered to be printed, and referred to
							the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union.— Some half a dozen
							bills for squandering money in the territories went through the
							Committee, without opposition or remark— They were chiefly gotten up by
							the Jew Delegate from Florida <persRef ref="yulee-david">Levy</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> stop’d one or two
							of them which were no sooner looked into than they were found to be
							gull-traps, and were rejected.— At last one bill was brought up for the
							admission of the Territories of Iowa and of Florida, each as a State
							into the Union. A question arose about fixing the boundaries of the
							State of Iowa—with regard to which there is a controversy between them
							and the State of Missouri— <persRef ref="duncan-alexander"
								>Duncan</persRef> moved an amendment specially defining the boundary
							of Iowa, against which <persRef ref="dodge-augustus">Augustus
								Dodge</persRef>, the Delegate from the Territory most solemnly
							protested. But <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> rose in
							support of Duncan’s amendment—the Committee rose, and the house

							the ground for 24 hours— And Fahrenheit never lower than 10. The weather
							has now again become warm as Spring— This was the second of the days
							specially assigned for the consideration of the business relating to the
							territories— By a Slavemonger trick the admission of the two Territories
							of Iowa and of Florida, was included in one bill— There is a controversy
							concerning their respective boundaries between the Territory of Iowa,

							and which terminated in a political dissertation by <persRef

							rose and the house adjourned over to this day; when upon going into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Vinton took up his
							theme, and expatiated upon the future centripetal glory and conservative
							power of the West for the preservation and perpetuation of this
							Union—for his allotted hour— I dare not say how I felt when he closed—
								<persRef ref="belser-james">Belser</persRef> of Alabama followed him
							with a bathos of sequel to his argument sinking into the slough of

							off as a separate State—but this was struck out notwithstanding a
							desperate struggle by <persRef ref="yulee-david">Levy</persRef>.
								<persRef ref="morse-freeman">Morse</persRef> of Maine moved a
							conditional proviso that the admission of Florida, should be on
							condition of her People’s expunging from their Constitution two
							Articles—one prohibiting their Legislature from emancipating Slaves, and
							the other authorising them to pass Laws excluding coloured persons from
							the State.— Levy asked him if he was serious. The Committee rose 76 to
							76. by the casting vote of the chairman <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> moved to go into Committee again and take out the
							bill in 20 minutes—and the previous question— I moved to adjourn— Not in

							next Thursday. adjourned past 5. Evening visitors—</p>

							which he calls a Legislative Teller for taking the yeas and nays
							expeditiously—but one objection was made, and the memorial was not

						<p>Snow in the night— <persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> James Knox Polk</persRef> arrived last night in this
							city— His arrival was notified by a democratic Cannonade upon the
							Capitol hill, and a democratic escort from the Depot of the Rail-road
							Cars to his lodgings at <persRef ref="coleman-samuel"
								>Coleman’s</persRef> National Hotel. He brought with him <persRef
								ref="polk-sarah">his wife</persRef> and a small retinue, and was
							accompanied by the Vice-President elect, <persRef ref="dallas-george"
								>George Mifflin Dallas</persRef> who coming from his residence at
							Philadelphia, joined him at the relay house 9 miles on this side of
							Baltimore— The parade of his reception was all partizan, and a display
							of one democrat member of Congress to represent each State and Territory
							of the Union formed a congenial part of his cortège from the cars to his
							lodgings.— He has affected to speak at Nashville and at Cincinnati of
							being the President of the Nation and not of a party, but he is sold,
							soul and body to that grim idol half albino half negro the compound of
							democracy and of Slavery, which by the Slave representation in Congress
							rules and ruins the Union— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Houck</persRef> the man from Missouri recommended to me
							yesterday by <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> of
							Kentucky came this morning, and I went with him to the lodgings of
								<persRef ref="almonte-juan">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Almonte</persRef> the Mexican Minister, but he was sick in bed with
							a fever— It was relief to me, for the morning’s mail had brought the
							tidings of <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa-Anna’s</persRef> final
							overthrow, and captivity in Mexico.— The house very soon after meeting
							went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and after a
							close and convulsive disorderly struggle to take up the Cumberland road
							bill, the Post-Office Bill, the Bill for extending the right of suffrage
							in the city of Washington, settled first on the unfinished business at
							the last rising of the Committee the bill of appropriation for the
							improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, which was amended reported
							and passed without opposition—then upon the navy pension bill passed
							also without opposition—and then upon the annual appropriation bill for
							the West Point Academy, which brought up the Prince of demagogues
								<persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef>— He made a furious
							speech of an hour and more of charges against the whigs of frauds in the
							recent presidential election— He was repeatedly called to order, and
							pronounced by the chairman <persRef ref="jameson-john2"
								>Jameson</persRef>, out of order, just feebly enough to encourage
							him to proceed, as he did proceed without in the least heeding the
							decision against him. He attacked also the abuses of the army and navy
							the epauletted loafers, and was answered but not silenced by <persRef
								ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>A strange looking man named <persRef ref="holden-richard">Richard
								Holden</persRef> whom by his pronunciation I took to be a well
							educated Englishman, came this morning with a petition which he
							requested me to present to the house; proposing to Congress to purchase
							an invention of his—a method of procuring relative motion.— I entered it
							in the <persRef ref="french-benjamin">clerk’s</persRef> office, and
							directed its reference to the Committee of Naval Affairs. <persRef
								ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todsen</persRef>
							called also and spoke about German Literature, and his own destitution
							of employment— He mentioned a recent German work in which he said he
							said notice was taken of me having been educated in Europe. I asked him
							what work it was— He said he would send me the volume, which he did— It
							was the Conversations— Lexicon in 4. Volume Edition of 1838— My name is
							introduced in an Article on the Congress of the United States, at that
							period—as a member of the house of Representatives— At the house
								(<persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means reported a Navy pension-bill which was
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and
							passed— I found the house voting by yeas and nays on a motion for a call
							of the house. The affirmative was carried by the <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">Speaker’s</persRef> casting vote, but as a quorum
							appeared the call was superseded.— Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union <persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jameson</persRef> again in the
							chair.— A motion was made to take up the Cumberland road Bill— Count by
							tellers 58 to 58 a tie— The Chairman voted ay, and the Bill was taken
							up— N. 13. all this was yesterday, but this day) the rules were
							suspended for about 2 hours to receive Reports of Committees which would

							from the joint Committee to inform the <persRef ref="polk-james"

							hurried through the Committee, and carried to the question of its

						<p>In the Hall of the house of Representatives <persRef
								ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tuston</persRef> the Chaplain of the Senate preached for the last
							time to the present Congress. His text was from Acts 26.28. [“]Then
								<persRef ref="herodagrippa-ii">Agrippa</persRef> said unto <persRef
								ref="paul">Paul</persRef>, almost thou persuadest me, to be a
							Christian.” He read the whole chapter of which this verse forms a part
							and expatiated largely upon the transcendent excellence of the character
							of Paul, upon his unparalled services and sufferings in the cause of the
							gospel, upon the wonderful powers of his mind, exemplified in the
							history of his wanderings related in the book of Acts, in his epistles
							and in his Orations, especially that before Agrippa. I believe it must
							be admitted by every reflecting reader of the New Testament that next to
							Jesus himself, Paul stands unrival’d as the great pillar of the
							Christian Gospel— And although the record of all his speeches in the
							Book of Acts would not make up in quantity one half of the shortest
							philippic of <persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> or of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, not the second or
							divine philippic of the Roman, nor the Oration for the crown of the
							Athenian can claim the palm of eloquence by the side of this address to
							Agrippa, or of the speech to the Athenians upon the altar to the unknown
							God— Upon the text itself M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston’s
							argument seemed to me to drag its slow length along— It is a pregnant
							text, but seemed to elude his obstetric hand. He drew from it one
							ingenious inference—that as Agrippa was almost persuaded to become a
							Christian therefore persuasion is the only lawful weapon to be used for
							the conversion of infidels. And then came a blast of indignation against
							all religious intolerance and persecution. At S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church after dinner, <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the Evening
							service for the second Sunday in Lent and preached from Ecclesiastes 5.2
							“Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any
							thing before God.”— It is but half the verse, but it was the whole of
							the text, and the discourse was an admonition rather peremptory of the
							solemn obligations assumed by sponsors in baptism. He said that in this
							country the parents were permitted to be sponsors—but never, in the
							Church of England— He dwelt even with vehemence upon the sacred duty of
							the Sponsor to fulfil the promise to see to the religious instruction of
							the child, and warned his hearers never to undertake the office, and yet
							not to decline it when duty qualified for it.</p>

							Clay— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had not been in the habit

							and distant periods of time, and in a very different state of the
							personal relations between us— That I should cheerfully allow him,
							Colton to see them all so far as I could collect them— But with regard
							to certain transactions at Ghent, and to one event during my
							administration, his duel with <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef>, there had been a depth of dissension between him
							and me, which I desired not to disclose to the public, but would wish to
							be buried in oblivion.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton said that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay would desire nothing which might
							disturb the friendly relations now subsisting between him and me; and we
							had an hour or more of full and free conversation which I have neither
							time space nor inclination here to record— At the house after a sparring
							debate upon questions of distribution of copies of the great work on the
							exploring expedition, on motions to reconsider the votes laying on the
							table the bill for a free bridge over the eastern branch of the
							Potomack, and the bill for compounding with the sureties of <persRef

							were lost, the bill for regulating the pay of the army was taken up. The
							question of its engrossment had been ordered under the screw of the

							engrossed— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> called for
							the yeas and nays on the passage of the bill, but forgot to move the
							previous question— I seized the unsuspected moment and took the floor
							intending to speak about 5 minutes <persRef ref="black-james2">James A.

						<p>My speech of yesterday was a random shot. A mere digression; of which

							an apology to his constituents for voting against the annexation
							joint-resolution. <persRef ref="black-james2">James A. Black</persRef>

							Society, came to me last Saturday evening with a subscription on paper
							to purchase a library. I desired them to come again which they did last

							me, and will call again in two or three days. This morning <persRef

							if he knew what the administration proposed in this case to do. He said
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>r</hi> Calhoun. I said he might— He will see me again. At the house
							this day. In Committee of the whole on the state of the Union there was
							a debate of three hours on a bill appropriating 20000 dollars to
							refurnish the Presidents house and 8000 dollars for the outhouses and
							grounds, which in the house was finally rejected by yeas and nays 72 to
							80— The civil and diplomatic appropriation bill was then debated in
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef

						<p>I read a series of 12 Letters printed in the Boston Atlas, addressed to
							me on the subject of the annexation of Texas to the United States; well
							written, though I know not by whom; well reasoned, and conclusive
							against the measure; but without avail; for it is now apparent that it
							will be consummated, and is written in the book of Fate— The only
							insurmountable objection against it, the perfidious robbery and
							dismemberment of Mexico is lost in the Anarchy and civil War into which
							precisely at this moment Mexico has fallen— She cannot maintain her own
							identity— She is falling to pieces, and if Texas were restored to her
							she could not hold it— The opposition is now confined to the mere mode
							of making the acquisition, and the question of power will be finally
							decided by the Will— The Constitution is a menstruous rag, and the Union
							is sinking into a military monarchy to be rent asunder like the Empire
							of <persRef ref="alexanderthegreat">Alexander</persRef> or the kingdoms

							motion to cease debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, on the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill, and take it out

							succeeded by the descent of <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheits</persRef> thermometer to a range from zero

							for explanations and five minutes for answer were allowed, till to

							have read the address of <persRef ref="breck-samuel">Samuel

							was a similar celebration of the pilgrim race at Cincinnati, Ohio— And
							there will be hereafter pilgrim anniversaries South and West till the

								<persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Saunders</persRef> in the Chair, the

							to the War and Navy Departments after much discussion, and a ludicrous

							designs had been exhibited he obtained a vote for 80000 dollars for one
							of the buildings, that for the War and Navy Departments, and chirped
							like a cricket at having got one of his buildings out of three— Then
							followed another half hour’s sparring for the rebuilding and furnishing
							the branch mint at Charlotte, North Carolina; whereupon <persRef
								ref="barringer-daniel2">Daniel M. Barringer</persRef> gave us an
							instructive dissertation upon the gold mines of that and the adjoining
							States of South Carolina and Georgia— The Mint at Charlotte has cost
							more than it has coined; and has been burnt down.— The Delegates from
							the territories of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Florida moved amendments each
							for his own, which were rejected; but the Georgia members carried an
							item of 20,000 dollars for a Custom house at Savannah— A sweeping item
							of 72000 dollars, for 8 outfits for all the plenipotentiary missions
							abroad was carried, after one of 63000 dollars, excepting Brazil had
							been rejected— <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J.

							6000 for salary of a minister resident to China— I moved to strike out
							the word resident and insert plenipotentiary to strike out the two
							6000’s and insert 9000’s. Ingersoll accepted my amendment, and it was
							carried without an opposing voice. Other amendments were proposed, some
							adopted— Others rejected. About 5 O’Clock the bill was reported to the
							house—the previous question was called on its engrossment, and the house
							adjourned. <persRef ref="cutts-richard2;cutts-mary">Richard and Mary

						<p>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								son</persRef> to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">his
								mother</persRef>, dated Wednesday the 19<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> had given birth to
							a <persRef ref="adams-mary9">daughter</persRef>— Their sixth child, and
							may the blessing of Heaven rest upon them all— Here great preparations
							are making for what is called a National birth-day Ball next Monday.
							Intended as a celebration of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington’s</persRef> birthday.— But as the festivity will run
							into the succeeding day to avoid the profanation of the Sabbath, the
							joyous anniversary is postponed from this day to Monday.— Among other
							ceremonials to give splendor to the occasion they appointed Committees
							of the Managers to wait personally on <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hamilton-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								Evans</persRef> and <persRef ref="bayard-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>, Senators from the
							States of Maine and Delaware, called me out from my Seat in the House,
							and announced to me their mission to tender me the invitation— Which I
							declined, owing to my age and state of health— I had also received a
							written invitation from <persRef ref="porter-samuel">Samuel Humes
								Porter</persRef>, and eleven others, a Committee of invitation to an
							inauguration Ball, to be given on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of March, which in like manner I have declined— This morning <persRef
								ref="goodman-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goodman</persRef> came, and I took his Social History of Great
							Britain, during the reign of the Stuarts beginning with the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> century, being the period of the
							Settlement of the United States, in two duodecimo volumes— In the house
							yesterday I met <persRef ref="tracy-albert">Albert H. Tracy</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="judson-andrew">Andrew T. Judson</persRef>, U.S.
							District judge in Connecticut— I asked him if he had seen <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J Ingersoll’s</persRef> Report and bill
							appropriating 70,000 dollars to indemnify the owners of the Schooner
							Amistad—he said he had— I asked him if he had observed the falsification
							in the report of the date of the capture of the Amistad by <persRef
								ref="gedney-thomas">Lieutenant Gedney</persRef>.— He said he had,
							and had intended to publish some remarks upon it; but had waited in the
							expectation that it would be duly exposed in the house— With slight
							exceptions the whole of this day was consumed in taking questions
							chiefly by yeas and nays upon the amendments adopted in Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union to the civil and diplomatic
							appropriation bill, most of them were confirmed. The most remarkable was
							the sweeping appropriation of 72000 dollars, or as much thereof as may
							be necessary, for all the plenipotentiary missions abroad.— The bill was
							passed— <persRef ref="owen-robert2">R. D. Owen</persRef> moved an

						<p>Public worship at the Capitol. <persRef ref="daily-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily</persRef> chaplain of the house
							preached from Galatians 6.14. first part of the verse— “But God forbid
							that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”— He
							began the discourse by remarking that it was the nature of man to glory
							in something. Every individual, every community, every Nation glories on
							something—and it was no uncommon thing for people to glory in their
							shame— But the only real source of glory was the Cross of Christ— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily is fond of a fencing bout with
							infidelity.— He undertook to specify the mistake of infidels who reject
							the Christian Gospel because they maintain it is inconsistent with
							reason— It arises from their confounding two distinct ideas—existence,
							and the cause of existence—the difference between the idea that a thing
							is—and how it is—for example grass grows—human reason is competent to
							observe and comprehend this—but <hi rend="italic">how</hi> it grows is
							beyond all human comprehension— Reason is adequate to the observation of
							the fact; but not to discover the primary cause of the fact—that is a
							mystery which reason can neither penetrate nor disprove— So of the
							truths of the Christian Gospel— Reason finds them disclosed in the
							Bible—but how they exist no human mind can comprehend or disprove— It is
							the Mystery of the Cross of Christ— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daily
							did not notice the peculiar character of this epistle to the Galatians,
							which is merely a controversial argument against the necessity of
							subjecting the gentile converts to the jewish rite of circumcision.— His
							valedictory to his auditors was warm and affectionate— After the morning
							service, <persRef ref="bradley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William A. Bradley</persRef> called on me, and gave me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="slacumb-george">George W. Slacum</persRef> late consul
							of the United States at Rio de Janeiro to him, desiring him to request
							me to move a call in the House of Representatives, for his
							correspondence with the Department of State, which he complains has been
							suppressed, relating to the African Slave-trade— This afternoon at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef ref="pyne-smith"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read prayers for
							the third Sunday in Lent, and preached from Acts 16.30—“what must I do
							to be saved?” A solemn and momentous question, which he exhorted every
							one of his hearers to put to himself. It seems to me susceptible of a
							very simple and easy answer.— Obedience to the will of God—good will to
							man—true repentance for sin, and active exertion to do good is the
							unerring path to Salvation— May I not fail to follow it. <persRef

								comptroller of the Treasury</persRef>, upon the remnant claim of the
							Representatives of the late <persRef ref="otis-william3">William
								Otis</persRef>, on the Treasury— I told him that my time has been so
							entirely absorbed since he was last here that I had not yet had the
							opportunity to call upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Culloch, and
							probably shall not have, before the close of the Session of Congress—
							Immediately after which I would attend to the subject— He gave me to
							read a Letter from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wolfe</persRef> the Counsel for the heirs of William Otis at
							New-Orleans, urging the payment of their proportion to them— The
							difficulty being that the judge of probate declines issuing Letters of
							Administration on the Estate of <persRef ref="otis-nathaniel">Nathaniel
								Otis</persRef>, who on his decease left no assets within his
							jurisdiction.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson proposes to send
							to New-Orleans a draft of 50 dollars to serve as assets upon which the
							judge may issue Letters of Administration, which will authorise him to
							pay the portion due to the heirs at New-Orleans— At the house the day
							was almost entirely consumed in a struggle, to pass per saltum, a bill
							for reducing the rates of postage, received from the Senate— There is in
							all the free States a loud popular clamour for a great reduction of the
							postage of Letters; and it has taken a deep hold of the candidates for
							popular favour, and votes in those parts— The Sectional interests of
							North and South, are in conflict with each other in this case— The
							Committee of Post-Offices and Post roads, had reported a Bill in the
							house, to reform of the Postage, but it fell far short of the bill from
							the Senate— <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> had given notice
							on Saturday that he should this day move to go into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union to take up the army and navy
							appropriation bills.— He moved accordingly to go into Committee this
							morning, and they did so— But they refused to take up his army bill, and
							took up the Postage bill from the Senate.— <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
								>Hopkins</persRef> moved to substitute the house Bill in its place—
							But <persRef ref="rathbun-george">Rathbun</persRef> moved the Committee
							to rise for a resolution to take the House bill out of Committee in ten
							minutes— The Committee rose, and <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal"
								>Hamlin</persRef> of Maine made the ten minutes motion, but it
							kindled a blaze of Such ignation from the South that he soon flinched
							and extended the time for debate in Committee to two hours. The Northern
							and Southern democracy, battled it all day; but the North finally
							prevailed to take the bill out of Committee, after two hours of debate
							to morrow.— <persRef ref="cary-shepard">Shepherd Cary</persRef>, by a

							last Evening; and <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

							And this long day from 11 in the morning to half past 7 in the evening,
							was worried through against a desparate opposition resorting to every
							possible of chicanery to defeat the first two hours of the sitting were
							however yielded to receiving reports from Committees which gave no
							occasion for debate; executive communications, and bills from the
							Senate, several of which were taken up, and passed— I seized a moment
							between one report of a Committee and another to ask the general consent
							of the house for a resolution calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef>, if not incompatible with the public interest
							to cause to be communicated to the house the correspondence of <persRef
								ref="slacumb-george">George W. Slacum</persRef> late Consul of the

							to the African Slave trade.— The <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>Speaker</persRef> after putting me off two or three times, said my
							motion could only be received by the unanimous consent of the house—
								<persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi
							objected— I intreated him to withdraw his objection, observing that it
							was a mere call of enquiry and there were so few days of the Session
							left that unless the call should be immediately made there would be no
							chance of receiving an answer to it— Thompson rather ungraciously
							slackened his objection, the Speaker put the question upon my

								>M’Kay</persRef> moved that the house would daily to the end of the

							Section out of 23. the Committee rose for lack of a Quorum; and <persRef
								ref="douglas-stephen">Douglas</persRef> moved to discharge the
							Committee from all further consideration, and the Bill and bring it with
							the amendments adopted before the house for its immediate action— This
							after a hard and convulsive struggle was carried; and after abortive
							motions to lay the bill on the table, for a call of the house and to
							adjourn, the previous question on the passage of the bill was carried,
							and at half past 7 the house adjourned.</p>

						<p>Another tumultuary day of confusion as all those that follow will be to

							Department of State, in answer to a Resolution offered by him on this

							After an agonizing struggle the bill was passed 128 to 74.— <persRef

						<p>The day passes and leaves scarcely a distinct trace upon the memory of

							journal was read— I presented the report of the joint committee of the
							Legislature of Massachusetts, by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, and the Resolutions of
							the Legislature concerning the annexation of Texas to the United States,
							and they were received— The River and harbour bill was taken up at the
							stage where it was last left, and after several of the amendments
							adopted in Committee of the whole were rejected <persRef
								ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts’s</persRef> substituted bill was
							carried by yeas and nays 102 to 92—and passed 106 to 95.— <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> moved to go into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union to take up the army and navy
							appropriation bills, but the Texas-Resolutions had not yet been referred
							to that Committee and the house refused to go into Committee 82 to 107.—
							So the report of <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke’s</persRef>
							Committee on the Rhode-Island Resolutions came up for the morning hour—
								<persRef ref="elmer-lucius">Elmer</persRef> finished the Speech
							which he had begun against the report the last time it was before the
							house; and <persRef ref="williams-henry4">Henry Williams</persRef> made
							a Speech to sustain the report— Then after another struggle to go into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union which the majority
							inflexibly refused until the Texas Resolutions were referred to that
							Committee— They were referred and after many fruitless efforts to delay
							their passage were forced through without the allowance of any debate
							and with stubborn rejection of every proposed amendment. I took in this
							transaction save that of silent voting.— I regard it as the apoplexy of
							the Constitution.— The final vote of concurrence with the amendment of
							the Senate was 132 to 76— After which on M’Kay’s motion the house
							resolved itself into a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							and crowded through the Navy Appropriation Bill alternating at pleasure
							between the Committee with <persRef ref="duncan-alexander"
								>Duncan</persRef> in the Chair, and the house with <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef>, <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> and <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Linn Boyd</persRef>
							by turns, the Speaker <persRef ref="jones-john9">Jones</persRef> being
							indisposed— The army appropriation bill came next and was squeezed along
							to its last lines till the quorum failed and at 10. P.M. the house
							adjourned.</p>
