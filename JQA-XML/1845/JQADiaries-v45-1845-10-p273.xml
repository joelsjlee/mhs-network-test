                            upon which or upon any thing else that I read I have no power to write
                            or indeed to make any useful remarks— I had also received invitations,

                            Revelation 1–5— “Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness”— The text of
                            his afternoon Discourse was Galatians 6.10. “As we have therefore

                            the household of Faith.” These were both excellent Sermons— There was

                            brought with him, a Certificate, of good conduct, from his School
                            Teacher— I told him if he would address an application to the <persRef

                            vacancy of a Cadet to be filled—from this District, and I told M<hi

                            appointment—with strong Certificates and recommendations— He said that
                            the printed regulations of the War Department expressly declared that in
                            the appointment of Cadets no regard is paid to priority of application—
                            I said that however that might be, the practise is to allow the
                            Representative, in Congress, for the District to nominate the Candidate
                            and to appoint the person nominated by him—and if I should be called to
                            make the nomination, between Candidates of equal claims in other
                            respects I should not think it right to disregard all together priority
                            of application— He thanked me for the offer to forward his application
                            and said he would avail himself of it— <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"

                            the day—to very thin auditory—his text of the morning discourse was
                            Titus 2.12. “Teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we
                            should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world”— He
                            divided his Discourse into three classes of duties, embracing the whole
                            duty of Man upon earth—and remarked that the precept to live soberly
                            comprises all the duties of Man to himself that the command to Live
                            righteously included all the duties of Man to his fellow-creatures and
                            that of living Godly, all his duties to his Creator— The text of his
                            afternoon Sermon was 2. Peter 1.7. “And, to Godliness brotherly
                            kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity”— <pb n="278" type="ms"

                            is not yet settled and that her admission as a Slave state may be
                            defeated, that if National infamy and ruin are strong enough to create a
                            necessity it must be defeated, and then devising in their wisdom how it
                            shall be defeated— The Liberty Abolition Birney constitute perhaps one

                            that his name may be entered on the Books of the War Department as a
                            Candidate for the Warrant— He asked me what prospect I thought there was
                            of his success— I said I could not give him much encouragement as there
                            were several applications of a prior date with strong recommendations—
                            He said he would nevertheless send me the application— I rode this

                            I then rose, and performed my ritual lustrations, ablutions and
                            frictions. I took a long walk after breakfast in the morning, and
                            another after dinner. I called at <persRef ref="harding-chester"
                                >Harding’s</persRef> gallery in school St. and saw <persRef

                            morning. I met in a bookseller’s shop <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Mr

                                >his brother the Judge</persRef> was sick, confined to his bed. I
                            next went to Amory hall and saw <persRef ref="king-john5">Mr
                                King</persRef> the Sculptor and the cast of my bust. He told me that
                            he intended to make a cameo from it for himself: he said also that he
                            had received four orders for copies of the bust. And that every person
                            who had seen it pronounced it an excellent likeness. In walking to the
                            south part of the city I found an entire new street called Dover St.
                            many of the houses of which are not yet finished. Near there I met

                            five thousand dollars a year and no outfit— I used all the influence in
                            my power that he should have the rank and compensation of an envoy
                            extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary; to which the house of
                            representatives agreed but which the senate refused to sanction reducing
                            the rank to that of a simple commissioner and the salary to five
                            thousand dollars— He embarked in may last with his wife at New York, but
                            on his way was taken ill and at Rio Janeiro found himself so much
                            indisposed that by the advice of his physicians instead of proceeding to
                            China returned to this country and arrived here about a fortnight since.
                            He had still some expectation of recovering his health sufficiently to
                            go out again upon his mission. <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">Dr

                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">My son</persRef> went out to Quincy
                            and returned after dinner. <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss

                            sitting to <persRef ref="healy-george">Mr Healy</persRef>, and <persRef
                                ref="dubourjal-savinien">Mr Du Bourjal</persRef> for my portrait. I
                            believe Mr Healy’s picture is the strongest likeness of me that ever was
                            painted, and I told him that I hoped it was the last portrait that ever
                            would be painted of me. <persRef ref="u">Mr Weston</persRef> was there
                            during part of the sitting and he too is a painter, and a man of taste
                            and intelligence. Mr Healy requested that any of my friends who wished
                            to see my portrait should come on Saturday morning. His portraits of
                                <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Andrew Jackson</persRef> and

                            declined both the requests to deliver a lecture and to contribute a

                            Numbers 13,32. “And they brought up an evil report of the land which
                            they had searched, unto the children of Israel, saying the land through
                            which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
                            thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great

                            was Amos 5.13 “Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that that
                            time for it is an evil time.” In the evening with my Granddaughter

                            my health has disabled me from completing— I stated my doubts whether I
                            should ever be able to complete it—but that I had not entirely given up
                            that hope, or at least that of finishing, and presenting it to the

                            amounts to six hundred and seventy five dollars, for distributing
