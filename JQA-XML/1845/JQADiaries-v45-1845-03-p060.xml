								Todsen</persRef> called on me this morning and took back the volume

							South Carolina dying by inches of pulmonary consumption, immediately
							after the reading of the journal intreated and obtained permission to
							have his name recorded in favour of the Texas resolutions adopted
							yesterday, while he was absent, from extreme indisposition—Campbell’s
							life is probably not worth a year’s leave. He said it was probably one
							of the last votes he should ever give in the house— He is one of those
							who in the commission of crimes think they are doing God service— He
							represents about 80,000 slaves— Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union, <persRef ref="mcclellan-robert">M’Clelland</persRef> in the
							chair, the bill for establishing new Post-Offices was taken up, loaded
							with a number of amendments, reported to the House and passed Then

							Army appropriation Bill was taken up where it had slumped last night.
								<persRef ref="lucas-william">Lucas</persRef>, the member from the
							District in which is the Harper’s ferry armoury moved to strike out the
							item of 200000 dollars for the manufacture of arms, and insert 360000—he
							had polled a large majority of the Committee for it, but there was no
							quorum present— Hamlin the chairman pronounced the amendment carried— I
							remonstrated against such a reckless waste of the public money and made
							Hamlin revoke his decision—and compelled the adjournment for want of a
							quorum— This morning <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef>
							came and told me that half this money was wanted for the Springfield
							armoury, and that the item of 360000 dollars was the estimate from the
							War Department which <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef>, and the
							Committee of Ways and Means had cut down.— Lucas and Harper’s ferry
							however carried the increased appropriation this morning through the
							Committee first, and then by yeas and nays through the house, 85 to 75—
							The army appropriation bill with sundry other incumbrances was
							passed—and also an amendment of the Senate to the bill for reducing
							postage The house took a recess from 3 to half past 4 O’Clock during
							which I came home and dined— Then went back and sat till half past

						<p>The Newspapers had announced that the <persRef ref="taylor-edward">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Taylor</persRef>, the Seamen’s preacher of Boston would officiate in
							the Hall of the House of Representatives at 11. O’Clock this morning.
							But he did not arrive. <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston</persRef> the chaplain
							performed the usual services for the last Lord’s day of the Session, and
							preached a short Sermon of nearly three quarters of an hour, from Acts
							16.30. the last words of the verse—“what must I do, to be saved?” a
							singular coincidence with the discourses of <persRef ref="pyne-smith"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston said nothing very impressive upon
							the subject of his text—but his address was an affectionate and grateful
							valedictory to his congressional auditory. He has been for six
							successive Sessions the chaplain of the Senate, and takes pride in the
							acknowledgment that he has during all that time been treated with
							undeviating respect and kindness, by all the members of both houses of
							Congress— As a second exercise we had an address in behalf of Sailors
							from the <persRef ref="denison-charles">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dennison</persRef> the
							Colleague of father Taylor who travels to obtain subscribers for a
							Sailor Newspaper called the Sheet Anchor— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dennison is not quite so methodical, or so various of topics as <persRef
								ref="colton-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton</persRef>,
							and still less so than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor. He touched
							upon the peculiarities of the Sailors character— The dangers of the
							Seas, of the rocks and of the shores—the sudden and dreadful
							vicissitudes to which he is exposed, and the extraordinary learning of
							some common seaman, one of whom he once heard dispute upon the bible in
							seven different languages. There was earnest exhortation to promote the
							temperance reform among the Seamen, and to abolish the Spirit ration in
							the Navy.— The hall was crowded, and the galleries well occupied— Very
							few members of Congress were in attendance—among them was <persRef
								ref="johnson-henry">Henry Johnson</persRef>, Senator from Louisiana,
							who accompanied <persRef ref="hamilton-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hamilton</persRef>, the widow of
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>, in
							the 90<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year of her age, who has been
							passing the winter here with the manuscript papers of her eminent
							husband for sale to Congress—encouraged by their purchase of those of
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> and of
								<persRef ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef>— Johnson introduced
							me to her— She said she had known <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>—
							After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne read the Evening service, and for the
								4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday in Lent, and preached a
							second Sermon upon the text from Acts 16.30. “What must I do to be
							saved?[”] An elaborate, ingenis, earnest, close, argument for the
							indispensable necessity of a saviour, for man conscious of sin, and of
							his utter inability to save himself— Odi et arceo— It cannot be, the
							more this doctrine is pressed upon me, the more my soul stiffens against
							it. I rely upon the mercy of God.</p>

							performed for the Committee of Manufactures, and the select Committee on
							the Memorials of the American statistical Association and the
							Massachusetts Medical Society relating to the errors in the returns of
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> census— The house took a recess
							from 3 to 5. O’Clock, during which I came home and dined, and returned
							to the Night Session. The day was consumed in the usual convulsive
							agitations, and fraudulent devices usual on the closing day of a
							Congress. The Session was protracted till 3 in the morning of Tuesday,
							and the time was passed in shuffling bills and amendments between the
							two houses, in concurring and nonconcurring with amendments—in receiving
							reports from the Committee of enrolled bills—in messages between the two

							the other in the last 3 days of the Session, and the 17<hi

						<p>Inauguration of James Knox Polk as P.U.S. </p>
						<p>The day after the closing scene of a dying Congress reminds me of what is
							said of Typhon in the Asiatic Seas, and of a West India hurricane, when
							it often happens that the transition from the most terrific fury of the
							tempest to a dead and breathless calm is instantaneous— Such is the
							change of ones personal existence between the whirlwind of yesterday,
							and the tranquility of this day— There was an unusual degree of
							pomposity paraded in the inauguration of <persRef ref="polk-james">James
								Knox Polk</persRef> as President of the United States, by the
							democracy but I witnessed nothing of it— A Committee of arrangements,
							for the reception and inauguration of the President elect had been
							appointed by the Senate consisting of <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Levi
								Woodbury</persRef> of New-Hampshire, <persRef ref="breese-sidney"
								>Sidney Breese</persRef> of Michigan, and <persRef
								ref="colquitt-walter">Walter T. Colquitt</persRef> of Georgia, all
							rank democrats, who in a very polite note, enclosed to me, three printed
							copies of the arrangements, with a notification that a position had been
							assigned to the Ex-Presidents which the committee would be happy to have
							me occupy. I did not avail myself of the invitation— There was a
							procession of 10 or 11. military companies who escorted M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk and <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef>, who rode together, in
							an open carriage, from <persRef ref="coleman-samuel">Coleman’s</persRef>
							National Hotel to the Capitol—They first assembled in the Senate,
							chamber where <persRef ref="dallas-george">George Mifflin
								Dallas</persRef>, Vice-President elect was qualified as President of
							the Senate, and whence they proceeded to a platform protruding from the
							portico at the top of the flight of stairs ascending the eastern front
							to the entrance of the Rotundo— There M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Polk delivered his inaugural address—half an hour long, to a large
							assemblage of umbrella’s for it was raining hard all the time— The
							official oath was then administered to him by <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief Justice Taney</persRef>, and the
							draggle-tail procession thinned in numbers escorted him back to the
							President’s house— At night there were two balls, one at <persRef
								ref="carusi-samuel">Carusi’s</persRef> hall, at 10 dollars a ticket
							of all parties—the other of pure democrats at 5 dollars a ticket at the
							National Theatre— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk attended both but
							supped with the true blue 5 dollar democracy.— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">My family</persRef> and
							myself received invitations to both but attended neither— A young man (I
							forget his name) came and asked me for a copy of my oration upon
								<persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef> for a friend of his in
							New-York, which I gave him— He gave me a copy of the inaugural address
							at which he had been part of the time present I took this afternoon a
							short solitary walk— <persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Richard D.
								Cutts</persRef> was here this evening.</p>

						<p>Numerous visitors this day none of whose names except that of <persRef
								ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Johnson</persRef>, I remember absorbed my time so that I could not even
							redeem the arrears of the last three days in this Diary— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis Johnson came to relieve me from the
							trouble of calling again upon <persRef ref="mcculloch-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Culloh</persRef> the Comptroller to
							convince him of the justice of the remnant of claim of the Estate of
								<persRef ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>, for that last
							Monday morning he had promised a member of the Senate of the United
							States, a lawyer 500 dollars to get the claim through on that day which
							he had done, not only by pressure upon the accounting Officers of the
							Treasury, but by two personal visits to the then acting <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President John Tyler</persRef>, from whom he
							obtained a written order for the allowance of the claim, which passed
							through all the offices on that day. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Johnson said he had not yet received the money, but it was ready for him
							at the Treasury, and when paid he would tell me, who this Senator Lawyer
							is—he had paid him the stipulated 500 dollars, and found him greedy for
							more I guess his name. I rode with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>my wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> to
							the Capitol, where they left me— I found some documents at the <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">Clerks</persRef> Office, and met <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>, late Speaker, <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> and <persRef ref="cobb-howell"
								>Cobb</persRef> in the Post-Office— I had voted against the thanks
							to Jones— The testimony to his impartiality was too broad a lie for me
							to swallow. But I shook hands with him now— As I did with M’Kay, and
							told him it was to part with him forever—for his baseness in defeating
							the appropriation of 40000 dollars for a seawall in Boston Harbour.
								<persRef ref="polk-james">President Polk</persRef> this day
							nominated <persRef ref="buchanan-james2">James Buchanan</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, Secretary of State <persRef ref="walker-robert">Robert J.
								Walker</persRef> of Mississippi, Secretary of the Treasury, <persRef
								ref="marcy-william">William L. Marcy</persRef> of New-York Secretary
							of War, <persRef ref="bancroft-george">George Bancroft</persRef> of
							Massachusetts, Secretary of the Navy, <persRef ref="mason-john5">John Y.
								Mason</persRef> of Virginia Attorney General, and <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> of Tennessee, Postmaster
							General— They were all confirmed by the Senate except Bancroft whose
							nomination was laid over— An entire new Cabinet at the accession of a
							new President without a reverse of politics, is a novelty under the
							present Constitution. Rumours of it have been in circulation for some
							weeks which I did not believe. I doubted especially the removal of the
							Secretary of State, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.
								Calhoun</persRef>, and even now cannot account for it—or for the
							tame complacency with which the Senate confirmed this day all the
							nominations but one— This Evening as I came up to my chamber after tea,
							I found it illuminated with a blaze of light from the National theatre
							with nothing between it and us, but the opposite side of the Street. It
							burnt down, with five or six dwelling houses, and several other
							buildings before midnight— God of Mercy!— Mercy!</p>

						<p>The fire of the theatre, and adjoining houses was subdued before I
							retired to bed last Night, but the ruins were yet smoking when I rose
							this morning— The theatre had been the night before the scene of a
							magnificent democratic inauguration Ball; and when it took fire they
							were with a full house in the midst of the performance of a comedy.
								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> was there— All
							the company however escaped from the house, and not a life was lost— I
							was brooding over the calamities of human suffering, by the unbridled
							element of physical nature in fire, when I received by this morning
							Mail, a printed pamphlet intitled Statement of <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">Francis Thomas</persRef>, exhibiting a tale of
							woe, sprung from the vices and animal propensities of the species, more
							terrible than destruction by fire— Thomas was a distinguished democratic
							member of the House of Representatives from the 22<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> to the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress
							inclusive— In March 1841 he retired from Congress— On the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June of that year was married to
								<persRef ref="thomas-sally">Sarah M’Donnel</persRef>, daughter of
							the <persRef ref="mcdowell-james">Governor of Virginia</persRef>, and in
							December of the same year was elected by the People of Maryland Governor
							of that State for 3. years which expired last December— The torture of
							the infernal regions is Paradise in comparison with the condition in
							which he by his own narrative he has lived from the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st</hi> of July 1841. only six weeks after his
							marriage— He has suffered an excessive load of public odium from which
							he now appeals by this Statement— It is dark if not fatal to the
							reputation of the Lady.— An irresistible interest attached me to the
							pamphlet which I read through, and which consumed the leisure of the
							day— I had a long conversation with <persRef ref="turner-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel A. Turner</persRef> of
							Scituate, here I suppose as a speculator for public office under the new
							administration. I gave him freely my opinions upon the present condition
							and prospects of the country— He avowed no opposite opinion; but
							concurred in a faint-hearted tone, willing to retain the credit of the
							sentiment, and the liberty to maintain its opposite counterpart
							elsewhere— <persRef ref="lawrence-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Lawrence</persRef> an aged Quaker from New-York,
							with his friend named <persRef ref="hoyt-william">William Kimball

						<p>I am endeavouring to pass into a regular and orderly course of life for

								ref="woolley-john">John Woolley</persRef> is a tinplate workman from
							New-Jersey— In 1813 he enlisted for 5 years as a private soldier in the
							U.S. army, and in May 1815 was discharged as unfit for service by reason
							of chronic rhumatism— He has long been a complainant and claimant under
							the pension Laws— Until February or March 1844, his testimony was
							deficient to the fact that his disability was contracted by his military
							service. He then produced it and obtained from <persRef
								ref="wilkins-william">Secretary Wilkins</persRef>, a pension
							certificate of 3 fourths disability, 6 dollars a month— But <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">J. L. Edwards</persRef> the Commissioner of
							Pensions allows his pension to run only from the time when he completed
							his proof last March—which is the law— He claims arrears from May 1815.

							papers to me, for a certificate that if they had been exhibited to me
							when I was President I would have ordered the allowance of his claim— I
							declined and told him that on the face of his papers the decision of

						<p>I attended public worship this morning at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church where <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the morning prayers for the 5<hi

								rend="strikethrough">Matthew</hi> John 9.6. [“]When he had thus
							spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he
							anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. 7. And said unto him,
							Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation sent) He
							went his way, therefore, and washed, and came, seeing.” I was perplexed
							in the effort to trace any connection between this text and the
							discourse which followed upon it—which was a very earnest and
							argumentative exhortation upon the duty of joining in communion with the
							church. In commenting upon the text M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pyne’s first remark was of a peculiarity in the performance of this
							miracle differing from most if not from all the others performed by
							Jesus— In healing the man sick of the palsy—in raising <persRef
								ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> from the dead it was by a word— Take
							up thy bed, and walk— Lazarus came forth— Here it was by action, having
							no apparent relation, between the act and the result—the restoration of
							sight to the blind man— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne urged it as
							a lesson to abstain from irreverent scrutinies into the manner and
							agencies by which the miracles were performed— In this case an intense
							curiosity was excited—the man himself upon whom the miracle was
							performed was taken before the magistrates and examined; as were his
							Parents— They answered enquiries only by referring to him— He referred
							only to facts, and reply to objectors and accusers only said I was
							blind— I see.— The lesson is ingeniously drawn, but how the duty of
							joining in communion with the church is drawn from it, I do not see.
							After the morning service <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef> called on us to take
							leave— He is to go with <persRef ref="barnard-catharine">his

							retires from Congress, having declined a re-election, and has not left a
							wiser or better behind.— His character is grave his deportment courteous
							but dignified; conscious of his own intellectual pre-eminence, and not
							condescending to conceal his aversion to the base or his contempt for
							the stupid— If I ever return here again I shall deeply lament his
							absence— After dinner I attended at the second Presbyterian Church—
								<persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knox</persRef> was in the pulpit, but all the services were
							performed by a stranger—quite a young man He preached from Matthew
							12.30. the first part of the verse— “He that is not with me, is against
							me[”]— Not deficient in fluency; the discourse was not remarkable for
							much beside. He prayed with great fervour for the restoration of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox’s health, and the resumption of his
							ministerial exercises— Whence and from his emaciated form and pallid

						<p>Rainy day— I am now but just beginning a week after the close of the

							informing them that he had found their name in the Report of the

							debt—and offering to receive the money for them, and pay it over to
							their order deducting his commission, if they will send him executed a
							power of Attorney of which he sends them a copy. This printed Letter I
							received some weeks since from <persRef ref="fisher-milton">M. M.

							asking my attention to it— I took it this morning to the Office of
								<persRef ref="nourse-michael">Michael Nourse</persRef>, chief clerk
							to the Register of the Treasury.— The Document is N. 36.— 28. Congress
							1. Session. 6. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1844—where on a
							Statement A. of unclaimed dividends due at the treasury, upon treasury
							and loan Office books, at page 35. the town of Medway stands credited
							for 3 dollars 68 cents; which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse said
							would be paid upon the production of a power of Attorney to receive it,
							executed by the Treasurer of that town— I called also at the Bank of the

								>Speaker</persRef> of the late H.R.U.S. for 513 dollars 60 cents—the

							The nomination of <persRef ref="bancroft-george">George

						<p>This was the first day since the close of the 28<hi rend="superscript"

							Letter and previous correspondence of <persRef ref="gregory-james2"
								>James Gregory</persRef> of Marblehead, for a pension in behalf of
								<persRef ref="reynolds-sarah">Sarah Reynolds</persRef> once widow of

								ref="tucker-samuel">Captain Samuel Tucker</persRef> until she sailed

							1778. and on the next day from Marblehead for France— I took all these

								>James L. Edwards</persRef>, who told me that the pension of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cheney for both half years would be paid,
							on presentation of her declaration and power of Attorney to Meserve, at
							Boston— As to the claim of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sarah
							Reynolds I read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards the material
							parts of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gregory’s Letter to me, and

							from that harbour on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February
							1778. and put in to the harbour of Marblehead for a Seaman or Seamen,
							though I could not pledge my memory to the name of Follett— I left the
							papers with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards who promised
							carefully to review the case and inform me of the result.— This
							afternoon <persRef ref="hague-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							told me he had come to cast the nativities of the new great men, just

							was very desirous of visiting <persRef ref="almonte-juan">General
								Almonte</persRef> the late Mexican Minister who is about taking his
							departure, in consequence of the passage of the Texas-annexation
							Resolutions. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hague asked me the day and
							hour of the birth of <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
							which I told him— He said that for the last six or eight month Saturn
							had cross’d the path of my celestial Stars, and asked me, if I had not
							been visited with an unusual troubles and afflictions. I said I had not
							been without them, nor without cheering consolations. But that in the
							January number of his Horoscope he had prophesied Afflictions to me,
							from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
							children, by this passage of Saturn across my path and I would thank him
							not to foretel any more from the same cause— Sickness or disastrous
							casualties were the only troubles that Saturn could inflict upon me
							through my wife and children, and they would be distressing enough if
							they should come— It was no pleasant pastime to anticipate them. He said
							he would not predict them any more, and that my horoscope was fair for 7
							years.</p>

								Levering</persRef> came and took leave of me—going to Baltimore
							to-morrow and intending to embark in April for England— He asked for a
							Letter of introduction, which he had several times before requested, and
							which I had promised to give him. I wrote one to <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Thomas Aspinwall</persRef> our Consul at
							London, and sent it to him at his lodgings.— I have several tasks of
							private business on hand, for the performance of which I waited till the

							to day. The most that I can accomplish is to dispose of one or two of
							them every day. I wrote this day to <persRef ref="fisher-milton">M. M.
								Fisher</persRef> at Medway to inform him that there is on the books
							of the Register of the Treasury, a sum of 3 dollars 68 cents due to that

							afterwards at his house, and read to him a Letter received, from
								<persRef ref="whitaker-thomas">Thomas S. Whitaker</persRef> 10.

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell</persRef> dined and

						<p>On the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of January last I received a
							Letter from <persRef ref="cowen-benjamin">Benjamin S. Cowen</persRef>,
							then a member of the House of Representatives of the State of Ohio,
							dated Columbus 30 December 1844. informing me in terms of great kindness
							that he had that day had the pleasure of voting for a resolution,
							rescinding the resolution of censure which had passed upon me in the
							Legislature of the same State in February 1842., for having presented
							the Haverhill petition. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cowen was at that
							time a member of Congress from Ohio.— He mentioned in his Letter to me
							that the Resolution of censure was a joint resolution of the two houses—
							That the rescinding Resolution was introduced into the house by a young
							member from Portage County named <persRef ref="paine-robert5"
								>Payne</persRef>, and that it must go to the Senate.— On the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February last I received a Letter
							from R. F. Paine himself dated Columbus 21. February 1845. informing me
							that his rescinding Resolution had that day passed the Senate by a vote
							of 21 to 15— He speaks of the indignation which he had felt at the
							passage of the Resolution of censure, and of the determination he had
							then formed, if he should ever have the opportunity, to get it
							rescinded, and he enquires whether if I should reply to his Letter, I
							should be willing to have the correspondence published?— This proposal
							suggested to me the idea of reviewing the transactions connection with
							my presentation of the Haverhill Petition, in the nature of a deposition
							in perpetuam rei memoriam, and for that purpose began last Tuesday my
							answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Paine to which I have devoted
							ten days, and for which I need above all the daily admonitions of a cool
							and friendly Mentor.</p>

						<p>To sooth my conscience with the semblance of something like doing

							of the chief-Clerk, <persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M’Clintock

								>r.</hi></persRef> owners of the Schooner Abigail of Provincetown,

								<persRef ref="walker-robert">Robert J. Walker</persRef>, requesting
							the remittance to be made. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">M<hi

								Whitwell’s</persRef> on the Capitol Hill, and enquired concerning
								<persRef ref="bates-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bates</persRef>— A young man came to the door of the carriage, and
							said he was no better, and not expected to survive this day.— I went to

								ref="buck-daniel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buck</persRef>,
							the only person whom I found in the Office of the <persRef

							adverse Report— The Report is from the Committee of claims 20 May 1842—
							Two days after the close of the recent Session of Congress, I found
							among the papers on my table a bound octavo Volume of 464 pages, the
							title of which was An American Field of Mars, &amp;c. in 3. Volumes of
							which this was the first—by Benjamin Eggleston—printed at Cleveland
							1839.— Within the book was pasted on the cover was a written note that
							the two subsequent volumes were yet in manuscript, and a long Letter
							addressed to me, of three folio closely written pages, dated Vernon,
							Shiawassee Co. State of Michigan, 7 Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							1844. and enclosing two depositions.— The Letter consisted of a
							narrative of the writer’s removal from Canada to the United States
							during the last War with Great-Britain, and of claims of indemnity and
							of lands consequent thereon. Of a petition to congress, presented for
							him by <persRef ref="andrews-sherlock">Sherlock J. Andrews</persRef>
							then a member from Ohio and of the report of the Committee against the
							claim for want of sufficient evidence— The Letter complains that M<hi

							the subsequent Session—and requests me to do so now, and to present the
							two depositions enclosed in the Letter, one of which is from <persRef
								ref="u">his Son</persRef>. He founds his request upon my promise in

							to it, I would put the papers into the hands of <persRef
								ref="tilden-daniel">Daniel R. Tilden</persRef>, of Ravenna, from
							Portage County, Ohio— When and how this book with its enclosed papers
							came upon my table I know not but the Session had closed before I read

						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church this morning a Stranger preached from
							2. Timothy 1.18 First clause of the verse— “The Lord grant unto him that
							he may find mercy of the Lord in that day”— The words relate to <persRef
								ref="onesiphorus">Onesiphorus</persRef>, an inhabitant of the city
							of Ephesus where <persRef ref="timothy">Timothy</persRef> was residing
							and ordained, when <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> wrote to him this
							Letter from Rome, the English Bible says when Paul was brought before
								<persRef ref="nero">Nero</persRef> the second time— He was then in
							bonds, and complains that on his examination he had been deserted by all
							his companions— The tone of the Letter is gently plaintive and
							melancholy, but inflexibly firm. Onesiphorus had been exceedingly kind
							and bountiful to him at Ephesus— He therefore prays that he may obtain
							mercy from the Lord, in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> day— Mercy! that is
							all for which Paul could pray in behalf of the worthiest of mankind The
							theory of Christianity is that the whole human race is a gang of
							malefactors living from age to age and from century to century in a
							state of total depravity—redeemed however from eternal punishment two
							thousand years ago, by the death of Jesus Christ, and for whose
							salvation the Mercy of God may be implored in <hi rend="italic"
								>that</hi> day—that is in the day of judgment. The tone of the
							preacher was mild but impressive—his discourse congenial to the temper
							of the Epistle— The style plain but not inelegant. Some remarks were
							made on the condition of Paul when he wrote the Letter—on the object of
							it which he thought was an urgent invitation to Timothy to come to him
							at Rome, and on the supplication for the divine mercy to Onesiphorus,
							which if necessary to so meritorious a person, must be so with far more
							self conviction to the miserable Sinners the professing Christians of
							the present day— The house was as thin as ever— Neither <persRef

							Pastor of the Church, nor <persRef ref="mclellan-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lellan the Elder</persRef> was
							present— The preacher prayed for the restoration of the Pastor’s health,
							and gave notice of a lecture to be delivered next Wednesday evening on
							the protestant reformation by the <persRef ref="ely-ezra">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Ezra Stiles Ely</persRef>— <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef>, read the Evening

								ref="cooper-james">James Fenimore Cooper</persRef>, which I promised
							him to distribute and which he sent me several weeks since, for that

							of <persRef ref="elliott-jesse">Commodore Jesse D. Elliott</persRef>— In

								>Fischer’s</persRef> shop and directed the date 3. December 1844 to
							be engraved on the breast of the Eagle directly under the words Right of

							Slavery.— I walked round over the Tyber Creek, and by the Potomack
							bridge, reflecting how strange it is that the recent Session of Congress
							began with a silent vote by yeas and nays 106. to 84. to rescind the
							rule excluding anti-slavery petitions, and ended by receiving the
							Resolutions of the Legislature of Ohio, rescinding the Resolutions of
							censure upon me of the Legislature of 1842, for having presented to
							H.R.U.S the Haverhill petition— And yet this is the same house which
							together with the remnant ruin of a whig Senate, passed the Resolutions
							for the Robbery of the Mexican Provinces, and the admission of Texas as
							a State, and future States into this Union.— <persRef
								ref="wilkes-charles">Captain Wilkes</persRef> sent me for my
							inspection the fourth Quarto Volume of the Narrative of the Exploring
							Expedition.— It will be impossible for me ever to read this enormously
							bulky work the mechanical execution of which so far as concerns
							externals paper, type, and engravings is not inferior to the English,
							French and Russian National works of the same kind.— I am also reading a
							new sort of Arabian or fairy tale called the wandering Jew, by <persRef
								ref="sue-eugene">Eugene Sue</persRef>.— A mystery.</p>

							that the funeral of the Senator from Massachusetts. <persRef

							at dinner with him at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Whitwell’s— At

								ref="buchanan-james2;walker-robert;marcy-william;bancroft-george;mason-john5;johnson-cave"
								>his six Cabinet Ministers</persRef> and his private Secretary were
							present; a few of the Senators in their seats. Several of the foreign
								Ministers—<persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> and

							and female.— <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript"

							no more go down: neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord

							to take up that of Sangster who was seated in the rear of the lawyer’s
							bar— I was sworn and requested to take the witness’s stand which I did—
							The indictment was not read— He had pleaded to it before— At M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall’s request I related the
							circumstances of Sangster’s assault upon me, as briefly as possible— A
							lawyer by the name of <persRef ref="u">Ratcliff</persRef> appeared in
							his behalf— He asked if I had observed any thing peculiar in his
							condition at the time.— I said I saw he was in a state of violent
							excitement which I attributed either to intoxication or insanity, but I
							did not know which— He asked if any thing had subsequently passed
							between Captain Sangster and me. I said I had received a few days a
							Letter from him containing a very handsome apology for the act;
							declaring his deep regret for it, and that it was a sudden and violent
							impulse which he could not controul and which he should never cease to
							lament— He did not say what had been the cause of his passion, but from
							the moment that I received his Letter, every trace of resentment was
							banished from my bosom and I should have been happy to have buried the
							whole transaction in oblivion— I had so declared when called before the
							grand-jury, and had expressed to them that so far as concerned my
							personal injury, they would in the considering the case set it entirely
							aside— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratcliff asked if I believed that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sangster Letter to me was sincere— I
							said I had not a particle of doubt that it was so; and that from the
							moment of receiving it I had been banished every trace of resentment
							from my mind— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratcliff then read several
							Letters from <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="jones-roger">Adjutant General Jones</persRef>, and
							several Officers, testifying the high character and distinguished
							military services of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sangster— The judge
							sentenced him to 30 days imprisonment and 100. dollars fine.</p>

							<p>Adjournment of U.S. Senate. </p>
						
						<p>When <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratcliff</persRef>
							had read the Letters yesterday testifying the honourable character and
							services of <persRef ref="sangster-thomas">Captain Sangster</persRef>,
							he addressed to the court an argument founded upon them, and upon my
							disclaimer of all desire for his punishment, on my account, for the
							mitigation of the sentence upon him— <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall</persRef>, the District
							Attorney made no reply. Captain Sangster in his apology to me had not
							stated what his motive for his assault upon me, nor how it had
							originated. I mentioned this fact in my testimony, and it was specially
							noticed by the judge— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratliff said there
								<hi rend="italic">was</hi> no motive— It was a sudden uncontroulable
							impulse of intoxication without motive.— But he knew better— The
							studious concealment of the motive is some indication of its nature— All
							the testimonials to Sangster’s character were given him as
							recommendations of him for appointments to petty offices which he
							solicited— He was moved to his assault upon me, as a Passport to a
							lucrative Office— That he was instigated to it by some Jackall of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> is highly probable—
							Or he had the instinct to see that nothing could so effectively
							recommend him to the patronage of <persRef ref="tyler-john">John
								Tyler</persRef>— The judge seemed somewhat embarrassed in delivering
							his judgment, acknowledging the weight of the certificates of character,
							and of my desire that he might be dealt with mercifully, but not
							overlooking the aggravated nature of the unprovoked offence, and the
							necessity of vindicating from outrage the immunity of the
							Representatives of the People in Congress— When he pronounced his
							sentence M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratcliff earnestly intreated
							that its execution might be suspended until there should be time for an
							application to <persRef ref="polk-james">President Polk</persRef> for a
							pardon, to which the judge assented. Within an hour afterwards M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratcliff came to my house with the written
							application to the President, to which I readily subscribed my name
							declaring my concurrence in its prayer.— I finished yesterday my Letter
								to<space/><persRef ref="paine-robert5">Paine</persRef>, and am sick of
							it, but must nevertheless send it, and to escape from sinking into
							useless indolence resumed the review of the Report and Bill to indemnify
							the owners of the Spanish Schooner, Amistad, reported to H.R.U.S. on the
								10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1844, once taken up in
							Committee of the whole house, and upon which I was preparing a speech,
							to make if it should be called up again— I went to the Senate chamber
							this morning; but they went immediately into Executive Business and
							adjourned without day— In the Supreme Court Library, <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George of Evans</persRef>
							Senator from Maine, and remarked how his speech was mutilated in the

							urged him to publish his speech in a pamphlet; but he was disinclined.—
							The Senate immediately after Meeting went into executive business and I
							went into the library of the Supreme Court— I read there in 11. <persRef

								Doll</persRef>, a methodist preacher from Shrewsbury in the State of

							some conversation with me. But he has just publishe a book, a duo-decimo
							volume of 347 pages, entitled Jesus Witnesses or the “Great Salvation
							exemplified,[”] of which he let me have one copy for a dollar We had a long conversation upon spiritual subjects, in which I
							acknowledged my inability to believe in some of the portions of the
							creeds of all the Christian Churches.— I found him exceedingly tenacious
							of the atonement, and when I told him it was impossible for me to
							believe that my sins would be forgiven by my maker, by the crucifixion
							for blasphemy, of one man, nearly two thousand years ago, I saw that it
							pained him to the soul. He said that his undoubting belief of this was
							the greatest comfort and delight of his life— He asked if I was willing
							that he should pray with me— I said certainly—and he did kneel and pray
							very devoutly remembering me in his prayer with great kindness— He told
							me he had a son about 11 years old to whom he had given the name of
								<persRef ref="doll-eutychus">Eutychus</persRef>. That some months
							ago, this boy had of his own accord adopted the initial A. as an
							addition to his Christian name, and now always wrote his name Eutychus
							A. Doll.— That he himself had several times asked his son what he meant
							by this A. till at last he told him it meant Adams, and that he had
							adopted it to honour me. I am ashamed to repeat this tale; and still
							more ashamed to confess how delicious are tokens of reverent esteem from
							women and children.— I received this morning a Letter from <persRef

							disposal of the Smithsonian fund— But he has involved himself
							considerably in debt in expenditures for the National Institute, the
							appropriation for which failed again at the recent session of Congress
							that he seems quite discouraged. We agreed however to have further

							and the race grounds. Very few improvements in that direction— <persRef

						<p>Full Moon.</p>
						<p>There has been some ecclesiastical controversy whether this or the next
							Sunday is this year the proper day for the celebration of the festival
							of Easter, and there was in the National Intelligencer of yesterday a
							publication by <persRef ref="doane-george">Bishop Doane</persRef>
							maintaining that this is the proper day, and citing <persRef
								ref="clavius-christopher">Clavius</persRef> for his authority: with
							an array of algebraic calculations, which he says he does not
							understand. I attended public worship this morning at the second
							Presbyterian Church, whose Pastor, <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef>, preached from Psalm
							108.1. “O God, my heart is fixed” the meaning of which he understood to
							be, fixed in the service of God— The Discourse was an earnest
							exhortation of the preacher to his hearers to have their hearts fixed to
							sense God.— In what this service of God should consist, was not
							sufficiently defined. To do Justice, to love Mercy and to walk humbly
							before God are definite ideas, but I can conceive of no worship of God,
							which can carry with it the idea of serving him otherwise than by acts
							of beneficence to our fellow creatures The Service of God which consists
							merely of worship or adoration, is of very little account with me.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox dwelt with great earnestness on our
							duty to serve God throughout our lives in sincerity and in truth— After
							ranging through the variety of motive to this service he considered the
							objections of worldlings to untake it— Then he adverted to the dangers
							of delaying our self devotion to the service of God, and concluded with
							pathetic appeals to the several classes of his auditory the old, the
							middle aged and the young. As I draw towards the close of my days the
							summons of a preacher of the gospel to the proper use of the remnant of
							my time, comes with deeper impression upon my mind than when I had
							longer prospects of life before me.— I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Knox after the service— He is barely recovered from severe
							illness which confined him several weeks to his house and observing the
							continued absence of <persRef ref="mclellan-john2">Elder
								M’Lellan</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef> I
							enquired concerning him and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox told me
							he was so ill that it was not expected he would long survive— After
							dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef>,
							another Clergyman, and <persRef ref="southgate-horatio">Bishop
								Southgate</persRef> a missionary bishop read the Evening service,
							for Easter day, and the Bishop preached from Colossians 3.16. [“]Let the
							word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
							admonishing one another in psalms and hymns, and spiritual songs,
							singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.”— Upon church music—a
							pleasing discourse <persRef ref="campbell-archibald">Archibald

						<p>I have an anxious sensation fretting upon my spirits every morning to do

							reported on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1844. by the
							Committee of Foreign Affairs of the house, to indemnify the owners of
							the Spanish Schooner Amistad— A baser and more profligate misapplication
							of public money was never made than that proposed by this bill; and
							seven years in a penitentiary cell would be a strictly just retribution
							for the report— In examining the compositions of <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>, it is
							impossible to suppress indignation and next to impossible to speak of
							them in terms of moderation— There is in this report a long specious,
							snakish argument against the decisions of the United States Courts in
							the case of the Amistad captives— But it turns upon a gross and glaring
							forgery, a false date; alledging that the schooner Amistad was seized by
								<persRef ref="gedney-thomas">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Gedney</persRef> on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August

									>r.</hi> Lieberman</persRef>, who proposes to take a lease of 3
							years of my house in the Pennsylvania Avenue at a rent of 350 dollars a

								Albion K. Parris</persRef>, second comptroller of the Treasury,

							who has a lease for ten years of the house near <persRef

							the second year when <persRef ref="darby-elizabeth">his wife’s</persRef>

								<persRef ref="claiborne-william2">Captain Claiborne</persRef> came

								Lewis Johnson</persRef> came in, but being immediately followed by
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamb</persRef>, of

								>r</hi> Lamb told me that he had been introduced to me, by <persRef
								ref="davis-garrett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Garrett
								Davis</persRef> of Kentucky, and that he came to enquire to whom he
							must apply to obtain a called meeting of the National Institute— I
							mentioned to him, <persRef ref="markoe-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Francis Markoe</persRef>, the corresponding Secretary,
							and enquired for what purpose he wanted a special meeting of the
							Institute— He said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>of the State
							of Missouri had the finest collection of Mammoth bones in the world, and
							of the largest size— He was desirous to dispose of them, and there had
							been some overtures for the purchase of them by the Institute— He wished
							for the special meeting to ascertain what would be their final
							determination concerning it— I asked him what would be the price
							demanded for them— He said about 5000 dollars. I thought the funds of
							the Institute would not warrant them in making this purchase now.— I
							wrote to <persRef ref="juliusprattandco">Mess<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Julius Pratt and Co.</persRef> of Meriden Connecticut,
							and enclosed the Letter to <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">M<hi

							Commissioner of Patents, requesting him to forward it to them— I took
							the Cane with the Card and the Letters to the Patent Office and there

							left them all with the Chief Clerk. <persRef ref="carleton-h">M<hi

						<p><persRef ref="todson-george">Doctor Todsen</persRef> called upon me this
							morning, as usual once a quarter, for literary conversation, and to ask
							a loan of my Letters on Silesia— The weather has again changed to a mild
							type, and I walked for exercise to the Capitol— I went to the Office of
							the Secretary of the Senate, and enquired for the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of the American Archives, to a
							copy of which I am entitled, as an Ex-President of the United States—
								<persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickins</persRef> the Secretary of the Senate, found the book, and
							promised to send it to me, apologising for not having sent it before— I
							went to the Librarian of the House of Representatives, and enquired for
							the set of Documents of the first Session of the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress which should come to me from
							that office— After some enquiry, I found that they had not been sent
							because he had not yet received the Senate Documents of that
							Session—from the Book-binder.— But he promised to procure and send them
							to me— At the Post Office of the house, I took a bundle of covers of
							Letters, and at the document room the sheets numbered from 26 to 29. of
							the Journal of the House of the late Session, and N. 11. of the Senate
							Journal— As I was coming out from the Capitol I met the Daguerrotype
							printer <persRef ref="edwards-jonas">Edwards</persRef> who invited me
							into the Committee-room of which he has had the use and shewed me a
							number of the Portraits recently taken among which two of the new
								<persRef ref="polk-james">President Polk</persRef>—one in a
							breast-pin reduced from the other, and bespoken for <persRef
								ref="polk-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Polk</persRef>. On
							returning from my walk I was somewhat exhausted, and suppose the walk to
							and from the Capitol more than suits my years— There was a fire which
							consumed a dwelling house before daylight this morning, and two alarms
							this evening.— <persRef ref="campbell-archibald">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Campbell</persRef> came in at tea time and passed the
							evening here— Shortly before 9. O’Clock, I went with <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Adams</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef>, to an evening party given by <persRef

								Heiskell</persRef> daughter of <persRef ref="monroe-maria">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> S. L. Gouverneur</persRef>, and a
							granddaughter of <persRef key="monroe-james">President Monroe</persRef>—
							The company was curiously composed of families going out of Offices, and
							families coming in to take their places— There was the new Secretary of
							War <persRef ref="marcy-william">Marcy</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="wilkins-charles">son</persRef> of the late <persRef
								ref="wilkins-william">Secretary Wilkins</persRef> who with the
								<persRef ref="wilkins-matilda">rest of his family</persRef> left the

							Postmaster at Baltimore We came home soon after 11.</p>

						<p>The spring has returned with the warmth of summer, and I had no fire made
							in my writing chamber this day.— Morning visit from <persRef
								ref="heap-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heap</persRef>,
							heretofore Consul of the United States at Tunis; afterwards Dragoman of
							the Mission to Constantinople, and now a Solicitor for restoration to
							his Office at Tunis— Conversation with him. Anodyne— <persRef
								ref="bodisko-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bodisco</persRef> the Russian Minister said to me last evening,
								<persRef ref="peel-robert">Sir Robert Peel</persRef> adds 6000
							Seamen to the British Navy for the service of the present year, and
							raises the estimates for the navy to the round sum of seven millions
							sterling 35 millions of dollars— That is for your special benefit— He
							takes your occupation of Texas very quietly—but he will send a large
							naval, force into the pacific, and then if you touch Monterey, War,
							universal War will blaze out— Whereupon I observe 1. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bodisco, blows the coals. 2. He has no
							objection to the annexation of Texas to the United States— He said
							laughing that Russia, herself in the habit of taking ten times the
							amount of Texas, could not object to that measure, but the main point
							was to do it in a genteel way—and the inconceivable thing to him was
							that with the measures of Congress for the annexation of Texas, there
							was not a dollar of additional expense appropriated, in preparation for
							War. <persRef ref="skinner-john">J. S. Skinner</persRef> told me last
							Night that when I was President, and he was Postmaster at Baltimore he
							had written and published in the Newspaper sundry pieces against me,
							till he was told that I had heard of it, and after enquiring whether he
							faithfully performed the duties of his office, and being answered that
							he did, had said—then tell him he may write against me, as much, and as
							often as he pleases— Skinner added that from that day he never published
							or wrote a line against me— The rumours now are that <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> has consulted his cabinet on the
							principle of political proscription— That <persRef ref="buchanan-james2"
								>Buchanan</persRef>, <persRef ref="walker-robert">Walker</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="mason-john5">Mason</persRef> were against it— <persRef
								ref="marcy-william">Marcy</persRef>, <persRef ref="bancroft-george"
								>Bancroft</persRef> and <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> for it—and that Polk himself decided for the turn
							out.— The morning of this day was absorbed in finishing a Letter to
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, which I had begun
							last Evening. I took my twilight walk over the Tyber to the Potomac
							Bridge and thence returning over the central market bridge— <persRef
								ref="campbell-archibald">Campbell</persRef> spent the Evening here—
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">Captain Tyler’s</persRef> pocket veto upon
							the Harbour Bill, turned him out of Office at Pittsburgh, as a civil
							engineer, but the new Secretary of War Marcy has promised him a place in
							the Department here.— The practical distribution of my time falls yet
							far short of my resolutions in advance, and my arrears of correspondence
							increase instead of diminishing.— “Video meliora, probo que.”</p>

								Lewis</persRef> the contractor with this Government for the supply

							and invited me to inspect in the basement Story of the Patent Office,
							the new apparatus of Light house lamps invented in France by <persRef
								ref="fresnel-augustin">Fresnel</persRef> and imported from France by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis himself— I went accordingly,
							and saw three of the four Classes of refracting glasses substituted in
							the place of the old semispherical metallic reflectors— The Lamps are of
							brass the machinery for circulating the oil, and preserving the proper
							measure of the wicks curious and complicated— The polyzonal lenses round
							which a frame horizontally revolves with a similar denticulated glass of
							smoky crimson colour <hi rend="strikethrough">revolves</hi> forms a
							column of splendid light which must be seen to be understood. The four
							classes are graduations of the size of the lenses the largest of which
							are in 8 concentric circles— The smallest of the four is of the size
							introduced at the entrance of Boston Harbour— I agreed with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis to go and see one lighted up next
							Monday evening at 7. O’Clock.— Fresnel first published a notice of this
							invention by a Memoir read before the Academy of Sciences at Paris Sur
							un nouveau systeme d’Eclairage des Phares, in 1822. It has now been
							introduced in all the maritime countries of Europe. <persRef

							at the system of proscription from Executive Offices upon which <persRef
								ref="polk-james">President Polk</persRef> has commenced, and which
							threatens to be far more extensive than any that has ever before been
							carried through— I wrote three short Letters—one to the <persRef

								>John Adams</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-john22">John Adams

								ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef>
							preached from Revelation 3.20. [“]Behold, I stand at the door, and
							knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
							him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Knox observed that the instructions of the Christian Gospel
							were given not in the form of one continuous dissertation connected
							together as one system, but were scattered abroad in detached sentences,
							and varieties of figurative language conveying the most important truths
							in lively and striking imagery— The text is a part of the address of the
							holy Spirit, in the Vision of the beloved Apostle, to the Church of
							Laodicea— He complains of their indifference— Neither hot nor cold— Of
							their spiritual pride, self-delusion and self-conceit He tells them that
							he rebukes and chastens those whom he loves; and exhorts them to zeal
							and repentance— Then he summons their attention to himself— Behold— I
							stand at the door and knock— A free, friendly and gracious invitation to
							partake of the blessings of the gospel, likened to the intimate
							endearing enjoyments of familiar hospitality, given and received. In the
							next verse he promises to the believer glory and power— He that
							overcometh shall sit with him on his throne; as he sits with the father
							on his throne; and he closes with a solemn call on him that hath an ear,
							to hear what the Spirit saith to the churches— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Knox exerted himself even beyond his usual animation in his
							appeal to Sinners to open the door to the Saviour as he knocks, and
							respond to his gracious invitation. The <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>President</persRef> and <persRef ref="polk-sarah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Polk</persRef> were present, and in
							my pew were a stranger man, three Ladies and two small children— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring dined with us, and shortly before
							four O’Clock left us, to take passage at half past 5. in the railway
							Cars for Baltimore intending to stop this night at the Relay house, 9
							miles on this side of that city, and to proceed to-morrow to Cumberland
							to visit the coal mine or mountain of that region— After dinner I
							attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church where M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>read the evening service for the first
							Sunday after Easter— (The 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Lesson is the
							awful 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of 1. Corinthians upon
							the Resurrection of the body,) and preached from Revelation 3.1. “And
							unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that
							hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works
							that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. 2. Be watchful and
							strengthen the things which remain; that are ready to die: for I have

						<p>I became immersed this morning in the annual report of the Commissioner
							of the Patent Office <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">Henry L.
								Ellsworth</persRef>; a document which he has rendered so interesting
							that at the recent Session of Congress, the house ordered 25000 extra
							copies of it to be printed for circulation by the members— He has for a
							succession of years been improving it from year to year, till it now
							forms a volume of 500 pages, and a calendar of mechanical and
							agricultural inventions and discoveries, more sought after than any
							other annual document published by Congress— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ellsworth has turned the Patent Office from a mere gimcrack
							shop into a great and highly useful public establishment. Yet there has
							been from the day of <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk’s</persRef>
							inauguration to the present a report in circulation that he has been or
							is from this day to be removed, and that <persRef ref="burke-edmund4"
								>Edmund Burke</persRef> or <persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin">Benjamin
								F. Bidlack</persRef> is to be appointed in his place.— I read the
							report this morning— It consumed an hour of time, and diverted me from
							my prescribed and appropriate employment— Further it seduced me to turn
							over for another hour and more the subsequent pages, and the appendix to
							the report. As I proceeded I found continual instigation to further
							enquiry, and was finally obliged to break off so as not to lose the
							whole day— Another digression was occasioned by <persRef
								ref="lewis-isaiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I. W. P.
								Lewis</persRef>, who sent me a bound book and two large pamphlets
							upon the subject of Light-houses— One of the pamphlets is in French, an

							et Fanaux des Cotes de France—published by the Ministére des Travaux
							Publics— Administration Générale des Ponts et Chaussées et des Mines—
							The English pamphlet is the Article Sea-Lights in the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica
							by <persRef ref="stevenson-alan2">Alan Stevenson</persRef>— These works
							give full and minute accounts of the modern improvements in the

							machinery of <persRef ref="fresnel-augustin">Augustin Fresnel</persRef>
							substituted almost universally on the coast of France and very
							extensively in Great Britain for the previous, hemispherical metallic
							catoptrical reflectors used for lighthouses— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lewis sent me word just at dark this Evening, that it was so
							damp with a prospect of rain that he should postpone lighting up his
							lenticular lantern to another evening of which he would give me notice.
