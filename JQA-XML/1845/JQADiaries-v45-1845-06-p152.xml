                                Lunt’s</persRef> text this morning was from 1. John 4.20. [“]If a
                            man say I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that
                            loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he
                            hath not seen?” This first epistle of John in five chapters, is devoted
                            entirely to the establishment of the doctrine 1. That God is Light and
                            God is love. 2 That Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and was sent to die
                            as a propitiation for the sins of the whole world 3. That as God loved
                            us, so we ought to love one another 4. That righteousness of life is the
                            only test by which we can prove our love of God, and our obedience to
                            his will— In the verses preceding the text it is said 15. Whosoever
                            shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he
                            in God. 16. And we have known, and believed the love that God hath to
                            us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God
                            in him.— and the verse immediately succeeding the text is 21. And this
                            commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother
                            also.— The 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse of the 5<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of this epistle is claimed by
                            the believers in the doctrine of the Trinity, as proof unanswerable of
                            its Truth— The words are “For there are three that bear record in
                            Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are
                            one” It is strange that such a doctrine as that of the Trinity in unity
                            should have been ever held upon so slender a foundation; in a
                            composition so absolutely figurative— But this verse has been detected
                            as unquestionably an interpolation— In this epistle is also Ch. 1. v. 8.
                            The first introductory sentence of the Episcopalian prayer book, If we
                            say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
                            &amp;c— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt administered the communion,
                            with less of profound sensibility than usual, and there was less of
                            peculiar aptitude to the occasion in his discourse than I have witnessed
                            heretofore— He announced the accession of two married women to the
                            church as participants at this communion— The preacher of this afternoon
                            was the <persRef ref="pike-richard">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
                                Richard Pike</persRef> of Dorchester; and his text was from Luke
                            7.50. And he said to the woman, “Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
                            peace.” He had declared her sins, which he said were many, forgiven— He
                            was dining with a pharisee, whose other guests were astounded at his
                            pretension to forgive sins, and he pronounced it as a reward for her
                            faith— He also declared the sins of the man sick of the palsy to be
                            forgiven and being therefor charged with blasphemy, healed the man of
                            his palsy by a word, and then appealed to the by-standers to say which
                            was easiest—to say thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say arise and walk.—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pike’s discourse was upon Faith— A
                            sensible dissertation, well written in a calm and temperate style, and
                            rather frigidly delivered. He is a young man—not a graduate of
                            Cambridge— The Steamer Britannia, <persRef ref="hewitt-john"
                                >Hewitt</persRef> departed this morning for Liverpool, and the

                            at 9 this Evening— Left Liverpool 20. May— I saw the Sun rise and set

                            married to his Sister Mary Ann— It is dated in January last, professes
                            to be very kind, and affectionate, and gives him information about many
                            of his relatives, but says not one word about his maternal grandfather
                                <persRef ref="u">Collins</persRef>, or about the property left by
                            him. Freeman has written to him twice since he received this Letter but
                            has no answer.— He has some suspicion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Mathers— Thinks it strange that his Sister did not herself write to him—
                            I advised him to write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mathers once
                            more, and to address to him special enquires concerning M<hi

                            he supposed he could do at little or no expence, as he could work his

                            came in— The Doctor was anxious to know what had been done in Congress
                            at Washington with the Memorials of the American statistical association
                            and the Massachusetts Medical Society concerning the errors in the
                            returns of the sixth census of 1840.— I told him how the memorials had
                            been treated— At the first Session of the last Congress referred to a
                            select Committee which—on the last day of the Session reported that they
                            had not had time to investigating the subject— At the second Session
                            referred to a select committee of which I was chairman, but of which I
                            was never to obtain a quorum— A false and prevaricating report from

                        <p>In the heat of the day yesterday, I exchanged my velvet waistcoat lined
                            with flannel, for a cotton summer vest, and this morning I arose with a
                            severe lumbago, which continued through the day, and confined me chiefly
                            to the house; though the weather was fair and warm with a brisk breeze—
                            I had no spirit for labour, and coasted in idleness the precious time—
                            By some constraint upon myself I was enabled to get through with the
                            journal of yesterday, and to copy a list of names of persons to whom I
                            am to send public documents— I visited my seedling plants, and made
                            fruitless efforts to observe for some useful purpose the process of
                            vegetation— Last October <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef>
                            transplanted for me from the Nursery to the Seminary a seedling shagbark
                            walnut tree, about nine years old 7. feet 4 inches high. The stem 3
                            inches in circumference near the ground— Straight 3 feet 3 inches before
                            branching out— Then putting out thirteen branches of different growth to
                            the top of the stem each with a germinating bud at the end of the
                            branch, and one on the top of the stem, of different sizes oviform and
                            the largest nearly of the size of a hen’s egg.— When I first came home
                            on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of May I found this tree with all
                            the buds full and swollen, but not one of them open— So they remained
                            four weeks till the last of May, and I feared that the tree by
                            transplantation had lost its vegetative power.— Since then all the buds
                            have been slowly opening and unfolding themselves, a process not yet
                            completed. The two sets of external scales or petals separate and peel
                            back, like the opening of a rose bud and disclose from 3 to 7 slender
                            stalks each with 3 or 5 leaflets rolled round itself, which when
                            disengaged from its prison bounds expands into the broad leaf of the
                            tree— I see the maternal care of nature in keeping these nascent leaves
                            sheltered from the frosts of May, and I see its necessity manifested in
                            the perished stem of one second years seedling, which came up
                            prematurely, and in the scorched leaves and strangled vegetation of
                            several others— <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux</persRef>
                            supposes that the peeling off of the external scales of the shagbark
                            walnut bulb, is the origin of the peculiarity of the tree in shedding
                            its bark. I have other seedlings, apples, pears, peaches coming up, but
                            have no confidence in their continued growth and heed them very little—
                            Some of the budded trees are doing well— All the peach trees are
                            perishing, and from some unknown cause all the button wood trees
                            throughout the country are slowly dying— My Grandson <persRef

                            in the preparation of a preface to the republication of my antimasonic
                            Letters— During the heated controversy from 1827 to 1835 concerning the
                            order and Institution of Free-Masonry, very little notice was taken of
                            any other secret Society— The result of that contest in this
                            Commonwealth was a Law prohibiting on severe penalties, the
                            administration of secret Oaths— There was no express abolition of the
                            order of Free-Masons. But as an affiliated Society they were broken up,
                            and most of the lodges throughout the State voluntarily dissolved
                            themselves.— But they retained their organization, continued to hold in
                            Boston their secret meetings, and occasionally to admit new members to
                            their sublime-ridiculous rites and ceremonies.— Within the last two or
                            three years they have been again creeping out of their crevices and
                            hiding places, and courting public notice and applause. But besides the
                            order of Masons, a new Order has presented itself under the burlesque
                            appellation of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.— They have adopted
                            most of the mummeries, some of the bombastic titles, and some of the
                            foolish trivial obligations of the Free-Masons— Of this order as a
                            secret Society I knew nothing, nor of their connection with
                            Free-Masonry, till, I was applied to for the republication of my
                            Anti-masonry; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gassett has furnished

                        <p>After a painful and almost sleepless night I flattered myself this
                            morning and through the day that my complaint was subsiding— It was only
                            because the atmosphere was cool, almost cold, the morning cloudy and
                            with a delusive promise of rain— My morning exercise became all but
                            impracticable by the loss of the command of my own limbs; the
                            observation of the rising and setting Sun, disconcerted, all my
                            instinctive habits dislocated, and my order of time subverted, the day
                            serves me for little more than to bemoan my own condition.— <persRef

                            his oft repeated proposition to purchase a strip of my land adjoining
                            his and near his house to give him the command of a passage way across
                            which he had erected bars— He complained that <persRef

                            and scattered his rails and thrown them over the wall. Harvey denies his

                            and its purposes.— It is a secret affiliated Society, apparently
                            existing in every part of the civilized world with most of the
                            properties and pretensions of Free-Masonry— It was founded in
                            Massachusetts on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1820. by

                            until the explosion of 1832. when this order was prostrated together
                            with that of Free-masonry— In June (22) 1841. Massachusetts Lodge N. 1.
                            was reorganized, and there are now under the Grand Lodge of
                            Massachusetts 68 subordinate Lodges and upwards of 6000 members. In
                            Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island there are Grand
                            Lodges Encampments, and subordinate Lodges of the same Institution, and

                            three or four faint flashes of lightning and the rumbling of distant
                            thunder, and the sky cleared up for an intensely warm and dry day—

                                Lunt</persRef> preached at home, all day— His morning text was from
                            John 4.48. [“]Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders,
                            ye will not believe.” This is the same chapter in which is told the
                            revelation by Jesus of himself as the Messiah, to the woman of Samaria,
                            at <persRef ref="jacob">Jacob’s</persRef> Well.— He was going from Judea
                            through Samaria to Galilee, because he knew that the pharisees heard
                            that he made and baptized more disciples than <persRef
                                ref="johnthebaptist">John</persRef>— He was travelling on foot with
                            his disciples which of them we are not told, and reached the well, at
                            Sychar, weary, exhausted and thirsty, and was sitting on the well, when
                            the woman came up to draw water— The disciples had gone away to the city
                            to buy meat— He was alone with the woman, and asked her to give him to
                            drink.— She asks him, how he, a Jew, dares ask her, a Samaritan woman,
                            to give him drink— How she knew that Jesus was a Jew, is not told, but a
                            main object of his mission was to break down that deadly barrier of
                            hatred between the people of the two kingdoms, into which the children
                            of Israel had divided themselves— He was to restore harmony between them
                            and bring them all back to one fold— He tells her of this purpose, and
                            that he is the Messiah.— He makes an occasion to shew that he knows her
                            whole history—that she has had five husband, and is living with a man
                            not her husband—whereupon she concludes him to be a prophet and
                            announces him to the city as the Messiah— Thus introduced he discourses
                            to the Samaritans in the city, and in the course of two days, converts
                            many Samaritans to the faith, by his word— He thence passes into Galilee
                            where he performs the miracle of healing the nobleman’s son, distant a
                            day’s journey from him, rather to relieve the nobleman’s distress for
                            his Son, than to display the manifestation of his miraculous power—for

                            healing word— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon text was
                            from 1. Thessalonians 5.23. “And the very God of Peace sanctify you
                            wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
                            blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” From this text M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt deduced his favourite doctrine that
                            for the whole sanctification of the Christian, his religion must be
                            under the harmonious guidance of reason, feeling and will—the whole
                            spirit soul and body— After the service, I rode with <persRef

                        <p>The Summer has set in, with heat so intense that it has scarcely left me
                            the power of action— Yesterday morning there was a very heavy thunder
                            shower at Boston, with a cooling draught for the thirsty earth— Only a
                            few drops of it reached us here—followed by a parching Sun, which
                            continued all through the day,—partially subsided at night—blazed out
                            again this morning and shows no abatement at Night.— My Lumbago has
                            relaxed its severity leaving with great exertion the power to write, but
                            continued disability to read and almost total extinction of the power of
                            observation, and of reflection, so that I remember nothing that I read.—

                            University— 16 since I lost my beloved and unfortunate Son— I had almost
                            forgotten Briggs and the affectionate attachment which had subsisted
                            between my son and him— The sight of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Briggs who appears to be a man of the most respectable standing, and of
                            his two modest and blooming daughters, called up recollections, which I
                            must suppress, and opened wounds which this world can never heal— I got
                            through the journal of yesterday, despatched to my granddaughter

                            essence— He was the only member of the U.S. Senate who dared to meet and
                            resist the Slave domination of the South, and he was supplanted in his

                        <p>I rose at 3. O’Clock this morning, and looked out from my North and East
                            windows for the comet announced by a short paragraph in the Boston
                            Courier of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> signed <persRef
                                ref="bond-william">B.</persRef> as having been seen at 2. O’Clock in
                            the Morning of that day, at the Observatory in Cambridge— On the same
                            day, it was announced in the Washington Newspapers, by <persRef
                                ref="page-thomas">Professor Page</persRef>, in the absence of
                                <persRef ref="maury-matthew2">Lieutenant Maury</persRef>, as having
                            been seen at the Observatory there. In a subsequent notice of B. (M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond) in the Boston Courier, he states the
                            place of the Comet to be in a line between the Stars Capella and Algol.
                            This last I recognized this morning, and not with equal certainty
                            Capella; but not the Comet The dawn had commenced, and I had no glass.—
                            The appearance of this Comet just at this time, and the simultaneous and
                            immediate notice of it at the two observatories of Washington and of
                            Cambridge, have given me a pleasure all my own; for no other person will
                            understand or sympathise with it— This was a blazing hot and scorching
                            day.— My Sciatica, was slowly and gradually subsiding, and I was
                            thinking much of the day where I should look for that poetical tour de
                            force, the French Rondeau— Pour te guérir de cette Sciatique— Time
                            wasted— But in my wanderings round my library, I pitched upon a
                            beautifully printed duodecimo volume of upwards of 900 pages; two
                            hundred years old, within 3.—on handsome paper, a fine type, an <persRef

                            United Netherlands— Of this man I can find no other trace, But Salmasius
                            tells him in the dedication that this work was composed at his request,
                            upon a conversation with him a year before at the Hague— There is a
                            preface to the reader of 98. pages, a synopsis of the work of 20 pages
                            and 844 pages of the work itself, all in elegant Latin— I translate a
                            passage from the second page of the preface, thus “There is nothing in
                            which men, by no means fools indulge and flatter themselves more
                            licentiously than in the divination of futurity, and hence it is that
                            they flock with such eagerness to every mountebank who professes the
                            art; and lavish all sorts of favour on those who feed them with its
                            delusive promises— And as if they were or knew something more than is
                            given to mortals to know, they call them divines, because the
                            foreknowledge of future events is a part of divinity— This faculty
                            belongs to God alone, and can be possessed by no mortal unless bestowed
                            by him— Which is so intensely desired by multitudes ever spurred by
                            curiosity that it is no wonder if many pretend to a perfect knowledge of
                            that of which they are entirely ignorant.[”] (The close to-morrow—)— I

                        <p>Yesterday was perhaps the hottest day of this year. In the Night a total
                            change of the atmosphere occurred and this morning before Sunrise,
                            commenced a gentle sprinkling of rain which continued with little
                            intermission till noon.— The closing sentence of that passage in the
                            preface of <persRef ref="saumaise-claude">Salmasius</persRef> to his
                            book de annis climactericis is a sentiment so just, expressed in Latin
                            so elegant that I copy it here in the original as an observation upon
                            human nature worthy of <persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef>— “Nam
                            falli volentibus nunquam desunt et fallere parati, praecipue si operae
                            pretium facturi sunt qui stulta aliorum credulitate abutuntur ad
                            compendium suum.” For willing dupes never fail to find ready knaves
                            especially when they can turn fraud to their own profit.— Salmasius was
                            the adversary of <persRef ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> in the
                            controversy between <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles the first</persRef>
                            and the English People. Milton charged him with bad Latin for using the
                            word persona, for person pretending that it was Latin only for a mask.
                            Milton was wrong—the use of the word persona for person was strictly
                            classical. Salmasius defended it, with authorities <persRef
                                ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Johnson</persRef> in his Life of Milton says not so good as one that
                            he gives— But Johnson charges Milton himself with bad Latin for using
                            the word vapulandum which he says can never be derived from vapulo,
                            which has a passive sense— Salmasius and Milton were learned Latin
                            scholars— Johnson was not and his critique was conceited
                            ignorance—vapulandum was as good a Latin word as recubans— At 11.
                            O’Clock I went with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> to
                            Boston— Stop’d at the house of <persRef ref="davis-john">judge
                                Davis</persRef>, to whom I took the pamphlet Sessions copies of the

                            that of the last, being the second Session of the 28<hi

                            the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I have not been able to find. The
                            judge was gone out of town, and I left the books at his house— I called

                            and which the boys says keeps time well—but he forgot to give me the
                            key, and I did not perceive that it was missing.— There was an alarm of
                            fire and a bustle of Engines running to and fro in the Streets—only a
                            chimney. I went to Charles’s house— All dark. <persRef

                        <p>My Sciatica continues gradually to subside without external application
                            or internal medicine— It leaves me to the command of my own time, but
                            not to the controul of my own indolence. The rain of yesterday gave an
                            impulse to vegetation, which I was stimulated to observe but with the
                            discouragement of reflecting that all my observations upon vegetation,
                            which for the last 20 years I have perseveringly pursued, are barren.—

                            the ground— The vegetation of the Shagbark walnut, in its early stages
                            deserves profound study and the inventive faculty— Two shoots of the
                            second year which came up since 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> May,

                            Their first developement frost bitten. A new central shoot beginning to
                            be seen. The tree 8 or 9 years old transplanted last October from the
                            Nursery to the Seminary, has opened 14 large buds—10 at the ends of the
                            branches, and 1. at the top of the stem. Each opened bud throws up from
                            4 to 7. stalks each with 3 or 5 leafets now in the process of
                            developement— Obviously checked, and retarded by the drought. My other
                            seedlings and buds scarcely deserve a passing notice— My peach trees are
                            a desolation— One white hart cherry bud, has nearly overgrown the
                            mazzard stock and bears a half gallon of sickly looking cherries. The
                            Bartlett Pear buds grow so as to threaten to break down the Stock— My

                            complicated as that of the United States of America as the organization
                            of a Moschito is more complicated than that of a man. After dinner I

                            this afternoon with <persRef ref="curtis-anna2">his wife</persRef>— He
                            is a native of Randolph born when it was a part of the town of
                            Braintree; but not old enough to remember when it was set off and
                            incorporated as a separate town— He left it in 1807. and went to
                            Dartmouth College— He has never since returned to reside there, but has
                            now been on a visit to his relatives and friends, and being on his

                            I returned my thanks.— In visiting my seedling plants I found one more

                            adjoining the garden— This shoot is the fourth in that enclosure— There
                            is yet one more to come up. I found also several other traces of fresh
                            vegetation—</p>

                        <p>I received this morning a small pamphlet entitled “The Elements of
                            Constitutional Law[”] by <persRef ref="raymond-daniel">Daniel

                            blank leaf preceding the title page, written “The author requests M<hi

                            book.” A request to be taken ad referendum— I received also a Letter
                            from my Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine
                                Adams</persRef> at Lenox. At 11. O’Clock, I left my house with
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>. A heavy rain
                            commenced as we set out—and poured till we reached his office in Boston
                            and an hour longer. I stop’d a few minutes at <persRef ref="raymond-fc"
                                >Raymond’s</persRef> shop 229. Washington Street, for a watch key.
                            He had found the one that I had left there and which he had forgotten to
                            return with the watch; but its pipe was split, and I could not wait to
                            take another— I left the watch with him again— At 2. <persRef

                            we rode to <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Peter C. Brooks’s</persRef> at Medford, and dined with the Trustees
                            of the agricultural Society—and as in the margin— <persRef

                            was one of the persons who dined with <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
                                >General Andrew Jackson</persRef> at my house on the 4<hi

                            this day told my Son, he perfectly recollected, and that he was seated
                            next to Jackson at the table— The weather was so unfavourable that I had
                            no opportunity for visiting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks’s
                            garden. At about 6. O’Clock we left his house, and came through Boston
                            without stopping and reached home at Quincy just after 8— This is by the
                            Massachusetts Register the first day of the summer Solstice, which
                            continues the Sun rising at 4.27. and setting at 7.33. till the 28<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> This reckoning is from the appearance
                            and disappearance of the centre of the Sun’s disk. The Calendar of the
                            American Almanac reckons from the appearance of the first to the
                            disappearance of the last ray of the Sun’s disk, and makes allowances
                            for refraction and parallax. It reduces the solstice to four days, from
                            this to the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inclusive. Fixing Sun rise
                            at 4.22 and Sunset at 7.38. Making the longest days of 15 hours and 16
                            minutes—of course ten minutes longer than that of the Massachusetts
                            Register— The first volumes of the American Almanac gave the rising and
                            setting of the Sun as is yet done in the Massachusetts Register. The
                            corrections for refraction and parallax were introduced in 1835, and
                            announced in the preliminary observations on the astronomical department
                            in the almanac of 1836.</p>

                                Lunt’s</persRef> morning text was from Colossians 1.16. “For by him
                            were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth,
                            visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
                            principalities, or power; all things were created by him, and for him.
                            17. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” M<hi

                            can I— But I wish I could satisfy my own mind of any possible
                            construction of those words, and of those of the first chapter of the
                            Epistle to the Hebrews, to refute those whose faith in the godhead of
                            Christ is pinned upon them.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
                            supposed that all material substances, the globe of earth itself might
                            by the power of God be subtilized into invisible spirit, and yet retain
                            its properties as an earthly globe— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
                            understands this creation of all things by Christ as spoken only of the

                            sin— As God he is eternal— As the Son of God he is begotten— As man he
                            is born but not like other men—his conception, his birth, his life, his
                            death are all miraculous— His resurrection is of the body— He eats

                            would not go back without seeing old John Quincy Adams, for that was the

                            went and settled in the State of Maine though at a distance of 100 miles
                            of each other— Both have been successful in acquiring property and a

                            seedling and budded trees.— He gave me some advice for the management of
                            them, but little encouragement for the future growth of the transplanted

                        <p><date>17. III.30. </date>Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after I rose this morning I was suddenly seized with a return
                            of the Sciatica, which I flattered myself had passed away— This attack
                            was more severe than the former one; kept me in severe pain the whole
                            day—disabled me for writing so that it was with the utmost difficulty
                            that I got through the record of the day before. I was compelled to
                            resort to the girdle of cotton matting which had been made for me, but
                            which I had dispensed with wearing hitherto.— Just before I rose there
                            had been thunder and lightening and a heavy shower of rain which still
                            continued— The sky then cleared off and a cold brisk breeze from the
                            Northwest blew, and searched my reins for the remainder of the day— Yet
                            I strolled about my nursery, garden and seminary to observe the progress
                            of vegetation on my seedling trees. In the centre of the Seminary is a
                            white-hart cherry, budded upon a mazzard stock— It has been ten years
                            there, and the bud has not yet entirely overgrown the stock— It bore
                            last year about half a dozen cherries, and has now upon it perhaps
                            fifty— In the course of half an hour this morning I saw a Robin, a
                            Catbird, and a blue-bird successively fly up to the tree, near the top,
                            and regale themselves upon the reddening and ripening fruit— They will
                            leave none to be gathered; but they want the cherries more than I. Half
                            way between that tree and my window is the transplanted shagbark, the
                            buds of which have been opening nosegays of spreading cinque-foil leaves
                            upon lengthening stalks— I saw by the morning newspapers that the
                            schooner Columbia <persRef ref="u">Captain Knapp</persRef> arrived
                            yesterday from Alexandria, with a Trunk ship’d by <persRef

                            we were informed that <persRef ref="greenleaf-lucy">M<hi

                            suffering. Here Miss Smith alighted and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
                                >Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> took her place in the barouche; we
                            rode to Germantown; then returned to M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
                            Adams’s left Elizabeth and took up Miss Smith— We left M<hi

                            and sent back the barouche for her— After tea, I walked home with
                            Arthur; and his father came and spent the evening with me— I read this
                            day in the Charleston Mercury of 9. 10 and 11. June three Letters from
                                <persRef ref="hammond-james">James H. Hammond</persRef> an

                        <p>A sleepless and very painful Night. I was obliged to suspend my washing
                            and horse-hair friction almost entirely, but had an easier day than
                            yesterday. I received a Letter from <persRef

                            to come from New-York by the Long Island Rail-road next Saturday. I sent
                                <persRef ref="fuller-gardiner">Fuller</persRef> to Boston, and he
                            brought out the trunk which had arrived from Washington in the Schooner

                            among the rest the beans, a bag of which I brought with me from
                            Washington. I neglected to measure the exact quantity of them before
                            they were sown. They are up very thick in five rows in a lot fenced off
                            in the pasture below the orchard.— Towards Sunset I walked up the hill,
                            where I found <persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            at 6 O’Clock in the Evening, of old age— They were two of the bitterest
                            enemies I have had to encounter in this life— Whitney because I exposed
                            him as a villain— Jackson because I saved him from disgrace, and
                            infamy.— Whitney was a swindler of uncommon talents, and pandered to

                            he gave him an office from which the Senate ejected him. Jackson was a
                            hero, a murderer, an adulterer, and a profoundly pious presbyterian, who
                            in the last days of his life belied and slandered me before the world,
                            and died in full confidence that his sins were pardoned by the atoning
                            blood of the Saviour— Whitney as a common place knave will be forgotten
                            now he is dead, but the welkin rings with tolling bells, and minute
                            guns, and funeral eulogies, and vociferous lamentations for the departed

                            came home yesterday, and has this day a holiday, for the great festival
                            pageant of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The resurrection of
                            Freemasonry, strip’d of some of its abominations, and professing to be
                            devoted to Friendship, Love, and Truth.— An Oration in Faneuil Hall by

                            swarming from all the lodges of the Land, formed on Boston Common and

                            Odd Fellows— I told him that <persRef ref="gassett-henry">M<hi

                            other Gentlemen had applied to me by personal interview last Fall
                            requesting my consent to the publication at their expence of a new
                            pamphlet edition of all my writings relating to the Anti-masonic
                            controversy; these gentlemen had been ardent antimasons, and
                            conscientiously believing the institution of Freemasony vicious and
                            mischievous, they had zealously pursued their opposition to it, until a
                            Law of the Commonwealth prohibited the administration of secret Oaths—
                            It broke up for the time, the Order of Free-Masons in Massachusetts, and
                            the Order of Odd fellows a spurious breed from the same Stock sunk with
                            it.— They were suppressed, but not extinguished, and after an interval
                            of seven years have reappeared, and are annoying the community with
                            their grotesque exhibitions and their gaudy processions— They are
                            multiplying with extraordinary rapidity, and as they openly avow that
                            secret proceedings are essential to their institution they excite fears
                            and jealousies in the portion of the community not initiated in their
                            mysteries— I mentioned M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gassett’s

                            taken a part in the celebration of yesterday, but that three other

                            said he believed those three clergymen were all Universalists— He added
                            that he knew nothing of the reasons which had induced the six unitarian
                            ministers to join the order, and had taken no interest in himself—
                            Though he had observed with much surprize the revival of the
                            institution—the affectation of publicity given to their proceedings, and

                        <p>A light shower this morning, and a heavy one this afternoon— <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> was here this morning, and I
                            had a long conversation with him upon private concerns and family
                            arrangements of deep interest to him and <persRef
                                ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4;adams-arthur;adams-mary9;adams-louisa3"
                                >his children</persRef>, and to me, and the other members of my
                            family; and on plans which we have been some time contemplating for
                            future execution. In 1837. he built a house on the hill opposite my
                            dwelling house in Quincy, where he has lived in the Summer Season with
                            his family from that time.— Its situation and prospects are exquisitely
                            beautiful; but as his family increases, its dimensions become inadequate
                            for their comfort, and the Old colony Railroad, now in the process of
                            construction from Boston to Plymouth approaches so near to it that it
                            will lose many of its comforts as a dwelling house for him and may
                            appretiate in value as an article for sale or rent— He thinks therefore
                            of building another house upon Mount Wollaston for his own Summer
                            Residence, and of taking that farm under his own management— As I daily
                            draw nearer to the close of life, a deepening concern affects me for the
                            future prospects of my posterity— Through a long, busy, and eventful
                            life, I have collected a library of great value, large for that of a
                            private citizen in this Country, and of which my Son has the means and
                            the disposition to make the most advantageous use— <persRef
                                key="adams-john">My father’s</persRef> manuscript books and papers,
                            bequeathed by him to me, and my own, little less important; those of my
                            Son, which with the divine blessing humbly and anxiously implored may
                            become equally interesting to after ages, are and will be exposed unless
                            some provision shall be made for preserving them, to the daily and
                            nightly chances and dangers of fire, in a wooden building more than 100
                            years old, amidst the perpetual fiery shower of a railroad. I have
                            therefore longed for the means of erecting a durable fire proof building
                            connected with my son’s future residence, for the preservation of this
                            library and these family vouchers and records— These purposes are as yet
                            but in embryo— The result of our conversation this day was that my Son
                            will undertake to build for himself a stone dwelling house on mount
                            Wollaston, connected with which shall be a fire proof building to
                            contain my library, and manuscript books and papers to be bequeathed to
                            him. That I will convey to him the whole Mount Wollaston Estate in fee;
                            and that this shall be received by him as an advance on his portion of
                            my Estate— Thus far for the present— And I pray that there may be no
                            vain presumption to avert the vicissitudes ordained for the condition of
                            human life by the Laws of Nature’s God, mingled up in my heart with this
                            design— Its necessary expence I hope may be defrayed by the increased
                            value of my landed Estate in Quincy to be expected from the quarries and
                            the railway— I rode this afternoon with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Miss
                                Smith</persRef> and Arthur, and took <persRef ref="sampson-rachel"
                                >Miss Samson</persRef> home to Braintree— She has been some time,

                        <p>The rhumatism hangs by me and depresses and admonishes me. And other
                            trials await me. I received a Letter from <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> at Washington,
                            written last Sunday, advising me that she proposed to leave that city on
                            her way hither, on the next Wednesday, and on Saturday, yesterday, to
                            come by the Long Island Railway from New-York to Boston— We expected and
                            waited for her Saturday Evening till eleven O’Clock—and yesterday till
                            the hour for morning service— <persRef ref="stearns-oliver">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns</persRef> of Hingham was the
                            preacher— His text was the second clause of the verse Job 5.17. Behold,
                            happy is the man whom God correcteth; therefore “despise not thou the
                            chastening of the Almighty.”— This discourse was upon the benefits of
                            affliction, and upon the duty of bearing in meekness, humility and
                            resignation the chastising hand of God.— I felt the text as applicable
                            to my own condition—labouring with disease, and disappointed in the hope
                            of receiving my wife by her still returning illness— The Stoic
                            philosophy taught the endurance of pain and suffering with Fortitude—
                            The Book of Job teaches us to bear it as chastisement from the hand of
                            God, inflicted to promote our own happiness and bids us not to despise
                            it— And this doctrine is sanctioned and enforced in the New Testament
                            Hebrews 12.5–10.— The Christian doctrine administers consolation and
                            hope and is eminently promotive of virtue. The Stoics inculcated a
                            principle contrary to nature and truth— Its argument was entirely
                            selfish, and leaned upon a broken read— It had no promise for the
                            future; no responsibility of man to his maker— The afflicted Christian
                            who follows his vocation suffers less and enjoys more than the Stoic who
                            belies his own consciousness by denying that pain is an evil. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns dined with us. I received a Letter
                            from <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, written last
                            Wednesday, the day which my wife had fixed for her departure from
                            Washington.— He says she has had one of her attacks, not so severe as
                            some that have preceded, but it has compelled her to postpone her
                            departure for some days. She will take care to have us apprized of the
                            day when she will set out. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns’s
                            afternoon text was the second clause of Luke 2:49. And he said unto
                            them, how is it that ye sought me? “Wist ye not that I must be about my
                            Father’s business?” The reason assigned by Jesus even in the age of
                            childhood for withdrawing from <persRef ref="mary;joseph5">his
                                parents</persRef>, without claiming exemption from their authority
                            was to be about his father’s business— And as his father is our father,
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns considers it as an injunction
                            of duty upon every follower of Christ to be about his father’s business—
                            I finished reading the Letters of <persRef ref="wayland-francis"
                                >President Wayland</persRef> to <persRef ref="fuller-richard">D<hi

                            of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller’s Letters in reply.— I read
                            also in the American Review for May last the critique on the Vestiges of
                            the Natural history of Creation.</p>

                            pinched me with flying pains which relaxed of their severity as the sky
                            cleared off and the atmosphere became warm and dry; but ceased not to
                            remind me of their presence— <persRef ref="thayer-henry">M<hi

                            called on me, and said that the inhabitants of that town proposed to
                            have a celebration this year, on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            July, and would be much gratified then or at any other time convenient
                            to me to have an address from me— They were both strangers to me, and
                            produced no authority or commission for their visit— I told them it
                            would give me great pleasure to address the inhabitants of Randolph and
                            especially on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July— That
                            Randolph was a part of my native town of Braintree, and although as well
                            as Quincy separated from it, for now more than half a century, I still
                            consider myself a native of the whole town of Braintree as it was at the
                            time of my birth— That labouring under a severe attack of rhumatism,
                            from which I have no hope of being wholly released before the
                            approaching 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July, I regretted that
                            it would not be in my power to speak in public at that time; but I hoped
                            that before the next Session of Congress some opportunity will present
                            itself, when I shall be able to address in person the inhabitants of
                            Randolph, as I have repeatedly done to the Inhabitants of Quincy and of
                            Braintree— They acquiesced apparently satisfied with this decision— M<hi

                            repairing of roads, building of stone fences, and railroad speculations—
                            He had also a subscription paper to procure for the singers of the first

                            have had for several years; the only complaint against which I have
                            heard is that it came at second hand from Trinity church Boston. M<hi

                        <p>The longest day of the year has passed away and henceforth the daily
                            movement of the Sun will be Southward, and the daily portion of light
                            for 6 months abridged— My disease has broken up my daily morning
                            pilgrimage up the hill to greet the rising Sun, but I still almost every
                            clear evening drag myself up to witness his setting beam.— I had a
                            morning visit from the fishmonger <persRef ref="andrews-samuel">Samuel
                                Andrews</persRef>, with his usual fare of Cod, Haddock, Halibut, and
                            Mackerel; and the unusual article of one Salmon, weighing 13 pounds— The
                            prices of Cod and Halibut have been from time immemorial 3 cents a
                            pound— Mackrel from 10 to 12 1/2 cents, haddock from 10 to 15 cents a
                            piece. The price of the Salmon was from 20 to 22 cents a pound, and
                            frequently half a dollar— There is very little difference of taste for
                            an epicure, between the halibut, the cod and the Salmon, but the relish
                            of the palate is for the costly food— I received this morning a Letter
                            from the Postmaster General <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
                                Johnson</persRef>, informing me according to his promise, that
                            application has been made to him from North-Bridgwater for the removal
                            of the Postmaster <persRef ref="southworth-edward">Edward Southworth
                                    jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef>— The complaints
                            against him are all of a party character— I immediately enclosed the
                            Letter to <persRef ref="perkins-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Jesse Perkins</persRef>, with a tender of any service in my power to
                            aid M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southworth or his friends if they
                            think proper to meet and repel the charges— I gathered the few cherries
                            left by the birds, on the small budded tree in the centre of the
                            Seminary. They are now so nearly ripe that the only way to save them
                            from human depredation in addition to that of the birds is to gather
                            them— There is a great variety of operation in the growth of my seedling
                            trees.— The aphis seizes almost all the top shoots of the apples and
                            pears and arrest at once their growth upwards— The effect of this may be
                            to strengthen the stem— The growth of the shagbark walnut is most
                            perplexing.— Its life depends upon the formation of the top bud, and
                            that is very uncertain— The second shoot from the English white Oak is
                            just showing itself, and one of the willow slips which I stuck down to
                            guard a young shagbark, has already sprouted up.— The transplanted
                            shagbark in the Seminary is in perilous condition— The developement of
                            the buds into leaves, is so slow and languid that I apprehend its
                            failure— This was the day of the celebration of the Freemason revival on
                            Bunker’s hill— An appendix to the festival of the Odd Fellows— Our
                            afternoon ride was superseded by two very heavy showers— With <persRef

                        <p>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> at Washington, dated
                            last Saturday, announcing her intention to leave that city yesterday,
                            and her wish that <persRef key="adams-charles2">our Son</persRef> would

                            I took the Letter immediately up the hill and read it to my Son, who
                            concluded to go for New-York by the Stonington Cars this afternoon—
                                <persRef ref="fuller-gardiner">Fuller</persRef> took him to Boston

                            Astronomy— He is now going to visit the high school at Philadelphia to
                            examine their telescope which has acquired some reputation, and
                            Washington to inspect the <persRef ref="fraunhofer-joseph"

                            to Free-Masonry— The order celebrated yesterday the festival of Saint
                            John at Bunker-hill in Charlestown, with all their pageantry, to the
                            number of nearly one thousand, including 75 knights templars.— The
                            Odd-fellows outnumber them ten to one, but are despised by them— This
                            tenacity of existence, and of burlesque display of magnificence, in the
                            gross imposture of Freemasonry is one of the speckeld pages of human
                            nature— Mummery and mischief under the mask of charity and benevolence
                            embrace the whole compass of Free-masonry.— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Gassett told me that it had been recently ascertained that
                                <persRef ref="arnold-benedict">Benedict Arnold</persRef> was a
                            Freemason, and he intimated a suspicion that it was under the influence
                            of Masonic obligations that he was suffered to escape, which I do not
                            believe— I read a Letter from <persRef ref="fuller-richard">D<hi

                            Slavery. This discussion has a tendency to promote the principle of
                            abolition— Fuller takes his stand upon the extreme point of his cause.
                            He deni<unclear>es</unclear> that Slavery is under all circumstances and without
                            exception a sin, and his main argument is the express authority and
                            sanction of God in the old testament, and the permission, or absence of
                            prohibition of it in the New. The reso<unclear>rt</unclear> to these arguments is the
                            most conclusive evidence of the desperation of the cau<unclear>se</unclear> itself— D<hi

                        <p>Sun rose 4:24— Set 7:40. Day, 15 hours 16 m.</p>
                        <p>I saw the Sun rise and set, clear, from <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >Charles’s</persRef> house on the hill. The pleasure that I take in
                            witnessing these magnificent phenomena of physical nature, never tires.
                            It is a part of my own nature, unintelligible to others, and I suppose a
                            singularity which I should suppress or renounce. The sensations which
                            affect me at the rising and setting Sun, are first, of Adoration to the
                            power and goodness of the creator of this wonderful universe mingled in
                            the morning with thanksgiving for the return of the great luminary of
                            heaven, the source of life and of light—in the evening with sadness at
                            the departure of this greatest of blessings, with a conscious sense of
                            the dependance of all animated nature, upon the constant beneficence of
                            the creator, and with humble supplication for forgiveness of my own
                            errors, and infirmities, and for the continuance of the never ceasing
                            bounties of the omnipotent and all seeing God— These sentiments are
                            always the same, and are rather quickened than deadened by repetition— I
                            take pleasure in indulging them, and wish that my conscience could
                            testify to the influence of these sentiments on my conduct in life— I
                            went this morning to Boston, with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.
                                Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>.— We left Miss
                            Smith at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                James H. Fosters</persRef>.— I alighted at the apartments of the
                            Massachusetts Historical Society, and attended their monthly meeting—
                            There were about 17 members in attendance— I presented to the Society
                            the Majority and Minority Reports of the Committee of the House of
                            Representatives of the United States, on the recent insurrection against
                            the Charter Government of Rhode-Island.— I offered them as a sequel to
                            the three annual reports of the <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry"
                                >Commissioner of Patents</persRef> and with a view to form a
                            collection of select Congressional Documents— A vote was passed to have
                            them bound with that title— The meeting adjourned soon after one. I then
                            stop’d at <persRef ref="raymond-fc">Raymond</persRef> the watchma shop,
                            and took the watch I had left there to be repaired— I then called at
                                <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob
                                Bigelow’s</persRef> house and consulted him respecting this thorn in
                            the flesh which nearly through this whole month has tormented me and
                            disabled me for all useful labour— I gave him an account of the symptoms
                            with which I have been afflicted, and which are constantly varying.— The
                            Doctors advice finally settled into a recommendation of a mustard
                            poultice, a remedy which I propose to postpone for the present We
                            returned home to Quincy to dine, and I suffered more pain throug this
                            day, than I have in any other day since the first attack. I attempted to
                            read <persRef ref="fuller-richard">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                        <p>Yesterday was one of the severest days of the affliction with which I
                            have been visited for nearly this whole month, and I went to bed last
                            night with gloomy forebodings of this day— This morning I rose, much
                            relieved from pain, and continued easier the whole day— I received a
                            Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
                            dated last Tuesday. She was still so feeble that she had been advised
                            not to leave Washington, that day, but she intended to start on
                            Wednesday; to stop one day—this day—at New York—to come by the Long
                            Island Railway to Boston to-morrow, and either to come out to morrow
                            evening in a hack, or to take lodging for the night at the United States
                            Hotel, and come out on Sunday morning. <persRef

                                ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> will—and a woman— I received
                            also a note from <persRef ref="colton-george">George H. Colton</persRef>
                            without date, but post marked the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            Tuesday, enclosing the proof pages of the Lecture on Society and
                            Civilization 10 pages with double columns— The note states that if
                            possible he would be glad to receive it again Thursday afternoon— I
                            immediately revised the proof and corrected at least 20 errors of the
                            press. I despatched it by this day’s mail, with the hope that M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton will receive it to-morrow morning—
                            I rode this afternoon in the barouche from 5 to 7— O’Clock with <persRef

                            by the Quincy point and Braintree roads, and went up the hill just in
                            time to miss the setting of the Sun— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Beales</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="beale-ann;beale-caroline">two daughters</persRef> were
                            there.— I came home, and was the first time for nearly a month able to
                            write an hour after the evening bell— These afternoon rides are
                            extremely pleasant to me, but they consume precious time, and nothing
                            but my suffering state of health can apologize for my self indulgence in
                            them. The lounge about my garden nursery and seminary to observe the
                            progress of vegetation in my seedling trees is time more excusably, and
                            ought to be more profitably spent— This the sixteenth Summer in
                            succession which I have passed in this house, and in which I have
                            devoted many hours to the raising of fruit and forest trees from the
                            stone the acorn and the nut— I have raised many trees, and failed to
                            raise many more— Their preservation through the first summer and winter
                            of their existence, is the principal difficulty in their cultivation and
                            transplantation is the next. The process of vegetation sometimes
                            exceedingly slow, and in other cases surprizingly rapid, baffles all
                            reasoning, and makes me feel my poverty of invention— I have now growing
                            at least 25 Shagbark walnuts, of one, two and three years growth, of
                            which it is doubtful whether they can be made to survive this Summer,
                            and the next winter— The transplanted tree in the Seminary is in the
                            semi condition, and the opening buds which had the most promising
                            appearance has been followed by a feeble and drooping developement of
                            leaves altogether discouraging.</p>

                        <p>I rose this morning relieved from all severe pain of the complaint which
                            has oppressed and disabled me, from the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            of the present month. I had no return of it this day [symbols]— I might

                                Leavitt</persRef> came out from Boston, with a young Englishman
                            named <persRef ref="u">Barrett</persRef>, who has been about two months
                            travelling in this country, and came to see me as a curiosity.— They
                            came in the 12. O’Clock Stage, with my grandson <persRef
                                ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> from school and returned by
                            the 3. O’Clock stage to Boston. They dined with us in the interval, upon
                            a tough Beef-steak and a plain flour pudding, materials perhaps
                            hereafter for a chapter in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrett’s
                            travels— He had a small album, and asked me for an autograph which I
                            gave him— I wasted hours in my Nursery, Garden and Seminary, studying
                            the progress of vegetation in my seedling trees, in vain— <persRef

                            came in and spent a silent half-hour with me— <persRef

                            returning from Boston stop’d and he spoke about one or more fishing
                            parties this summer.— I received this morning a Letter from my
                            grand-daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa-Catherine</persRef>
                            at Lenox, and at Sunset I took it up the hill to <persRef
                                ref="adams-abigail4">her mother</persRef>— There was a gentle
                            sprinkling of rain all the evening, and at the stroke of the evening
                            bell at 9. the family from Washington with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >my Son</persRef>, arrived in a Hack from Boston— <persRef

                            femme de chambre.— They came in one day—Wednesday, from Washington to
                            New-York—and this day from New-York by the Long-Island Railway to
                            Boston, and thence here— The accidents in Steamers and on Railroads are
                            so frequent and so fatal, that a load of apprehension always weighs upon
                            my spirits whenever I know that persons dear to me are travelling upon
                            them, and I speed a blessing on the moment when the journey’s end is
                            reached in safety. I am drawing to the conclusion of the Correspondence
                            between <persRef ref="wayland-francis">President Wayland</persRef>, and
                                <persRef ref="fuller-richard">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard

                            to escape from this principle indicates the last resort of the
                            Slave-holder to evade the wrath to come— There is one remark in the last
                            Letter of President Wayland, at the simplicity of which I could not
                            choose but smile— After lavishing upon his correspondent all the
                            language of endearment, and all the vocabulary of admiration on the
                            temper and talent of his correspondent’s defence of Slavery, he tells
                            him there is one thing which throughout the whole discussion he has
                            entirely forgotten or overlooked—namely the distinction between right
                            and wrong. It is so.</p>

                            preached this morning from Ecclesiastes 3.1. “To every thing there is a
                            Season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:[”]— He had given
                            out as the first hymn to be sung the 138<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            of the Christian Psalter, his compilation, and the hymn book now used in
                            our church. It was my version of the 65<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            Psalm, and no words can express the sensations with which I heard it
                            sung— Were it possible to compress into one pulsation of the heart the
                            pleasure which in the whole period, of my life I have enjoyed in praise
                            from the lips of mortal man, it would not weigh a straw to balance the
                            ecstacy of delight which streamed from my eyes, as the organ pealed and
                            the choir of voices rung the praise of almighty God from the soul of
                                <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> adapted to my native tongue by
                            me— To this thrill of rapture the composition of which I dare not
                            analyse there was one drawback— In the printed book, the 5<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> line of the second Stanza reads “The
                            morning’s dawn, the evening’s shade” and so it was sung—but the
                            corresponding 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> line of the same Stanza
                            reads<space/>“The fields from thee the rains receive” totally destroying the
                            rhyme. I instantly saw that the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> line
                            should read “The morning’s dawn, the shades of eve.” but whether this
                            enormous blunder was committed by the copyist or the pressman I am left
                            to conjecture— That it was committed by me is scarcely possible. The
                            correction is so obvious, that it could scarcely escape the notice of
                            any intelligent reader of English versification— The Sermon was
                            ingenious and eloquent, but somewhat eccentric, embracing remarks upon
                            the melancholy paroxysms of <persRef ref="swift-jonathan"
                                >Swift</persRef> and <persRef ref="cowper-william">Cowper</persRef>,
                            and a critique and commentary upon <persRef ref="shakespeare-william"
                                >Shakespear’s</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="hamlet">Hamlet</persRef>— The specifications of the
                            opposite objects for which the royal preacher says there are appropriate
                            times has one item which the purer morality of Jesus Christ has
                            reformed. He says there is a time to love and a time to hate— The
                            precept of Christ, forbids hatred at all times, and probably with
                            reference to this very passage commands his disciples to love their
                            enemies— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon text was
                            Matthew 6.23. “But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
                            darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great
                            is that darkness.” This language is so entirely figurative that is not
                            easy to discern its practical preceptive application. If explained by
                            the verses which precede and follow it to the end of the chapter it is
                            an admirable exhortation to suppress the instigations of avarice, and
                            the passion for amassing inordinate wealth—but it must not be understood
                            as countenancing indolence or indifference to the acquisition of the
                            necessaries and comforts of life— The precept is to provide first for
                            the wants of the Soul, and that will enlighten you, in the search of
                            means to provide for the wants of physical nature—food, and rayment—

                        <p>A cold Northeast wind, threatening rain continued through this whole day,
                            and drove us to the necessity of having a fire made in our dining
                            parlour— The most unaccountable thing to me is that at this most
                            unnatural return of winter to close the month of June, the Sciatica
                            which has so severely afflicted me from the beginning of the month, has
                            departed, and given me a respite from pain which in humble hope I pray
                            may continue, without requiring even the mustard poultice recommended by
                                <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            took <persRef ref="adams-john17">his eldest boy</persRef> to his school
                            at Boston; went and attended an annual meeting of the Stockholders of a
                            Cotton factory at Dover in New-Hampshire; dined there, and returned this
                            evening to Boston and home— An easy travel of 140 miles by railways in a
                            day. <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> went also to
                            Boston and returned towards evening.— I visited my seedling trees
                            watching the signs of vegetation of my shagbark walnuts in all their
                            stages, but unable to account for the blights which strangle them in
                            their growth— I gathered a small basket of the red cherries which are
                            not yet quite ripe. They would be so if left on the tree about the 15<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July—but neither birds nor boys will
                            suffer them to remain till that time— The mazzards will ripen about the
                            same time, but I have two young mazzard trees in front of our western
                            windows one of which open to the Sun, will ripen its fruit at least a
                            fortnight sooner than the other shaded by White Mulberry trees
                            North-west of it— The second shoot of the seedling English white oaks,
                            is pushing out dubiously, and the unfolding leaves of the transplanted
                            shagbark are drooping. [symbols]. Instead of resuming my proper
                            occupation, I gave the leisure of this day to looking up and assorting a
                            collection of pamphlets for the book-binder— I now assorted only 6. of
                            more than 100 that I propose to have bound in the course of this Summer—
                            I called at the shop of<space/><persRef ref="marsh-jonathan"
                            >Marsh</persRef>, and bespoke a pair of shoes— Then at the Post Office,
                            and left the Evening Gazette of last Saturday for <persRef
                                ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef> at Lenox— I went into
                            the cemetery, and visited the tombstones of my first English Ancestors
                            in America <persRef ref="adams-henry;adams-joseph3">Henry and Joseph
                                Adams senior</persRef>— I met there <persRef ref="leary-john">John

                            town house westward. He told me he had returned two years since from

                                father</persRef> all the property left by his brother <persRef

                            house, and was living honestly and comfortably in it— I saw they had
                            planted young trees in the grave-yard and covered the ground around
                            their roots with seaweed, heaped down with a circle of large stones.— I
                            stop’d at the Quincy Aurora Office and left there three congressional
                            documents— At <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lunts</persRef> I pointed out to him the error in the 138<hi

                            requested him to have it corrected in as many of the books as he could,
