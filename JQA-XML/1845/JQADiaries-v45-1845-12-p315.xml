						<p>At 12. o’clock, Meridian I attended at the Hall of the House of
							Representatives— At the Commencement of the 1. Session of the 29.
							Congress precisely at that hour the House was called to order by the
							Clerk of the last House of Representatives. <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">B. B. French</persRef>— The Roll of Members
							was called over beginning with the State of Maine and proceeding
							Southward. 212. Members answered to their names they proceeded to vote
							for Speaker of the House viva voce— <persRef ref="davis-john8">John W.
								Davis</persRef> of Indiana received 120. votes— <persRef
								ref="vinton-samuel">Samuel F. Vinton</persRef> of Ohio—72. and 19.
							scattered— He was conducted to the Chair by Samuel F. Vinton and
								<persRef ref="mckay-james">John I. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>c</hi>Kay</persRef> and was sworn, to support the Constitution of
							the United States, at the call of the Clerk B. B. French, by me. He then
							proceeded to administer to all the Members of the House present the same
							oath, beginning with the State of New-Hampshire Maine, but in the
							Election of Speaker I know not for what reason the Clerk began with the
							State of Massachusetts— After some irregular proceeding a Message was
							sent to the Senate informing them that a quorum of the House were
							assembled, had elected John W. Davis of Indiana their Speaker and were
							ready to proceed to business. A similar Message was received from the
							Senate and the usual Committee on the part of the House to join with a
							Committee of the Senate was raised to inform the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">President of the United States</persRef> that a
							quorum of the two Houses was assembled ready to receive any
							communication from him which he should be pleased to make. The Speaker
							made a short address to the House declaring that he would discharge the
							duties of his office without knowing any Party and with impartiality a
							promise which will certainly not be performed— There was some question
							about the adoption of the Rules. <persRef ref="mcdowell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">c</hi>Dowell</persRef> of Ohio moved a
							resolution that the standing Rules and Orders of the last House of
							Representatives as they existed at the close of the last Session should
							be adopted as the Rules and Orders of proceeding of the House— <persRef
								ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hamlin</persRef> of Maine moved to except the
								33<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> rule commonly called the Hour
							Rule—restricting every Speaker to one hour upon any question in Debate—
								<persRef ref="payne-william3">Payne</persRef> of Alabama moved an
							exception for all Bills to raise Revenue—which after some discussion he
							withdrew— The question was finally taken by yeas and nays and the
							amendment was rejected 62 to 143. <pb n="316" type="ms"/><persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> of Alabama moved to amend
								M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Dowell’s resolution by adopting the
							Rules existing at the Commencement instead of the close of the last
							Session that is to restore, the gag rule, of refusal to receive
							Petitions relating to Slavery— Chapman moved also the previous question
							but the Speaker told him that would cut off his own amendment upon which
							he withdrew the Motion for the Previous Question <persRef
								ref="tilden-daniel">Tilden</persRef> of Ohio and <persRef
								ref="hunt-washington">Washington Hunt</persRef> of New York called
							for the yeas and nays upon Chapmans amendment which was rejected by a
							vote of 84. to 121. <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> of
							Charleston South Carolina with a view to harmonize the House moved to
							Amend M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Dowell’s resolution by adding that a
							Committee be appointed to revise the Rules and report such alterations
							and amendments as might be deemed advisable— This also was rejected—
							Payne of Alabama offered again his amendment as a proviso—but finally
							withdrew it and M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Dowell’s resolution was
							adopted without yeas and nays— It was ordered that the daily hour to
							which the House should stand adjourned should be twelve noon— <persRef
								ref="cobb-howell">Cobb</persRef> of Georgia moved a Resolution that
							the Clerk of the House should place in a box the name of each Member
							upon a separate piece of paper and draw in the presence of the House the
							names one at a time, and each Member when his name should be announced
							should choose his seat for the present Session— He complained of the
							present mode, of choosing seats, but Payne of Alabama immediately moved
							to adjourn which was carried by acclamation—at 20 minutes past two
							o’clock— I walked home— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

								Simpson</persRef>, wife of <persRef ref="simpson-presley">Presley

							been a Clerk, in one of the Public Offices, The Chief Clerk of which was
								<persRef ref="washington-peter">Peter G. Washington</persRef>—who
							had removed Mr Simpson last June—from motives of personal animosity,
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Simpson had taken no part in
							politics, that she considered his case a very hard one, and had applied
							for the restoration of her husband, without success, though it was
							admitted, that he had faithfully performed the duties of his Office, and
							the only cause assigned, for his removal, was, that he had been many
							years in it— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Simpson had opened a
							family Grocery store, on Penn<hi rend="superscript">a.</hi> Avenue, and
							her purpose was to solicit our <pb n="319" type="ms"/>custom for any
							article of Grocery which we may need— Then <persRef ref="davis-john4"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John Davis</persRef> one of the
							Senators from the State of Mass. called on me to confer with me,
							concerning any notice to be taken by the Bar of the Supreme Court of the
							United States on the occasion of the decease of the late Judge, <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">Joseph Story</persRef> he intimated that there
							might be an expectation that I should preside at a Meeting, of the Bar
							for that purpose. I said that I believed, the usage in such cases was
							that the Attorney General should call a Meeting of the Bar, preside
							thereat and present to the Court the Resolutions adopted by the Bar,
							honorary to the memory of the deceased Judge— That I saw no propriety
							that I or any other person from the State of Mass—should take the lead
							or preside at this movement—that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Story
							was a Judge not of the State of Mass but of the United States and it
							might be considered somewhat derogatory if any movement of respect
							towards him should be left to originate in persons from his own State.
							But if the <persRef ref="mason-john5">Attorney General</persRef> being a
							Va should decline to assume this Office I would readily attend a Meeting
							of the Bar and Preside if so elected by the Meeting— This would be some
							inconvenience to me as the state of my health has compelled me to
							decline attendance at similar Meetings for some months past— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis expressed his concurrence with my
							opinions that is movement should originate and proceed under the
							direction of the Attorney General and said he would further confer with
							him upon the subject— At the House the Annual Report of the <persRef
								ref="walker-robert">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> upon the
							Finances was received laid on the Table and ordered to be printed, with
							100 additional copies for the use of the Treasury Department— The Report

							of the House that he had received all the engraved plates. 150 in number
							from the Engravers under an order of the House of 25<hi

								<persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayly-thomas3">Baily</persRef> of Virginia was then resumed
							after long speeches from each of them of Political <unclear>crim</unclear>ination and

							was this morning taken up— After some discussion <persRef
								ref="hungerford-orville">Hungerford</persRef> moved it be laid upon
							the Table—which was rejected by yeas and nays 88 to 115—and it was
							adopted by a vote of 117 to 77— A motion was made and rejected to
							reconsider it and the House proceeded immediately <pb n="321" type="ms"
							/>to carry it into execution— The members vacated the seats which they
							had occupied according to the method hitherto observed in the selection
							of them and the name of each member was drawn from the box by the Clerk
							and they successively chose such of the Seats as remained after those
							previously drawn had appropriated to themselves were left vacant— This
							operation consumed about three hours of time— It is remarkable as a
							revolution in the manner of appropriating seats of the members by a
							prescriptive unwritten rule observed from the first organization of the
							Government under the Constitution of the U.S. There were about 155 names
							drawn before mine but my seat one of the best in the House was left
							unoccupied and when my name was drawn I resumed it—almost all the other
							Chairs were filled by others than those who had first chosen them—
							Several notices of intention to introduce Bills were given and one of
							them by <persRef ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale Owen</persRef> of a Bill
							establishing a Smithsonian Institution. After some other Resolution
							among which one for Printing the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Presidents</persRef> Message in the German language were made and
							failed— The House adjourned past three o’clock— The ground was covered
							with snow—when the sky cleared off with a sharp frost— Evening visit

							inserted by him at my suggestion I told him that was true—that I had
							been authorized by him to assert the principal in a Letter of

									>r.</hi> Rush</persRef> then Minister in England and had written
							the paragraph in the very words inserted by M<hi rend="superscript"

							Presidents of the United States to prepare their Annual Messages and to
							receive from each of the Heads of Departments—paragraphs ready written
							relating to their respective Departments, and adopt them as written or
							with such modifications as the writer of the Message deemed advisable—
							That this principle thus inserted was disagreeable to all the principle
							European Sovereigns I well knew and that those of Great Britain, France
							and Russia had explicitly expressed their dissent from it
							notwithstanding which I adhered to it and was glad that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Polk had so emphatically referred to and
							repeated it— I hoped he would adhere to it—but I must in candor say that
							with it I believed it indispensably necessary to make large expenditures
							for preparation by Sea and land to maintain it if necessary by force of
							arms that I had not been entirely without apprehension that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Polk would ultimately recede from it— He
							asked me if M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Polk I disapproved of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Polks repeating the offer of assuming the

							strengthen our final adherence to our whole claim—but that I should not
							have repeated it myself at this time. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Bancroft spoke of the Astronomical Observatory here—said he hoped

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bond</persRef>— It was now

							would not take M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bond away from Cambridge—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft’s manner and deportment to

						<p><date>7. V— VI. </date>In the National Intelligencer it was advertised

							preach in the Hall of the House of Representatives this morning at
							eleven o’clock— I rode to the Capitol to hear him and dismissed the
							carriage—to walk home M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Conner commenced
							the Service by reading the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of
								<persRef ref="luke">Lukes</persRef> Gospel which he made the text
							for his Discourse— He observed that it contained three parables,
							delivered by Jesus Christ, on the occasion stated by the Evangelist that
							all the Publicans and Sinners drew near unto him, to hear him— That upon
							this, the Scribes and Pharisees made it a subject of reproach against
							him and murmured saying this man receiveth Sinners and eateth with them.
							His first Parable in answer to this accusation was that of a Man losing
							one of an hundred sheep going after it into the Wilderness until he find
							it and rejoicing with his neighbours upon his Living found the Sheep
							that was lost— The second like the first is in form of an inquiry what
							woman having ten pieces of silver and losing one piece doth not
							dilligently seek till she find it and then rejoice with her friends and
							neighbours and in the application of these two parables; he says there
							is joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth more than over ninety
							and nine just persons which need no repentance— The third parable is
							that exquisite one of the Prodigal Son— The inference from these three
							Parables is a complete justification for Jesus Christ himself against
							the reproaches of the Scribes and Pharisees but it behooves the humble
							Christian not to mistake the real import of these instructions the
							charges of the Scribes and Pharisees against Jesus, for associating
							familiarly with Publicans and Sinners were not without foundation— The
							Publicans were odious to the people by the vocation which was to levy
							tribute and taxation for the Roman Government— The Sinners were persons
							of vicious and degraded character of such persons it was the duty of all
							honest, and virtuous men to beware and there is no principle more
							conformable to the Christian system of Morals than that “Evil
							communications corrupt good manners”— In justifying himself therefore
							from the charge of the Scribes and the Pharisees—Jesus Christ, does not
							deny the propriety of the charge itself but rests his vindication upon
							the motive which induced him to depart from the <unclear>general</unclear> principle of
							morals and the authority which he assumed of a Reformer He associates
							with the vicious and degraded incapable of being seduced by them but to
							redeem them from the consequences of their own crimes and to restore
							them to the Paths of honor and virtue— The example must be followed with
							great reserve by the frail and imperfect Christian believer—few have the
							right to assume the character of Reformers and every one who associates
							with persons of known vicious characters can indulge the hope of
							reforming them without incurring the imminent danger of being seduced by
							them to their own ruin— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Conner is a
							fluent respectable Orator not of a very high order of talent or genius—
							In the afternoon I attended at Saint Johns Church where <persRef
								ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne</persRef> read
							the evening service for the second Sunday in Advent and preached from
							Luke 4—part of 18. <pb n="325" type="ms"/>“He hath sent me to heal the

							and I moved that the first Petition presented by me should be referred

							moved the reference of the Petition to the standing Committee on the

							twenty other Petitions all except two or three containing the same
							Remonstrance and were referred to the same Committee— I presented also
							two Remonstrances of Citizens of Philadelphia against the appointment of
							Chaplains by the two Houses of Congress which were referred to the

								Kavasales</persRef> a native of Greece who obtained in 1841. a

							upon his amendment which were refused— Pettit asked to be excused from

							Upon this he called the yeas and nays which were refused and the

							for Petitions was then renewed— I offered a Remonstrance against the

							each state, but they were all laid upon the Table as well as others of
							the same kind presented by other members, to which disposition I stated

							which were laid upon the Table like those against the admission of Texas
							but no Petitions relating to the abolition of Slavery have been sent to

							walked home— In the evening <persRef ref="white-elijah">D<hi

								>Hudson’s</persRef> Bay Company or Canadian Government upon all

							Lecture upon Oregon and a Pamphlet containing the discussion between him
							and <persRef ref="falconer-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Thomas Falconer</persRef> on the same subject— For the reading of
							all these Papers I do not find myself yet prepared to abandon the
							“Mystères De Paris of <persRef ref="sue-eugene">Eugene Sue</persRef>.”
							This work is little more than a repition or sequel to the once
							celebrated Tableau De Paris of <persRef ref="mercier-louis"
								>Mercier</persRef>—one of the works among the premonitory symptoms
							of the French Revolution— The representation, of the condition of Human
							Society in that great City, of all the wretchedness and misery of all
							the different classes of Society forming the mass of its population is
							in almost all important essentials the same. The principle difference is
							that this work throws the subject into the form of a Novel Before the
							Tableau de Paris de Mercier. Restife de La Bretonne in his Paysan et
							Paysanne pervertie had exibited the portraiture of the vices, crimes,
							and distresses suffered by the Population of Paris in features not less
							energetic and horrible, than form the characteristic of these mystères—
							The originality of Eugene Sue is in the frame of his work Its alternate
							result is perhaps no more than a picture of civilized life under the
							existing institutions of civil society in all populous Cities The book
							is composed of a variety of adventures, incident to the high and the
							low, the rich and the poor converting into individual crimes, all the
							operations <pb n="332" type="ms"/>of the Laws, manners, and customs of
							Christian Nations— <unclear>Dress</unclear> tragedies catastrophes of which, are brought
							about among the highest classes of Society by the impulses of passion
							and in the lowest by those of hunger nakedness and want—</p>

							Bancroft was attending a Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef

								<persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef>—whom I said I wished to recommend to the humane

							Kavasales had been itself an improper one in as much as he was not a
							native of this Country, not well acquainted with the English language or
							with the manners and feelings of American Seamen— I said that I regreted
							the Secretary of the Navy should have listened to such representations
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Kavasales had been saved by the
							charity of a Commander of our Squadron in the Mediterranean, when a
							small child from a massacre of christians at Smyrna by a barbarous and
							brutal Mahometan soldiery that he had been brought as an infant to this
							Country educated, and supported by certain benevolent gentlemen in Mass
							and Conn that he had been graduated at Yale College and at a subsequent
							Theological Institution in the forms and principles of the New England
							Congregational Churches that as to his knowledge of the English Language
							I could speak of it from personal knowledge having frequently conversed
							with him and found him as familiarly acquainted with it as any of the
							graduates of our Colleges That he might not perhaps be so skilful an
							adept in the peculiar language and manners of English Seamen as <persRef
								ref="taylor-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Taylor</persRef>
							a Minister of the Sailors Church in Boston but that he was no more
							strange to them than the generality of the Clergymen of this Country of
							all denominations— That I did not suppose <pb n="333" type="ms"/>that
							the Navy Department of the United States had assumed the political
							doctrines of the Native American Party, but that no other principle
							could justify objections to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Kavasales
							from the circumstance of his not having been born within the bounds of
							the United States— That I took it for granted no objection had been made
							to his moral character or to any deficiency in his capacity to perform
							the duties of a Chaplain; he said certainly not and I replied that I
							considered the others as altogether unworthy of the consideration of the
							Secretary of the Navy— He said he would report the substance of this
							conversation to him and did not doubt that he would pay every attention
							due to the interest which I took in favour of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Kavasales. I said that as to the appointment of this
							gentlemen I was perhaps more responsible than any other man for that
							measure having very earnestly recommended him for that appointment. I
							considered him as having been an unfortunate foreigner cast upon the
							hospitality of this Country by great and unmerited calamities. That his
							character was unexceptionable his deportment modest and unpretending,
							and his sufficiency for the Office which he held equal perhaps to that
							of any other Chaplain in the Navy that he had been now about four years
							in Commission nearly three of which he had been in service at sea on the
							Pacific Ocean and in the Mediterranean. That his Salary while in full
							service was 1200 dolls a year that he was desirous of obtaining an
							appointment to what is called a shore station at Brooklyn Long Island or
							at Norfolk in Virginia that if this could not be obtained he wished for
							a leave of absence which would secure to him two thirds of the full
							salary for eight hundred dolls a year but that the Secretary had put him
							upon furlo which reduced him to one third of his salary or four hundred
							dolls a year only not sufficient to support him with the decency due to
							his station— Evening visits from <persRef ref="maury-matthew2"
								>Lieutenant Morey</persRef> and <persRef ref="herndon-william">Lieut
								Hernden</persRef>—who have charge of the Observatory at this place—
							Lieut Morey invited me to come, and look through the <persRef
								ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauen Hofer</persRef> Refractory—and the
							Prime Vertical at the Moon at its third or fourth day if the weather
							should permit— He said that was the period of the moon at which the
							observations through the large Telescope were the most interesting—</p>

						<dateline>Sunday— 14. December— 1845</dateline>
						<p><date>14. III.45— VI. </date>On the first day of this month I resumed the
							practice which for some years I have intermitted of reading every
							morning two Chapters of the Bible— I am regularly getting along through
								<pb n="334" type="ms"/>the Book of Genesis and every day find
							occasion for some remark, which I had never made before— I find I shall
							lose almost if not entirely the benefit of this practise from the
							inability of minuting down as I have heretofore done those remarks— I
							had received an invitation from the vestry of the Church of the
							Ascension to attend this day at the opening of Divine Service within its
							walls— But a steady rain continuing through the whole day and a failure
							in the attempt to find where the Church of the Ascension was defeated me
							in the execution of my purpose and confined me to the house for the rest
							of the day— My chief occupation was to read the discussion between the
							successive secretaries of state—<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef>—<persRef ref="upshur-abel">Abel P.
								Upshur</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C

								ref="fox-henry3">Henry S. Fox</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pakenham-richard">Richard Pakingham</persRef> concerning the
							contest of title between the United States and Great Britain to the
							Oregon Territory— The most remarkable reflection to which this
							correspondence gives rise in my mind is, that notwithstanding the
							positive declaration of <persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Polk</persRef> in his Inaugural
							speech of the unquestionable title of the United States to the whole
							Oregon Country to Latitude 54–40–, notwithstanding a repetition of the
							same declaration in his recent Message to Congress and notwithstanding
							the constant professed inflexibility of his Official Newspaper in the
							support of this Claim he had actually repeated the offer heretofore made
							by <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Munroe</persRef> and repeated by me of continuing the Boundary Line
							between the British Possessions and the United States in the Latitude of
							49— from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean and that it has again been
							rejected by Great Britain— This offer was formerly made under the
							impression that it would not be accepted but that its effect would be to
							preserve the Peace between the two Countries, and postpone the issue of
							the Controversy until the time should come when we should be able to
							maintain our Claims by an appeal if necessary to Arms— My own opinion
							is, that this offer ought never again to be made nor accepted if offered
							by Great Britain herself but, it is too clear to me, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Polk, will finish, by accepting it— In
							addition to all my other complaints, I have taken a severe cold
							affecting now both my head and breast— We have received three days ago a
							Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> with the
							intelligence that his Son <persRef ref="adams-charles7"
								>Charles</persRef> has taken the scarlet-Fever— Our concern is
							somewhat alleviated by the addition that there were no unfavorable

								Kavasales</persRef> called here this morning I told him that I had
							endeavoured to see the <persRef ref="bancroft-george">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef> both at his house and at the Department without
							success— That I would renew the attempt and recommend him as I had
							promised to the kindness of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft— I
							did not tell him the objections, mentioned to me, against him and his
							appointment as a Chaplain by the <persRef ref="smith-athomas">Chief
								Clerk</persRef>, because it could only have mortified him. And the
							Secretary alone is responsible for them and to be reasoned with
							concerning them— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Mason</persRef> who had accompanied <persRef ref="gray-john4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gray</persRef> when he came
							concerning the Bill for the relief of the legal representatives of
								<persRef ref="bell-james2">James Bell</persRef> came this morning
							alone. He enquired what I thought of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Gray’s argument against the Legislative power to determine who the Legal
							Representatives of Bell were— I said I believed the argument to be
							correct but the question can not be discussed in the House until the
							Bill shall come in from the Senate— At the House, I found the <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef>, presenting to the House several
							Reports from the Executive Departments— The Resolutions of the
							Legislature of Conn—against the annexation of Texas presented by
								<persRef ref="rockwell-john">John A Rockwell</persRef> a member from
							that State, last week were first taken up. He moved they should be
							referred to the whole House on the State of the Union and printed— Among
							A motion had been made that they should be laid upon the Table and
							objection made to their being printed— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Rockwell in a sensible speech of about ten minutes insisted, chiefly
							upon their being printed, as a customary mark of respect to the state
							from which they had eminated. <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Lynn
								Boyd</persRef> who had made the motion to lay them on the Table
							disclaimed all intention of objecting to their being printed and
							concluded by a Motion that they be laid upon the Table and printed—
								<persRef ref="bowlin-james">James B. Bowlin</persRef> of Missouri
							moved to suspend the Rules to enable him to move for leave to introduce
							a Bill to provide for a Territorial Government in Oregon— The motion was
							rejected and a Call for Petitions commencing with Maine and passing in
							inverted order from the Territory of Wisconsin northward occupied the
							remainder of the day <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef> presented the Resolutions of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts of April last concerning the naturalization Laws— <persRef

								>Richard Brodhead</persRef> of the same state moved referrence to
							the Committee on the Judiciary Levin, said he proposed to Debate the
							Question and the Resolutions were passed over till tomorrow— I presented
							two sets of Resolution of the Legislature of Massachusetts one against
							the annexation of Texas and the other concerning Louisiana and South
							Carolina, they were read and I moved their referrence to a select
							Committee and that they be printed— <persRef ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew
								Johnson</persRef> of Tennesee sent to the Table a slip of printed
								<pb n="336" type="ms"/>paper to be read—it was read—and was an
							advertisement from a Boston Newspaper of the year 1741. advertising for
							the sale of a Negro and offering reward for runaway’s The Resolutions
							were laid on the Table by yeas and nays—83. to 67—and were ordered to be
							printed— The Resolutions concerning South Carolina and Louisianna were
							treated in the same manner laid on the Table 90. to 68. and ordered to
							be printed— On the motion of <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Stephen A

						<p>I called at the Office of <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major

							received a note from him, but without effecting any thing. At eleven

								ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef> of Maine was absent—
							There are thus upon this Committee five members from Slave holding
							states and four from the free States only three of whom were present—
							The commission is to revise the Rules and Report to the House such
							alterations and amendments as might be deemed advisable— The object of
							the Chairman is to restore the Rule excluding Abolition Petitions from
							reception and the <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> a member
							from the free state Indiana has so constituted the Committee as to
							secure a Report favorable to the purpose of the Chairman. At this
							meeting the proceedings of the Committee were only preliminary— In
							conversation concerning the Rules generally and the Gag Rule
							especially—a Sub-Committee of three consisting of the Chairman Vinton
							and Hunter was appointed by the Chairman to report a general revisal of
							the Rules for the consideration of the Committee. I proposed that a
							Journal of the Committee should be kept that upon all Questions decided
							by the Committee a minute of them should be made of them upon the
							Journal and the yeas and nays taken upon it at the request of any
							member. I desired that I might not be placed upon the Sub-Committee
							believing that no improvement in the proceedings of the house is to be
							expected from any Report of the Committee but ready for my own part to
							agree to any improvement of the Rules which might be proposed by any
							member of the Committee and which I could approve—with the exception of
								<pb n="337" type="ms"/>the restoration of the Anti-Petition Rule to
							which I could under no circumstance whatever assent— Reed of North
							Carolina, said, he should deem it his duty to move the restoration of
							the Rule— Chapman of Alabama suggested that he should favor a substitute
							proposed in the Committee of the first Session of the last Congress
							namely upon the presentation of every such Petition objection should be
							made to its being received and the objection and Petition then be laid
							on the Table— The Chairman undertook to make up the Journal for the
							meeting of this day and the Committee adjourned without agreeing upon
							the time of the next meeting— In the House, the special order of the day
							the first Resolutions reported from the Committee on the Territories for
							the admission of the State of Texas into the Union were immediately
							taken up— <persRef ref="mcconnell-felix">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>Richard P. Herrick</persRef> of New-York moved to lay them on the
							Table rejected by yeas and nays 52. to 142— The Previous Question was
							carried by Tellers 91. to 85. After some chicanery the engrossment and
							third reading were carried by Yeas and nays 141. to 57. <persRef
								ref="rockwell-julius">Julius Rockwell</persRef> of Massachusetts
							made a speech of an hour against the passage of the Resolutions and
							proposed an Amendment to the first which the Speaker declared not to be
							in order— Rockwell moved to recommit the Resolutions to the Committee on
							the Territories with instructions to Report an Amendment “provided that
							within the State by this Resolution admitted into the Union—Slavery or
							involuntary servitude except for crime, shall be prohibited and all the
							provisions of the said Constitution inconsistent with this proviso shall
							be null and void[”]— <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Douglass</persRef>
							moved the Previous Question which started a Debate whether the Previous
							Question will apply to the passage of the Resolutions or to the
							recommitment moved by Rockwell— The Speaker decided this Question both
							ways first that the main Question would be on the passage of the
							Resolutions and then that it would be on Rockwell’s motion of
							recommitment— <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef> of
							Kentucky took an appeal from this last decision— <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Drumgould</persRef> of Virginia moved a call
							of the House which was refused— Tibbatts withdrew his appeal for the
							present until the Question was decided on the Question as put by the
							Speaker which was sustained by the House— Alvan Cullom moved to
							reconsider the vote sustaining the decision of the Speaker— The
							reconsideration was carried by yeas and nays 99. to 98. The decision of
							the Chair was then reversed and the Previous Question was settled to be
							on the passage of the Resolutions <persRef ref="schenck-robert"
								>Schenck</persRef> of Ohio asked to be excused from voting and to

							irrelevancy and then the permission was refused— Schenck withdrew his
							motion <unclear>to</unclear> be excused though even the right of doing that was objected
							to by some Members of the House. Motions were made to divide the
							Questions into two—one upon each Resolution which the Speaker decided to
							be inadmissible— One vote by yeas and nays were taken upon the two
							Resolutions and was carried 141. to 56. <persRef ref="jones-george4"

								White</persRef> from Oregon and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> <unclear>Wines</unclear></persRef> from Missouri was

							Constituents to have the Memorial presented by a Member of the majority
							in the House and a friend and supporter of the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>present Administration</persRef> of the Federal Government— He said
							he had been advised by some of the friends of the present
							Administration—to place the Memorial in my hands in preference to any
							other Member of the House, but he enquired whom I would recommend— I
							told him it was a subject of much delicacy for me to undertake to
							specify any particular person as peculiarly in the confidence of the
							present Administration but I would name M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Douglass of <unclear>Ill</unclear> the Chairman of the Committee on the Territories to
							which the Memorial would doubtless be referred— He said he would follow
							this advice and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Douglass was himself

							by me— I said M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Douglass might entertain
							liberal opinions concerning me but that there were <unclear>. . .</unclear> considerable

							distrust and jealousy upon any thing which would be proposed by me.— I
							would give him and his Memorial all the support in my power but I could
							not answer for the action of any other Members of the House—</p>

								Kavasales</persRef> was here again this morning but I had not been
							able to see the <persRef ref="bancroft-george">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef> to speak a word in his favor— I went to the
							Department again for that purpose but was again told that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft was in Cabinet Council at the
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Presidents</persRef>. I went and settled
							an old bill at Keyworths and passed the remainder of the day at home—
								<persRef ref="gray-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Grey</persRef> was here and enquired if I had examined his Argument,
							respecting the division of the Legislative and Judicial Powers under the
							Government of the United States— I had read it cursorily supposing it to
							be connected with the Claim of the Legal Representatives of <persRef
								ref="bell-james2">James Bell</persRef> and the Bill before the
							Senate and which it is expected will come from that Body for the action
							of the House of Representatives upon it— But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Gray now told me that it was upon quite a different subject
							which without clearly explaining to me he said was intended as
							preparatory to an argument before the Supreme Court of the United
							States—and somewhat abruptly, he said it involved an immense pecuniary
							interest and he offered me what he called a Contingent fee of five
							thousand dollars to undertake this Argument— I told him that for many a
							long year I had ceased to practise Law in any of the Judicial Courts of
							the United States, and was in no condition to resume the practise now—
							That I would however read with more particular attention his Memorial
							again and if he desired it would give him my opinion upon it as a Member
							of the House of Representatives without any Fee or charge whatever— I
							did not say to him what I thought of this Contingent Fee, offered upon a
							subject intended to be brought both before the Supreme Court of the
							United States and before Congress but it brought forcibly to my mind the
							Offer of which I had recently read in the Correspondence of <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund">Edmund Burke</persRef> which he peremptorily and
							I think justly declined— It occurs to me that this double capacity of a
							Councellor in Courts of Law and of Member of a Legislative Body affords
							opportunity and temp-<pb n="343" type="ms"/>tation, for Contingent Fees
							of very questionable moral purity— Of one such transaction I had
							knowledge last Winter which in my mind was tainted with the vilest
							corruption and I have heard of others which I shall not specify because
							they are familiarly spoken of as in no wise exceptionable, but for which
							the only palliation of which I deemed them susceptible is that alledged
							by <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Chancellor Bacon</persRef> in his
							Defence upon his Trial before the English House of Peers that there are
							“vitia temporum” as well as [“]vitia hominum”— It is a sad contemplation
							of Human Nature to observe how the action of the Members of Legislative
							Bodies may be bought and sold, and how some of the brightest stars in
							that firmament may pass in occultation without losing their lustre— I
							took from the Library of Congress yesterday morning the New Annual
							Register for the year 1790 and ’91. to examine the Negotiations between
							Spain and Great Britain about their N<space/>Sound controversy and I find
							that although with great reluctance I must devote to this subject the
							time I am now wasting upon <persRef ref="sue-eugene">Eugene
								Sue</persRef> “Mystères De Paris” I spoke this day to <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass</persRef>
							concerning the Resolutions which he has introduced into the Senate and
							told him that I hoped he meant to follow them up by the proposal of
							measures of real and effective preparation— He said he did and expressed
							his high gratification at the approbation which he had heard I had
							expressed of his movement—he said he hoped I concurred with him in the
							opinion of the justice of our Title I said I did entirely—</p>

						<p>The Winter is setting in with extreme severity and the Potomac River is
							frozen over down below Alexandria.— I attended Public Worship this
							morning at the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd.</hi> Presbyterean Church,
							where the <persRef ref="knox-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
									M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> James Knox</persRef> is about to
							leave his Society and preached I believe for the last time. His
							Discourse was from Matthew 9.36. “But when he saw the multitudes he was
							moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered
							abroad as Sheep, having no shepherd” It was a melancholy Sermon—upon the
							deep importance of supporting the Christian Ministry— It has been with
							extreme difficulty that this Church has struggled to support itself
							hither to— When I first occupied in it a Pew its Pastor was the <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Daniel
								Baker</persRef> and in the twenty five years since that time it has
							had a succession of eight or nine ministers of various talents and
							acquirements all pious and respectable men and every one of whom I
							believe has been compelled to leave them from their inability to afford
							him a comfortable support &amp; by invitations from more easy if not
							affluent Religious Societies— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Knox
							sermon was in a spirit of earnest affection mingled with concern and
							regret at the apparent prospect of the dissolution of the Society— He
								present<pb n="344" type="ms"/>ed all the obvious considerations
							which contribute to the importance of a regular Christian Ministry to
							the Religion, the Morals, the Virtues and the happiness of a people— He
							alluded in general terms and without complaint to his own services
							during his connection with the Church for a space of not more than two
							years— He did not dwell upon the cause or motives of his own departure
							The occasion of which is an invitation from a Society in the City of New
							York The theme is copious and was discussed with great power in the
							Supreme Court of the United States by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Daniel Webster</persRef> about two
							years ago on the Trial of the Gerard College at Philadelphia— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Knox Sermon without being perhaps equally
							comprehensive and eloquent was to me more affecting and affecting above
							all by the selection of the text— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> T. B. J. Frye</persRef> dined with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef> and after dinner

								>r.</hi><space/>preached from 1. Corinthians 9.24. part of the verse “So
							run that ye may obtain” the preceeding part of the verse is—“know ye not
							that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize” Thus
							that which the <persRef ref="paul">Apostle</persRef> exhorts the
							Corinthians, so to run that they may obtain it is the prize of the race—
							But the Preacher did not much attend to that part of the context which
							remarks that only one can obtain the prize and although the Discourse
							was not destitute of good sense and piety it made little impression upon
							my mind or I believe upon those of the Auditory in general— There was
							something lacking of an explicit meaning in the text itself which needed
							the explanation of the con-text even to be understood—</p>

							should think proper—and thereby score of the balance of their charge
							against me— They did not seem disposed to accept of this arrangement but
							left me saying they would make report of my proposal to the Board of
							Trustees— The <persRef ref="graham-jane">widow</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> George
								Grahame</persRef> came and requested a recommendation from me to the
							Secretary of the Navy <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi

								<persRef ref="graham-george2">her Son</persRef> a youth of 16. years
							of age for a Midshipman Warrant which I readily promised her though my
							recommendation, can avail no farther than to have his name entered in
							the Books of the Department as one of the Candidates for the
							appointment. She said there was a rule that the number of midshipmen
							must be distributed among the states according to the number of their
							Representation in Congress and that her Son was entitled to be entered
							as belonging to the state of Missouri where an Uncle of his resided—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft had been here this morning
							before M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Grahame— I spoke to him in favor
							of <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef> the Chaplain and mentioned his wishes to obtain
							a shore station at Norfolk or at Brooklyn Long-Island or if that should
							be inadvisable a leave of absence— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Bancroft said that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Kavasales had been
							treated with as much indulgence as any other Chaplain in the Navy but
							that the reports from the Commanding Officers of the Squadron in which
							he had served were unfavorable to him— That he was represented as
							inefficient and incompetent for the service required by his station,
							that he had performed little or no duty and that his conduct had not
							been unexceptionable in regard to his moral principles— I said that this
							was the first intimation that I had ever received of this last
							charge—that on the contrary I had understood from the Chief Clerk of the
							Department, that not a lisp against his moral character or conduct had
							been heard from any quarter—that if it was well founded I wished him to
							consider me as withdrawing any recommendation that I had heretofore
							given in his behalf and would never say another word in his favor—but
							that upon a charge of this nature I thought he was entitled to a
							hearing, that it must be made by a responsible person and duly
							investigated, if it was to be made the foundation of any denial of
							proper indulgence to him— That I had taken a deep interest in him from
							principles of humanity regarding him as a stranger an Orphan cast in his
							childhood upon the Charity of this nation by the Turkish massacre at
							Smyrna in which both his Parents had perished <pb n="346" type="ms"/>and
							he himself was saved by the kindness of the Commander of our Squadron
							there at that time He was brought to this Country by him and educated
							for the Gospel Ministry at the Charge of a Religious and Charitable
							Association by whom he was first recommended to me— I had earnestly
							solicited his appointment as a Chaplain I was still earnestly solicitous
							that he should enjoy the advantages of his education and discharge
							faithfully the duties of his station that he should suffer no injustice
							from the Government of this Country but if there was any taint upon his
							morals I must withdraw any interposition in his favor— I could only
							require that he should have a fair and impartial trial— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft said that he would require a
							formal Report concerning him from the Officers of the Squadron in which
							he had served— At the House the reading of the Journal of last Friday
							after some objection was commenced but soon suspended and dispensed with
							a message from the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef> was
							received in reply according to his English to the Resolution of the
								25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> February last with Report from the
								<persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Secretary of State</persRef> with the
							correspondence of <persRef ref="slacumb-george">George W.
								Slacum</persRef> late Consul of the United States at Rio Janeiro
							with the Department of State relating to the African Slave trade— It was
							read; laid on the Table and ordered to be printed— The House then
							proceeded to the Election of Chaplain and after some obstruction from
								<persRef ref="pettit-john">John Pettit</persRef> who finally asked
							to be excused from voting in which he was seconded by <persRef
								ref="sawyer-william3">William Sawyer</persRef> of Ohio both of them
							being excused the election was made there were thirteen nominations and
							at the third vote <persRef ref="milburn-william">Rev<hi

							chosen— <persRef ref="jones-george4">George W. Jones</persRef> of
							Tennessee then moved to proceed to the election of a superintendant of
							the folding room. The <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> at
							first said that this would require a vote of two thirds but afterwards
							changed his opinion and decided that the election might be made by vote
							of a majority— <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef>
							of Maine moved that the election should be made by Tellers— <persRef
								ref="jenkins-timothy">Timothy Jenkins</persRef> of New York moved to
							lay Hamlins motion on the Table rejected by yeas and nays 57. to 90. but

						<p>I omitted to mention yesterday that I met <persRef ref="dodge-joshua"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua Dodge</persRef> in
							Pennsylvania Avenue who walked home with me and came in and spent half
							an hour here. This morning I called at the Navy Department where I found

									>r.</hi> Bancroft</persRef> and told him that I came as a
							solicitor for a Lady <persRef ref="graham-jane">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> George Graham</persRef> in behalf of <persRef
								ref="graham-george2">her Son</persRef> a youth of sixteen very
							desirous to obtain a midshipman’s warrant— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi>
							<pb n="349" type="ms"/>Bancroft objected that several relations of this
							Lady were already in the Pub Service and that being a resident of the
							Dist. Columbia from which there were already a great disproportion of
							their numbers in the naval service, it was scarcely practicable to allow
							them any further favors— I observed that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs.</hi> Grahame claimed the State of Missouri as the domicil of
							her Son M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft treated this pretension
							some what lightly observing that she had already advanced the same claim

							to the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="polk-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Polk</persRef>, to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft himself and to every other
							person whom she supposed to possess any influence with him, but that he
							had not been able to find a sufficient justification for complying with
							her request— The earnestness of a Lady in soliciting for the benefit of
							her son the means of useful education and honorable existence in the
							service of his Country I observed were entitled to great indulgence and
							even to warm approbation if not to compliance— I discussed the matter
							for some time with M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft without
							apparently producing any impression upon his determination and on
							parting from him told him I should report to the Lady as the result of
							my commission from her that it was impossible to say no more graciously
							than the Secretary of the Navy had done— I received this day from

									>r.</hi> Theodore L Moody</persRef> also from the state of
							Maine, sometime settled in Alabama and now a Clerk in the Land Office—
							They also spent the evening here and for the first time for many years I
							took a hand at a Rubber at Whist— I finished reading this morning the
							Book of Genesis and among the very striking Properties of this first
							Book of the Holy scriptures I have been more impressed than I had ever
							been before with what is called the blessing of <persRef ref="jacob"
								>Jacob</persRef> upon his children the Patriarch’s of Israel in the
								49<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter It is said that when upon
							his death bed he called unto his Sons and said “Gather yourselves
							together—that I may tell you that which shall befal you in the last
							days[”] There is a Prophecy for each of the twelve Sons without notice
							of what he had before said that each of the two Sons of <persRef
								ref="joseph3">Joseph</persRef>
							<persRef ref="ephraim">Ephraim</persRef> and <persRef ref="manasseh"
								>Manassa</persRef> should form a separate Tribe. But <pb n="351"
								type="ms"/>of all these predictions there is not one excepting that
							of Joseph which can properly be called a blessing. The beginning of that
							of <persRef ref="reuben">Ruben</persRef> the eldest son is—“Unstable as
							water thou shalt not excel[”] and there is barely one of them but
							portends calamity and wickedness rather than blessing— This Prophecy is
							understood to be applicable not to the sons themselves but to their
							remote posterity the Tribes descending from them— The predictions are
							all obscure highly metaforical and not easily comparable with any
							fulfilment which afterwards happened to them— It is said for example
								<persRef ref="benjamin">Benjamin</persRef> shall ravine as a Wolf in
							the morning he shall devour the prey and at Night he shall divide the
							Spoil— Now in the Book of Judges it is related that this Tribe of
							Benjamin was nearly exterminated in a Civil War with the other Tribes—
							In the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd.</hi> and third verses of the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> Chapter of that Book it is said “that
							the People came to the House of God and abode there till even before God
							and lifted up their voices and wept sore and said Oh Lord God of Israel
							why is this come to pass in Israel that there should be to day one Tribe
							lacking in Israel” This seems hardly a confirmation of the blessing of
							Benjamin by Jacob— The Tribe of Benjamin was indeed to some extent
							restored and the first King of Israel <persRef ref="kingsaul"
								>Saul</persRef> was one of his descendants—but the fate of Saul
							himself and of all his posterity shows in glaring contrast to the
							prediction of the dying Jacob— The Tribe of Benjamin never recovered
							entirely from the War in which it had been so nearly extinguished— Of
							all the particulars of Jacob’s Prophecy that respecting <persRef
								ref="judah">Judah</persRef> is the most remarkable— He calls him a
							“Lions whelp[”] and adds [“]from the prey my Son thou art gone up—he
							stooped down, he couched as a Lion and as an old Lion who shall rouse
							him up[”] and then the nex verse says [“]the sceptre shall not depart
							from Judah nor a Law giver from between his feet until Shiloe come and
							unto him shall the gathering of the People be” this is considered I
							believe by all the Christian Commentaters upon the scriptures as a
							Prophecy of the Advent of the Saviour Jesus Christ—and when I was a
							Student at Newburyport I heard a sermon by the <persRef
								ref="bass-edward">Rector</persRef> of the Episcopal Church at that
							place afterwards the first Episcopal Bishop in Massachusetts—delivered
							on Christmas Day on that text in which this position was maintained and
							which has dwelt upon my memory to this day— It was in the year 1787. or
							1788. but it appears to me that the passage is not susceptible of that
							construction distinctly precluded by the tenor of the two following
							verses There is no sufficient explanation of the Grounds upon which the
							term Shiloe can be applied to Jesus Christ—nor is it apparent how it
							should be said that the Sceptre should not depart from Judah until he
							should <pb n="352" type="ms"/>come— The Tribe of Judah having been
							carried into captivity into Babylone hundreds of years before the Advent
							of Christ—</p>

						<p>A sleepless night or at least I was unconscious of losing the sense of
							wakefulness from the time when I went to bed last night till I arose
							this morning— I heard the clock below successively strike eleven,
							twelve, one, two three, and four— I supposed myself wholly awake from
							that time but did not hear the clock strike five or six, and found broad
							daylight much to my surprize and the clock striking seven and when I was
							not aware of any interval since I had heard the stroke of four— I must
							therefore have slept nearly three hours with a consciousness of being
							all the time awake— This condition of body and mind is not new to me— I
							have experienced it before but know not how to account for it— A morning
							visit from <persRef ref="smith-truman">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Truman</persRef> &amp; <persRef ref="dixon-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> James Dixon</persRef> Members of the

								ref="moseley-william3">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> W<hi
									rend="superscript">m.</hi> A. Mosely</persRef> Representative
							from the Buffalo District of New York—he is confined to his chamber with
							a severe attack of inflammatory rheumatism and has been unable to attend
							the House nearly from the commencement of the Session—he is now
							recovering but thinks it will be a week or ten days longer, before he
							will be able to resume his seat— I had some conversation with him on the
							present state of Public affairs— He is a member of the Whig party the
							policy of which among the People appears to be concentrating itself upon
							a system of opposition to the <persRef ref="polk-james">present
								Administration</persRef> on the ground of its propensity to War with
							Great Britain— Dangers of War and a very contemptuous estimate of the
							object for which they suppose the President is provoking it are the only
							theme upon which they dwell without sufficiently considering that their
							terrors and prognostics may furnish to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Polk motives and pretexts for yielding to the pretensions of our
							adversary and sacrificing our own just claims to the Territory in
							dispute of which I think there is much greater danger than of a War for
							the maintainance of them— I commenced this morning the reading of the
							Book of Exodus, presenting the opening of a new Scene in contrast of
							those which had preceded through the Book of Genesis to its close— The
							vocation of <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> and its
							consequences to himself and his family until their temporary
							establishment in the Land of Goshen under the Government of Egypt is now
							succeeded by the birth and surprising history of <persRef ref="moses"
								>Moses</persRef> the leader of the children of Israel to the
							promised Land of Canaan which he was not permitted himself to enter and
							to the system of Laws for their Government as a Nation which he received
							from the hand of Jehovah on Mount Horeb— I read also another chapter of

						<p>I was again restored to the blessing of sleep which came on me very soon
							after I retired to bed last night and continued till nearly Sun Rise
							this morning but my sleep was restless and I arose suffering much with
							rheumatism— <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Kavasalas</persRef> called upon me again this morning
							and I told him the result of my interposition with the <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> in his favour—
							That there were complaints against him not only of incompentency for the
							performance of the duties of his station but even with regard to his
							moral conduct and I said that if there was any just exception against
							him in that respect I had assured M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Bancroft that I should cease for ever all farther interference in his
							behalf—but M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft had said that no
							specific charge or formal report against him had been made and I urged
							that if any charge existed against him to his disadvantage in the mind
							of the Secretary it should be made by a responsible person in specific
							terms and that he should be allowed a hearing in defence and
							justification of himself— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Kavasalas said
							he was very sure that no such charge could be made, but that most of the
							Officers were his Enemies and especially those addicted to habits of
							intemperance and to the use of profane language of which he was sorry to
							say there was far too great a proportion and he named to me several from
							Post Captains down to Surgeons and Midshipmen who were notoriously
							intemperate from who he had received the most injurious and insulting
							treatment— I do not repeat their names here but I fear that his charges
							against them are but too well founded— He added he had no doubt that
							these same Officers were the same persons who had made these informal
							and unwritten charges against him which had indisposed the mind of the
							Secretary of the Navy towards him— I advised him to call upon the
							Secretary at the Department and to repeat in his own name the claim
							which I had made for him, that any charges against him should be
							specifically made and that he should have the opportunity of self
							defence to repel them— He left me and returned this evening with a sad
							report of his visit to the Secretary, who received him together with
							another person a stranger to him and treated him as he said with so much
							rudeness and insolence that he remained not more than three minutes in
							his Office and withdrew from it in total disappointment, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft upon his entering the Office had
							accosted him with an air of anger and demanded what he would have—he
							answered that he was desirous of obtaining from him a private interview,
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft had replied that he must
							speak out; what he wanted, or that he must commit it to writing. A short
							dialogue ensued in which Kavasalas intimated that as a Clergyman he had
							expected favourable if not indulgent treatment from the present
							Secretary of the Navy A remark perhaps not unnatural though not very
							politic for it exasperated M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft who
							thereupon told him that he saw himself his incompetency for <pb n="354"
								type="ms"/>a teacher in the Navy of the United States— After this
							unfortunate allusion it is apparent that I can do nothing further for
							this poor man and that he must submit with as much of christian
							resignation as he can to his fate— The Turks at Smyrna are not more
							inexorable to his Father and Mother, than a Christian Divine turned into
							a Secretary of the Navy will be to him— At twelve oclock I attended the
							Meeting of the House with the expectation of an immediate adjournment
							but a sparring debate of between two and three hours was sprung upon the
							motion to proceed to the election of a Superintendant of the Folding
							room an Officer not recognised by Law or even by the rules of the House,
							appointed hitherto as a Subordinate of the Doorkeeper by him, but which
							the House have now determined to appoint by their own election— There
							was a conflict of Patronage between some of the leading Members of the
							House at work to animate and prolong this Debate— A Grave question was
							discussed whether the Election should be made as now usual viva voce or
							by Tellers— A question which remained undecided in as much as after
							several motions for adjournment one finally succeeded by Yeas and Nays—
							While this debate was in progress a Bill came in from the Senate for
							extending the Laws of the United States over the State of Texas, an
							effort was made to pass it through the House per saltum, but it was
							finally referred to the Committee on the Judiciary—</p>

						<p>I attended Public worship in the Hall of the House Representatives where
							the Chaplain of the House <persRef ref="milburn-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi><space/>Milburn</persRef> preached from 1.
							Romans 15. “So as much as in me is I am ready to preach the Gospel to
							you that are at Rome also” a text in which and in its application to the
							Preacher himself there was to say the least no small portion for
							presumption He introduced the Discourse with a very detailed
							byographical account of <persRef ref="paul">St Paul</persRef> the Author
							of the Epistles to the Romans—beginning with his birth and origen, His
							education at the feet of <persRef ref="-gamaliel">Gamaliel</persRef>.
							His early hostility to the Christians, his keeping of the garments of
							the Ruffians who murdered the first Martyr <persRef ref="ststephen"
								>Stephen</persRef>—his commission from the High Priest breathing out
							threatnings and slaughter against the Diciples of the Lord—on his way to
							Damascus, the sudden and miraculous appearance of Jesus Christ to him on
							his Journey and its consequences, his conversion and metamorphosis from
							Saul the persecutor of Jesus, into Paul the great and unrivalled Apostle
							of the Gentiles— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Milburn in a striking
							and some what dramatic manner followed him step by step through the
							whole career of his existence noticing his various Journeys his
							wonderful adventures and the final elevation of his character to that of
							an inspired teacher in his Letter to the Romans—then Masters of the
							World— This narrative well composed <pb n="355" type="ms"/>and not
							ineloquently delivered would have been more interesting but for the
							seeming arrogance not even veiled or disguised of its application to the
							Preacher himself who rather intimated than left it to be inferred by his
							hearers that he himself from a very obscure origin—and under the
							affliction of almost total blindness had risen from one of the humblest
							Preachers of the Gospel until brought here by the election of the House
							of Representatives to Preach the Gospel to them the Rulers of the land,
							if not the Masters of the World— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Milburne is a Methodist and his manner of Discoursing declamatory as is
							that of all Preachers of that Denomination has the peculiarity of a very
							modest introduction and temperate progress diversified with very loud
							intonations of voice and bursts of spontaneous declamation— I walked
							home and in the afternoon attended at Saint Johns Church where the
								<persRef ref="pyne-smith">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne</persRef>—read the evening
							service for the Sunday after Christmas and preached from Luke 4.18. part
							of the verse “He has sent me to preach deliverance to the captives and
							recovering of sight to the blind.” This is only a part of a verse
							containing the self anunciation of Jesus Christ of himself as the
							Messiah in the Synagogue on the Sabbath day at Nazareth— It is the
							passage of al most awful solemnity in the whole Bible— The text is part
							of the passage which he read from the Book of <persRef ref="isaiah"
								>Isaiah</persRef> which after reading he closed the Book and sat
							down saying this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears— It is
							impossible to treat this subject as it should be treated without taking
							together the narrative of the event the words which Jesus read from the
							Book of Isaiah and this assertion immediately following that he was the
							fulfilment of that prophecy— Let me here repeat the whole of the Passage
							which he read as recorded here by the Apostle <persRef ref="luke"
								>Luke</persRef>— “The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath
							anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal
							the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and
							recovering of sight to the blind, to set at Liberty them that are
							bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord” The passage in the
							Book of Isaiah thus quoted by the Saviour is the first and second verses
							of the 61. Chap. where it reads thus “the spirit of the Lord God is upon
							me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the
							meek he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim liberty
							to the captives and the opening of the Prison to them that are bound—to
							proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” thus far is the passage read
							by Jesus Christ, as related, in the narrative of St Luke— There are
							several remarkable differences between <pb n="356" type="ms"/>the
							translation from the Hebrew of Isaiah in the English Bible and that from
							the Greek of St Luke in the New Testament In the Book of Isaiah—the
							apparent purport of the Chapter refers only to the Prophet himself and
							continues to declare the purpose of his own commission in its essence
							and its consequences through the whole Chapter— In the narrative of Luke
							Jesus declares, that this Prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in him but in
							this proclamation of his Commission he stops in the midst of the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> verse of the Commission, unfolded by the
							Prophet Isaiah leaving out all the remnant of that Chapter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne contracted still more the theme of
							his Discourse by confining his text to a part of the commission
							proclaimed by the Saviour consisting only in preaching deliverance to
							the captives and of recovering of sight to the blind an incident not
							even contained in the passage from Isaiah as it now stands in the
							English translation of the Bible a complete commentary upon this
							declaration by Jesus Christ of his whole commission from Heaven compared
							with this Prophecy of it in the Book of Isaiah is much to be desired,
							but this Discourse of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne commenting
							only upon a fragment in which the Old and New Testament are not
							identical leaves that exposition still to be desired— <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Caleb
								Cushing</persRef> was also here—and had much conversation with me He
							said he was here only for two or three days upon some business of his
							own the nature of which he did not tell me— He said that we were coming
							again to the times of the Panama Mission which I told him I did not
							understand— He made inquires concerning the right of Intervention and
							whether according to International Law Blockades could be instituted
							unless between Parties are War— I supposed he had referrence to a
							Blockade of the Platte river said to have been proclaimed jointly by a
							French and British Squadron off Montevideo—and I conjectured that there
							was some question in our present Executive Administration—depending at
							the present time—and that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cushing was
							under an expectation of a Diplomatic Mission connected therewith— We had
							also some desultary conversation respecting his late Mission to China— I
							mentioned the Lecture which I delivered in 1842. at Boston—<pb n="358"
								type="ms"/>concerning the War then existing between Great Britain
							and China in which I had avowed the opinion that in that War the right
							was on the side of Great Britain— That after his return from China I had
							heard that he in a Lecture delivered at Boston had expressed an opinion
							adverse to mine but was afterwards told, that he had contradicted this
							Statement—he said it was so that on reading my Lecture he had procured
							the papers laid before the British Parliament upon which my opinion had
							been formed and that he fully concurred with it— I asked him some
							questions respecting the Religion of the Chineese and their system of
							morals and whether among them there were any Mahometans he said there
							were some Mahometans among the Tartars—but of the Chinees there was very
							little religion excepting Confucianism. I observed that there were
							differences of international Law between nations modified by their
							systems of Religion that between Christian nations there was one system
							founded upon the fundamental Moral Principle of Christianity brotherly
							Love among men, there was another system between Christian and Mahometan
							nations modified by the Mahometan Principle the Unity of God and the
							creed that Mahomet is his Prophet with the further doctrine that this
							Creed may be imposed upon the rest of mankind by force—that there was
							still another system with the Chinees, and I asked what was the
							fundamental principle of morals with them? he said it was the relation
							of authority and obedience, between Parent and Child, he said also that
							the words of Jesus upon the Cross “Father forgive them for they know not
							what they do” were to the very letter in the Cyropædia of <persRef
								ref="xenophon">Zenophon</persRef> and he intimated that the
							Christian Doctrine was fully comprised in the discourses of <persRef
								ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef>—which I think is not quite
							correct—</p>

						<p>I had a night, of quiet repose and sound sleep till past five this
							morning but I am suffering severely with a flying rheumatism and the
							involuntary tremulous agitation of my nerves bears me down with
							increasing vigour— I think it was never so great as this morning a
							potion of salts gave me but very partial relief— <persRef
								ref="beck-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Beck</persRef> of
							Charlestown was here—impatient not merely for the presentation <pb
								n="359" type="ms"/>of her Petition but for the immediate enactment
							of a Special Law in her favour— She said it was a great inconvenience to
							her to be kept here a burden upon her friends— I told her that on the
							very first day upon which the House would receive Petitions I would
							present hers and I wished I could encourage her to expect an early
							decision upon it—but from all the experience that I had had upon the
							most successful Petitions for private Claims—I must confess—that she
							could have no hope of relief from that source within less than three or
							four months— That I did not believe she could advance it one hour by
							remaining here that her Petition when presented would be referred to the
							Committee on Revolutionary Claims who if upon examination should be
							satisfied of its justice would Report in its favor but this in the most
							prosperous state of things could not be obtained within many weeks and
							if they should Report in its favor there would be many weeks more before
							the House could pass upon it and then it would have to go through a like
							proceeding in the Senate—that there could be no use of her remaining
							here as her presence would not advance it for a day— If she thought it
							necessary to stay till she could see the Chairman of the Committee on
							Revolutionary Claims to whom it would be referred I should advise her
							immediately afterwards to return home and await the decision there— If
							she would call again tomorrow morning I would inform her of the name of
							the Chairman of that Committee, whom if she thought proper she could
							call and see before her departure.— At the House, a Select Committee of
							five on the folding Room and all its apertenences and announced with
								<persRef ref="mckay-james">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>Garrett Davis</persRef> offered certain Resolutions for the
							investigation by the Committee on the Judiciary of the Defalcation of
							the late Clerk of the House <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Caleb. J. M<hi
									rend="superscript">c</hi>Nulty</persRef>—which were adopted—
							There were five inditments against him in the United States Circuit
							Court for this District upon one of which he has been tried and
							acquitted by verdict of a Jury <pb n="360" type="ms"/>a Nolle prosequi
							has been entered upon the other four One of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Davis’ Resolutions implies that the mode summoning and
							empanelling Juries in the Courts of the United States—have contributed
							to the acquittal of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> M<hi
								rend="superscript">c</hi>Nulty and required an Amendment of the Law—
							A Report was received from the <persRef ref="walker-robert">secretary of
								the Treasury</persRef> in answer to a Resolution inquiring why
							certain Sums of Money due to the state of Arkansas had been with held
							from payment and the answer is that it has been by virtue of Joint
							Resolution of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> March last providing
							that whenever any State shall have been or may be in default for the
							payment of interest or Principle on investments in its Stock or Bonds
							held by the United States in trust it shall be the duty of the Secretary
							of the Treasury to retain the whole or so much thereof as may be
							necessary of the percentage to which such state may be entitled of the
							proceeds of the sales of the Public Lands within its limits and apply
							the same to the payment of said interest or principle or to the
							reimbursement of any Sums of Money expended by the United States for
							that purpose— This provision was first introduced into an Act of
							Congress by me in 1842 and is the only check which I believe practicable
							to an enormous system of swindling and plunder by some of the Democratic
							States upon the Treasury of the Union— The <persRef ref="davis-john8"
								>speaker</persRef> said that the first business of tomorrow would be
							the Call of the Committees for Reports— Adjourned about 3. o’clock— The
							first symptom of the first <persRef ref="polk-james">present
								Administration</persRef> flinching in the controversy with Great
							Britain concerning the Oregon Question occurred in the Senate this
							day—upon certain Resolutions offered by <persRef ref="hannegan-edward"
								>Hannegan</persRef> Senator from Indiana reasserting the right of
							this Country to the whole of Oregon to which Amendments offered by
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">John. C. Calhoun</persRef> declaring the
							subject still open for negotiation and looking to a renewal of the offer
							of the 49. Par<space/>of Latitude for the boundary— Hannegans Resolutions
							were at his own motion laid on the Table for further discussion
							hereafter—</p>

								Beck</persRef> came again this morning and I informed her that no
							Petitions, had been received by the House yesterday and none would
							probably be received this day— that <pb n="361" type="ms"/>from this
							time the first thirty days of the Session having expired only one day in
							the week would be assigned for the receipt of Petitions and that the
							opportunity of presenting hers would not occur till next Monday— I gave
							her the name of the Chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary
								Claims—<persRef ref="johnson-joseph">Joseph Johnson</persRef> of Va
							and of the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions <persRef
								ref="brodhead-richard">Richard Brodhead</persRef> of Pa— That to one
							or the other of these Committees her Petition would doubtless be
							referred but that no possible benefit could accrue to her from her
							remaining here, and I advised her to return home as soon as possible—
							She mentioned her need, of the means of defraying her passage for which
							I gave her five dollars—which she promised to return if she should ever
							be able— At the House, the day was chiefly consumed in the Call of
							Committees for Reports—and a Debate upon a proposition for printing an
							additional number of <persRef ref="fremont-john">Fremont’s</persRef>
							Report to supply the new members of the present Congress with a number
							of Copies equal to those distributed by a Resolution of the last Session
							to the Members of the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress. A

							was one by <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">John W. Tibbatts</persRef> from
							the Committee on Commerce a Bill making Appropriations for the
							improvement of certain Harbours and Rivers—when upon his motion to
							commit the Bill to the committee of the whole on the State of the Union
								<persRef ref="crozier-john">Crossier</persRef> of Tennessee moved
							instructions to the Committee to amend the Bill by inserting a Clause
							making an Appropriation of one hundred thousand dollars for the
							improvement of the Tennessee River— This was followed by a long Debate
							chiefly upon the Question on the rule that all Appropriations of Money
							should first be considered in Committee on the Whole. This Rule
							furtherly prevailed and the Bill was referred to Committee of the Whole
							on the state of the Union without instructions— <persRef
								ref="vance-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Vantz</persRef>
							of Ohio moved that when the House should adjourn it should be till

							which passed without opposition— There were several Reports relating to
