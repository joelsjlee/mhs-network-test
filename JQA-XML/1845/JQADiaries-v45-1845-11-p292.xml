						<p><date>2. III— V— </date>I arose at five oclock, with a rainy morning

								>Ansaldo Ceba</persRef> Citizen of a Republic in fulfilment of a
							promise to <persRef ref="lester-charles">C. Edwards Lester</persRef> the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt</persRef> this morning
							from 1. John 5–12— He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not
							the Son of God hath not life—and in the afternoon from Romans 13–10—
							Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore Love is the fulfilling
							of the Law— Both admirable Sermons and both lucid expositions of the
							system of Christianity— And in the Discourse in the morning, commenting
							upon the words of his Text he said that Christianity was to be
							considered not so much for Law as a Life.— And expanded the assertion in
							the Text that to have the Son is Identical of Life into a general
							exposition of all the Virtues and Graces which constitute the Life of a
							pure disciple of Christ— In the afternoon Discourse the theme was
							essentially the same— If Love is the fulfilling of the Law it is the
							hinge upon which the whole system of Christianity revolves— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts discourses are perhaps too
							exclusively confined to this Class of religious topics—there is some
							want of variety in his selection of the subjects on which he treats—a
							defect to which Clergymen obliged to produce two Sermons every week is
							always liable— I rode to, and from the Meeting Morning and Afternoon and
							for the remainder of the day was confined to the House— I answered the

									>r.</hi> Frothingham</persRef> discoursed in the morning from
							Isaiah 17.6. Yet gleaming Grapes, shall be left in it, as the shaking of
							an Olive tree— Two or three berries, in the top of the uppermost bough,
							4 or 5, in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, Saith the Lord God of
							Israel, this is the whole verse, but Mr. Frothingham took for his text
							only the words, two or three berries, in the top of the uppermost bough,
							four or five, in the outmost fruitful branches thereof. Words seemingly
							scarce sufficient to include the subject of a whole Sermon, but from
							which he formed a beautiful, &amp; eloquent discourse upon the decay
							&amp; diminution of human enjoyments, in the last stages of life, it is
							a peculiar talent of Mr Frothingham to make applications, thus
							comprehensible, &amp; ingenius, from similar passages from Scripture
							remarkable either for singularity, then for their direct bearing upon
							the doctrine which he draws from them. The text of his afternoon
							discourse was Acts 9.6 and he trembling &amp; astonished said Lord what
							wilt thou have me to do &amp; the Lord said unto him, arise, &amp; go
							into the City &amp; it shall be told thee what thou must do. The subject
							is the Conversion of <persRef ref="paul">St. Paul</persRef> but the
							preacher generalized as an enquiry suitable to be made by every
							Christian, &amp; presented a general view of the answer in the life and
							conduct of the enquirer, to the question. A visit before dinner from
								<persRef ref="swett-samuel">Coln. S. Swett</persRef>, who invited me
							to his house to see his pictures. <pb n="304" type="ms"/>We passed the

						<p><date>17. III.30. V. </date>Morning visit from <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>, to whom I delivered
							all the papers, relating to the Observatory at Cambridge, which it was
							my business to prepare, but which I have not been able to get ready. I

							provision, for the support of an observer who it is desired should be
								<persRef ref="bond-william">Mr Bond</persRef> who now performs the

							prevented me from executing this duty, &amp; I thankfully accepted the
							offer of Mr Quincy to undertake it for me. <persRef ref="palfrey-john"
								>Mr J. G. Palfrey</persRef> also called to see me, but I was out. I
							called at the Tremont House &amp; enquired for <persRef
								ref="hackett-james">Mr. Hackett</persRef> to return to him his
							manuscript with my answer to his letter received some weeks since, but
							he was no longer lodging there, nor do they know his return is to be
							expected. I received invitations to dine next Saturday from <persRef
								ref="gray-francis">Mr. F. C. Gray</persRef> &amp; from <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Mr Edward Everett</persRef>, the first of which
							I accepted, &amp; declined the second, also an invitation from <persRef
								ref="swett-samuel">Coln. Swett</persRef> to name a day of this or
							the next week to dine with him, for which I answered by <unclear>naming</unclear> next
							Friday. He invited us also, to call &amp; see his pictures, which I did
							with my daughter, at one oclock this day. I am reading the
							Correspondence of <persRef ref="burke-edmund">Edmund Burke</persRef>
							recently published, in 4 volumes, &amp; in the 2<hi rend="superscript"
								>d</hi> volume page 281. I find a letter from <persRef
								ref="curry-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
							Curry</persRef>, an Irish Roman Catholic dated the 6. August 1779 in
							which he informs him of a present a bill of three hundred guineas
							offered to him by a meeting of the Roman Catholics &amp; at page 290. a
							letter from <persRef ref="dermott-anthony">Mr Anthony Dermott</persRef>,
							dated 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> August of the same year,
							enclosing a bill for 300 guineas, in part of a sum of 500, in
							consequence of an unanimous resolution at a meeting of the Roman
							Catholics of which they pray his acceptance as a mark of their gratitude
							for the many <unclear>eminent services</unclear> he had rendered their body &amp; he adds
							that as soon as <unclear>in cash he shall have</unclear> the pleasure to send him a Bill
							for the remaining 200 guineas. 291 is the answer of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Burke, declining to receive the present
							&amp; he says “it is impossible for me with any agreement to my sense of
							propriety to accept any sort of compensation for services which I may
							endeavor to do upon a publick account. If the bill you allude to should
							come before you receive this I must return it by post, to the gentleman
							who transmits it” &amp; in page 295, is the answer to Mr Dermott dated
							August 17. returning the bill as he had received it. I note especially
							this correspondence, to mark my approbation of the principle involved in
							this transaction. His services for which this offer of a private
							gratuity was made where performed in the discharge of his duties as a
							member of Parliament, the refusal to receive it was the act of a lofty,
							&amp; independent spirit, the most creditable in him, as his
							circumstances in life were far from affluent. His friend <persRef
								ref="fox-charles">Charles Fox</persRef> was not so scrupulous, he
							permitted his friends, to pay his debts for him. His great rival &amp;
							adversary <persRef ref="pitt-william2">William Pitt</persRef> had the
							same offer made to him which he rejected. There may be some casuistical
							argument for and against the acceptance of large &amp; costly presents
							under such circumstances, but for the preservation of a <unclear>pure, disin</unclear>
								<pb n="305" type="ms"/>terested character my opinion is, that they
							should always be refused in this however, I do not mean to include
							articles of trifling value, being unwilling to stake a great principle
							on a very small object. I dined with <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"
								>Robert C. Winthrop</persRef> in company with 14 persons, among whom
							were <persRef ref="everett-edward;everett-charlotte">Mr &amp; Mrs Edward

							prevailing to recover the power &amp; influence of Free Masonry, &amp;
							that this had furnished to me, an additional reason, for desiring a

							24. “For all flesh is as grass” &amp; all the glory of man, as the
							flower, of grass, the grass withers, &amp; the flower thereof falleth
							away 25. but the word of the Lord endureth forever, and this is the
							word, which by the Gospel is preached unto you. This was one of the most
							admirable discourses that I ever heard in the Pulpit. Its subject was
							the contrast between the transitory nature of every thing in the life
							&amp; affairs of the human race &amp; the permanency, of the Christian
							Gospel. The division of the subject was at once easy &amp; natural, the
							transient nature of all that relates to the concerns of men, is a common
							Place <unclear>treated</unclear> by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham, as by
							others, but the permanency of Christianity he considered under four
							divisions, one, its history, 2. its spirit. 3. its doctrines, &amp; 4.
							its effects. The composition was elaborate, &amp; elegant, &amp; after
							expatiating at once with <unclear>brevity</unclear> &amp; with force, upon each of the
							four separate divisions it closed, with an emphatic &amp; <unclear>impressive</unclear>
							repetition of the last <unclear>clause</unclear> of the text, “this is the word which by
							the Gospel is preached unto <hi rend="italic">you</hi>[”] with a look,
							<unclear>directed</unclear> to his whole auditory, as eloquent as the words themselves.
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">My son</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">daughter</persRef> invited Mr Hughes to dine
							with us but he had a previous engagement to <persRef ref="otis-harrison"
								>Mr H. G. Otis</persRef>. In the after<pb n="309" type="ms"/>noon,
							the preacher was <persRef ref="robbins-chandler">Mr Robbins</persRef>,
							&amp; his text was from Joshua 24.15 “But as for me, &amp; my house we
							will serve the Lord.” The subject was upon the duty of Parents, in the
							education of their children highly important &amp; very well treated. He
							dwelt earnestly upon the part of the Mother, in the performance of this
							duty, &amp; with exhortation equally earnest to the other parent, not to
							neglect the performance of his own, concluding with the somewhat
							singular expression, oh give us Christian houses. <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">Mr Quincy</persRef>, was here, after the
							morning service, &amp; promised to call tomorrow morning in his carriage
							for our visit to the observitory at Cambridge. He said that <persRef

								<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">Mr Abbott Lawrence</persRef> could

							meet us, at the Observitory.</p>

								ref="holbrook-ichabod">Lieutenant Ichabod Holdbrook</persRef>,
							Massachusetts Continental line, army of Revolution Weymouth, Norfolk
							County, Massachusetts, This circular informed the persons to whom it was
							addressed that he was in possession of some evidence, that Lieutenant
							Ichabod Holdbrook, was entitled to a pension, &amp; grant of public
							lands for Military services, during the Revolutionary War, &amp; Mr
							Duval offers himself as an agent to recover the claims, for 50 dols in

							upon a claim which he states to amount to 7.4.56, &amp; 210 acres of
							bounty land. In manuscript under this circular is a note &amp; signed
							stating that Lieutenant Holdbrook died, March 31<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> 1823, aged 65. This circular proposed also, that the
							member of the persons addressed meaning the member of the Congressional
							district to which they belong would call upon him at Washington. he
							could inform them of the progress of their business &amp; if their claim
							should be passed, could be present with him at the Treasury department
							&amp; receive their money after deducting his pr ct, or they could
							attend in person. The circular adds, if you wish my services, direct to
							General John P Duval Attorney at Law, postage paid, as letters not paid
							are not taken from the office. I asked Mr Holdbrook if the Heirs
							proposed to accept the terms offerd by Mr Duval he said they did not,
							that they thought them extortionate. I said that Mr Duval made this
							business a part of his profession. I was not disposed to speak in
							censure of the terms of his estimate of the value of his services, but
							that I thought they were in this case, more, than they deserved. That if
							the Heirs were willing to charge me with this service I should consider
							it, as a part of my public duty as the representative of the
							Congressional District to which they belonged, &amp; would do every
							thing in my power to obtain their claims without any charge upon them
							whatever &amp; I believed that I could do as much for them, at the
							pension &amp; bounty land offices at Washington, as Mr. Duval being very
							familiar with those Offices &amp; with many such claims, which I had
							attained at both of them, for persons interested in them, that I would
							advise him, in the name of the Heir’s to answer Mr Duval’s Circular
							thanking him for his information, stating that they should prosecute
							themselves their Claims, &amp; in the event of recovering them
							<unclear>considering</unclear> him, as entitled to a reasonable compensation for it. To
							this he assented. I then enquired who the Heirs of his father <persRef
								ref="holbrook-ichabod2">Ichabod Holdbrook</persRef> were, he said
							there was beside him-<pb n="311" type="ms"/>self <persRef
								ref="holbrook-elisha2">one living younger brother</persRef> &amp;
								<persRef ref="hayward-hannah">two married sisters</persRef>, &amp;
							several children, of <persRef ref="holbrook-peter">another brother

							behalf, they must all join in a letter to me, stating their claims &amp;
							requesting any assistance to obtain them, they must also furnish me with
							authentick evidence to show their right, as Heirs of Lieutenant
							Holdbrook. I told him also, that letters of administration on the estate
							of his father would be necessary for the receipt of the money if
							obtained. He said there had been an administration, before these claims
							were known, but the administrator was dead. I said that new letters of
							administration, “de bonis non” the nature of which I explained to him
							must then be taken out, to authorise the receipt of the money &amp; its
							distribution among the heirs, he asked if the administrator would be
							required to give bonds. I answered yes, whereupon he intimated a
							disposition, in the event of the recovery of the claims to retain the
							whole of the amount of them himself, on the ground of a dep<unclear>. . .</unclear> of his
							own upon his father’s estate at the time of his decease, admitting that
							he had never made this demand, upon the former administrator, of the
							estate. I told him it was too late to make it now &amp; if any thing
							should be recovered of the present claims, he must share it equally with
							the other heirs, he finally left the circular with me, &amp; promised to
							write me the letter requesting my assistance to obtain the claims &amp;
							furnishing the evidence of the right of the heirs. I detained me till
							past 12 o clock, when I went to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my

								ref="curtis-nathaniel">Mr Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, a deed of a
							lot of Land in Charlestown belonging to the estate of <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">Ward N. Boylston</persRef> I then went into the

							&amp; a <persRef ref="u">Mr Giles</persRef> was arguing before him a

								ref="shaw-lemuel">Lemuel Shaw</persRef>, was holding the Court, with
							an empannelled Jury, trying a cause, one of the parties to which was a

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> John M. Thomas</persRef>— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Adams</persRef> was so much better that she was able to leave her
							bed but kept her chamber— I attended at Saint Johns Church morning and
							afternoon— The <persRef ref="pyne-smith">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith Pyne</persRef>
							performed both the services for the first Sunday in Advent and for Saint
							Andrews day— This morning text was from Isaiah 9. chap. and part of the
							sixth verse— “And His Name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor” It was
							a Discourse upon this prediction, of the Prophet <persRef ref="isaiah"
								>Isaiah</persRef>, seven hundred and fifty years before the birth of
							Christ of the Advent of the Messiah upon Earth—and the Discourse was an
							exposition of the peculiar application of the words “Wonderful and
							Counsellor” to the name, History, and attributes, of Jesus Christ the
							Saviour, and Redeemer of Mankind— The Sermon of the afternoon was from
							1. Thessalonians 5.7—“For they that sleep sleep in the night, and they
							that be drunken are drunken in the night. 8— But let us who are of the
							day be sober putting on the breastplate of Faith and love and for a
							helmet the hope of salvation” This Discourse was short The Church was
							well filled in the morning but the afternoon Auditory was thin— I went
							first in the afternoon to the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							Presbyterean Church but found it closed and I presumed there was no
							Service there— I am told that the <persRef ref="knox-james">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knox</persRef> has left them and that the Church is now without a
							Pastor— In passing from it to Saint John’s Church I met <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Mary E. E. Cutts</persRef> who invited me to
							visit her Aunt <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Madison</persRef> with whom she now resides, which I
							accordingly did after Church— I met also <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="markoe-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Markoe</persRef> of the Department of State— The day was dark and
							gloomy threatning snow or rain— Spent the evening at home without
							interruption of visitors— I had written a note this morning to <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> inviting him to dine with us this day, and every
							day while he should remain in this City, when otherwise disengaged— But
							he had left his Lodgings and returned to Baltimore much to my surprise
								<pb n="315" type="ms"/>as I had supposed he intended to remain some
							days in Washington— But it seems he came only to accompany me, to the
							end of my Journey— Of all the persons to whom it has been my good
							fortune to render important service in the course of my life, I believe
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Christopher Hughes to be the most
							sincerely and cordially grateful, and so little have I been accustomed
							to that return that I feel it a duty incumbent upon me to record in this
							Diary of my life though I can no longer write it with my own hand—</p>
