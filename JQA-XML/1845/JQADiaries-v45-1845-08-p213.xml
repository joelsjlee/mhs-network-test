                            from 1837 to 1842— The act of Congress of 3. March last continues these

                            after a considerable search this day an autograph Letter of 22. April

                        <p><date>2 III.50. </date>Saturday.</p>
                        <p>The weather for the last two days has been such as might have been
                            enjoyed in the garden of Eden before the fall— But nothing can a charm
                            impart to the decays of age—and symptoms of bodily disease, disclose
                            themselves day after day of which it is useless to speak and idle to
                            complain; but which I ought to take and improve as warnings to set my
                            house in order— Among these is increasing insomnia— I lead a very
                            regular life, wasting some hours for exercise every day, and retiring
                            regularly to bed between 10 and 11 at Night— But I seldom sleep 3 hours
                            often lying hours before sleep comes and often awaking before 2. with
                            inability to sleep again, and irresistible impatience to rise— Last
                            Night I lay consciously awake the whole Night. Hearing the entry clock
                            strike 11. and 12. but not 1. 2 or 3—waiting nearly an hour to hear it
                            strike one—finally rising from inability to wait longer and finding it
                            daylight and close upon four— I had thus slept nearly 3 hours, all the
                            time believing myself awake— A consequence of this is, dosing all the
                            day long, and mental imbecility— I wrote to <persRef ref="colton-george"
                                >George H Colton</persRef> of New-York, and to redeem arrears of
                            Correspondence resolved to write at least one short Letter every day
                            through this month— Pursuing the double purpose of making a collection
                            of my pamphlet published writings, to be bound in volumes for <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and of assorting other
                            pamphlets for the book binder I ransacked many hundreds of old pamphlets
                            till it was a weariness to the flesh—and made the index to the third
                            volume of the compilation for my Son. There is mixed up in this
                            assemblage of my writings much—perhaps two thirds of the whole, written
                            by others—especially the controversies and the negotiations— Of these I
                            daily find additional pamphlets, containing perhaps only one or two
                            Letters of mine, with all the rest of the pamphlet by others.— I think
                            of forming a secondary or supplementary collection for my Son— My plan
                            enlarges as I proceed— I must take care not to let it spread to
                            evaporation.</p>

                            preached this morning, from John 17.4. “I have glorified thee on the
                            earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.” An
                            occasional Discourse, preliminary to the administration of the
                            communion— The words of the text are part of the last discourse held by
                            Jesus after his last Supper, and immediately before he went forth to the
                            garden, where he was betrayed by <persRef ref="judas-iscariot"
                                >Judas</persRef> and taken.— The narrative by <persRef ref="john"
                                >John</persRef> is extended from the 13<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> to the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter
                            inclusive— The institution of the eucharist or Lord’s supper is not
                            noticed in these chapters, nor any where in the gospel of John— It is
                            related by the <persRef ref="mark;luke">three other
                                Evangelists</persRef>, only one of whom, <persRef ref="matthew"
                                >Matthew</persRef>, introduces the words “for the remission of
                            sins,[”] of which <persRef ref="pusey-edward">D<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Pusey</persRef> makes such preposterous use— The
                            discourse of Jesus in these chapters of John, is different from the
                            relations of the other three— The ceremony of the communion is performed
                            with solemnity partaking of awfulness by almost every denomination of
                            Christians—but the frequent repetition of it always in the same words,
                            and with the same action makes it scarcely possible to retain the
                            profound impression with which it is first gone through. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s Sermon was an earnest exposition of
                            the declaration of Jesus at his last hour that he had glorified his
                            father on the earth, and had finished the work which his father had
                            given him to do.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s text in the
                            afternoon was from John 16.33. [“]These things I have spoken to you,
                            that in me, ye might have peace,” omitting the remainder of the verse—
                            [“]In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have
                            overcome the world.” The tenor of the discourse was an argument upon the
                            natural aspirations of human nature to the enjoyment of Peace of Mind,
                            and upon the peculiar adaptation to that end of the system of
                            Christianity— Peace of mind is indeed the greatest of earthly blessings,
                            and if the mission of Jesus Christ had been exclusively to secure the
                            enjoyment of that blessing to his followers, it would have been worthy
                            of a supernatural revelation from Heaven.— In parting from his disciples
                            Jesus tells them in the world they shall have tribulation. But bids them
                            be of good cheer—for he has overcome the world— Peace of Mind was the
                            Supreme good of the Epicurean Philosophy, but they held it resolvable
                            into sensual enjoyment— Philosophy teaches us to bear with composure the
                            ills of Life which we cannot avert— Religion teaches us to bear them
                            with Fortitude and cheerfulness. Enthusiasm, like the doctrine of the
                            Stoics attempt, to disguise them and to deny that they are evils— I
                            cannot subscribe to this creed either philosophical or religious— The
                            approach of death is little compatible with Peace of mind— I have it now
                            before me day and Night. The administration of the communion is a
                            suitable occasion for habituating the Soul to endurance. M<hi

                            minutes rose, passed into my Library room and took 2 hours of morning

                            every one of which is to me a disappointment. My Washington Plumtree,
                            bore about 20 plums which were ripening on the tree— I took off one last

                            I found the tree strip’d, and could see only one left— One of the
                            Baldwin Apple-trees, from Medford, planted in the garden 1831. was
                            girdled by a field mouse— It lived below the Baldwin bud and about 1840.
                            was budded again with the harvest apple— It has born this season 3
                            beautiful harvest apples, now ripe— I had the upper stems of the apple
                            and pear budded trees in the Seminary taken off— The shoots from the
                            Bartlett pear-buds grow creepingly like vines, and bear profusely with

                            period of my life which I am just now reviewing in Memory he was in the

                            with provisions for my family.— I well remember being thus supplied by
                            several frequenters of the market, but have no special personal

                            second family visit from Alexander S. Johnson, since mine to Utica in
                            July 1843. I invited him earnestly to come again, and I should take
                            great delight in keeping up the most cordial intercourse with the
                            descendants of my brother <persRef key="adams-charles"
                            >Charles</persRef>— This young man began his career in New-York under
                            promising auspices.— I hope they may not end in disappointment—
                            Excepting the time that I borrowed this day for exercise, it was
                            occupied with steady assiduity, yet without accomplishing my daily task—
                            I answered a Letter from <persRef ref="peters-john2">John A.
                                Peters</persRef> in behalf of the Managers of the Lyceum at Bangor,
                            inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them in the course of the
                            ensuing autumn— I decline, and must henceforth decline all such
                            invitations.— I cannot sufficiently stamp it upon my will that the short
                            remnant of my life should be exclusively devoted to preparation for my
                            departure— Meantime <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirke</persRef> has trim’d
                            off the parts of stocks over the bud stems of the apple-tree fronting my

                                Louisa’s</persRef> patch, and one in that of my dear departed
                                <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef>—and one Bartlet
                            pear-bud at the eastern end of the Seminary— I had an empty Champagne
                            box, filled with loose earth and placed in a corner of the Seminary, to
                            try the experiment of sowing Washington Plum-stones, Mazzard Cherry
                            Stones, English White Oak Acorns, and Shagbark walnuts for next Spring
                            and Summer.— And with the aid of Kirke, I found five plums still left
                            ripe on the Washington Plum tree— My reminiscences of the year 1805
                            minuted on the last page gave me while I was recalling them many a heart
                            ache. There were some that I have not the heart to record.</p>

                            much impaired— From the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of October
                            1803 to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1807. I sat in the
                            Senate of the United States side by side with M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Plumer the father, and during the latter part of that time
                            in very intimate relations with him— His political opinions during that
                            period coincided more with mine than those of any other public man of
                            considerable distinction in the Country— I was in correspondence with
                            him during my missions in Europe from 1809 to 1817. and for several
                            years after my return home— In 1821. as an Elector of President and
                            Vice-President of the United States he gave his solitary vote for me as
                            President, and he has retained his personal kindness for me to this day—
                            In my controversy with certain Boston federalists in 1829. he stood by
                            me with unshaken fidelity and confirmed with unfaltering integrity my
                            testimony with his own. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer the Son
                            was from 1806. to 1809. one of my pupils at Harvard University. While I
                            was Secretary of State he was several years a member of Congress from
                            New Hampshire, and has been in frequent correspondence with me from that
                            time to this— Men of purer minds and more genuine patriotism exist not
                            upon earth. I hope and trust that in the review of my life, for more
                            than forty years, I may find some materials for the projected memoir of
                            this pious and dutiful Son, which may be creditable to the reputation
                            both of him and of his father; and that I shall on no earthly
                            consideration flinch from the performance of the task— This was a sultry
                            and oppressive Summer day somewhat saddened by fears of lurking night
                            robbers round the house— Suspicions roused by the tintamare of Carbo the
                            watch dog during the night which did not wake me from sleep, but which
                            alarmed all the rest of the family. The dog was missing this morning but
                            returned home this afternoon— I sent to Boston for <persRef
                                ref="bates-stephen2">Bates’s</persRef> Chamber Shower Bath, which
                            was brought out this day, and I had it set up in the eastern cellar of
                            the house— None of the rooms in the house being high enough for its
                            operation— I have been obliged to abandon the usage of Sea and river
                            bathing which for so many years I considered a necessary of life.— The
                            Shower bath is the only substitute left me, and I pine in longing for
                            it— I saw the Sun rise and set from up the hill.</p>

                        <p>I made my first experiment of <persRef ref="bates-stephen2"
                                >Bates’s</persRef> patent chamber shower bath, and imagined that its
                            immediate effect was a sensible improvement of my health— The shock of
                            the shower bath stimulates perspiration. The human body is a colander
                            always emitting humours which if arrested on their passage are turned
                            inward and prey upon the vitals. To this cause I attribute most of the
                            diseases that I have ever suffered, and to my Sea and river bathing and
                            swimming I ascribe much of the health that I have enjoyed, and many

                            through the centre of the lot, and are bound to build a bridge over it

                            correct idea of it to acquiesce in any cession of it which he would
                            approve.— He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bracket had spoken of
                            it to him this morning— And the object of it was to accommodate him— He
                            thought the proprietors of the Railroad ought to give 3 or 400 dollars
                            for it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale when he came with <persRef

                            obtained, and I thought a descent to 3 or 400 ominous. I said therefore
                            that 500 dollars should be demanded, to which he assented.— M<hi

                            that he had never seen any thing so brilliant in the heavens. It is the

                            the American Anti-Slavery Society said to belong to me— He did not, but
                            said the Rooms of the American Anti-Slavery Society were at N. 25
                            Cornhill, the Liberator Office. I went there and refering to Wendell
                            Phillips’s Letter enquired for the Speeches. The Shopman brought me a
                            packet sealed directed simply to me at Boston. I enquired how it came
                            there— He did not know— How long it had been there. He did not know— He
                            had himself been there five years, and he had found it there— How many
                            of such packets there were? about 30— The cover was worn out and torn.—
                            It contained ten copies of my morning hour Speech of June and July 1838.
                            on the right of petition, and upon Texas— I told the Shopman, I would

                            call for me at the rooms of the horticultural rooms at one O’Clock— I
                            went to half a dozen Stationers shops, for a quire of the largest-sized
                            Letter paper, which at last I found 10 3/4 inches by 8 1/4. for which I
                            paid half a dollar double price of the ordinary sized paper 10 by 8. I

                            very numerous and made up in bouquets with elegant taste, and there were

                            and figs. I saw no melons, oranges or pineapples— I bought one dozen of

                        <p>While the second morning bell was ringing, I went to <persRef ref="u"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French’s</persRef> tavern, and

                                Colton</persRef> who came down immediately from his chamber, and
                            went with me to the Stone temple opposite, and, after inspecting the
                            monument of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
                                key="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> of the inscription upon which
                            he asked me for a copy, he took a seat with me in my pew— <persRef
                                ref="lothrop-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel K.
                                Lothrop</persRef> preached, from 2 Corinthians 4.18. [“]While we
                            look not at the things which are seen, but at the things that are not
                            seen.”— the remainder of the verse is—[“]for the things which are seen
                            are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.—” This was
                            omitted from the text, but the whole discourse was a parallel in
                            contrast between external and visible nature, and the internal empire of
                            the soul—between every thing temporary and perishable, and every thing
                            spiritual permanent and immortal.— The text and the chapter are portions
                            of an argument to enforce the doctrine of the immortality of the Soul,
                            as the special object and purpose of the Christian dispensation— There
                            are intimations not very distinct but obscurely given out that he is
                            enduring persecution, and threatened with the loss of his life for
                            preaching this doctrine— What then? he substantially says— We believe,
                            and therefore speak— The outward man may perish, but the inward man is
                            renewed day by day.— You see the body—but it will vanish. It is
                            temporal. It must pass away— You cannot see the Soul— It is of the
                            things which are not seen—but it is eternal. It shall never die.— Look
                            not then at the things which are seen— At the things of a day— Of an
                            hour— Look at the things which are not seen. They are eternal— The naked
                            precept without the context has the appears an inconsistency—an
                            absurdity—and the disciple might reply in the words of <persRef
                                ref="mcfingal">MacFingal</persRef>— But optics sharp it needs I
                            ween, to see what is not to be seen— But with the elucidation of the
                                <persRef ref="paul">Apostle</persRef> it becomes a solemn and
                            sublime principle; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop
                            ingeniously brought it to bear upon the duties of every individual of
                            his hearers. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop and M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton dined with us, and after dinner we
                            rode together to the Temple— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton
                            went to the Episcopal church to hear <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            This also is only the last clause of a verse the remainder of which was
                            omitted.— It is the entrance upon that same exposition of principle for
                            which the text of the morning had been selected.— The drift of the
                            discourse was the same. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton came and
                            walked with me round the garden and nursery, took tea, and spent the
                            Evening with us— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            continues.— There was a thunder shower this morning, and one startling
                            thunder clap while we were at breakfast—but the atmosphere was not swept
                            clean. The day past with alternate shower and Sunshine, sultry and

                            after breakfast and remained with me till near 1. O’Clock P.M— He has
                            ready for the press and Stereotyping at New-York a book in two octavo
                            volumes, to be called the Life and Times of <persRef key="clay-henry"
                                >Henry Clay</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton spoke
                            to me of this work last Spring at Washington— And he comes now to gather
                            materials to interweave in the narrative—of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Clay’s life— Among others of these materials are the
                            incidents of the controversy between me and <persRef

                            Negotiation at Ghent one of the critical periods of my Life. In that

                            benefit of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay against me— He broke down
                            and Clay deserted him.— In 1843. <persRef ref="mallory-daniel">Daniel

                            an Editor of a Newspaper at Louisville Kentucky named <persRef
                                ref="prentice-george">Prentiss</persRef>, equally partial and
                            falsifying— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton’s Life will be an
                            unqualified panegyric, and I do not much rely on the frankness and
                            candour with which he will deal in the differences between M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and me— But he comes to me for
                            information, and I gave it, sparing Clay as much as truth and my
                            conscience would let me— He asked me to lend him my book upon the
                            duplicate Letters, the Fisheries and the Mississippi, which I did— He
                            took it with him Saturday evening to his lodgings at <persRef ref="u"
                                >French’s</persRef> tavern. He returned it to me this morning, and
                            said he had read it— He was inquisitive concerning the Panama mission
                            out of which he expects to weave a magnificent monument of glory to M<hi

                            much in it— I read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton, all the

                            the constant gradual diminution of my nightly Sleep.— I retire to bed
                            regularly soon after 10. O’Clock when I came out here, near the last of
                            May I awoke usually as the Clock struck 4— A month later I was awaked
                            morning after morning by the Clock in the entry striking 3. and now I
                            hear it almost every morning strike two.— I rose this morning a quarter
                            before 3. and was consequently heavy and drowsy the whole day— <persRef

                            and he arrived a few days since, on a leave of absence— I spoke to him
                            of the annuity interest, which had belonged to his Sister, the late

                            his proposal that it should be invested for the benefit of mother and

                            facts which he promised to do— His mother is dying a lingering death
                            already more than five months in agonizing progress, and still
                            protracted hopeless of all relief. When I rose this morning the sky was
                            in an incessant blaze of lightning flashes, but I heard no Thunder—
                            There followed a long and copious shower of rain after which it cleared
                            off, warm, bright and calm for the remainder of the day. I take the
                            Shower bath every morning, and an hour and a half of self-friction and
                            ablution which serves for the exercise of the day.— But my Resolution
                            from the first day of this month to write one Letter every-day has
                            already fallen through. I wrote this day, answers to <persRef

                            meet them at the Western Railroad Depot, upon the arrival at Boston of
                            the afternoon train of Cars, which was done. <persRef
                                ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> was here this
                            morning, and I had some conversation with him concerning his Report and
                            answer to my enquiries, which are satisfactory. M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Quincy anxiously desires that an immediate effort should be
                            made to raise by subscription a further sum of 50000 dollars to provide
                            a permanent support for an observer and assistant at the Cambridge
                            Observatory.— I told him that I should as soon as possible communicate
                            his Answer and the documents annexed to it, to the other members of the
                            Committee of the Overseers; and would urge an immediate appeal to the
                            liberal friends of Science for a further subscription— But I said that
                                <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
                                Lawrence</persRef> at the Meetings of the Committee in the Spring,
                            while favouring this project had dwelt emphatically on the idea, that to
                            ensure its success it would be indispensably necessary, that the funds
                            of the University itself should liberally contribute to make up the sum
                            for this establishment. but I observed that he was very explicit in the
                            opinion that the University could contribute nothing further to this
                            purpose— He said his remarks on this subject were merely his individual
                            opinions, for which the Corporation was not responsible— That M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence was perhaps not aware of what the
                            University had already expended for the accomplishment of this
                            undertaking— But if the Committee should finally think it absolutely
                            necessary to require a further application of the University funds to
                            fill up the contribution from without, he did not wish them to consider
                            his opinion as barring the proposal to the corporation— <persRef

                            that as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett had engaged his passage
                            home in the Liverpool Steamer, to depart on the first of September; and
                            a Letter to him could not reach him before that time—and that my
                            personal relations with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Louis M’Lane were
                            of a nature not to admit of my giving Letters of Introduction to him—

                            had told them that he thought it probable I should decline to give
                            Letters, but he had been willing to ask the favour for them.— I received
                            a Letter from <persRef ref="randall-john3">John C. Randall</persRef>,

                            immediately, declining— My present experience is ascertaining that one
                            page of Diary and one page of a Letter, is the utmost daily labour that
                            I can at this time perform—a sad prognostic for the accomplishment of my
                            tasks. At half past 8 this evening Fuller returned from Boston with the

                        <p>After a calm night and a continuance of the warmth early this morning;
                            about Sunrise an easterly breeze sprung up, and the autumnal Season
                            commenced. I have no doubt that from this day forward, with a clear sky
                            the Star Sirius may be seen rising before the Sun—and that is the
                            Astronomical closing of the dog-days— The Massachusetts Register and
                            United States Calendar of this year 1845 sets down the dog days as
                            beginning on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July and ending
                            the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September— It is said in

                            Article Canicular days, that in an antient Calendar preserved by
                                <persRef ref="bede">Bede</persRef>, the beginning of the dog days
                            was placed on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July, which is
                            perhaps the authority upon which our learned Astronomers and
                            Chronologists now fix it on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> But
                            after numerous changes, Rees says that of late, a very proper alteration
                            has been introduced into the almanacs, and they have been made to
                            commence with the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of July and to finish
                            with the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August, corresponding very
                            well with the Astronomical phenomenon which attributes them to the
                            heliacal rising and setting of Sirius.— <persRef ref="burrill-martha"

                            here. I had sent her papers to the <persRef ref="edwards-james"
                                >Commissioner of Pensions</persRef>, with an enquiry why her pension
                            had been discontinued. I had received the answer of M<hi

                            under the act of 3. March 1837—and was withdrawn by the repeal of the
                            act in 1842. I read to her M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards’s
                            Letter, and returned her papers, equally mortified with the enormous
                            dilapidations of the act of 1837 and at the penurious injustice of the
                            repeal of 1842. filching from this poor widow her pittance of 6 dollars
                            a month because twenty thousand dollars had been without a shadow of

                            event would introduce new considerations regarding the disposal of the
                            funds and new enquiries concerning its distribution— And I advised that
                            if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier should come again, it would be
                            well to enquire of him, what disposal he has made or proposes to make of
                            the funds— This morning I went to Boston, accompanied by <persRef

                            Month. I notice these events as tributary to the history of Steam
                            Navigation and of the world— Of the rumours of War with Mexico, for
                            several of the last days prevalent, I have as yet said nothing, because
                            I do not yet believe them— This morning <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached from Matthew
                            21.28. [“]But what think ye? A certain man had two Sons; and he came to
                            the first, and said, Go, work to day, in my vineyard. 29. He answered
                            and said, I will not; but afterwards he repented, and went. 30. And he
                            came to the second, and said likewise; and he answered and said I go,
                            Sir: and went not. 31. Whether of them twain, did the will of his
                            father?— They say unto him the first”— Here the text stop’d— The
                            remainder of the verse is, “Jesus saith unto them, verily, I say unto
                            you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God
                            before you.” This was the application made by Jesus himself of this
                            parable, to his immediate hearers, the chief-priests and elders of the
                            people, and pharisees, who came to him as he was teaching in the temple,
                            and demanded of him his authority for teaching, and for turning the
                            money changers out of the temple— Jesus retorted upon them their
                            question of his authority by asking them what they thought of the
                            baptism of <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John</persRef>; whether it was
                            from Heaven, or of men? They were afraid to answer him, and said they
                            could not tell—whereupon he refuses to tell them his authority— But he
                            gives out this parable to justify his mission to publicans, and harlots
                            in preference to them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt however dwelt
                            entirely upon the commandment Go, work, today, in my vineyard—and he
                            expatiated with vivid eloquence upon the duty incumbent upon all
                            Christians to work in the vineyard of the Lord, and concluding with an
                            apologue of Ben Hassan, to whom a Genius appeared on three successive
                            Nights saying go—work in my vineyard— Ben Hassan makes each Night some
                            frivolous excuse for not heeding the voice of the Genius, and disobeying
                            his command. The Genius comes and repeats it the fourth time, when Ben
                            Hassan starts to go to work, stumbles at the first step, and falls into
                            his grave— A striking lesson which I had heard before— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave out as the second hymn of the
                            morning service, the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of his collection—
                            My version of the 67<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. His afternoon
                            text was from Psalm 51.6. [“]Behold, thou desirest truth, in the inward
                            parts.”—omitting the remainder of the verse—and in the hidden part thou
                            shalt make me to know wisdom—This is one of the penitential psalms, but
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s special theme was the
                            inflexible adherence to truth in the inward parts— A fertile soil, but a
                            beaten path— Truth and Good are the Heaven of <persRef

                        <p>In the patch of my central seminary row, next but one to the barn, I
                            planted one of the Stones of the Duane purple plums which I purchased
                            last Saturday at the Horticultural Rooms— I marked it with a small stake
                            to ascertain if it will come up next Spring, though I never retain the
                            memory of these notices from season to season— There are<space/>patches in
                            the Seminary untenanted because my plantations in them heretofore have
                            failed.— I have had them now filled with fresh earth; and intend to sow
                            and plant in them for next Summer’s vegetation— We had visits this day

                            of July has been down to Eastport and Passamaquoddy, and then to
                            Plymouth, and the Old Colony. He is now on his return home, accompanied
                            by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tillson</persRef>,
                            a native of Plymouth County, but now an inhabitant of Quincy, Adams
                            County Illinois— Scarce a single day passes but I receive newspapers,
                            pamphlets or books, very often without notice from whom; and I cannot
                            even conjecture. Sometimes from friend—occasionally from foe. One day to
                            ask permission to dedicate a book to me. Another insulting and
                            scurrilous— I am too much tickled with the flattery—too much prickled
                            with the abuse. I ought to receive both with profound indifference— I

                            no longer to procrastinate the binding of 5 volumes of my miscellaneous

                            form, chronologically assorted to be bound in five volumes to be given

                            foresee— Some of them have had a temporary popularity— But Volumes have

                            leave a demand for them after the occasions which produced them have
                            passed away.— Their popularity has been evanescent, and I have no right
                            to hope that they will ever emerge from that class of literary labours,

                            author, a pamphlet of 156 pages on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery,
                            by <persRef ref="spooner-lysander">Lysander Spooner</persRef>— A man
                            with whom I have already had some not very pleasant relations, and who
                            in pursuing principles to their extreme consequences, heeds not of whom
                            or of what he runs foul. I have also received half a dozen copies of the
                            annual address delivered before the Cincinnati Astronomical Society.

                            usefulness of Astronomical Science, and observatories are in many
                            respects new, and specially applicable to our western States, to the
                            surveys and admeasurements of the public Lands, and to the political
                            condition and history past and future of our western States— In reading
                            it, and the Reports of the board of Control, and of Professor Mitchell,
                            the question occurred to me whether I could not from these materials
                            elicit some pregnant ideas, for the organization of the Astronomical
                            Observatory at Harvard University, and for a final Report to the House
                            of Representatives of the United States upon the Smithsonian bequest?

                            was gone to the white mountains, and was expected home this day. I
                            returned to Amory hall, and gave a sitting of an hour for my bust to

                            with him, a Scotchman who some 25 years ago was breeding a revolution in
                            Canada, till the Colonial Government without regard to any Habeas Corpus
                            Laws, took him up bodily and sent him off to England, where they tried
                            and acquitted him—since which he has been a dead Letter— He still keeps
                            up an obscure War, with the colonial government, but cannot or dares not
                            return to his residence there, and has lived the last two or three years
                            at Boston— His conversation is entertaining, though he still affects the
                            character of a reformer. At 11. O’Clock I walked up to the State-house,

                            I had drawn up on the reference of the communication from the
                            Corporation of the resignation of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
                                >President Josiah Quincy</persRef>. The report was of 3. Resolutions
                            proposed for adoption by the board of Overseers. 1. A full and
                            unqualified concurrence with the sentiments of personal respect and
                            approbation of the administration of the Presidents Office by M<hi

                            resignation. 2. A resolution of special commendation upon three points
                            of peculiar merits in the administration of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Quincy, not noticed in the Letter signed by the members of
                            the Corporation— 1. His inflexible firmness in maintaining the necessary
                            discipline. 2. His exertions to elevate the standard of acquisitions for
                            admission to the University, and to enlarge the circle of Science
                            attainable within its system of instructions and 3. His History of the
                            University— 3. That a copy of these Resolutions signed by the <persRef

                            Walley intimated some objection to the first of my Resolutions
                            expressing entire concurrence with the Letter of the Corporation— I
                            offered to consider any amendment which he would propose, but judge
                            White defended the Resolution so earnestly that M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Walley said he would assent to it as it was.— The Meeting of
                            the Overseers was thinly attended. <persRef ref="bigelow-john">John P.

                            of them all; which was unanimously adopted. I read my report which was
                            also unanimously accepted, without a word of remark from any one. I
                            asked <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

                        <p>The fire last evening was of the barn of <persRef ref="edward-pray"
                                >Captain Edward Pray</persRef> in Braintree near Weymouth landing.
                            His Store was damaged, but not consumed. This morning I was surprized by
                            the appearance of a shoot from the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            shagbark seedling<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> which first came up in
                            the corner square of the orchard behind the garden, last Summer— I
                            barely noticed them then. When I first visited the spot last Spring 3.
                            May, there was no vestige of the stems that had come up last year. They
                            had been all winter killed— At the second visit 23. May, one stem was
                            up, much like that which now appears— It was killed within a fortnight
                            afterwards by a sharp frosty Night, and has vanished. The second third
                            and fourth came up successively in May, June and July with stems four,
                            three and two inches long, and put out each 3 lateral stalks on each of
                            which 3 or 5 leaflets have expanded to their usual size on the full
                            grown tree. The stem after its first shoot grows no more— The object of
                            nursing it by cultivation would be to form a bud at the top of the stem
                            from which the stem of the next year would spring— This I have never
                            been able to do, but never before the present Season have I had the
                            opportunity to observe the progress of vegetation of this walnut
                            seedling through the whole summer from day to day. I have been watching
                            full six weeks for the appearance of the 5<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> stem, and had given it up in despair, when I found it up
                            its full length this morning in two shoots. No trace of the first
                            remains above ground—nor is there a single stem up from any of the nuts
                            which I committed to the ground last Autumn— I trimme off a number of
                            shoots, one of them 3 feet 9 inches long grown this year from the stump
                            of an old apple tree, which I trimmd last year by way of experiment— I
                            now left one shoot near four feet long, and still growing.— My old
                            hickory 40 years of age bears this year more than usual. One horse plum
                            sucker bears this year for the first time— I had this day no
                            interruption but answered a Letter from <persRef ref="derby-mary">M<hi

                            called on me this morning, and left with me a printed circular
                            advertisement of the Trustees of Milton Academy of whom he is one. They
                            have engaged <persRef ref="chute-ariel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                                Ariel P. Chute</persRef> as Principal, to commence on the 6<hi

                            several years connected with the Warren Academy, at Woburn— There is in
                            the Quincy Patriot of this morning an Article, signed a Parent,
                            referring to the donations of <persRef key="adams-john">my
                                father</persRef> to the town of Quincy, especially to that for the
                            erection of a Stone School house over the cellar of the Hancock house,
                            and enquiring into the condition of that fund with a view to the
                            erection of that school house— I said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lunt that I was glad to see that Article, and thought it quite time for
                            the town of Quincy to consider of the expediency and propriety of
                            undertaking to erect this building— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
                            made no objection but seemed to take no interest in the suggestion— I
                            must undertake it against wind and tide— And the first thing to be done
                            is to propose it to the Supervisors of the fund, and then to the town—

                            most abject language of supplication, praying for pardon for the

                                Charles T. Torrey</persRef>, now for six years, the first of which
                            is nearly completed in the Maryland Penitentiary, for aiding and
                            abetting Slaves in the attempt to escape from their chains— They call it
                            negro-stealing. For the Offence in Virginia Torrey has been indicted and
                            demanded by the Governor of Virginia, of the Governor of Maryland, but
                            never tried nor even arrested— Yet the prayer for pardon is in the same
                            terms, with that to the Governor of Maryland— A crouching Spaniel under
                            the lash of its master, is an image of lofty Independence, compared with
                            the prostration of these petitions signed by <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"

                            Massachusetts— I was requested to sign them and young Ide said his
                            father had been desirous that my name should stand first of the
                            signers.— <persRef ref="torrey-mary2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            to render any service in my power to obtain the release and liberation
                            of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torrey, but I declined signing the
                            petition, and thought it a much more grievous offence against moral
                            principle, than the acts which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torrey is
                            expiating in the penitentiary— I specified my objections to the
                            petitions and M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thayer said he had
                            foreseen and foretold that I would refuse to sign them.— He asked if I
                            had any objection to their being presented to my Son for his signature—
                            I answered none in the world— <persRef key="adams-charles2">My
                                Son</persRef> had a judgment of his own, and I wished him to
                            exercise it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ide said he had no doubt his

                        <p>The lightening of the last evening’s storm struck in two places in this
                            town of Quincy and set fire to a barn which was consumed with eight tons
                            of hay.— This day the Sun was bright, without abatement of the Summer
                            heat. <persRef ref="lamson-alvan">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Alvan
                                Lamson</persRef> of Dedham preached his morning text was from 2
                            Corinthians 3.6. The same from which <persRef ref="lothrop-samuel">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop</persRef> had preached this
                            day fortnight.— [“]For the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life.”
                                D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamson opened the drift of his
                            discoure by observing that in every thing connected with the nature and
                            condition of man there was a Letter and a Spirit, and that in every
                            thing, death was inseparbly connected with the Letter, and life with the
                            Spirit— This general principle he illustrated by a great variety of
                            specifications, and numerous quotations from the new testament, among
                            which the declaration of Jesus in Luke 14.26.— “If any man come to me,
                            and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren
                            and sisters, yea, and his life also, he cannot be my disciple” was one—
                                D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lamson dined with us; and I said to
                            him that this saying of Jesus was the figure of speech in rhetoric was a
                            hyperbole— That all his language was figurative that one of the
                            evangelists says he never spoke without a parable—that is without a
                            fictitious tale, a metaphor, an allegory or a symbol. That among his
                            frequent figurative forms of speech was the hyperbole, which expresses
                            more than it means— And I said that was my interpretation of all his
                            precepts for the forgiveness of injuries— When if smitten on one cheek
                            he tells his disciple to turn the other to be smitten also—when if a man
                            takes your coat, he bids you give him your cloak, when if he compels you
                            to go with him one mile you are commanded to go with him twain— All
                            these are Hyperboles expressing more than they mean.— D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamson said he concurred with me in these
                            opinions— His afternoon Sermon was from Matt 21.28.— “Son, go, work to
                            day, in my vineyard” a small part of the same text, from which M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt preached last Sunday morning.— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamson however took a different view of
                            the subject— As the command was to work to<hi rend="italic">-day</hi> in
                            the lord’s vineyard, he dwelt with most emphasis upon the word <hi
                                rend="italic">to-day</hi>, and undertook to expound the full import
                            and meaning of a Christian’s working day—how its morning should be
                            opened with humble and fervent prayer— Its noontide and afternoon with
                            labours for self support, and in the discharge of duties to promote the
                            wefare and happiness of others; and its close at Night with a strict and
                            conscientious review of the past; with the voice of gratitude to God,
                            for the continuance of existence and for all blessings received, and
                            meditations of future good, soothing the spirit to repose— An excellent
                            discourse, though a still more comprehensive exposition of this parable
                            might form an interesting lecture, analysing the contrasted character of
                            the two brothers—the peculiarity of the question, which of the two did
                            the will of the father, and the turn given by the wisdom of Jesus from
                            the enquiry by what authority he did these things to his closing
                            declaration that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
                            God before the inquisitors into his authority.— I read a second time,
                            the Sermon of <persRef ref="dike-samuel">Samuel F. Dike</persRef>, at
                            the Dedication of the New Jerusalem Temple in Bath, Maine, on the
                            Doctrines of the New Jerusalem— The doctrine of correspondence is
                            diluted into something like sense.</p>

                                >Edwards</persRef>, brothers visited me this morning, one of them
                            being now a resident in this town of Quincy, and the other having been
                            so heretofore, but having removed to the western Country, and here only
                            on a visit to see his brother— Their call on me was merely of curiosity,
                            and my conversation with them was of little interest. <persRef

                            said there had been in some English Newspaper, and republished perhaps
                            in the New-York herald an advertisement calling for information of the
                            heirs of <persRef ref="young-john4">John Young</persRef> a man who had
                            emigrated from England and died in this country, but it was not known
                            where— The motive for the advertisement was not stated— It was probable
                            there might be large property coming to the heirs of John Young—but it
                            might be from creditors seeking for property to answer for debts. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane said that the name of <persRef
                                ref="crane-pamelia">his wife’s</persRef> father had been <persRef
                                ref="young-john5">John Young</persRef>, but they had no knowledge of
                            where he was in the latter years of his life nor where he died.— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane wanted advice how to proceed in his
                            enquiries on this subject— I thought his first process should be to
                            procure the newspapers in which the advertisement had appeared—one of
                            which he knew was the true Sun of New-York—but of what date he did not
                            know. I said it must be easy to ascertain at the Office where that paper
                            is published. There he might learn from whom and for what purpose the
                            advertisement was issued—whether M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Crane’s
                            father was the individual whose heirs were enquired for and if so, by
                            what evidence his identity could be proved to the advertiser. This step,
                            to procure the paper containing the advertisement I thought preliminary
                            to all further proceedings in the case, on his part— <persRef

                            several apple, and several pear seedling stocks— But he said he did not
                            expect that any one of them would succeed, the extreme heat and dryness
                            of the Season having withered the germ of the buds, so that they would
                            not take and live on the foreign stock.— <persRef ref="frothingham-ann"

                        <p>I went into Boston this morning with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C
                                Smith</persRef>, and my grand daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
                                >Mary-Louisa</persRef>. They alighted at <persRef ref="foster-james"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef>.— I
                            proceeded to Amory Hall and gave a sitting of an hour to <persRef
                                ref="king-john5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> for
                            my bust— He labours his work very much but I fear is not likely to
                            obtain a likeness— I then attended the monthly meeting of the
                            Massachusetts historical Society, but there were scarcely numbers of
                            members present sufficient to constitute a meeting— The President of the
                            Society <persRef ref="savage-james">James Savage</persRef> was there,
                            but said he had been obliged to leave his bed with a fever to attend the
                            meeting— There was no business before the meeting. Some time ago there
                            had been adopted a Resolution that dividing the resident members of the
                            Society into three Sections alphabetically, it should be the special
                            duty of the members of one of the Sections alternately to present some
                            communication to the meeting. The 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
                            Section includes the members from A to F—the second from G to P—the 3<hi
                                rend="superscript">d.</hi> from Q to the end of the alphabet— My
                            name is of course in the first Section, and the recording Secretary
                                <persRef ref="willard-joseph3">Joseph Willard</persRef> in the
                            printed circular notice of the meeting inserted a special notice that
                            the Society would be ready to receive communications from the respective
                            members of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Section— The meeting the
                            day before commencement is never well attended— The only communication
                            that I could, I did make— I presented the July number of the American
                            Review, which contains my Essay on Society and civilization, and a copy
                            of the annual address delivered before the Cincinnati Astronomical
                            Society last June by <persRef ref="mansfield-edward">E. D. Mansfield
                                    Esq<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> with the Reports of
                            the board of control and of the Director of the observatory, <persRef
                                ref="mitchel-ormsby">professor Mitchel</persRef>.— With these
                            presents I ought to have made some remarks were it but to stimulate the
                            few members present to take more interest in the regular monthly
                            meetings of the Society and to urge upon every member the duty of
                            contributing something be it ever so small to make the Society useful.—
                            But I had not considered the subject sufficiently in advance.— I had my
                            Letter to <persRef ref="colton-calvin">Calvin Colton</persRef> in my
                            hand, and <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P. Davis</persRef> seeing it
                            offered to put it into the Post Office for me which saved me some time.
                            the meeting adjourned.— I took up Miss Smith and Mary Louisa, at M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster’s and we returned to Quincy to
                            dine— The afternoon was occupied in writing out the journal of
                            yesterday, and in hesitating whether to remain at Cambridge to morrow
                            night, or to return in the Evening, and go to Cambridge again Thursday
                            Morning— I made preparation for staying over night, and finally
                            concluded to return home to-morrow night and go again on Thursday.</p>

                            and we immediately to Gore-Hall, where the President and members of the

                            honorary degrees were to be conferred, all of which were confirmed— The
                            Resolutions of the board of Overseers honorary to President Quincy had
                            been sent by <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            suggested to him that in presenting the resolutions he would add some
                            kind and complimentary words of his own. I now made myself the request
                            to the Governor who readily assented regretting that he had not received
                            earlier notice of the expectation. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy
                            was also notified that this address would be made to him and would
                            require some few words of answer from him—the fewer the better. The
                            procession to the church was then formed and the usual exercises were
                            performed by the members of the graduating class—none by the candidates
                            for the master degrees, that part of the ceremonies having ceased in
                            1843 and for all future time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy the
                            conferred the degrees of bachelors then of masters of Arts—then of

                            the procession then was formed to University Hall to dinner.
                            The<space/>Psalm was sung. I went to the President’s house whence we
                            returned to Quincy.</p>

                            my Son, and his Son John Quincy, and leaving them at the depot of the
                            train of the Railway cars for New-Bedford, at the foot of the Common in
                            Boston, I proceeded alone to Cambridge, and just before 8 alighted at

                            Senior Class—none of the junior Class— One of the Class yesterday
                            graduated, and one of the Seniors did not perform.— We proceeded to the
                            new Church opposite to the College yard, where a small company of
                            auditors were assembled—more of Ladies than of men— Of the subjects

                            deficiency of intense feeling, a dull uniformity of gesticulation, and a
                            failure in the contrasted elevation and depression of the voice which
                            nature stamps on the passions of man— There were 11 speakers, and 11.

                        <p>There is an excitement in the multitudes of persons and rapid evolution
                            of incidents in the two successive days of Commencement at Harvard
                            University, and of the prize-declamations and Φ.B.K. of the next day,
                            that after they are over it seems to me as if I have been in a trance,
                            living, moving and being in another world different from that of my
                            present habitual existence— Commencement day carries me back to that on
                            which I was myself graduated one of the exquisitely happy days, yet
                            saddened with the pang of parting forever from loved associates, and
                            from cherished studies to enter upon another career of anticipations
                            full of timid hope and awful fear—one of the dies fasti of my life—and
                            that by an association of ideas opens the vista of my whole collegiate
                            period, so short and yet so memorable to me—the friendships then
                            contracted, the extraordinary incidents of my preceding life, and the
                            long interval of 58 years, with all its eventful vicissitudes since
                            elapsed, all these retrospections crowding at once upon my memory shake
                            my shattered nerves and confuse my mind till my whole past life flashes
                            before me like a luminous dream I said yesterday at the dinner that I
                            had entered upon the sixtieth year of my membership of the Φ.B.K. and it
                            startled the juveniles before me. The retirement of <persRef

                            the two last days— <persRef ref="rives-william">W. C. Rives</persRef>

                            re-election— Warren presided at the dinner, with the sprightly wit and
                            humour which runs in the Otis and Warren blood— This morning, autumnal
                            cold, I took my daily shower bath, and endeavoured to resume my hacknied
                            occupations, but could not entirely recover from the dissipation of
                            yesterday, and the day before. <persRef ref="julian-hs">H. S.

                            dined with us.— A few days after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay

                            inefficient to restore to me the stedfastness of my nerves— My physical
                            powers are deserting me; and especially that of writing. Prayer itself
                            leaves me helpless, and the prospect before me is appalling. A young man

                            I asked his age, he said 18. and from his conversation I have no doubt
                            he would stand high on the roll of studies. I told him I would write to
                            the <persRef ref="marcy-william">Secretary of War</persRef> and have his
                            name entered as a candidate for a warrant, and would transmit his
                            recommendations to be filed at the Department—but I must apprize him,
                            that I had already presented the names of two other candidates with very
                            strong recommendations for that same appointment, and if called upon
                            next March to nominate I might feel it my duty to name the earliest

                                >King Louis-Philippe</persRef> to paint for him the portraits of the

                            be there at two O’Clock. I agreed to sit for him two hours next
                            Wednesday, from 11. or half past 11. O’Clock at <persRef

                            the persons whose portraits he desired, but that might have made it
                            necessary to enlarge the number, which a necessity for some limitation
                            had restricted him to 3 living characters— Healy says M<hi

                            preached this morning from Luke 16.1. “And he said also unto his
                            disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a Steward; and the
                            same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.” This was the
                            text. The discourse was an exposition of the whole parable of the unjust
                            Steward, and even of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 16<hi
                                rend="superscript">th</hi> Chapters of which M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lunt must be read together comprizing not only this parable
                            but four others three of which are related in the 13<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter— That of the man who had lost
                            one of an hundred sheep—that of the woman who lost one of ten pieces of
                            silver, and the story of the prodigal Son. The closing parable of the
                                16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter is that of the rich man
                            and <persRef ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef>.— All these are parts of
                            one and the same discourse— Multitudes of Publicans and Sinners had
                            assembled and followed him to hear him preach— The pharisees and Scribes
                            made this a charge of reproach against him that he received and ate with
                            vicious and odious companions— By these parables he met and repelled
                            these censures which were highly plausible, and in each of the parables
                            there is a special, distinct and precious lesson of instruction— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt pointed out the vital shades of
                            difference between the several principles taught by them.— There was a
                            passage in this particular parable of the unjust Steward, which had
                            given rise to much difficulty of construction, owing to misconceptions
                            of the precise point of morals which it was the purpose of the teacher
                            to inculcate— The unjust Steward called to account by his Lord and
                            unable to meet the call, combines with the debtors to defraud him of
                            their real amount by deducting 50 per cent from one bill and 20 per cent
                            from another.— The fraud succeeds— The lord is cheated of his dues—and
                            the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse of the chapter say the Lord
                                <hi rend="italic">commanded</hi> the unjust Steward, because he had
                            done wisely—for the children “of this world are in their generation
                            wiser than the children of light”— This commendation of the Lord M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt endeavoured to explain away, but the
                            difficulty is insuperable. The Lord upon discovering the cheat practised
                            by his faithless Steward upon himself, commends him for the wisdom of
                            his knavish expedient to indemnify the Steward for the loss of his
                            place, by obtaining a share of the plunder from the dishonest debtors.
                            The commendation is limited to the prudence of the Steward in providing
                            a final retreat for himself—and the advice to the disciples to make to
                            themselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, rather entangles
                            than solves the doubt of the purity of this story as a lesson of
                            morals.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon text was from
                            John 1.14. “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us[”]—one of
                            the strong holds of the Trinitarians, and believers in the divinity of
                            Jesus Christ— Unitarian preachers seldom handle these texts
                            successfully. How the word could be made flesh is to me and must ever in
                            this life remain a mystery. No definite idea can be affixed to these
                            expression. An evacuated Irish Shanty an appendage to the Old Colony
                            railroad and immediately behind my barns and outhouses was set fire to,
                            by no one knows whom, this Evening—and burnt down. We were for a time in
                            great alarm for the barns and the house. </p>
