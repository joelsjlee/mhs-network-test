								Beale</persRef> called on me this morning to enquire the price of
							one of my gallery pews in the Stone Temple. I asked him which of them
							was desired— He said he wanted two— One for <persRef
								ref="emmons-nathaniel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Emmons</persRef> who is building a house opposite to his, and the
							other for <persRef ref="bigelow-george">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> George T. Bigelow</persRef>, who is also about to build
							near the <persRef ref="miller-caroline">widow</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef> whose daughter <persRef
								ref="miller-hannah2">Hannah</persRef> is his wife— M<hi

								ref="emmons-elizabeth">daughter</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="wales-thomas">Thomas Beale Wales</persRef>, by <persRef
								ref="beale-ann2">Ann Beale</persRef> sister of George W. Beale— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Emmons and Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Bigelow are both inhabitants of Boston, but are preparing
							for Summer residence at Quincy— I said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Beale that I did not know what to ask for a gallery pew— He said he knew
							what it had cost me—50 dollars— I told him I should not ask more than
							that and the interest of the money.— I promised to look up my deeds of
							gallery pews and give speedily a definitive answer— I made an effort
							this day to resume the routine of my daily occupations broken up by the
							dissipations of Commencement week— I devoted the morning to the Journal
							of yesterday, and after dinner to writing two short Letters— One in
							answer to <persRef ref="colton-calvin">Calvin Colton</persRef> who in a
							Letter dated New-York 28. August asks my permission to publish a
							paragraph of my last Letter to him of 25 August—concerning the Letter of
								<persRef ref="rhea-john">John Rhea</persRef>, in the imbecility of
							second childhood or bought with the money or promises of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, affirming falsely the
							connivance of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> with Jackson’s military Occupation of Florida in
							1809.— Colton wants to disclose all the facts of this specimen of
							Jackson’s honour and honesty— <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel"
								>Gouverneur</persRef> also wishes the whole story divulged, but kept
							the secret during Jacksons life from motives of prudence and now keeps
							it still for fear of Jackson’s ghost— To all these transactions I was
							knowing only by correspondence. It is not for me to make myself busy for
							its publication. Jackson’s vengeful hatred of Monroe was stimulated by
							Monroes disavowal of his conquest of Florida.— His hatred of me was
							stimulated by my services in saving him from the public indignation—and
							he glutted his revenge upon us both in the same way, by spinning out of
							his own brain fictitious, and slanderous charges against us— If the
							metempsicosis of <persRef ref="pythagoras">Pythagoras</persRef> were a
							doctrine of Christian faith, the Soul of Andrew Jackson would be a
							derelict from the body of <persRef ref="william-iii">William the third
								of Orange</persRef>, the glorious deliverer of Ireland—the murderer
							of the <persRef ref="dewitt-cornelius;dewitt-john">two De
								Witts</persRef>, and the Hero of the battle of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Denis, fought four days after the peace
							of Nimeguen— My other Letter was to <persRef ref="marcy-william">William
								L. Marcy</persRef>, Secretary of War, requesting that the name of
								<persRef ref="dickerman-enos">Enos T. Dickerman</persRef> of
							Stoughton may be entered on the books of the War Department as a
							Candidate for a Warrant of Cadet at the Military Academy at West point,
							for the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of
							Massachusetts in the appointments of 1846. and with this Letter I
							enclosed the 5 recommendatory documents which young Dickerman had left
							with me— Another evacuated Irish Shanty just below our orchard was set
							fire to, and burnt this evening. <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Miss

						<p>A black man by the name of <persRef ref="humphries-joseph">Joseph P.
								Humphries</persRef> came this morning to visit me, and ask for
							advice. He comes from Charleston South-Carolina, with certificates of
							conduct and character from white men of whom I know nothing, but who I
							suppose pass for respectable persons in that region— He comes from
							Charleston, because being free, having learnt to read and write, and
							being a taylor by trade he cannot live in that glorious exemplification
							of democracy the State of South-Carolina— He comes to settle in
							Massachusetts, and apprehensive of the prejudices against his colour in
							Boston, said his inclination was to fix himself in some small country
							town— I told him that I thought the prejudice against his colour would
							be more annoying to him in any country town than in Boston— That in
							country towns he would find very few if any of his own colour, with whom
							to associate, or from whom to derive countenance and support— In Boston
							he might exercise his trade and the people of his colour of whom there
							are many of respectable standing would afford him society and
							employment. He thanked me for the advice, and said that several of his
							friends in Boston had given him the same— This afternoon <persRef
								ref="cowdin-elliot">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot C.
								Cowdin</persRef> and <persRef ref="peterson-fa">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> F. A. Peterson</persRef> came as a
							Committee in behalf of the Mercantile library association and requested
							me to deliver a lecture before that institution this autumn before the
							next meeting of Congress. I assured them it would give me great pleasure
							to comply with their request if possible; but I apprehended that it
							would not be in my power— They said if I would repeat any lecture that I
							had given heretofore elsewhere, it would give the company entire
							satisfaction, but I have an invincible repugnance to that— I have now on
							hand more than I can possibly perform for the present autumn— These
							gentlemen were however so urgent, that I requested them to call on me
							again about the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this and promised
							to give them then a definitive answer so far as may be in my power— To
							this they acceded.— <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Miss Welsh</persRef>

						<p>There is a change of feelings in the condition of physical existence
							consequent upon the change of the Seasons for which I cannot account and
							which I cannot describe— I have been sensible of it every year of my
							life— The principal change usually occurs to me in July and was once
							marked by a severe intermittent fever of 8 days, at Töplitz in Bohemia.
							It has several times since been attended with slighter indispositions
							perhaps this year superseded by my fits of lumbago through the month of
							June.— I presume that the shower bath which I have taken every morning
							from the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month to this day has
							had considerable effect on the course of nature, and that the symptoms
							of gradual bodily decay are modified by it— Without actual sickness I
							have been several days not well, but not knowing what ails me— I went
							this morning to Boston with <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet
								Welsh</persRef>, and alighted at Amory Hall where we parted— She is
							going to England by the Steamer which is to sail on the first of next
							month to visit for one year <persRef
								ref="hodgkinson-william;hodgkinson-anne">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hodgkinson</persRef>
							by their invitation.— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hodgkinson once
							Ann Hinckley is a beautiful native American, of adventures somewhat
							romantic but now soberly settled as the wife of a wealthy English
							Country Gentleman in England— Harriet Welsh is the last waif from the

								Welsh</persRef> whose wife <persRef ref="welsh-abigail">Abigail
								Kent</persRef> was a first cousin of <persRef key="adams-abigail">my

							important years of my life from 1790 to 1794— I gave a sitting of two
							hours to <persRef ref="king-john5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef> the Sculptor whose progress in taking my bust is
							inconceivably slow and who to my judgment has not yet reached one

							call on him at <persRef ref="hubbard-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles Hubbard</persRef> painting room—N 11 1/2 Tremont
							row at 11. or 1/2 past 11. O’Clock— It was past 12 when I got there and

								ref="harding-chester">Harding’s</persRef> painting room in
							School-street where <persRef ref="page-william">Page</persRef> had

								<persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef> was lying at the
							point of death at Cambridge, not expected to survive this day. He had
							determined to resign his Office as a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court and
							to embark next month on a voyage to England— I sat to M<hi

							struck two, and then immediately returned to Quincy alone— I had agreed
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Healy to give each of them another sitting next Friday— when
							I reached home <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>

						<p>The Steamer Caledonia, <persRef ref="u">Captain Lott</persRef>, arrived
							at Boston yesterday morning, having left Liverpool on the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month. Among her passengers are
								<persRef ref="codman-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John
								Codman</persRef> and <persRef ref="parkman-francis">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Parkman</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="swift-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Swift</persRef> and his son <persRef ref="swift-henry">Henry
								Swift</persRef>, residents at Germantown came to enquire if I could
							accommodate them with a loan of 2000 dollars, upon a temperance hotel
							which they propose to build in that part of Quincy—taking a mortgage
							upon the place. I told them that <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								son</persRef> had the management of my affairs in this State, and
							knew better than myself, whether I have property to that amount of which
							this disposal could be made. He was now absent from home but I expected
							his return this evening—upon which I would ascertain from him whether I
							could accept their proposal, and would let them know. On my return from
							Boston yesterday, I found the five volumes of my miscellaneous writings,
							which I have collected to leave as a bequest to my Son, returned from
							the book binder <persRef ref="gill-caleb">Caleb Gill</persRef>,
							handsomely bound in calf. There are Articles in Volume 1. 17. Vol. 2. 8. Vol 3. 14. Vol. 4. 24.
							Vol. 5. 28. in all 91. The first volume begins with the Oration
							delivered at Boston 4 July 1793. The 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							volume closes with the Lecture on Society and civilization—chiefly
							written in 1822—but first delivered in 1840 and first published in the
							American Review of last July. The Article immediately preceding it is my
							Address to my Constituents of 2. April 1845— The space of time between
							the first and last of these publications is 52 years— The Lectures on
							Rhetoric and Oratory 2. Volumes, and the Silesian Letters. 1. Volume are
							distinct publications not included in these. The Oration which I
							delivered at Cambridge<space/>July 1787. was published in a Magazine or
							Review at Philadelphia in September of that year of which I had at the
							time a copy but it has disappeared— The papers signed Publicola, in the
							Boston Centinel 1791. were republished in a pamphlet in England, but I
							was never able to procure a copy of it. Those of Marcellus, Columbus and
							Barnevelt were published only in the Boston Newspapers The report to the
							Senate in the case of <persRef ref="smith-john6">John Smith</persRef>,
							should have been in this collection, but whatever copies I had of it
							when published in 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> are lost. The
							correspondence with the British Government upon the Slaves carried away
							in violation of the Treaty of Ghent before the reference to the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> and sundry other
							diplomatic documents are yet missing, but this is the most complete,
							daguerrotype reflection of my mind, for more than half a century that
							ever has been or ever will be made— This evening my Son returned with
							his son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> from his
							fishing excursion of 8 days to Holmes’s Hole— He comes back unwell with
							a sore throat and could not come down from the hill. <persRef
								ref="fuller-gardiner">Fuller</persRef> went into Boston, and brought
							him out in the Carriage at 8 O’Clock in the Evening in a heavy shower. </p>

						<p>Funeral of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Ann widow of <persRef

						<p><persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> came home last Night very
							ill, though it was not made known to me till this day— He had taken a
							severe cold last Tuesday at Holmes’s hole, and on Wednesday morning
							found himself seized suddenly with a violent cough, hoarseness, sore
							throat and fever— He remained however there till yesterday morning, when
							he returned by a Steamer to New-Bedford which he reached at Noon— There
							he was detained 3 hours to take the railway cars, and saw <persRef
								ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grinnell</persRef> but could not visit <persRef ref="grinnell-sarah"
								>his Lady</persRef>. It was past 6 O’Clock when he arrived in the
							railway train from New-Bedford at Boston. He had written to <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> last Monday, giving notice
							that he proposed to come home on Thursday and requesting that <persRef
								ref="fuller-gardiner">Fuller</persRef> might be sent to meet him at
							the depot of the Providence railroad with the Carriage at 5— p.m of
							yesterday— Fuller went accordingly; but it was half past 6. when the
							Cars arrived, and before coming out he went and took advice of <persRef
								ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bigelow</persRef>, who directed him on reaching home to shut himself up
							and keep house for some days— From 6. O’Clock last evening till 8 when
							he arrived, I was in extreme uneasiness, fearing that some disastrous
							accident had befallen on him in the railway cars— He arrived in a shower
							of rain— The family of <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Ann Adams</persRef> had depended upon him to make all
							the arrangements for her funeral this afternoon— In the delay of his
							arrival last evening, <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> came
							to me for directions. I named to him <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas;greenleaf-daniel">Thomas and Daniel
								Greenleaf</persRef>—<persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">Lemuel
								Bracket</persRef>, <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">Josiah
								Brigham</persRef>, <persRef ref="beale-george">George W.
								Beale</persRef> and <persRef ref="whitney-john3">John
								Whitney</persRef>, to be requested to serve as Pall-holders— When he
							came I directed Kirk to go up the hill and ask him to come and speak
							with me about the Pall holders— He sent me back word that he was
							somewhat fatigued; and that there was no occasion for Pallholders, the
							custom of having any at funerals being in this part of the country
							discontinued— This morning, under the depression of Spirits, of
							increasing tremulous debility, still encroaching upon my physical powers
							like the surge of a rising tide, I first learnt the illness of my Son.
							After an early dinner I went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>my wife</persRef> to his house, and found him with a hoarse cough
							and sore throat scarcely able to speak.— He was of course confined to
							his house. I went with my wife, <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef>, her daughter
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, to the house where
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Ann Adams has resided since May
							1829. and where she died— Many of her relatives of her own family and of
							ours, together with her neighbours of her late residence male and female
							were there assembled. The house was filled— Her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>, her Son <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-john3">John Quincy Adams</persRef>, her sisters <persRef
								ref="greenough-mary">Greenough</persRef>
							<persRef ref="foster-frances">Foster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="harrod-elizabeth">Stebbins</persRef> were there, and many other
							Friends and Acquaintance— The funeral service was performed by the
								<persRef ref="lunt-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								William P. Lunt</persRef>. The Coffin was transported in a Carriage
							to the grave yard without Pall bearers, and followed by a procession of
							mourners in Carriages and of friends and strangers on foot. It was
							deposited in the tomb bearing my name over its door. I walked home and
							spent the Evening at Charles’s and at my own house. </p>

								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>. Leaving them at
								<persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.

								Abbott Lawrence’s</persRef> son <persRef ref="lawrence-james"
								>James</persRef> who told me that his father had returned from

								>Harding’s</persRef> gallery in School-Street in search of M<hi

							was closed. Then I went to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my

								ref="spooner-allen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. C.

								rend="superscript">r</hi> King, gave him a sitting of an hour, and a
							half, and engaged to come again next Tuesday— After another call at
							Harding’s gallery, without finding M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy,
							I went to the Tremont house and enquired if he lodged there— He did not,
							but I was directed to the house in Beacon Street, the former dwelling
							house of <persRef ref="sears-david">David Sears</persRef>.— On enquiry
							there he was gone out, and not expected till 3. O’Clock— I left word for

								<persRef ref="lawrence-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								>Fuller</persRef> drew up to it with the Carriage— Miss Smith and

							immediately to see my Son— Several of the pustules in his throat had

								<persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef> had come down
							to request me on the part of <persRef ref="adams-ann">his

								>Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> was unwilling to be named, and my Son

							preached this morning from Psalm 107.29. “He maketh the storm a calm.” I
							thought the discourse intended, as occasional, but written before hand
							with allusions to the recent decease of a parishioner, but so
							generalised as to suit for one person as well as for another— The
							subject was the efficacy of the Christian Religion to compose and
							tranquilize the storm of affliction raised by the decease of beloved
							relatives and friends— Its topics were consolatory, and its
							exhortations, reliance upon God in the exercise of Christian faith, as
							the only comforter in affliction with power and will to make the storm a
							calm— It was a spirited and eloquent discourse closing with a passage
							deeply pathetic— The text of his afternoon Sermon was from Matthew 8.29.
							“Art thou come hither to torment us before the time”—which at first
							struck me, as singular, its connection with the present occasion, or
							with the text of the morning, being in no wise apparent— But the morning
							text, from the Psalm, has <unclear>espesian?</unclear> to mariners at sea, to them that
							do business in the great waters, that go down to the sea in ships—they
							are described as in a storm, and it is to them that he maketh the storm
							a calm— The narrative in the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of
								<persRef ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef>, is of an occasion when
							Jesus Christ was embarked in a ship, when a great tempest arose and the
							ship and all on board were in imminent danger of perishing— He was
							asleep— His disciples awoke him and implored him to save them—v. 26.
							[“]And he saith unto them, why are ye fearful, o ye of little faith?
							Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great
							calm”— Now this is precisely the power ascribed to the Lord, in the
								29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse of the 107<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm—and there is a manifest harmony
							between the two passages— But this verse was not the one selected by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt for his afternoon text— He took
							it from the narrative of a subsequent miracle when he had landed from
							the ship and come into the Country of the Gergesenes, and met with two
							men possessed by devils, whom he cast out and drove into a heard of
							swine— These were the evil Spirits, who being yet in the men, who cried
							out, what have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? “Art thou
							come hither to torment us before the time”? And these were the words
							chosen by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt for the text to his
							afternoon Sermon— What was the connection between this strange speech of
							the devils to Jesus recognizing him as the Son of God, and the assertion
							in the Psalm, that the Lord maketh the storm a calm, or the fact related
							in the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of Matthew that Jesus
							Christ did actually make a storm a calm, on the Sea of Galilee? What is
							it but the principle that the same power which controuls the elements of
							physical nature is equally sufficient to controul the passions of
							animated nature, and the spiritual soul of men—“which stilleth the noise
							of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the People[”]—
							A philosophical truth—that the universe is governed by a reasoning mind
							and a rational will— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Ex-President
								Quincy</persRef> came out this morning from Cambridge, and after the
							day’s service, walked with me to the two railway bridges at the corner
							near my house— He told me he should remove from Cambridge to Boston with
								<persRef
								ref="quincy-eliza;quincy-eliza2;quincy-maria;quincy-abigail">his
								family</persRef> to-morrow. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt read
							this morning the notes as we had agreed upon them last Evening—
							Southwest gale blowing all day— Evening shower, with distant thunder and
							lightening. <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> confined to

							After breakfast, I walked to<space/><persRef ref="marsh-jonathan"
								>Marsh</persRef> the Shoemaker; and bespoke a pair of winter shoes—
							He gave me some Dix and Cushing pears. I called at the Post and left the

							Editor of the Philadelphia Gazette in answer to his inquiry when the

							there was not a mail for me— He said yes—a large one, and gave it to me—
							There was a Letter from <persRef ref="totten-joseph">Col<hi

								>l.</hi> Totten acknowledges the receipt of the 5 recommendatory
							documents and informs me that the name will be presented to the
							Secretary of War as a Candidate in February or March next when the
							appointment will be made— There was a Letter from <persRef
								ref="gowans-william">William Gowans</persRef> of New-York, with a
							copy of <persRef ref="denton-daniel">Denton’s</persRef> description of
							New-York, formerly New Netherlands 1670. a very thin pamphlet rather

							printed on large 4<hi rend="superscript">to.</hi> paper, being the first
							number of a collection of works under the title of Gowans’s Bibliotheca
							Americana which he proposes to republish. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gowans in his very obliging Letter, intimates a desire for my opinion
							upon his undertaking which I consider highly useful— I answered
							immediately his Letter warmly approving his undertaking, and offering my
							hearty good wishes for his success in the prosecution of it— The only
							doubt that I entertain concerning it is whether a sufficient interest in
							these antient colonial memorials can be excited in the reading public of
							this Country to pay for the expence of costly editions of them.— There
							was a note from <persRef ref="healy-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Peter Alexander Healy</persRef> regretting the
							failure of our appointment for last Friday, and proposing to me to call
							on him again next Wednesday morning at half past 11—and there were

							him still suffering severely with his ulcerated sore throat. I went
							there again about Sunset, and met there <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef>—several of

						<p>I went into Boston this morning, for variation of the scene, for

							answer to my letter of enquiry of 19. May last, with a copy of my Letter
							and sundry documents appended to the answer all which I requested him
							and he promised to read— I said we had two arduous duties to
							discharge—one was to address the contributors to the Observatory, and
							call upon them for a new contribution for a fund to support the observer
							and his assistants and subordinates—and the other to prepare a report as
							a Committee of the board of overseers to be submitted to them at their
							meeting during the Session of the Legislature next January— And that the
							satisfactory discharge of this second duty would depend very much upon
							the successful result of the first— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lawrence mentioned the course which he thought it would be best to take
							for raising the contribution, and I promised to see him again as soon as
							he shall have read President Quincy’s communications.— I took up Louisa

							Foster’s, and we returned to Quincy to dine. After dinner I went up the
							hill to see my Son, who is yet confined to the house, with his illness—
								<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Emmons</persRef> and <persRef ref="bigelow-george">M<hi

							the front and 15 for the back pew, and would give the same for mine—to
							which I agreed— He spoke also of the small strip of my land wanted to
							square off M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Emmons’s houselot; and without
							specifying terms I declared my disposition for all reasonable
							accommodation I received a Letter, from <persRef ref="jackson-william2"

							requested my leave to take my head, in his way at the same time while
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy was at work with his brushes,
							to which I readily gave my consent— The sitting was of two hours,
							enlivened by much conversation upon France at three separate periods of
							time— Of 1778. The ancien regime when <persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis
								16</persRef> was a young king, <persRef ref="marieantoinette">Marie
								Antoinette</persRef> a young and beautiful queen, passing a week or
							two of the summer Season at the Chateau de la Moutte, in Passi at the
							entrance of the Bois de Boulogne, with Chaillot at the right hand,
							Auteuil at the left and Saint Cloud beyond the wood.— Of 1815. when
							after 37. years I revisited Paris, and saw the restored Bourbons—
								<persRef ref="louis-xviii">Louis 18.</persRef> charter king—the
								<persRef ref="artois-charles">Comte d’Artois</persRef>, since

							I had much to remember, especially of the first. Of the third they
							talked exclusively, comparing the now as they see it, with the then as
							remembered by me— There is an enchantment in the recollections of
							childhood and youth of which I had a much larger share than most others
							of the human race. My whole life from the 5<hi rend="superscript"

							cold— Even in the mid day sun, I cease not to shiver with the cold of

							with a shrinking body— Without so much flinching I used the horse hair
							mittens and girdle, till after Sunrise, but was still trembling with
							cold. I lighted up on my chamber hearth the torn up covers of Letters
							and newspapers which have been gathering up in the 3 fireless months,
							which made a light fire, and we had a fire in the dining room the whole

						<p>Sun rose 5.36— Set 6.17.</p>
						<p>After going through the usual morning process of washing and rubbing,

							Sun. I then took my hoe into my nursery, and dug up weeds about an hour,

							I had visitors; the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>

								<persRef ref="miner-bradley">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>

							stone temple church; and he by <persRef ref="taverns-alexander"
								>Alexander Taverns</persRef> and his wife <persRef
								ref="taverns-jane">Jane Taverns</persRef>, a <unclear>fine</unclear> coloured couple
							from Washington three fourths white— This Alexander served us at
							Washington about 2 months as a waiting man, till he fell sick and was
							obliged to leave us— But I had forgotten him— Their object in visiting
							this part of the country now, is to raise a contribution of 600 dollars
							to purchase the freedom of his or her Sister <persRef
								ref="taverns-norah">Norah</persRef>, a Slave whose tender hearted
							master or mistress generously consents to emancipate her for that sum—
							In the uncertain and alarming state of my health and especially of my
							mind, I endeavour as much as possible to occupy every moment of time
							that I can command with bodily exercise or with writing, but I am now so
							debilitated that the whole day is absorbed in making out one page of
							Journal, and I am not able to add to it the daily short answer to a
							Letter— My correspondence reduced as it is suffers accordingly— The
							Letter from the <persRef ref="green-jonathan">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> Jonathan S. Green</persRef>, the missionary to the
							Sandwich Islands, enclosed to me by <persRef ref="jackson-william2"
								>William Jackson</persRef> of Newton calls for an answer, as does
							the enclosing Letter from Jackson himself; but I could not find time to
							write either of them this day.— I hunted over the journals of the
							revolutionary Congress in search of answers to the enquiries of <persRef
								ref="palfrey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John G.
								Palfrey</persRef> concerning <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">Joseph
								Nourse</persRef>— I found at last on the Journal of 28. November
							1777. an order for the payment of his Salary for half a year from 10.
							May to 10. November 1777. as deputy Secretary to the board of War—
								<persRef ref="peters-richard">Richard Peters</persRef> was the
							Secretary.— This was the first introduction of Joseph Nourse to the
							public service— His subsequent appointments during the Confederation
							Congress I had not time to ascertain. One of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Palfrey’s enquiries is about what time he died, and my
							recollection does not enable me to answer it. I hunted over the Journals
							of the house of Representatives of the United States for the time, when
							the petition of <persRef ref="nourse-maria">his widow</persRef> was
							substituted for his own, for satisfaction of the judgment which he
							obtained in the Circuit Court of the United States for a balance due to
							him on the settlement of his accounts—one suit instituted against him as
							a defaulter— I traced his own petition to the Journal of 1834. when a
							bill, in his favour was reported by the Committee of Claims. I found his
							petition again, in 1838 but in the midst of my researches night came on
							and superseded them till a future day. </p>

								Bigelow</persRef> is now a Senior undergraduate, and his youngest
							Son <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott2">Abbott</persRef> has just entered as

								<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> at her sister
								<persRef ref="foster-elizabeth">Foster’s</persRef> and we reached
							home before Sunset.— The morning was clear but of November cold— It was
							clouding up all day, but without rain— My disease is becoming an
							unequivocal shaking palsy, with symptoms of a slow nervous fever. I
							agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy to sit again for them next Tuesday
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence invited me to dine with him

							also my granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>
							to a small family dinner— They keep open house on Saturdays, and have
							usually large companies falling in as on this day without special

							observatory, and also about the present state of his personal relations
							with <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Webster</persRef>— He said I was aware of the breach which had taken
							place in the whig party here, by Webster’s course in 1842; and

							note were also involved— Many painful circumstances had since occurred
							in the sequel to that breach, and now a totally new state of things has
							arisen requiring a new organization of party politics.— He had never
							broken off from the intercourse of social life with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, but all political confidence had
							ceased between them from that time. Now, all was changed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall and judge Story were dead—
							Texas is a part of the Union.— A new foundation for party movements must
							be laid— Yesterday M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had sent him a
							message that he wished an interview with him, on the old foundation of
							unrestricted confidence, which he had accepted— And he wanted further
							conversation with me on this subject— I found <persRef

							convalescent— </p>

						<dateline>Quincy Sunday 14. September 1845.</dateline>
						<p><date>14. V. </date>Sunday</p>
						<p>There was a relaxation of the rigour of the thermometer, with a sucession
							of light showers all day, and afternoon a stiff gale hardly amounting to
							a tempest— A gleam of light at the setting of the Sun, promised a fairer
							day to-morrow.— I cannot excuse myself for noticing so often and so much
							in this journal from day to day the state of the weather—but in the last
							stage of human life, in old age, the weather forms a large portion of
							life itself— I made a regular fire in my chamber this morning, with a
							large log, which has been waiting on the hearth from some time in June,
							but which this day reduced to two large conical brands— We had fires
							also in the dining room, and in <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife’s</persRef> chamber— Neither the shower bath, nor the other
							ablutions or frictions were intermitted, but all to little purpose for
							my ability to write. I rode to meeting with <persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4">her three elder
								boys</persRef>. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef> morning text was from Philippians 2.12
							[“]work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13. For it is
							God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”
							The discourse was upon the influences of the holy spirit or holy ghost
							upon the heart and conduct of Christians—and he said that the
							exhortation necessarily implied that the power of working out his own
							salvation was in every individual believer, in as much as if it was not
							there could be no occasion for exhortation, nor use in it—and the reason
							for the exhortation, because God himself by his holy Spirit worketh on
							the Soul of Man imports a promise of the influence of the divine Spirit
							in aid of the honest and humble efforts of the Christian to work out his
							own salvation— There is something encouraging and consolatory in this
							doctrine, which I need as I approach the close of life— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt said that in the New Testament
							especially there were three distinct manifestations of the Supreme
							Creator of the Universe under the denominations of God the father the
							Son and the Holy Ghost— By a large portion a majority of the Christian
							churches they were understood to be distinct persons though not with
							separate corporeal forms— The third of these persons called the holy
							Spirit or holy Ghost, was that emanation of the divinity which wrought
							internally upon the heart of man, and enabled him with fear and
							trembling to work out his own Salvation— I walked home with a sprinkling
							of rain; but it grew to a storm in the afternoon and I rode to and from
							the temple to attend the service— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s
							afternoon text was from John 9.25 “He answered, and said, whether he be
							a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know; that whereas I was blind,
							now I see.” This was the miracle of the blind man restored to sight,
							which the Pharisees attempted to turn to reproach as a violation of the
							Sabbath— There was something of the spirit of the morning’s discourse in
							the Sermon of the afternoon— The special motive for this miracle,
							besides the blessing, bestowed upon the man, the going about, doing
							good, seems to have been to accredit the mission of the Saviour, in
							despite of the opposition of the pharisees— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt’s lesson from it was the duty of the Christian was to
							pray that the gospel of Christ may operate upon the heart of every
							sinner to make the same acknowledgment—one thing I know; that, whereas I
							was blind, now I see— After church, the storm continuing, I called for a
							few minutes to see <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, still
							confined, but better, and came home. </p>

						<dateline>Quincy— Monday. 15 September 1845.</dateline>
						<p><date>15. V. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>No interruption of Visitors. The labour of the day was to bring up the
							journal from Friday, and that was all that I was able to accomplish— I
							could not write the daily Letter— I received from <persRef
								ref="cowdin-elliot">Elliot C. Cowdin</persRef>, one of the young man
							who a few days since applied to me to deliver a Lecture before the
							Mercantile Library association a Report of the board of Directors made
							in June last, from the origin of the institution in 1820 to its
							incorporation in 1845— The object of this institution originally was to
							collect a library suitable for the reading of a merchant, by the
							associated funds of the merchants clerks in Boston. Their beginnings
							were small—their numbers few—their contributions scanty. But they have
							maintained their organization under repeated modifications, for 25
							years— They began with a board of seven directors annually chosen, which
							they afterwards increased to thirteen, then reduced to ten and again to
							9 with a President— They have also an anniversary Oration and Poem,
							delivered sometimes by members of the Society and at others by strangers
							under special invitation.— After much deliberation they rejected the
							proposal to have a supper with their anniversary Oration and Poem— They
							have also introduced annual courses of Lectures every winter for a
							series of years and made repeated applications to me to deliver one of
							them, but I have never been able to comply with their invitation, and am
							now more unable then ever. After 25 years of a variegated and
							fluctuating fortune they have at last at the Session of this present
							year of the Legislature of this Commonwealth obtained an act of
							incorporation, and it is a sore disappointment to me to be disabled from
							delivering a Lecture before them. I went to the Post-Office, and left
							the Boston Evening Gazette of last Saturday for my Granddaughter
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef>, at <persRef
								ref="sedgwick-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Sedgwick</persRef> at Lenox and a Letter for <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> to the care of <persRef
								ref="fairfield-john">Governor Fairfield</persRef> at Saco, Maine and
							in returning home stop’d at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son’s</persRef> house to see him— I called again as the Sun was
							setting and the full moon rising, with a disk apparently larger than
							that of the Sun himself— How uniform is the course of Nature! how
							mutable the condition of man! The Sun and Moon rise and set now as they
							did five thousand years ago— I take pleasure in seeing the rising and
							setting of the Sun—and of the full moon—so I did fifty years ago—but
							with what a different sensation!— In youth, in manhood, even in green
							old age—the rising and setting Sun and moon, speak at once of God and of
							the lapse of time— Carpe diem is their Lesson—but what is it in extreme
							old age? what is it when the faculties of body and Soul, are in the last
							stage of decay? palsied— It is never too late to learn—but the last
							Lessons are without hope?— that must come from another quarter— In
							pursuit of <persRef ref="palfrey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John G Palfrey’s</persRef> enquiries about <persRef
								ref="nourse-joseph">Joseph Nourse</persRef>, I found that on the
								19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1781. he was
							appointed by the confederation Congress Register of the Treasury—under
							an Ordinance for regulating the Treasury, and adjusting the public
							accounts—of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of that month. And on
							the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1789. <persRef

							sit, for him, came in successively, and each staid a short time.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy told me that he should certainly
							want more than two more sittings— They paint me with a book in my hand
							but looking from it— Shortly after two I walked to <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence’s</persRef>, and was not belated as last Saturday— There
							was nearly as numerous a company at dinner as then and chiefly the same
							persons—with the addition of <persRef ref="storer-bellamy">Bellamy
								Storer</persRef> of Cincinnati— I still had no opportunity to
							converse with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence, either upon our
							business relating to the observatory at Cambridge or upon the state of
							political affairs and the reconciliation between him and his friends and
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>.— He engaged
							me for this purpose to dine with him again next Saturday, but I fear I
							shall be obliged to ask of him some other engagement than a dinner party
							before we can accomplish any thing effective— At a quarter past 4 the
							carriage came for us—we went to N. 6. Dock square and took in the
							articles which I had purchased there before dinner— Then to <persRef
								ref="foster-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> James H.

								Charles</persRef> was here but Charles himself does not yet venture

							Imaginaire—but the effect of my ailment upon body and mind, are
							overwhelming realities. </p>

						<p>Sun rose 5.41. in line with the <unclear>urn?</unclear>— Set 6.9.</p>
						<p>I awoke just before the entry clock struck 2. and lay awake as I supposed
							till hearing it strike 4. I remembered that I had not heard it strike 3.
							I was therefore then asleep with a consciousness of being awake— On
							rising I took the 41<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> daily shower bath,
							and the last for the present Season— Then went up the hill, and from the
							corner of <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house saw
							the rising Sun—and then came down, took my hoe, and dug up weeds at the
							bottom of my Nursery, for about an hour producing a mild but sensible
							perspiration— I then sat down at my writing desk and attempted to write.
							With what success the two preceding pages may shew— They are the arduous
							and scarcely intermitted labour of the whole day— The involuntary
							shaking of my right hand makes it a herculean labour to shape letters
							into words upon paper.— How far my own sins have to answer before heaven
							for this premature impotence to perform the great labour and duty of
							life, I must leave my merciful maker to determine— My practice of rising
							at 4. O’Clock in the morning was commenced in the Summer of 1796. at the
							Hague— I had never before been an early riser upon principle, though I
							had been taught from a child that early to bed and early to rise was the
							way to be healthy, wealthy and wise— I had been very late to bed and
							late to rise the preceding winter and spring at London— Returned to the
							Hague, and no longer stimulated by the same motive to sit up late, I
							chanced to read in an English Review of the Life of <persRef
								ref="wesley-john">John Wesley</persRef>, the founder of the
							episcopal Methodist church a statement that at a certain period of his
							life he formed the deliberate determination to rise every morning at 4.
							O’Clock. That the morning after coming to this resolution he commenced
							the practice, and continued it through his whole life— Profoundly struck
							with this narrative, the first thing I said to myself was—what John
							Wesley accomplished, cannot I undertake? I was not sure of my
							performance; but I thought I could try it for a time— I began it by
							going to bed in June 1796. at the Hague before 9 O’Clock in the Evening—
							I slept sound, and after a refreshing night awoke and rose with the Sun—
							The experiment was cheering; I continued it through the Summer and
							autumn and when winter came with its long and cold nights, I still took
							to an early bed with provision made for a lamp to be lighted and a fire
							to be kindled at four O’Clock the next morning. The fiftieth year has
							now commenced since I went through this process, and I rose this
							morning, at 4. O’Clock, and lighted my lamp and kindled my fire— I have
							not perhaps so inflexibly adhered to the rising hour of four as he did,
							but the average of my rising hour for the fifty years has not exceeded
							half past 4. One consequence has been that the hours before breakfast
							have been the most contented the most active and most efficient hours of
							the day— My habitual practice of Summer Sea and river bathing and
							swimming began much later, and I have of late years been obliged to
							abandon them altogether— The Shower bath was my last resource and I must
							now give up that— The jar is too racking, and I can not recover the
							composure of the hand through the day— Charles went into Boston and
							brought out his Son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>. </p>

						<p>I omitted this morning the shower bath, from a belief most unwillingly
							ripening to conviction—that it shakes my nerves beyond their power of
							Endurance, and disables me from writing almost entirely. I devoted
							however the morning hours to my usual morning exercises, saw the Sun
							rise from <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son’s</persRef> house and dug
							up weeds in my Nursery till I was warm. My Son took his son <persRef
								ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> to school at Boston,
							departing at half past six to be at the opening of the school at 8— I
							sent for <persRef ref="cadmus-william">my barber</persRef> then, who
							came and shaved me; and <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet</persRef>
							came and took me up in his stage at 8. At half past 9 he landed me at
							Amory Hall in Boston— The Stage was full but I knew none of my fellow
							passengers.— <persRef ref="king-john5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef> had not yet got in from his lodgings at Roxbury— I
							went to <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Abbott Lawrence’s</persRef> counting house in Milk Street and had an
							hour of conversation with him— First upon the papers relating to the
							observatory—with regard to these he is in consultation with <persRef
								ref="eliot-samuel3">Samuel A. Eliot</persRef> the Treasurer of the
							University, and with <persRef ref="bowditch-henry">Bowditch</persRef>,
							and they have not yet fixed upon the plan of operations to be pursued to
							raise the fund of 50000 dollars, for the salary of an observer, and the
							incidental current expenses of the establishment; but he thought they
							would be prepared at our next meeting on Saturday, when he engaged me to
							dine with him again.— O that I may be able to discharge my duty in this
							concern! Secondly M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence gave me to
							read the Letter of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef> to <persRef ref="appleton-nathan">Nathan
								Appleton</persRef> of 8. August last— It is an answer to one from
							Appleton to him of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the same
							month, in which he had expressed a hope that the relations of Friendship
							and cordiality which had formerly subsisted between Webster and Lawrence
							might be restored— Webster declares his willingness and earnest desire
							that this may be effected; and with regard to the past, that by-gones
							may be considered as bygones— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence’s
							answer, addressed to Appleton, and dated the 13<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this month accepts this proposition purely and simply
							repeating Websters words that by-gones are to be considered as by-gones—
							The intimate and cordial personal relations heretofore existing between
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lawrence are thus restored; but it is very apparent that
							confidences between them never can be restored— All Webster’s political
							systems are interwoven with the exploration of a gold mine for himself
							and all his confidential intimacies with Lawrence have been devices to
							screw from him or by his agency from others, money by the fifty or
							hundred thousand dollars at a time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lawrence further told me, that <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Louis
								M’Lane</persRef> when recently here to embark in the Steamer as
							Minister to England told him that when <persRef ref="baring-alexander"
								>Lord Ashburton</persRef> arrived here for the negotiation of the
							Treaty, <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> sent for him M’Lane,
							and offered him the Department of State, with the commission to
							negotiate with Lord Ashburton, and to turn Webster out of the Department
							of State for that purpose. I returned to Amory Hall and sat an hour to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King. Then passed into school-Street
							and sat in <persRef ref="harding-chester">Harding’s</persRef> Gallery to
								<persRef ref="healy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Healy</persRef> and <persRef ref="dubourjal-savinien">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubourjal</persRef>, till ten minutes
							past one, when my Son called for me, and I returned with him, in the
							curricle to Quincy to dine— We had scarcely dined when four gentlemen
							named <persRef ref="u">Washburn</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>Putnam</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Millard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">Bates</persRef> called on me; all strangers, and whose only
							purpose was to hold half an hour of miscellaneous conversation— I passed
							the remainder of the afternoon in the torture of writing, and after a
							short visit to <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Charles</persRef> at Sunset closed the Evening at

						<p>A longing lingering hope that a persevering use of the shower bath would
							ultimately alleviate the shaking of my nervous system, allured me to
							repeat the experiment this morning, after having yesterday renounced it
							yesterday for the short remnant of my days— It gave me no relief but
							aggravated for the early part of the day that universal trembling which
							disables me for writing. Yet by dint of extreme exertion, I got through
							the journal of yesterday before dinner, and after dinner, having
							attempted without success to take a short Siesta. I answered <persRef
								ref="palfrey-john">John G. Palfrey’s</persRef> Letter of enquiries
							concerning <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">Joseph Nourse</persRef>— He held
							the Office of Register of the Treasury from the 19<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of September 1781. to the<space/>1829. when he was removed by
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Andrew Jackson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="smith-thomas7">Thomas L. Smith</persRef> was appointed
							in his place— Jackson not only removed him but it was said insulted him
							when he applied to know the cause of his removal, by telling him that it
							was his old age, and that it was time for him to be making his
							preparation for another world.— He also ordered a prosecution of him as
							a defaulter on the Settlement of his accounts; the case was tried in the
							Circuit Court of the United States, and the verdict of the jury found a
							large balance due to Nourse—the judgment of the Court was conformable to
							the verdict of the jury, and was on appeal confirmed by the Supreme
							Court of the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse then
							petitioned Congress for payment of the balance which upon judicial
							investigation had been found due to him. On the 19<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of May 1832 the judiciary Committee of the Senate reported
							a Bill in his favour— On the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March
							1834 the Committee of claims of the House of Representatives did the
							same; and at every Session of Congress from that time until his death in
							1842—one of these bills was before one or the other house—always
							defeated by the democratic party— After his death the claim was pursued
							by his widow <persRef ref="nourse-maria">Maria L. Nourse</persRef> with
							the same issue until her death last year—and at the last Session of
							Congress, a petition from <persRef ref="nourse-charles">his
								son</persRef> and legal representative shared the same fate— All
							this forms no part of the enquiries of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Palfrey nor of my answers to them— They were of the Offices held by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse, and about the time of his death—
							This I ascertained, by the petition of his widow to the House of
							Representatives which was presented by <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
								>Daniel D. Barnard</persRef> on the 14<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1842. This afternoon
								<persRef ref="coffin-nw">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> N. W.

								Son</persRef>, and delivered to me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="bell-joseph">Joseph Bell</persRef> Chairman of the whig State
							central committee inviting me to attend at a whig convention to be held
							at Boston next Wednesday morning, and to preside at the Meeting— I
							declined very reluctantly on the ground of disability by the state of my
							health—and I was compelled to give the same answer to Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="cowdin-elliot">Cowdin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="humphries-joseph">Humphries</persRef> the Committee from the

						<p>Sun rose 5.44. Set 6.4.</p>
						<p>I made another last experiment of the shower bath— Then walked up the
							hill and saw the rising Sun, which soon went under a cloud— I then
							continued the weeding of my Nursery till I was warm.— But it had not the
							effect either of steadying my hand of relieving my throat or of healing
							my finger.— Exercise, air, hard labour and the bath have lost their
							healing and invigorating powers for me, and I have nothing left me, but
							to lie down in silent and submissive resignation to the will of my
							maker, and await his summons, if it may be without a murmur.— The
							morning was lowering. I left home with my granddaughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> at half past 8 for Boston—
							It sprinkled as we entered the Carriage, and poured with rain before we
							reached the railway bridge, this side of the Neponset— The appearance of
							the sky threatened a stormy day, and I ordered <persRef
								ref="fuller-gardiner">Fuller</persRef> to turn back and return home—
							This premature yielding to frowning skies proves my nature to be in the
							last stage of decadence never before should I thus have given way— On
							alighting at home I directed Fuller to put up the horses in the stable,
							and if the weather should clear up, to be ready to start again. And so
							it did in the course of an hour— We took a second departure and at 11.
							O’Clock, I left Mary Louisa at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Frothinghams’s</persRef> door in
							Summer Street— I drove to Amory Hall and gave a last sitting of an hour
							to <persRef ref="king-john5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef> the Sculptor— He is well satisfied with his own work,
							and says that it has been approved as a likeness by numerous visitors. I
							am not myself deeply impressed with the resemblance; but he has done me
							no injustice—having rather softened than otherwise the harshness of my
							features— From his chamber I passed to <persRef ref="harding-chester"
								>Harding’s</persRef> gallery in School-Street and sat two hours to
								<persRef ref="healy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Healy</persRef> and <persRef ref="dubourjal-savinien">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubourjal</persRef>. Healy has now
							received the two Portraits of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson</persRef> and of <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry
								Clay</persRef> which he has painted for <persRef
								ref="louis-philippe">Louis Philippe</persRef> King of the French.—
							There is a mystery in the art of Portrait painting— I have seen perhaps
							20 portraits of Henry Clay and as many of Andrew Jackson—generally good
							likenesses, besides caricatures. These are different from them all—
							There is a delusion in them— They are true as a mirror— Tableaux
							parlans.— When you look at them you feel as if they were speaking to
							you. My own will be fearfully like—for my countenance does injustice in
							my old age to my heart— It was not so when <persRef ref="parker-john5"
								>Parker</persRef> painted me in 1795—and <persRef ref="copley-john"
								>Copley</persRef> in 1796. It was not so when <persRef
								ref="vanhuffel-pierre">van Huffel</persRef> painted me at Ghent in
							January 1815—or <persRef ref="leslie-charles">Leslie</persRef> at London
							in September 1816.— My sufferings since that time from the injustice of
							some of my cotemporaries, from declining health and from the destroyer
							Time have furrowed my brow, and distorted my face, till my naturally
							tender heart has almost become a petrifaction. I dined again at <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence’s</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="lawrence-katherine;lawrence-katherine2;lawrence-annie;lawrence-timothy;lawrence-abbott2;lawrence-james"

						<p>Sun rose 5.45. Set 6.2</p>
						<p>I finally dispensed with the Shower bath, and with it left hope for
							bodily comfort on earth henceforth behind— I could not write, and a boil
							on the fourth finger of my left hand with other corresponding symptoms
							gave me warning of the condition of my blood— <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> is
							gone for an excursion of ten days to New-York, and <persRef
								ref="kendall-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall</persRef>
							of Plymouth supplied his pulpit this day— His morning text was from Acts
							3.26. [“]Unto you, first, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
							to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.”
							These words are part of the discourse of <persRef ref="peter"
								>Peter</persRef> to the people, on the performance of the second
							miracle by the Apostles after the death of Jesus, by healing the lame
							man in <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon’s</persRef> porch at the gate of
							the Temple. He reminds them that Jesus whom they had ignorantly rejected
							and executed had been sent by God, <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to them,
							to bless them by turning away every one of them [“]from his iniquities”—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall’s argument from this was that
							the object of Christ’s Mission upon earth was to bless all mankind, by
							revealing to them the immortality of their Souls and a state of future
							retribution; turning away every one from his iniquities, whereby the
							future world may offer to them a State of glorious reward— I invited him
							to dine with us but he had previously engaged to dine with <persRef
								ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef>. It
							rained almost the whole day—and I rode to and from meeting, morning and
							afternoon— The auditory both parts of the day was very small— The text
							of the afternoon discourse was Psalm 72.6. “He shall come down like rain
							upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.”— This Psalm is
							announced in its title to be for Solomon; and it closes also with a
							declaration that the prayers of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> the
							Son of <persRef ref="jesse">Jesse</persRef> are ended. It would seem as
							if it was composed immediately before his death, in a Spirit at once of
							prophesy, and of supplication.— As if in his last hour his whole soul
							was absorbed in the contemplation of the happy and glorious futurity for
							the People of God, under the rule and dominion of his Son and successor
							Solomon— He begins by the invocation of Jehovah— “Give the king, thy
							judgments, O God! and thy righteousness unto the kings Son”— And then he
							describes in oriental imagery the blessings which his reign shall shower
							down upon the people—and it is remarkable that of all the topics upon
							which he glorifies by anticipation the administration of Solomon, that
							upon which he most emphatically dwells, is his deliverance of the poor
							and needy from the oppressor— This Psalm is considered also, as referrin
							prophetically to the reign of the Messiah upon earth and the consumation
							of Christianity. There is a force of expression, applied to the
							predicted glory and power of the king’s Son, which could scarcely be
							justified by the transient and fading splendours of the reign of
							Solomon.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall is a preacher of the
							old unitarian school—a graduate at Harvard of 1796.—and there is a
							striking difference both of style, and of argument between the divines
							of that period, the close of the last century and the modern pupils of
							the divinity school since instituted. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Kendall took tea with us, and soon after returned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s to pass the Night and return to
							Plymouth to-morrow My condition at Night is as it was in the morning.
							The task before me is to accommodate the few remaining hours of my life
							to that condition. </p>

						<p>I have surrendered my shower baths, my garden and Nursery toils, and all
							hope of recovering physical powers for active and useful existence. Yet
							I sleep little at Night, and after hearing the morning clock strike two,
							three and four I find it irksome to lie longer in bed— I rise, and am
							yet able to wash and dress and make my fire—privileges of which soon—I
							know not how soon I am to be deprived— To all exertions of my own for
							protracting the day of absolute impotence and death, I must bid a last
							adieu— But I yet invoke the blessing of my Maker— I recur to the
							proceedings in the episcopal ritual on the Visitation of the sick; and
							here I meet the infirmities all involuntary of my Faith— I feel my
							responsibility for my own sins, but I cannot believe that any other man,
							and especially that any priest, can have power to pardon or absolve
							them, nor that the could be atoned for by the crucifixion of Jesus
							Christ two thousand years before I was born. I repeat with fervent
							supplication the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse of the 71<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> Psalm— “Cast me not off, in the time of
							old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth”—and the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Now also, when I am old and gray-headed,
							O God, forsake me not—for I believe there is a God who heareth prayer,
							and that honest prayer to him will not be in vain— Well I know that he
							will not supersede his general laws of physical nature for me— But he in
							his own time and his own way can redeem, and reward my Spirit, and to
							him I direct my prayer and commit my Soul— Early this morning <persRef
								ref="gay-granville">Doctor Granville Ware Gay</persRef>, came with a
							paper signed, by several of the most respectable citizens of Quincy,
							addressed to the Directors of the Old Colony rail-road, which will run
							by our house, and earnestly recommending his brother—<persRef
								ref="gay-henry2">Henry A. Gay</persRef> to be superintendent of the
							Rail-road depot, in our neighbourhood.— This recommendation the signers
							to which pledge themselves to the good character and capacity of him
							whom they recommend, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gay invited me to
							sign which I declined on the principle of a long settled rule, never to
							sign recommendations of character and capacity, in favour of persons, of
							whom I have no personal knowledge. I said I had great confidence in the
							opinions and testimony of the Gentlemen who had signed the
							recommendation, and had no doubt it was well deserved, but I could never
							feel myself justified in signing a certificate of character in behalf of
							a person, whom I did not know— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gay
							declared himself fully satisfied with this answer, and avowed his
							approbation of my rule. I devoted this day to retrieving the arrears of
							this journal without entirely succeeding— I lose a day whenever I go in
							to Boston and then have two days to record in one. <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went in this morning and
							returned to dine. He saw <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="everett-charlotte;everett-charlotte2;everett-edward2">his
								family</persRef>, who are now at the City house of <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks</persRef>— He visited also at <persRef ref="lekain-sarah"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lekain’s</persRef> in Summer
							Street <persRef ref="greig-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Greig</persRef> of Canandaigua, whom I specially remember from July
							1843. He went to England about 3 months since in one of the Steamers,
							and returned last Friday in the Hibernia, a fellow passenger with Edward
							Everett and his family— Two days before landing his foot was scalded
							with boiling water and he is now laid up on a Sopha— Charles and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> passed the Evening
							with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>.— My finger was
							this evening so much inflamed and swollen, that I applied to it a bread
							and milk poultice for the Night. My complaint in the throat continues
							obstinate, alternating outside and in, and not leaving me an hour of
							quiet— </p>

						<p>Up—twice in the Night— Left off the poultice on my finger and gladly
							would make light of all my complaints, and infirmities.— But they bring
							me down to the earth as a marksman brings down a bird upon the wing. I
							went into Boston this morning alone; with the expectation of bringing
							out <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> this afternoon— My
							Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> had been
							invited by <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott;lawrence-katherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Abbott Lawrence</persRef> to dine with them again; but from a
							scruple of delicacy, at repeating so often her visit she declined to go—
							I stop’d at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef> and returned to him the volume
							and the two separate numbers of <persRef ref="brownson-orestes"
								>Brownson’s</persRef> quarterly Review, which he had lent me when I
							came out here last May, and of which I have scarcely read a page to this
							day. On going in to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s, I met
							there <persRef ref="everett-charlotte">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charlotte</persRef> wife of <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>, who looks better in health than she did when they
							went to Europe five years ago— I now saw also the miniature portraits in
							Water Colours of Doctor and <persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frothingham</persRef> painted last
							winter by <persRef ref="dubourjal-savinien">Dubourjal</persRef>— My next
							call was at <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jacob Bigelow’s</persRef> house, as I wished to consult him upon the
							very discouraging state of my health, and the utterly desponding state
							of my mind but he was not at home— After waiting near half an hour for
							his return home, of which there were no symptoms, I went to the gallery
							in School street, and sat till ten minutes past two, to <persRef
								ref="healy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy</persRef>—
							Dubourjal was not there— I found a handsome Lady, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> White</persRef> sitting and her
							portrait very nearly finished. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hollingsworth</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Weston</persRef> came in while I was
							sitting, and we had some pleasant conversation upon classical learning,
							Literature and the fine arts— I agreed to come and sit again next
							Thursday, and I had promised D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frothingham to dine with them on that
							day— I went and dined at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
							Lawrence’s expecting to take up Miss Cutts at the house of <persRef
								ref="ward-artemas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Artemas
								Ward</persRef>, next door to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Lawrence’s— <persRef ref="barrell-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Barrell</persRef>, the daughter of judge Ward, living
							with him, and being an intimate friend of Miss Cutts— But she did not
							return this day from Saco, and I came home, as I had gone out this
							morning, alone— Before this however I called again for consultation at
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob Bigelows house but he was not
							at home— At <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peter C. Brooks’s</persRef> house to see M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Everett; but they were
							not within. At <persRef ref="lekain-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Lekain’s</persRef> where I found <persRef
								ref="greig-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greig</persRef>,
							whom I found with his foot upon a Sopha, and unable to rise— He said he
							had written to his wife at Canandaigua to come to him, and expected her,
							to morrow evening. I reached home at Quincy just before Sunset, after my
							solitary ride. After tea, <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> came in and spent
							the evening with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>—and

						<p>The progress of my paralytic affection has brought me to the point of a
							physical impossibility to continue my daily journal, as I have kept it
							with a few occasional interruptions for more than half a century— I
							shall cease henceforth the attempt to record the daily page of my life,
							and abide with resignation to the will of my maker, his final
							dispensations of my existence upon earth— Of my remnant of days the
							journal can scarcely have interest even for my own posterity— I read
							Psalm 90: [“]The days of our years are three score years and ten; and if
							by reason of strength they be four score years yet is their strength
							labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away”— I approach
							the term of four score— I cannot desire exemption from the lot of
							humanity, and have but to submit to my destiny— Yet struggling to the
							last, I was occupied nearly the whole of this day in retrieving the
							arrears of the two preceding days which I barely accomplished— We
							received visits from <persRef ref="love-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas C Love</persRef>—of Buffalo—heretofore a member
							of Congress (the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>) from the State of
							New-York—with <persRef ref="love-george">his son</persRef>, and
							unmarried <persRef ref="love-julia">daughter</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Soper</persRef> of Batavia,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Soper</persRef>,
							and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> of
							Boston. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Love is and has been ever since I
							have known him a warm whig, and while in Congress was with his family on
							the most friendly terms with me and mine.— In the Summer, and again in
							the late autumn of 1843 when I was at Buffalo, he came to greet me at
							Niagara, and I visited him at his own house— I saw M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Soper at Batavia in July 1843. and he
							reminded me of the good fortune which saved me there from fractured
							limbs if not from loss of life from the breaking down of a platform in
							front of the door of the house where I was received— (27. July) M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Soper says he was the person who saved me
							from the fall, by help me to step from the platform, at the very moment
							of the crash— To these visitors succeeded a person named <persRef
								ref="u">De Israel</persRef>, a German Jew, who says he has been
							residing twelve years in this Country, at New-Orleans, at Natchez in
							Mississippi, at Cincinnati, Ohio, and at New-York, and now comes in
							extreme indigence with a recommendatory certificate from <persRef
								ref="pickering-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Pickering</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="jenks-william">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jenks</persRef>, to enquire if I could procure for him a class of
							pupils for a teacher of modern languages, as French and German, or of
							Hebrew. It was not in my power to give him this assistance, and after
							dining with us, he proceeded to seek for the minister of the episcopal
							church in this place the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark</persRef> for
							whose residence he had enquired— I received a notification from <persRef
								ref="willard-joseph3">Joseph Willard</persRef> Recording Secretary
							of the Massachusetts Historical Society, of a meeting of the Society
							to-morrow, with an invitation of communications from the respective
							members of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Section pursuant to the

								>My Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="davis-alexander">M<hi

							here this evening; but the weather was lowering and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> did not come— The condition of my health continues
							as monetary and discouraging as it has been at any period of my life. </p>

						<p>I rose without relief in my throat, and without respite from salve or
							ointment— I received sundry Letters— One from the <persRef
								ref="murray-nicholas">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Nicholas
								Murray</persRef>, Minister of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
							Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth-town, New-Jersey, urging again with

							in honour of the <persRef ref="caldwell-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

							the conviction that neither my bodily nor my mental powers will bear me
							out in making the attempt.— With M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray’s
							Letter are enclosed one to me from <persRef ref="irvine-william">W. A.
								Irvine</persRef> of Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 7. 1845.
							transmitting to me copies of two Letters from his grandfather <persRef
								ref="irvine-william2">General William Irvine</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="irvine-anne">his wife</persRef>, dated 14 and 18 June 1780. in
							one of which mention is made of the shooting down of <persRef
								ref="caldwell-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Caldwell</persRef> with an infant in her arms. I had already
							received the small volume of Notes concerning Elizabethtown, by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray, published in 1844. Another Letter,
							of a different character was from <persRef ref="howland-john">John
								Howland</persRef> President of the Historical Society of
							Rhode-Island—returning the medal which at the request of <persRef
								ref="elliott-jesse">Commodore Jesse D. Elliot</persRef> I had
							forwarded to them—and with it two copies of a Resolution of the Society
							requesting me to return the medal to Commodore Elliot— The course for me
							to pursue in this case must be subject of cool reflection— I went to
							Boston this morning with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.

								<persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s</persRef> I called at <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bigelow’s</persRef> house to

								Healy</persRef> and <persRef ref="dubourjal-savinien">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubourjal</persRef>— They had hitherto
							painted me in a black silk Stock— But at the last sitting, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy requested me to come this day with a
							white cravat which I did— At noon I left them and went and attended the
							monthly meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society— There were but
							two members of the second Section of the Society present, and neither of
							whom had any communication to make— The only subject acted upon was a
							Resolution or Resolutions of the Legislature of the State of Connecticut
							adopted at their Session—last Spring—demanding in a tone somewhat
							peremptory the return of certain documents relating to the State of
							Connecticut, received at second or third hand from <persRef
								ref="trumbull-jonathan2">Governor Trumbull</persRef>, but which the
							Resolutions assert are Archives of the State, and ought never to have
							been removed from the State-house at Hartford, but have come into

							referred to the <persRef ref="savage-james">President Savage</persRef>,
							and two members to report thereon. The meeting adjourned soon after one.
							I returned and sat again to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy and

						<p>My way of life must change. I still awake, somewhat irregularly between
							midnight and four in the morning, and to lie in bed long after waking is
							irksome— I rise before or soon after four. I have been obliged to cease
							taking the shower bath— I still wash and use the friction of the horse
							hair mittens and strap— I no longer dig in my garden or nursery, but
							still light my lamp and make my fire in my writing chamber.—
							Occasionally I walk up the hill and from the eastern corner of <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house witness the rising of
							the Sun, but an unintermitting an universal tremor of my whole body,
							deprives me of the use of my hands for writing, and even for feeding
							myself— The last days of my life for any useful purpose are at hand, and
							the only rational hope left me as the possible result of prayer is that
							the mind may be spared, and not in total prostration precede the
							dissolution of the body— In this condition I this day executed with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> renouncing
							her right of dower, a deed in fix, of about a half acre of land on the
							hill opposite to my residence in Quincy, to the <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> William Parsons
								Lunt</persRef>, the Minister of the Congregational church of which I
							am a member, for a house lot on which he proposes to build— Of this
							church all my ancestors of the name of Adams, from its first gathering
							at Mount Wollaston—the Patriarch <persRef ref="adams-henry"
								>Henry</persRef>, the <persRef ref="adams-joseph3;adams-joseph2"
								>elder and the younger Joseph</persRef>, my grandfather <persRef
								ref="adams-john4">John</persRef> and my father, <persRef
								key="adams-john">John</persRef>, have been in their successive days
							and generations, members, and it is the Christian church in the bosom of
							which I intend that my mortal remains shall be deposited. I have given
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt this lot of Land the Deed of
							which was drawn, and is witnessed by my Son— I took it over to my
							neighbour <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George W. Beale’s</persRef> for him to take the acknowledgment of it
							as a Justice of the Peace, but he was absent from home on a visit to
								<persRef ref="beale-george2">his son</persRef> at Springfield— In my
							forlorn condition I still receive numerous Letters, visitors and
							invitations, as if I were yet a man capable of action in the world— I
							have a Letter from <persRef ref="lester-charles">C. Edwards
								Lester</persRef>, with a copy of a small duodecimo volume translated
							by him from the Italian, and published at New-York entitled the Citizen
							of a Republic—what are his rights, his duties and privileges and what
							should be his Education—by <persRef ref="ceba-ansaldo">Ansaldo
								Ceba</persRef>, a Genoese republican of the 16<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> century. This book M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lester
							has been pleased to dedicate to me, which seems at least to impose upon
							me the obligation of reading it— Yet, I have neither time nor power so
							to do— I received also this morning a Letter from <persRef
								ref="putnam-ee">E. E. Putnam</persRef> Secretary of the North
							Danvers Lyceum, inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them this
							Season— Every such invitation to me now is a pungent affliction— I
							omitted even to answer the pressing invitation of <persRef
								ref="wilder-marshall">Marshall P. Wilder</persRef> President of the
							horticultural Society to be present at their annual festival last
							Friday— Until the day came, I had hoped to attend, and when it came I
							had not the heart to go.— I have ever since been thinking of writing an
							apology to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilder but the time has passed
							and it is not written— </p>

						<p>Sun rose 5.51. Set 5.50.</p>
						<p>I rose in time to see the Sun rise from the corner of <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house, but without relief
							from my incurable disease.— Between 7 and 8. I took the deed to <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							over to <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W.
								Beale</persRef>, who took my acknowledgment of it, and I carried it
							to my Son’s house and gave it to him to deliver to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt— The consideration, nominal is one
							dollar. <persRef ref="davis-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis</persRef> the Architect went with me to Boston. <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Adams</persRef> and her daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef> went with me also. They had engaged to dine at
								<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence’s</persRef>, but I had expected that engagement would fail
							and had made a conditional one to dine with <persRef
								ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Parkman</persRef>— We stop’d with the Carriage at the United States
							Hotel to leave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis, and to return the
							visits of <persRef ref="love-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Love</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sopers</persRef> family— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Soper
							had left the City, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Love was gone out.
							I called twice at the house of <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>, for consultation,
							but in both cases he was not at home— I found M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Abbott Lawrence at his counting house in milk Street, and we
							had some conversation upon the papers relating to the Observatory— They
							are now in my hands and the labouring oar is with me— God grant me
							strength to ply it to useful purpose— I apprized M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lawrence, that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John, and her
							daughter would dine at his house, and obtained his consent for my
							engagement to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman.— I then
							went to <persRef ref="harding-chester">Harding’s</persRef> gallery in
							School Street and gave the final sitting to <persRef ref="healy-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dubourjal-savinien">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dubourjal</persRef>. Both the portraits of me are greatly different
							from any that have ever been painted of me before— Healy’s is such a
							picture of naked nature that I cannot look at it without shame.
							Conscious of its extreme likeness to my features at the present time, it
							brings me to that test which the ploughman poet <persRef
								ref="burns-robert">Burns</persRef> seems to think impossible of
							seeing myself as others see me. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy
							wished that the <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">Ladies</persRef>
							of my family should some day next week visit the room and if on seeing
							my portrait they should think some further touches of the brush would
							improve it he would then ask for another sitting. At two O’Clock D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman came in and went with us to
							his house where we dined with <persRef
								ref="parkman-eliza;parkman-george2;parkman-harriette">his
								family</persRef> including his brother the <persRef
								ref="parkman-francis">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi

							returned from Europe, and their brother in Law <persRef
								ref="shaw-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert G.
								Shaw</persRef>— At 4. O’Clock <persRef ref="fuller-gardiner"
								>Fuller</persRef> came for me with the Carriage— I took up M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams, and Mary Louisa at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrence’s, and <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> at <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">Doctor Frothingham’s</persRef> and came
							out to Quincy where we landed just before sunset. </p>

						<p>I attended divine service, morning and afternoon of this day <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							preached this morning, from Matthew 6.8. “for your father knoweth what
							things ye have need of before ye ask him.” His afternoon text was again
							from Matthew 26.24. [“]The Son of man goeth as it is written of him, but
							wo unto that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed!” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt omitted from the text the remainder
							of the verse.— [“]It had been good for that man, if he had not been
							born.”— The believers in the doctrine of universal salvation, an opinion
							which I have myself been greatly inclined to embrace are much
							embarrassed by this saying of Jesus Christ, but I remember to have heard
							the <persRef ref="whitney-peter">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef>, the predecessor of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Lunt as the Pastor of this Church, urge with great
							earnestness in a Sermon, that <persRef ref="judas-iscariot">Judas
								Iscariot</persRef> himself would form the exception to the ultimate
							salvation of the whole human race— It is a question the interest of
							which to every individual is exclusively confined to himself. The Roman
							Catholic doctrine of purgatory assumes that the prayers of the living
							may avail to redeem from punishment all but the deadly sins, and this
							also is a creed which I would adopt, if I could. There is something so
							revolting to every feeling of my heart in the belief that a God whose
							tender mercies are over all his works should ever have created a
							sentient being for a transient life on earth followed by endless misery
							in another world, that I cannot adopt it if I would— Retributive justice
							I can believe, and await with fear and trembling the judgment even of a
							merciful God—but I can form no conception of almighty power without an
							attribute of justice and no conception of Justice exercising power only
							to avenge, and to create only for misery— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt gave notice that from this time forth for the winter Season, the
							bell for the morning Sunday service would be rung at half past ten, and
							for the afternoon service at a quarter before 2. He gave notice also
							that the communion would be administered the next Lord’s day, and that
							the usual annual collection would then be taken up— <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>
							came out from Boston and dined and spent the evening with us— And on
							returning from meeting this afternoon we found <persRef
								ref="healy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healy</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="dubourjal-savinien">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dubourjal</persRef> here— The latter had brought out his portrait in
							crayons of me, upon which at his request I wrote my name— Their visit
							was short as they were engaged to take tea, at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Russell’s</persRef> in Milton—
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>Sun rose 5.54. Set 5.47.</p>
						<p>Time of the American Almanac. But I saw the Sun rise from the Eastern
							corner of <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house, and
							precisely at the moment when his whole disk was visible above the
							horizon the Stone temple clock, struck six.— The inability to write will
							throw a load of superfluous time on my hands which I shall scarcely know
							how to employ. On Saturday while I was in Boston <persRef
								ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Samuel T.
								Armstrong</persRef> came out to pay me a visit, and left a Letter
							informing me that for the benefit of his health he has taken passage,
							for himself and <persRef ref="armstrong-abigail">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Armstrong</persRef> in the Steamer Cambria to sail on
							the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October next, with the view to
							be absent a year or more, and to visit many parts of the Continent of
							Europe— And he intimates that introductory Letters from me would be very
							acceptable.</p>
						<p>This day impotent as I am I answered the Letter of <persRef
								ref="howland-john">John Howland</persRef> President of the
							Historical Society of Rhode Island with which he returned the medal
							struck by <persRef ref="elliott-jesse">Commodore Jesse D.
								Elliot</persRef> in honour of <persRef ref="cooper-james">J.
								Fenimore Cooper</persRef>, and which at Elliot’s request I had sent
							last March to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howland for the historical
							Society of Rhode-Island— The Society have refused to receive the Medal,
							alledging that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooper’s work avows
							opinions injurious to the reputation of the late <persRef
								ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry</persRef> and
							resolved to return the medal to me with a request that I would return it
							to Commodore Elliot, and they directed that two copies of their
							resolution should be sent to me, with a request that I should forward
							one of them with the medal to Commodore Elliot. The Rhode Island
							historical Society had the right to refuse to receive the present of
							Commodore Elliots medal, and as I had forwarded it to them, they had the
							right to return the medal with their refusal to me— But they had no
							right to ask me to return the medal to Commodore Elliot or to transmit
							their resolution to him. In answering M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Howland’s Letter therefore, I informed him that I declined the office
							requested of me by the historical Society of Rhode Island to return the
							medal to Commodore Elliot or to communicate to him the copy of their
							resolution refusing to receive it, with which they desire to charge
							me—but that I hold them to be delivered to any person authorized by them
							to receive them, retaining the copy of their resolution intended by them
							for myself— I took my Letter to the Post-Office and on my return
							homeward called at my Son’s house and saw <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>his wife</persRef>, who advised me to consult <persRef
								ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef> on this paralytic affection which disables me
							from writing— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>
							gave me the same advice. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward was
							accordingly sent for and came— I stated my case to him— He prescribed
							for this night two blue pills on going to bed, and to morrow morning a
							dose of magnesia, with sulphat of potash. </p>
