                        <p>At 6 O’Clock this morning the Steamboat Constitution <persRef
                                ref="chaytor-james">Captain Chaytor</persRef> parted from the wharf
                            at Baltimore, and at a quarter past ten landed her passengers at
                            Frenchtown.— This line was for some years broken up by the Railway, from
                            Baltimore to Philadelphia, which is a less agreeable mode of performing
                            the journey, but traverses the distance in nearly two hours less of
                            time— <persRef ref="gibbs-william">Governor Gibbs</persRef> preferred to
                            go by the Railway which starts at 9. O’Clock.— Another Steamer, the
                            Thomas Jefferson left the adjoining wharf immediately after us, an
                            opposition line, and the competition has reduced the fare in both so
                            that they take only one dollar for the whole passage— From ten to
                            thirteen minutes were consumed in passing from the Steamer to the Cars
                            at Frenchtown, and from the Cars to the Steamer George Washington, on
                            the Delaware river at Newcastle, 47 minutes for the passage of the Cars
                            from Frenchtown to Newcastle— And then three hours from New-castle to
                            the wharf at the foot of Dock Street Philadelphia, where I landed at 20
                            minutes past 2.— 8 hours and 15 minutes for the whole passage smooth and
                            without accident— The Passengers in the boat were all strangers to me,
                            but one and another, came and shook hands with me, some of them claiming
                            to have done so before, and even to be old acquaintances. One man
                            especially, named <persRef ref="u">Pettis</persRef>, an Englishman born
                            as he told me, but now and for many years past a resident of
                            Philadelphia, amused and wearied me with talking about Pennsylvania
                            politics heavily to the charge of the late <persRef ref="porter-david5"
                                >Governor Porter</persRef> said to have worried himself into that
                            Office poor as a church rat and to go out of it with half a million of
                            dollars— At Philadelphia, I left my trunks in charge of <persRef
                                ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> to be transferred to the other
                            boat and strolled up the Street— There was a sprinkling of rain which
                            did not amount to a shower— I called at the Bank of North-America, and
                            took a draft for 120 dollars on the Atlantic Bank in Boston, for 4
                            coupons of Cincinnati Bonds of 30 dollars each, payable this day— After
                            wandering round the city about an hour, and picking up, in and around
                            the Statehouse yard half a dozen white maple seeds I came down to the
                            corner shop of the Walnut Street house, where I met and had some small
                            talk with <persRef ref="dayton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Dayton</persRef>, U.S. Senator from New-Jersey.— Benjamin had got
                            the baggage on board the Steamer New Philadelphia— Governor Gibbs, who
                            had come on by the railway soon joined us, and also <persRef
                                ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burche</persRef>,
                            from Washington this morning.— Saw <persRef ref="biddle-elizabeth">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">rs</hi> William Biddle</persRef> who came
                            down to take leave of her brother <persRef ref="hopkinson-oliver">Oliver
                                Hopkinson</persRef>, just married and going with <persRef
                                ref="hopkinson-elisa">his bride</persRef> to New-Jersey. At 5. we
                            left the wharf. At dusk of Evening passed from the Steamer to the
                            Railway Cars at Bristol; came through Trenton, Princeton, Brunswick,
                            Rahway, Elizabeth town to Jersey city— Crossed the ferry, and walked
                            with Governor Gibbs to the Astor house which we entered at a quarter
                            past 11. P.M—</p>

                        <p>On rising this morning I found I had left my steel pen on the table of my
                            chamber at Baltimore, or had lost it from my waistcoat pocket— I sallied
                            forth till I found a Stationer’s shop and purchased a paper of <persRef
                                ref="gillott-joseph">Gillott’s</persRef> Victoria pens with a
                            holder— Then returned to my chamber and wrote till the sound of the
                            second gong, at half past 7. summoned me to the gentlemen’s breakfast
                            table— The hour of departure of the Long-island rail-road line being
                            changed from 8 to 10. A.M. they cannot reach Boston before 10 at Night,
                            and this together with some perswasion from <persRef ref="gibbs-william"
                                >Governor Gibbs</persRef> induced me to take passage in the

                            for Providence— <persRef ref="edwards-jonas">M<hi rend="superscript"

                                >Anthony</persRef>, called on me and invited me to visit their
                            establishment where they exhibit a collection of several hundreds,
                            persons of notoriety of all descriptions.— He told me that M<hi

                            him and exhibit there his whole gathering of noted persons of this

                            notorieties to exhibit here— I met in the Street <persRef

                            find him— He was not there but his partner <persRef ref="hurlbut-elisha"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hurlbut</persRef> told me, he
                            would write him a note and inform him that I wished to see him.— I
                            returned to my chamber at the Astor-House and wrote till 3. Letter to
                                <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— Alexander
                            S. Johnson, and sat till the dinner gong of the gentlemen’s table
                            sounded— He promised to come and visit us again at Quincy in the course
                            of the Summer. Just before dinner <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Grinnell</persRef> came in— He
                            was going for Boston in the Steamer Massachusetts at 5 this afternoon
                            and could not change his conveyance to go with us, because he said he
                            wanted to be early in the morning at Boston.— We dined at the
                            Astor-house with a company of about 158 men, all strangers, and I walked
                            with Governor Gibbs to Pier N. 3. in the North River near the Battery,
                            and embarked in the Steamer Neptune Captain Rollins at 5. minutes past 5
                            she loosened from the wharf, with the Steamer Massachusetts from the
                            other side of the wharf close at her stern. They passed round the
                            battery into the East-river, through hell-gate, by Sands’s point into
                            Long-island Sound— The whole day and evening were of the fairest and
                            brightest of the Spring with dewy fingers cold that I ever witnessed.
                            The waters were smooth, the breeze light and fair, and as night advanced
                            we glided along by the Long-island shores, passing successively by the
                            Lights of Huntington and Crane neck, and seeing the Long-island woods in
                            four different places blazing with fire— Among the passengers who were
                            not numerous, <persRef ref="fisher-milton">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> M. M. Fisher</persRef> of Medway named himself to me and

                        <p>In retiring to bed last evening I very imprudently left the window of my
                            Stateroom closed only with a Venitian Blind, and the consequence was a
                            comfortless Night, and sleep much disturbed by the cold. I hope nothing
                            worse. I rose as soon as daylight appeared in my State-room— It was
                            scarcely half past four, and the boat was passing by the Newport
                            Light-house, when I came out upon the deck. At Newport <persRef

                            passengers landed, and the boat proceeded up the river to Providence— On
                            the way a young man entered into conversation with me, and announced
                            himself as a Portuguese, a native of the Island of Madeira named
                                <persRef ref="gonsalves-mj">Gonsalvez</persRef>; but said he came in
                            early youth, and at 19 married an <persRef ref="u">American
                                woman</persRef> of the city of New-York— They had five children,
                            three girls and two boys between 14 and two years of age, and he
                            introduced his wife and all the children to me— He said he had been bred
                            to be a Roman Catholic Priest; but at an early period of his life took a
                            disgust to their teaching; and still more at their practises—with many
                            of which he was made familiarly acquainted— By the perusal of the Bible
                            he became a believer in the truths of evangelical religion, and was now
                            pastor of the Bethel or Seamen’s Church at New-Bedford— He was last
                            Sunday at Nantucket and preached there three times that day— They were
                            now returning from a visit to his wife’s relations at New-York— He said
                                <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> was yet living at Funchal—and
                            two years ago he had gone there and visited him— I asked him what his
                            father thought of his conversion— He said his father had himself been
                            converted by his agency to the Protestant Faith. The Boat reached the
                            wharf at Providence about half past 6. in the morning but we had a wait

                                    >r.</hi> Nathaniel L. Frothingham</persRef> performed the
                            service and administered the communion. The text of his morning sermon
                            was Mark 14.25. “Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the
                            fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of
                            God.” The mind of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham is of a
                            cast so original that I never heard from him otherwise than as a
                            quotation or direct reference a thought which I had heard from any other
                            source. How a most impressive and deeply pathetic communion Sermon,
                            could be constructed from this text I could not imagine— Yet so it was.
                                D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham observed that the minute
                            incident recorded in this had seldom been commented on; but that no
                            incident of that transcendently memorable event the institution of the
                            last Supper was to be overlooked, and it deserved reflection and enquiry
                            why Jesus at that moment formed and declared to his disciples this
                            determination; and why in the recorded words— They occur immediately
                            after his distribution of the bread as his body, and of the wine as his
                            blood; and after he had declared that one of the 12 would betray him—
                            From a variety in the narrative as related in another gospel, (Luke
                            22.17–18) it was inferred that Jesus did not himself drink of that
                            cup—but told his disciples to take it, and divide it among themselves—
                            The Resolution to drink no more before his death, and to drink it
                            afterwards <hi rend="italic">now</hi> in the kingdom of God, were shewn
                            to be all typical and significant— He described the contrast between the
                            cruel and ignominious death he was about to suffer, and the sequel of
                            glory and power in the kingdom of God. This view of the text opened the
                            way for new, and beautiful developements of the character of Jesus
                            Christ and of his religion— He said there had been opinions by some that
                            the body of Christ which suffered crucifixion was not the same with that
                            in which he afterwards manifested himself to his disciples— He utterly
                            disclaimed referring to his reply to the incredulity of Thomas, and to
                            his eating in the presence of the disciples—he cautioned against
                            skeptical scrutinies into the mystery of the resurrection of the body
                            which there is no necessity that we should understand, and which no man
                            in this life ever will understand— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Frothingham administered the communion with a degree of solemnity beyond
                            anything that I had ever witnessed, and which impressed me with awe—
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> participated with me in
                            taking it— After dinner D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Frothingham’s
                            text was from 1. Kings 17.14. “For thus saith the Lord God of Israel.
                            The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail,
                            until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.” An exquisite

                            numerous and so varied, that talents incomparably inferior could easily

                        <p><persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> came this morning, and I paid
                            him his wages and discharged him— I had given him notice of this before
                            we left Washington— He now said that he had no wish to part from me, and
                            I had not told him why I dismissed him— I said it gave me no pleasure,
                            and I might perhaps so far as concerned myself have overlooked the
                            cause— It was his habit of absenting himself without asking leave— It
                            had so often happened that the Carriage was wanted and could not be used
                            because he was out, that I had concluded it was best that we should
                            part— He said he acknowledged that he had given some occasion for
                            complaint in that respect, but he was under some apprehension that
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> had taken some
                            prejudice against him— I assured him, that my Son had used no influence
                            against him whatever— He pressed the matter no further, and withdrew
                            with my best wishes for his welfare— The relation of master and servant,
                            imports a degree of dependence which the proud spirits of our people
                            cannot brook. He never thought of asking leave to go out, and often
                            indulged himself without enquiring whether he would be wanted or not.

                            having an exact recollection of the Report he could not say what it was,
                            but if it was correct as to the facts, he approved the bill— Such is

                                Hoar</persRef>, now a member of the Council. The President read the
                            quarterly reports from the Professors and Tutors, and his own. They were
                            all favourable with regard to instruction— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Hoar remarked that the Reports of some of the Professors
                            omitted to notice the conduct of the Students— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Quincy said that this had been usual heretofore with some of
                            the professors when no disorder had occurred, and the report of the
                            President testified the exemplary conduct of the whole body of the
                            Students which at no period had ever been more satisfactory— But he
                            added that due attention would hereafter be given to the suggestion of
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hoar. A motion was made and adopted
                            that <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Savage</persRef> should be a Sub committee to prepare the report of
                            the Committee to the board of Overseers— At precisely 11. we passed into
                            the Chapel where the exhibition was performed.— A Latin Oration began by
                                <persRef ref="force-manning">Manning Ferguson Force</persRef>, a Son
                            of <persRef ref="force-peter">Peter Force</persRef> of Washington— An

                            Carolina. Fifteen parts were announced in the order of performances;
                            three of which were omitted— The performers were 9 Senior and 8 junior
                            Sophisters— The Senior performances were of their own composition. An
                            Essay— Four Disquisitions— Two Dissertations. All in English— The junior
                            performances were four versions—two from French into English— One from
                            English, into metrical Latin—omitted— One from Latin into Greek. One
                            dialogue from Latin into Greek and one from Greek into Latin— There were
                            no Mathematical parts— No calculations of eclipses— No exposition of
                            Natural Philosophy— No Poem— No Forensic disputation— No logical
                            wrangling. No French, or other modern foreign language— Four interludes
                            of instrumental music by the Pierian Sodality, formed resting places
                            after the third, 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 11<hi

                            parts— The speaking was all tolerably good—none remarkable—great
                            uniformity in the original compositions—nothing sparkling—no humour— No
                            attempt at wit— No passion—not a sarcasm or a sneer good or bad—one even
                            tenor of mediocrity pervaded the whole exhibition. It lasted till half
                            past one, when we went and partook of a collation at the chamber of
                                <persRef ref="porter-peter3">Peter Augustus Porter</persRef>—then

                            observatory— A considerable sum of money was raised by subscription to

                            other instruments are needed; but especially an Observator.— <persRef

                            compensation— I am by election of the board of Overseers a member of the
                            Committee to inspect the Observatory, and a duty thereby devolves upon
                            me— <persRef ref="peirce-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Benjamin Peirce</persRef>, professor of Astronomy and Mathematics
                                (<persRef ref="perkins-james2">Perkins</persRef>) told me yesterday
                            that they had in the morning observed an eclipse of the Sun, and that
                            there would be a transit of Mercury over the disk of the Sun to-morrow
                            from about Noon to 6. P.M— I told him if the sky should be clear I would
                            come and see it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy came to make
                            arrangements for going with me— He thought it would be necessary to be
                            there at an earlier hour than noon, but said he would enquire of
                            Professor Peirce, and if the transit should begin earlier he would write
                            to me— I have many enquiries which I ought to make, and much which I
                            ought to do to give a proper direction to this establishment— I called

                        <p>There was rain in the Night and a flight of snow this morning, with a
                            thrilling, chilling North-east wind, the whole day. I hesitated all the
                            morning, whether to go to Cambridge at-all or to give up in despair the
                            hope ever to see the planet Mercury on the disk of the Sun. About 10.
                            O’Clock the Orb of day peered out from his curtain cloud, and shone 4 or
                            5 minutes on the table on which I was writing, and I concluded to go— As
                            I was going from the house, <persRef ref="colton-george">M<hi

                            Lyceum at Waltham to allow him to publish the Lecture on Society and
                            Civilization. I told him I would write in a few days— I asked him to
                            send me 25 copies of the engraved likeness from <persRef

                            11. He had given up all expectation of seeing me, but immediately
                            ordered his buggy, and took me to the observatory now the dwelling house

                            story of the tower, under a temporary immovable wooden roof, observing
                            with an old clumsy English telescope about six feet long; a small brass
                            tubed French Telescope by <persRef ref="lerebours-noel">Le
                                Rebours</persRef>, with a rock crystal object glass, instead of
                            flint, and a small azimuth and altitude instrument by <persRef

                            observation that I ever saw.— The observer sits in a chair, looks
                            horizontally through the eye-glass, and by means of an internal mirror
                            sees the object in the sky projected as on the side of a wall.— In this
                            manner I saw the Planet several times as the clouds flitted off an on
                            over the face of the Sun. The planet was a small spot coal-black of the
                            apparent size and shape of a pea on a buff-coloured Sun’s disk— There
                            were two darks spots on the other side of the disk— M<hi

                            wooden shed in the yard, apart from the tower and the house observing
                            the planet with <persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Commander
                            Wilkes</persRef>, keeping time for him with a sidereal clock.— The
                            observations with this instrument were made, kneeling on cushions, and
                            with the head thrown back so that I could not endure it. I saw nothing
                            except by the horizontal instrument— At the contact of the Planet with
                            the Sun the sky was beclouded— They saw the planet about 7 minutes
                            before, and 15 minutes after the contact—when I saw them the planet had
                            advanced from 3 to 4 digits upon the disk— Between one and two, I
                            returned with President Quincy, and dined with him, <persRef

                            last, on a proposal for devising and promulgating a national name for
                            the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage read the Letter
                            from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay, and the report of the New-York
                            Committee which proposes that the name to be assumed by the United
                            States should be Allegania, or by abbreviation Algania— The report is
                            well written, and urges many grave and forcible considerations for
                            desiring to have a national name— We agreed at once that this was a sort
                            of literary trifling which could only cover us with ridicule; and that
                            our only proper course would be to frame a declining answer avoiding all
                            offense to the correspondent, or to the New-York Society or their
                            committee— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay the corresponding
                            Secretary suggests a preference for the name of the republic of

                            utterly beyond our competency. I was charged to prepare an answer to the

                            more, than the journal of the day before Last night and this morning I

                        <p>The night before last there was a sharp frost—our ride to Quincy last
                            evening was so chilling that we exchanged the barouche for a close
                            carriage to return— Early this morning, <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
                                >Fahrenheit</persRef> was at 80 and through the day at 85. I
                            attended public worship at the first congregational church. <persRef
                                ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Frothingham</persRef> officiated at the morning service, and
                            preached from Acts 2.37— “Now when they heard <hi rend="italic"
                                >this</hi>, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto <persRef
                                ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, and to the rest of the apostles, Men
                            and brethren, what shall we do?” He began by observing that this was the
                            day of the festival called in the jewish ritual Pentecost, and in the
                            language of the English episcopal church Whitsunday— Celebrated as the
                            anniversary of the day upon which the apostles received the miraculous
                            gift of tongues, and from which the existence of the Christian church is
                            to be dated— He said that the denomination to which we belong had
                            disused the celebration of all the fasts and festivals of other
                            christian churches, he thought it proper to notice them as they pass,
                            and without dwelling upon the wonderful incidents of that memorable day,
                            he thought the question at the close of the text by that vast assemblage
                            to the apostles—<hi rend="italic">what shall we do</hi>? eminently
                            suitable for us all, at all times to put to ourselves.— And then after
                            referring to the threefold definition of eloquence by <persRef
                                ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef>, as consisting all in action
                            he considered it equally applicable to the whole duty of man. An
                            excellent discourse of exhortation to virtuous action followed, worthy
                            of leaving abundant fruit in the lives of his hearers— Returning home I
                            met <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

                            several years.— In the afternoon I heard the <persRef

                                Lothrop</persRef> of the Brattle Street church, who exchanged with
                                D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham— His text was from
                            Proverbs 16.31. “The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in
                            the way of righteousness.” The discourse was a moral Dissertation upon
                            the condition, the obligations, the rights, the infirmities and the
                            enjoyments of Old age— A religious aspect was given to the whole
                            subject, and the obvious topics were handled with ingenuity, earnestness
                            of manner and elegance of composition.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lothrop’s style is at once chaste, pure and ornamental.— There was a
                            disastrous fire raging all the time of the afternoon service, and for an
                            hour after, at the South side of the City near the Neck which burnt
                            upwards of 30 houses and a Methodist church— <persRef

                        <p>I was awaked this morning before four O’Clock by the ringing of Bells for
                            a fire, and on rising saw from the chamber window the smoke of it North
                            and West of it in the direction of Charlestown—in the opposite quarter
                            of the city from that of yesterday’s fire— There were two other alarms
                            in the course of this day, and the people are so habituated to the cry
                            that it scarcely produces a sensation— Immediately after breakfast, two
                            gentlemen who introduced each other, <persRef ref="coolidge-william2"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coolidge</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="pray-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pray</persRef> came
                            to enquire if I had received some weeks since an invitation to preside
                            at a meeting of the Unitarians of this city to entertain with a
                            collation, the clergymen, and their wives of that denomination, who come
                            from all parts of the Commonwealth, in the last week of this month—to
                            attend various annual religious celebrations— I had received the
                            invitation, and had delayed the answer under some uncertainty whether it
                            would be in my power to comply with the request. Although a communicant
                            of a church with a unitarian pastor, my own opinions were not exactly
                            conformable to those of either division of the Unitarian churches
                            Neither Arian nor Socinian.— My creed was negative— Not Trinitarian—but
                            who and what the self declared son of God and son of Man was, is a
                            mystery not revealed to me, and the revelation of which I hope is not
                            necessary for salvation— I had attended a Lord’s day convention at
                            Baltimore, as a delegate from a strictly Calvinistic Presbyterian
                            Church, though a member not of the church but of the Society— I had
                            presided over that Convention—and their address to the People was signed
                            by me as their President— There was no Unitarian Minister, or Delegate
                            at that Convention, although there is a respectable Unitarian Church and
                            Minister, <persRef ref="burnap-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Burnap</persRef> at Baltimore— In presiding over this convivial
                            Unitarian assembly I should not be understood as intending any
                            inconsistency with the part I had taken in the convention at Baltimore.—
                            They said they were sure that no such inference could be drawn, and that
                            they had been highly gratified by the part that I had taken in that
                            convention— With some further explanations I promised a written <hi
                                rend="strikethrough">invitation</hi> answer to the invitation in the
                            course of a few days— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
                                Quincy</persRef> was here, and appointed Friday morning next at 11.
                            O’Clock for a meeting of the Committee of the Overseers, at the
                            Observatory at Cambridge and that he had seen <persRef

                                Sears</persRef>, also a member of the Committee afterwards called
                            and offered to take me with him— I walked out and took two Letters to
                            the Post-Office, with <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"

                            walked to his new Counting house in Milk Street— I called at <persRef

                            home— The burning heat of the Sun housed me for the remnant of the day.

                            The text of his 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Discourse (the
                            Difference), is “whom do men say that I, the son of man am?”— I observed
                            that there was a subsequent question, but whom say ye that I am? I did
                            not find in his Discourses <hi rend="italic">his</hi> answer to that
                            question— He said it was explicitly there—that he believed him to be
                            merely a man— I said I would read the discourse again,—he asked me to
                            read a manuscript Sermon of his, upon the Creation by Jesus Christ,
                            which I promised— He sent it this afternoon, and I read it this evening
                            without conviction— My next call was upon <persRef ref="davis-john"

                            Encyclopaedia, maintaining that the scintillation of the large fixed
                            Stars, is merely the interception of their rays by vapours in the
                            atmosphere, and that in regions of clear skies there is no
                            scintillation— He lent me a pamphlet recently published at New-York

                                >his son</persRef>, as Observer, and assistant—and he read to us a

                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Sears started as a question, whether this
                            was matter for us to proceed in as a Committee of the Board of
                            Overseers—whereupon a discussion of two hours ensued, the result of
                            which was, that a statement from the Corporation of the University
                            should be made to the Committee, to form the basis of their report to
                            the board of Overseers next February; and also of the intermediate
                            address soliciting a further contribution for the establishment of the
                            Observatory, and its annexation to the University.— I opened to the
                            Committee certain views respecting the report, which are to be followed
                            up by earnest attention to the subject hereafter— We returned to Boston
                            about 2 O’Clock, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Paine taking a seat with
                            us in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sears’s Carriage.— They landed me
                            at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my son’s</persRef> house— The storm
                            confined me to the house the rest of the day— A visit from <persRef

                            of writing, I wasted the time in reading <persRef ref="spencer-edmund"

                        <p>The cold North-east storm continued the whole of last Night and of this
                            day— The Steamer Hibernia departed in the midst of it yesterday for
                            Halifax and Liverpool with 112 passengers. It must be a tremendous gale
                            upon the coast. I was not interrupted by any visitor at home, but before
                            dinner I walked down into Milk Street to see <persRef
                                ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
                                Lawrence</persRef> at his new Counting house.— In such weather I
                            expected to find him without other visitors, but at the door I met two
                            of the Ex-Mayors of the city, <persRef ref="brimmer-martin">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Brimmer</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="chapman-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Chapman</persRef> who went with me, and with whom he held
                            consultation in the general counting room, shewing me into his private
                            chamber— The object of the two Mayors was the formation of a company
                            with a capital of half a million of dollars, for building a Hotel
                            surpassing in dimensions either the Tremont house of this city or the
                            Astor house of New-York— Their interview was not long, and he came in to
                            me— I told him that I had this establishment of an Astronomical
                            observatory at Cambridge very much at heart, and wanted the earnest and
                            zealous exertion of his influence for its consummation in the most
                            effective manner possible— That I believed much would depend upon the
                            report of the Committee of the board of Overseers to be made next
                            February; reminding him of the suggestions that I had thrown out
                            yesterday at the meeting of the Committee, I said I was preparing a
                            Letter to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>,
                            submitting to him in behalf of the Committee a number of specific
                            enquiries for information to enable them to make a satisfactory report
                            to the board, and also to fortify their address to the public for a
                            further contribution to complete the establishment of the observatory.—
                            And I wished to see him for half an hour to communicate to him this
                            Letter.—He agreed to see me at his house next Monday Morning at 9.
                            O’Clock— He said he saw this was a matter for posterity, and he wished
                            me to make a report that would be read in foreign countries and in after
                            ages— I said that without indulging such aspirations, my purpose was to
                            stimulate President to prepare a report, to be presented by the
                            Committee, perhaps with some remarks of their own to the board for
                            reference hereafter to this whole undertaking of superadding an
                            Astronomical Observatory to the institution of Harvard university— And I
                            wished so to manage it that the whole credit of it should enure to him
                            as he well deserved that it should, the design and the progress to its
                            execution hitherto being entirely due to him, and I would not attempt to
                            pluck one sprig of laurel from his brow— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lawrence concurred entirely with me on these sentiments, and I proceeded
                            in the preparation of the Letter this afternoon and evening— I read also
                            some of the Letters of <persRef ref="grey-charles">Grey</persRef>. </p>

                        <p>Still the Northeast storm with copious rain, in frequent showers with
                            intervals of drizzling mist. At the first congregational church in
                            Summer Street. <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> this morning
                            preached from Hebrews 11.6. part of the verse— [“]He that cometh to God,
                            must believe that he is, and that he is, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
                            he is a rewarder”— The whole verse is “But without faith <hi
                                rend="italic">it is</hi> impossible to please <hi rend="italic"
                                >him</hi>: for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and
                            that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” The Sermon was
                            a Discourse upon <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>; and the omitted parts of
                            the verse before and after the text at once limit and enlarge the field
                            of meditation opened by the text— The affirmation of the verse is that
                            it is impossible without Faith to please God— By leaving out those words
                            the topic of pleasing God, is excluded from the commentary, and the
                            scope of the Sermon is contracted—the closing words of the verse,
                            omitted from the text, limit the idea of God as a rewarder to them that
                            diligently seek him; and their omission enlarges the compass of the
                            discourse, by generalising the idea of God as a rewarder—which includes
                            even retribution in punishment— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Frothingham observed that the text at first blush would seem to be a
                            self-evident truism; but that if maturely considered it would be found
                            to contain a lesson of profound wisdom. That prayer to God necessarily
                            implied belief in the existence of God, and of responsibility to him for
                            faithful service— The text implies therefore the belief not only of the
                            existence of God, but of the immortality of the human Soul its
                            responsibility to God and the rewards of a future life— He said there
                            were persons who held the doctrine that the hope of reward was a selfish
                            and mercenary motive, and therefore not virtuous or entitled to reward—
                            That this sentiment was just so far as it commanded and required the
                            exercise of perfect and disinterested virtue, but that the holy spirit
                            in the Scriptures mentioned it in commendation of Moses that he had
                            regard to the recompense of reward and that Christ himself in his
                            enumeration of blessings connects them all with the promise of rewards
                            in Heaven.— The Sermon of the afternoon, was from John 1.1. “In the
                            beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
                            God”— He said this was the day observed by several Christian
                            denominations of Christians under the name of Trinity Sunday— That this
                            text was the chief pillar of the doctrine to which the day is indebted
                            for its name—that it was an institution of comparatively modern date,
                            twelve centuries having passed over the church before any one had ever
                            thought of celebrating it, as an annual festal day. He then analyzed his
                            text assigning the reasons for rejecting the sense in which it is
                            claimed to sanction the doctrine of the Trinity— I finished my Letter to
                                <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>.</p>

                            account fortunate that he is upon this Committee, and wish if possible
                            to express my sense of his exertions in this cause by considerations

                            this undertaking.— My next call was upon <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel"

                            to collect and prepare the materials for such a publication, but if my

                            I asked the servant to tell him that I wished much to see him, and would

                            the association of Odd Fellows in this State; but they appeared to have
                            no distinct information upon the subject—except that M<hi

                            produced to me printed copies of eight papers written by me and

                            which he had furnished me with a list— And he had a multitude of other
                            publications on the same subject, which I may want to consult in
                            preparing the preface for the republication— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Odiorne reminded me that he was married at Newburyport in

                        <p>Sun rose IV. Set 7.</p>
                        <p>My way of life is totally changed, and I am here in retirement
                            comparatively seldom interrupted— I ought this day to have resumed the
                            Memoir on the Patent Office, but did not. Though I rose before 4.
                            O’Clock, as it takes me one hour and a quarter to wash, scrub and dress,
                            the Sun had risen about 10 minutes when I reached the Southeast corner
                            of <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— The Sun has
                            nearly reached the extreme of his northern declination— My grandson
                                <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> came out this
                            afternoon in <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet’s</persRef> Stage. There
                            are numerous packages of public documents received here during my
                            absence, and which it will give me no small burden to distribute. Four
                            came this day of Document N. 45.— Commercial Systems—a Report from the
                                <persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Secretary of State</persRef>, founded
                            on Act of 16. August 1842. and I despatched 8 of Document N. 73.
                            Commerce and Trade—a Report from the Secretary of State founded on a
                            Resolution of the House of Representatives of 3. March 1843. These two
                            documents are quite likely to be confounded with each other; and both
                            with the annual document of Commerce and Navigation— I visited my
                            garden, Nursery, and Seminary trees.—My peach trees of all ages are dead
                            or dying— The Philadelphia Maples, flourishing and growing as rapidly as
                            ever, but bearing no fruit— One budded Cherry tree near the centre of
                            the Seminary, bearing fruit and promising— The Louise, Fanny apple-trees
                            in the seminary, and one Pea tree all budded in 1843 doing well—also the
                            stock in the front of my library window with two thrifty buds from a
                            seedling stock sown in 1833. all my seedling English Oaks have perished,
                            but of the shagbark hickories there are a number from 14 years old down
                            to shoots of last summer sown in the autumn of 1843 which have put up
                            stems from top buds and shew signs of vigorous life— Two sown in 1842.
                            fronting the tool-box in the garden, and two sown in 1843 and which
                            first came up last summer in the fenced off patch in the orchard, have
                            thrown up fresh shoots from the ground which with a long summer before
                            them may gain strength to live through the next winter.— I suppose the
                            sowing of nuts and acorns should be in the spring—to bring them up early
                            in the next Spring— In my Library, my attention was drawn, and
                            quartered, by a multitude of attractions— I unpacked two of my trunks,
                            and found my papers sadly crumpled— A heap of state newspapers, stole
                            from me two or three hours, and on looking into my Letter book of 10.
                                Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1830.—to 14 Sept<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> 1832.— I find much more to copy and to
                            select upon anti-masonry than I had imagined would be needed— I saw the
                            Sun Set from the porch in front of Charles’s house, and was thoroughly
                            chilled. I found a fire in the dining room and the library necessary the
                            whole day.</p>

                        <p>Sharp frost this morning, and my Chronometer is 12 minutes in advance of
                            the time marked in the Massachusetts Register for the rising and setting
                            of the Sun. I was belated about 5 minutes in reaching my station of
                            observation, and it was winter cold the whole day— <persRef

                            preached this morning, from Matthew 12 43. “When the unclean spirit is
                            gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and
                            findeth none. 44. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence
                            I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept and
                            garnished. 45. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other
                            spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and
                            the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be
                            also unto this wicked generation.”— The drift of this discourse was to
                            show that a vicious course of life was as pernicious to the
                            intellectual, as to the moral character of a man.— It was very well
                            written and very forcibly argued with a vehemence of delivery
                            contrasting thoroughly with the cold and tame manner for which M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt has been censured heretofore.— He is
                            passing from one extreme to the other, and is in danger of becoming as
                            over-energetic, as he was languid and chilling heretofore. His tone is
                            now unnaturally turgid, and his action far more impassioned than his
                            elocution— At an examination of the students in 1802 as a member of the
                            board of overseers, I remember having heard <persRef
                                ref="pearson-eliphalet">Professor Eliphalet Pearson</persRef> give
                            out to be parsed the following line— “Faults in the life breed errors in
                            the brain” I knew not, and now not whether it was original, or borrowed
                            from <persRef ref="cowper-william">Younger Cowper</persRef>, but it has
                            remained firm fixed I my Memory from that day to this; and now it would
                            have served as a summary in one line of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lunt’s discourse—the moral of which was admirable, and the illustrations
                            forcible—tempered however with the unavoidable admission of the
                            multitude of sad exceptions, in which the brightest intellect is sullied
                            by the unnatural alliance with a polluted heart— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lunt gave notice that the communion would be administered on
                            the next Lord’s day— <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> came out from
                            Boston, and dined and spent the day with us— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from the Wisdom of Solomon 1.6.
                            “For wisdom is a loving Spirit.” He observed that this was one of the
                            Apocryphal books and not admitted by Protestants into the Canon of
                            Scripture—but that in this text the whole sum of the system of
                            Christianity was comprized, and he expatiated upon the blessings of a
                            loving Spirit, as embracing all the duties and all the happiness of man—
                            And he issued a blast against Slavery as among the most execrable of
                            crimes— It is at this moment splitting asunder the Methodist,
                            Presbyterian and Baptist churches of this Union.</p>

                        <p>I lost the opportunity of seeing the Sunrise from the brow of this hill,
                            nor did he rise entirely clear. On Friday Evening I had written a Note

                            how and where, and when I am to meet the association— As I was anxious
                            to receive the information this day, and afraid to trust the mail of
                            Saturday morning, I enclosed this note under a cover to <persRef

                            request that the answer might be sent to me by this morning’s mail.— I

                            Coolidge I found that he had not received my note of Saturday
                            morning—but I now agreed with them to attend to morrow at one O’Clock at
                            the Hall over the depot of the Worcester Railway, to preside at the

                            and I told them I should then make the request to the <persRef

                            not returned from Boston where they had gone this morning— I requested

                            him that I should at the Unitarian Collation to-morrow, at Boston, ask
                            him to say the grace— As I was walking home, I met them, returning from
                            Boston, but did not speak to them.— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi

                            one in the morning to bring it to a close— I was determined to say a few
                            words which <hi rend="italic">may</hi> provoke severe criticism, and to

                        <p>American Academy Meeting, Unitarian Collation. I received this morning
                            under cover from <persRef ref="pray-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Pray</persRef>, the Christian World, and the Christian
                            Register of 1 June 1844 containing full reports of the Unitarian
                            Collation of the last year, the reading of which nearly absorbed the
                            morning till breakfast, but prepared me for the service of the day— I
                            received also a Letter from <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">H. L.
                                Ellsworth</persRef>, late Commissioner of Patents, with enclosures
                            which I had not time to examine— At 9. O’Clock I left home with <persRef
                                ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, who alighted at
                                <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
                                Foster’s</persRef> house in Boston.— I went immediately to the old
                            apartments of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in State Street,
                            but found they had removed to N. 7 1/2 Tremont Row— There, after some
                            time lost in searching for the place, I found it— There were about 20
                            members present; most of them new faces to me The President <persRef
                                ref="pickering-john">John Pickering</persRef> in the chair.— They
                            were balloting for the admission of new members, many having been
                            proposed at the last Meeting in January.— After four or five had been
                            admitted, <persRef ref="bowen-francis">Francis Bowen</persRef> moved to
                            suspended for half an hour to hear the address which was expected from
                            the President— This motion was adopted, and M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Pickering read his address— It was an interesting historical
                            review of the incorporation of the Academy in 1780. and of their
                            published transactions since that time— The balloting for the reception
                            of members was then recommenced; and at the same time the balloting for
                            President and Officers of the Society for the ensuing year. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Pickering was unanimously re-elected
                            President, and <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">Doctor Jacob
                                Bigelow</persRef> Vice-President. All the other Officers were
                            re-elected, except the Treasurer and Secretary, who declined and in
                            whose places, others were elected.— All the persons proposed for
                            admission, save one were elected. I was requested to add my name to a
                            proposal for the admission of <persRef ref="fletcher-richard">Richard
                                Fletcher</persRef> which I did. I left the meeting before it
                            adjourned. Met <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi

                            called at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s.— He went
                            with me to the Hall’s over the depot of the Worcester Railway for the
                            Unitarian Collation.— The company were an hour in assembling, and
                            another hour in taking their seats at six tables to the number of 916
                            persons. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lunt</persRef> asked the blessing— <persRef ref="barrett-samuel2"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrett</persRef> returned

                        <p><date>28. IV: </date>Wednesday</p>
                        <p>This is the week which in olden time was called election week. The last
                            Wednesday in May was the day of the annual meeting of the general Court
                            under the Colonial Charter, and under the first Constitution of
                            Massachusetts and the amended Constitution of 1820. It had always drawn
                            a large concourse of people from all parts of the State, especially if
                            the congregational clergy, and the anniversary meetings of all the
                            religious benevolent and scientific Societies had been concentrated upon
                            this week— In October 1831 an Amendment of the Constitution took effect,
                            altering the annual meeting of the Legislature from the last Wednesday
                            in May to the first Wednesday in January, at which time it has
                            thenceforth been held— But the Anniversaries of Societies and the
                            congregation of Ministers still continues as heretofore on the last
                            Wednesday in May. In the process of time, and the changes incidental to
                            human opinions, many of the inhabitants of Boston, and a smaller portion
                            of the ministers of parishes in the country have become warm and zealous
                            Unitarians—but they are bitterly opposed by all the other religious
                            denominations.— In 1842 a number of the Unitarian laymen of the City
                            associated together, and gave a collation, to all the Unitarian
                            ministers, and their wives who visit the city during the election week—
                            This social banquet was repeated in 1843 and 1844— At this meeting of
                            the last year, I had been earnestly invited by the committee of
                            arrangements to attend and preside; but by my absence on duty at
                            Washington had been prevented from accepting the invitation— This year
                            it was very urgently renewed. I accepted it, with pleasure to attend;
                            and with extreme reluctance to preside— A speech was of course required
                            of the President, and to escape embarrassment and for defence against
                            misrepresentation I wrote out an address which <persRef
                                ref="pierce-john">Doctor Peirce</persRef> who sat beside me said
                            occupied precisely 15 minutes— Many other speeches were made, and it was
                            close upon 7 O’Clock, when the doxology was sung and the company
                            separated, after a closing speech from <persRef ref="phillips-stephen"
                                >Stephen C Phillips</persRef>. <persRef ref="upham-charles">M<hi

                            the manuscript for publication, of my speech which I gave him— I found

                            temperate—no beverage but limonade tea and coffee, only the first of
                            which I tasted— I was much fatigued and exhausted, but rose this morning
                            refreshed and saw the Sun rise from the hill, at 4.31. I took a quiet
                            day and wrote to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
                            wife</persRef>, without copy in answer to hers of the 23<hi

                            a ticket of admission— I desired him to give my thanks, and offer my
                            excuse to Deacon Greele— At noon I attended the monthly meeting of the
                            Massachusetts Historical Society.— Very thinly attended, most of the
                            Members, being engaged at one or another of the anniversaries— I made
                            almost the only business of the historical Society Meeting— I read the
                            report of the Committee on the Letter from <persRef ref="jay-john3">John

                        <p>The reason that I gave yesterday at the Massachusetts Historical Society
                            for having failed to perform the service, assigned to me some years
                            since of preparing a biographical eulogy of <persRef
                                ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor jun<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r.</hi></persRef> to be read before the Society, was that I had not
                            been able to obtain facts, relating to the course of his life
                            indispensable to give an account of it, to do any thing like justice to
                            his character— I mentioned three periods of his life some particulars of
                            which were essential to the developement of his character 1. His travels
                            in Europe when young— 2 His agency in establishing and conducting the
                            North American Review. 3. His Services in the Massachusetts Legislature.
                            I noticed the influence of the Review on the Literature, and Science of
                            the Country, and especially upon the reputation of Boston.— I believed
                            that the name of the Athens of America, had been acquired by that work
                            more than by any other single cause— I knew generally that his activity,
                            zeal, and perseverance had effected more for the establishment and long
                            con<unclear>tinu</unclear>ation than the labours of all other men put together— But I had
                            been unable to collect any satisfactory information upon any of these
                            points— A Committee of 3 Members was appointed, with the <persRef
                                ref="savage-james">President</persRef> to assist me, in the
                            collection of facts upon these several points— I returned to <persRef
                                ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> the papers which he
                            had sent me—and asked him to send me a copy of the order of the board of
                            Overseers appointing the Committee to report on the Observatory. He
                            seemed to think it unnecessary; but I said I wanted the names of the
                            Committee.— He promised to send them to me— This morning the Sun rose
                            beclouded, and I could not ascertain the time— I consumed not a little
                            time in assorting the papers and opening Letters which were received
                            here before I came out: a work not yet completed— The Newspapers
                            announced the arrival at Boston yesterday of the Schooner Isabella
                                <persRef ref="matthew-o">O. Matthew</persRef> Master from
                            Alexandria— This is the vessel, in which my two chests of Books and
                            papers were shipped— The vessel is advertised to sail again next
                            Tuesday. I gave <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> the Bill of
                            lading to Kirk to send by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            chests brought out but they were not— I visited my seedling trees, but
                            take little interest in any of them except the shagbark hickories, of
                            which I have about 30 in various stages of growth— Of the smallest kind
                            several have opened their petals and shot up their stems with five
                            leaved, foliage— In the patch of the orchard behind the garden—there
                            were last summer and autumn 5 seedling shagbark hickories sowed in
                            October 1843.— There are now only 3— Each of them in a different stage
                            of growth, but there are strong marks on all of them that they have been
                            frost-bitten which has stunted their growth— I sawed off from the white
                            mulberry, the white maple, and the white willow, limbs from which I cut
                            off slips which I stuck down near the young hickories to take root— Saw
                            the Sun set at <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> at

                            opened this day a Letter, dated Belleville Illinois 15. April 1845. and

                                Campbell</persRef>— It relates to Slavery in the State of Illinois,
                            and claims my immediate attention. But full five weeks have passed away
                            since I should have received it, and now I must sleep over it many times
                            before returning the answer— I received also yesterday a mysterious
                            Letter, dated 27 May 1845. Philadelphia, and signed <persRef
                                ref="lansing-wd">W D. Lansing</persRef>, an entire stranger to me,

                            ignorant— These are prominent symptoms of humbug; especially that there
                            is not a hint of the subject upon which these portentous disclosures are
                            to be made— Yet a name without apparent disguise requires an answer— My
                            two chests of books and papers from Washington by the schooner Isabella,
                                <persRef ref="matthew-o">Captain O. Matthews</persRef> were brought
                            out from Boston this day, and I received a Letter from <persRef

                            May 1845.—without Postmark, stating that he sends 20 plates of my

                                >Marchant’s</persRef> picture, but no plates came with the Letter—
                            In unpacking my portmanteau trunk, with my files of Letters I found the
                            Lecture on Society and Civilization, which I had promised him for
                            publication— I visited again my seedling trees, but observe no progress
                            in their vegetation— I received a printed circular note of this day’s

                            and steeds with a full column of the like rhodomontade— The performance

                            border of the tent— The gymnastics were about equal to any thing I had
                            ever seen.— There were from one thousand to twelve hundred Spectators
                            present, and the most perfect order was preserved— They began at half
                            past 7. and finished after ten— The staging was rather slight, but no
                            accident occured. I came home thoroughly chilled— The principal Tumbler
