                        <p>The return of Winter cold at this precise period was too severe a trial
                            to the shattered constitution of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
                                >my wife</persRef> who was seized yesterday with a most distressing
                            cough, soon followed by a burning fever, a sleepless night, and an
                            almost breathless day. <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef> was called in and
                            precribed medicines to subdue the fever— There was some abatement of the
                            severest symptoms this evening— This was the day for the annual meeting
                            of the Directors, and proprietors of the Neponset Bridge— The dinner was
                            to be at <persRef ref="moseley-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Moseley’s</persRef> in Dorchester— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Moseley sent <persRef ref="moseley-pierce">his son</persRef> to notify
                            me that the party was postponed to some day next week on account of the
                            unfavouble state of the weather. I received this notice just at noon,
                            glad to be released from a pleasure party with a temper of Spirit so
                            unsuited to it, and a heart so burdened. This afternoon I took to the
                            Book binder some 25 pamphlets to be bound in 10 very thick volumes,
                            among which are the Session Messages of the 25<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 27<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> and 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congresses. It
                            absorbed the afternoon— I answered and declined the invitation to the
                            Dane Law School dinner the day after to-morrow— I should have recorded
                            yesterday the daily consumption of my time during the month of June— I
                            rose in the range from half past 3 to half past 5. and gave an hour and
                            a half on the average to washing, scrubbing, dressing and occasionally
                            ascending the hill to see the Sunrise— Two thirds of the time
                            intermitted by the pain of the Sciatica— Then 2 hours till breakfast and
                            two hours after reading the morning Newspapers—Atlas—Courier, Morning
                            Chronicle—Letters by the Mail, and pamphlets upon miscellaneous
                            subjects— Time which I consider principally wasted, but have not the
                            fortitude to redeem by renouncing once for all the reading of this
                            trash, scarcely a trace of which remains after the day has passed, upon
                            my Memory. On Sundays there is no mail brought to me, and I usually have
                            the journal of the preceding day written before the call of the bell to
                            the morning service— The other days of the week I seldom have the record
                            of the day before completed before dinner. I visit my garden, Nursery
                            and Seminary, at all hours of the day whenever the humour takes me, but
                            my disease has disabled me from working with the spade and the hoe, the
                            axe and the Saw— A grievous disappointment. A Siesta of two hours after
                            dinner, a ride of two more with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, <persRef

                                ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef>, a walk up the hill to see the
                            Sunset, occasional completing of the page of Journal begun before
                            dinner; occasional writing or copying of a Letter—calls to casual
                            visitors, desultory reading, and rank naked idleness bring the day to a
                            close at Sunset. <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> usually
                            spends the short Summer evening here, and from 10 to 11. at Night I
                            retire to short repose to the morning twilight.</p>

                        <p>I slept in the library. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
                                wife</persRef> had a very bad and second sleepless night, but her
                            fever subsided and the severity of her cough some what abated this day.
                            I received this morning from <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa
                                Catherine</persRef> at Lenox, a Letter from <persRef

                            up the hill; <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">her mother</persRef> having
                            been uneasy yesterday at failing to receive the weekly Letter.— <persRef
                                ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> went to Boston, and
                            returned to dine.— I sent by him an answer declining the invitation to
                            the Dane law school Oration and dinner at Cambridge to morrow, and a
                            copy of my Amistad Address to <persRef ref="griffin-b">B. F. S.
                                Griffin</persRef> West Newbury, from whom I received this morning a
                            Letter requesting one.— He put them into the Post-Office at Boston.— I
                            also received a Letter from <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">S. C.
                                Phillips</persRef>, <persRef ref="allen-charles">Charles
                                Allen</persRef> and C. F. Adams, a Committee appointed by the
                            Convention of the People of Massachusetts, opposed to the annexation of
                            Texas, held at Faneuil Hall on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            January last, to provide for immediate communication with the opponents
                            of annexation in this and other States as soon as any emergency should
                            be deemed to require a general consultation. They deem such an emergency
                            to have occurred by the passage of the joint Resolution of Congress
                            providing for the admission of Texas into the Union and presuming that
                            it is not yet too late for a concerted movement in opposition to the
                            consummation of the measure, the call for my opinion in regard to the
                            expediency of it, and the manner in which it may best be undertaken and
                            conducted— My afternoon rides being superseded by the arrival of my
                            family, I have devoted a large portion of them to the drudgery of
                            assorting my pamphlets for the book binder and to making up collections
                            of my own published writings for my Son, my Grand daughter <persRef

                            survive me— I made a table of contents to the second volume of the
                            collection for my Son—took to the book binders a second set of the
                            Session Messages of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, and
                            the first volume of the Omnibus collection for a sample— <persRef

                            both ways— Yesterday and this day the chilling and grating North-east

                                >r</hi> Hobart informed me that after a long and deliberate
                            examination of Swedenborg’s writings he had become a believer in his
                            doctrines, and a convert to his new church— That there were many others
                            of the same faith— They had gathered a Society at Abington and built a
                            church where he usually worshiped— In the Massachusetts Register of the
                            present year this church is noted and <persRef ref="pettee-joseph"
                                >Joseph Pettee</persRef> named as its Minister— M<hi

                            the works of Swedenborg and what my opinion of him was— I told him I had
                            heard much of Swedenborg, for more than 60 years— Had read parts of some
                            of his works, and had a general idea of his system with regard to the
                            sympathetic relations between the physical and the spiritual world— But
                            I believed his confident assertion of his own personal intercourse with
                            unembodied Spirits, was mere self deception, Creations of a bewildered
                            imagination to the flights of which I could yield no confidence— M<hi

                            earnestness, and evident conviction that my impressions were the effect
                            of mere preconception and obstinate prejudice—while I marvel at the

                            32 verse stands by itself. The theme of the discourse was the honour and
                            reverence due to old age— On the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            May last, I heard a Sermon from <persRef ref="lothrop-samuel">M<hi

                            16.31. in which old age was considered in a more comprehensive manners.
                            Its honours—its duties—its pleasures—its infirmities— The part of the
                            verse which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney this day left out of
                            his text is well derving of meditation. The profound solemnity with
                            which the commandment is delivered is characteristic of the whole Law
                            delivered from Sinai— [“]Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head”— The
                            Israelite is commanded to manifest his reverence for old age by a
                            movement of the body—by rising up before the hoary head—“and honour the
                            face of the old man[”]— This is the sentiment of the heart prescribed at
                            the sight of a man’s face— This mode of inculcating principles is one of
                            the choicest secrets of eloquence—but the omitted words—and fear thy
                            God; I am the Lord, are essential to the Spirit of this Legislation. The
                            command is to reverence old age—but the motive urging to obedience is
                            the fear of God and the duty of submission to his will— The closing
                            words, I am the Lord, repeated at the close of every Law was a continual
                            reminding of the people that the Law proceeded directly from Jehovah the
                            creator of all worlds— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney dined with
                            us, and <persRef ref="downing-andrew;dewindt-caroline2">M<hi

                            and whither they returned this evening— The text of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s afternoon Sermon was from
                            Ecclesiastes 5.1. “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God.”
                            again omitting the remainder of the verse—“and be more ready to hear
                            than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do
                            evil”— Here again is a principle inculcated by enjoining a movement of
                            the body— Keep thy foot M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney said was
                            an allusion to the practice of putting off shoes to enter upon holy
                            ground; as is now customary to uncover the head— The precept is
                            reverence in entering a church— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney
                            complained that in the manners of the age there was a culpable neglect
                            of this observance—but it has come very seldom under my observation. I
                            saw the Sun rise and set from the hill. <persRef key="adams-charles2"

                            unanimous votes of both houses accepted the terms prescribed by the
                            joint Resolution of the Congress of the United States of the first of
                            March last for annexing Texas to the United States, and that the Senate
                            of Texas have unanimously rejected the Treaty, negotiated for them by
                            the ministers of France and Great Britain with Mexico— If the voice of
                            the People is the voice of God, this measure has now the sanction of
                            almighty God— I have opposed it for ten long years, firmly believing it
                            tainted with two deadly crimes. 1. The leprous contamination of Slavery
                            and 2. Robbery of Mexico.— Victrix Causa deo placuit. The Sequel is in
                            the hands of Providence, and the ultimate result may signally disappoint
                            those, by whom this enterprize has been consummated— Fraud and Rapine,
                            are at its foundation— They have sown the wind— If they reap the
                            whirlwind, the being who left to the will of man the improvement of his
                            own condition, will work it out, according to his own good pleasure— I

                            afterwards removed to the State of New-York, and held some office of

                            disease of body and mind and confined to his chamber, where he composed
                            much gloomy poetry: a small volume of which he published under the title
                            of AEgri Somnia. Between two and three years since he recovered from his
                            dark Splenetics, and sallied forth again upon the world. He travels
                            about, and scribbles prose and poetry, and publishes Newspaper Essays
                            and keeps himself alive and merry— When I was at Utica two years ago, he
                            was in full activity, and extremely kind to me— He has two daughters
                            married in the County of Berkshire, and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

                            Celestial and spiritual, and frequent admission to the three Heavens— It
                            is melancholy to remark, what fooleries are made to pass for

                            the annual meeting of the Proprietors of Neponset Bridge— At 1. O’Clock
                            I left home in the Carriage, with <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss

                        <p>A sudden change in the night, with a sort of hurricane flurry, brought
                            the wind from the Northwest to North of East and a gentle breeze from
                            the Sea, cooled my thermometer down from 90 to 70.— <persRef

                        <p>I would repeat these lines every morning as the first beam of the rising
                            Sun strikes my eye— The whole hymn is one of <persRef ref="watts-isaac"
                                >Watts’s</persRef> best—one of his imitations of the 19<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lunt’s morning text was from Acts 10.15. [“]And the voice spake unto him
                            again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou
                            common.” The chapter contains the narrative of the call by God through
                            the Roman centurion <persRef ref="cornelius">Cornelius</persRef> at
                            Cesarea, addressed by an Angel, upon the apostle <persRef ref="peter"
                                >Peter</persRef> at Joppa to come and speak words to him. At the
                            same time Peter falls into a trance and has a vision of a sheet
                            descending from heaven containing all the animals forbidden by the
                            Levitical laws to be eaten by the jews— A voice commands him to kill and
                            eat— Peter objects that the animals are declared <hi rend="italic"
                                >unclean</hi> by the Law and are forbidden to be eaten—and says he
                            has never eaten any thing common or unclean— The voice replies what God
                            hath cleansed, that call not thou common—and these words abolished the
                            whole prohibitory code of the Law from Sinai about eating animals—on
                            waking up, he is told that three men are seeking him and ordered to go
                            with them. The co-incidence between the dissolution of prohibitory Laws
                            in the Pentateuch and the angelic mission commanding the centurion
                            Cornelius to send for Peter to come and speak with him without saying
                            about what constitute one of the most remarkable miracles in the Bible—
                            Jesus while he lived disclaimed all intention to intrench upon the
                            Mosaic Law, declaring emphatically that he came only to the lost sheep
                            of the house of Israel, and that he came not to destroy but to fulfil—
                            Many of his commands were incompatible with the Jewish Dispensations,
                            and among them was his last injunction to them to preach the gospel to
                            all Nations— This was impracticable without the revocation of the Jewish
                            Law itself and that was effected by this miracle— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s sermon was admirable as an
                            exposition of the wrong of rejecting blessings because they are common—

                            the verse— He carried through the figure of the engrafted word with
                            great Spirit and some sharp censure upon the transcendental dabblers in
                            philosophical theology— <persRef ref="cranch-edward">Edward

                        <p>Among my reminiscences this morning brought with it the memory that this
                            was <persRef ref="smith-abigail">my elder Sister’s</persRef> birth day—
                            Had she lived, she would have been this day four score years of age. She
                            died in 1813. at the age of 48.— <persRef

                            has a large family of children— Her eldest daughter <persRef
                                ref="dewindt-caroline2">Caroline</persRef> is married to <persRef

                            New-York, with whom she so recently paid us a visit— They have no
                            children— In 1841. he published and dedicated to me a Treatise on the
                            Theory and practice of Landscape Gardening adapted to North America,
                            with a view to the improvement of Country residences, with remarks on
                            rural architecture— This work has been successful, and just now he has
                            published another on the fruits and fruit trees of America, of which he
                            has presented me a copy.— These associations, and many others of mingled
                            yarn, throng to the mind with the recollection of my Sister’s birth
                            day.— The memory of herself is next to that of <persRef
                                key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef> the tenderest and dearest to
                            my heart of all the sympathies of human life— This day the helplessness
                            of midsummer heat returned— The morning was thick cloudy and sultry—
                            Towards noon the Sun broke through the gloom and the heat became
                            intense. No interruption by Visitors— In the afternoon there was a
                            moderate thunder shower, and two hours of rain after which a flat calm,
                            damp and sultry— Atmospheric Indolence absorbed the day— I opened for
                            curiosity sake a Letter of five very closely written folio-pages,
                            received in September 1827. from <persRef ref="condy-jeremiah">Jeremiah
                                Condy</persRef> of Charleston South Carolina, the seal of which had
                            not before been broken— This poor man wanted an office and being
                            friendly to my administration for the space of nearly two years wrote me
                            such anonymous Letters almost every day, enclosing three Charleston
                            daily newspapers—the City Gazette the Courier and the Mercury. Many of
                            these budgets were received at Washington when I was absent, and heaped
                            up in baskets till I returned, and then I had so many immediate calls
                            upon my time and attention, which could not be postponed that M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Condy’s despatches were overlooked and
                            remained under Seal—and so have continued to this day. Poor Condy never
                            got his place and has been dead many years.— His Letters would form a
                            secret history of the dirty slavemonger factions of South-Carolina at
                            that time, without a claim to be remembered beyond the passing day— I

                        <p>The cool weather of Sunday at this place and at Boston last Sunday was
                            the breath of an eastern breeze, fresh from the Sea, and extended not 40
                            miles westward. At New-York Albany and Philadelphia, there has been no
                            intermission of the heat, and every where the thermometers are quoted at
                            100—and some up to 106. The lightening of yesterday struck the
                            easternmost Schools house in this town; but the gust was much heavier at
                            Boston than here; and at Lowell it killed a man, and damaged several
                            houses.— This day the heat was nearly or quite as oppressive as last
                            Saturday.— I went to Boston in the Coach with <persRef

                            Washington and West Streets where I found at last <persRef

                                King</persRef> the Sculptor, who took a sitting of an hour for my
                            bust. The work of this day—was only the drawing with a pencil upon
                            paper, of the profile of my head as large as life— We agreed upon this
                            day week for the next sitting— He had a small cage with two Scottish
                            linnets in it. He said they had been brought out in one of the Steamers
                            this Spring— They were full of life and Spirits, chirping and pecking at
                            the seeds of the herbs on which they feed, and flying about the cage as
                            if in perfect possession of their freedom— He told me several anecdotes
                            of his taming this kind of birds and keeping them tame without cage for
                            five years of time.— It was past 12. when I reached the office of the
                            Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company, where on the 12<hi

                            The deed with a power to receive the dividends of interest are in the

                        <p>This to speak in the yankey dialect the hottest spell of weather that I
                            ever witnessed in New England. The newspapers from Boston, New-York,
                            Philadelphia and Baltimore, report the Thermometers of <persRef
                                ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> on Saturday last from
                            100 to 106 in the shade. In Boston and here a change of the wind to East
                            about 1 O’Clock Sunday morning brought down my thermometer to 76, and
                            the feeling of the whole day was rather cold than cool. This change did
                            not occur so far South even as New-York, nor fifty miles westward in the
                            interior. There the heat was intense throughout the day of Sunday as it
                            had been the day before. Monday was the third day of intense heat to our
                            Southern and western neighbours, mitigated here by a remnant of easterly
                            wind till the thunder gust of the afternoon, much severer north of us
                            than here— Yesterday was the fourth day of the spell, not at all
                            refreshed by the thunder-gust of Monday afternoon— This day is the fifth
                            made supportable by a Southwestern breeze. <persRef key="adams-charles2"

                            have bathed every day at the lime-trees on Mount Wollaston beach. I
                            suppressed my longing for a Sea bath till this evening after Sunset,
                            when I rode in the Carryall with <persRef ref="kirk-john">John
                                Kirk</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef> to
                            the beach and took the bath— Charles and his three elder sons were
                            there, but Arthur was afraid of the horseflies, and did not chuse to be
                            ducked. It was half past 9 in the evening when we got home, and I shall
                            not have passed the Summer without one Sea bath— The effect of the
                            weather upon my body and mind is debilitating.— By an extraordinary

                            got to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s— <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went with me— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring had a company of visitors, men and
                            women, two or three of the men only being of the fishing party. They
                            took time to breakfast and it was 8 O’Clock when we reached the cold
                            spring lodge at Cohasset.— I went immediately out from the rocks in a
                            sail boat at first about 2 miles when we caught nothing but perhaps half
                            a dozen dwarf mackrel, and I caught with my mackrel line one perch.—
                            After waiting there nearly three hours I proposed going about 3 miles
                            further out, which was done— Here there was a great plenty of
                            fish—several fine cod were taken, and in the course of 20 minutes I drew
                            up five large haddock— But by some caprice of the skipper instead of
                            coming to anchor after drifting a short time he set the sail again, and
                            went out about 2 miles further, where someone soon tired, and moved to
                            return— The wind was off shore, and we had to beat back; and the boat
                            was so leaky that the water rather gained upon her with one hand
                            constantly bailing out— My Son, with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            dinner, about 20 persons having filled the two tables there was
                            conversation, till a gathering of dark clouds at the north and a low
                            rumbling of distant thunder gave us warning to provide for a shelter— We
                            took to our several vehicles— <persRef ref="hudson-william2">M<hi

                            about ten minutes before what there was of the squall exploded there.—
                            Sundry peals of thunder, and a copious shower of half an hour, were
                            succeeded by a calm evening, a clear sky and a bright moon— A large tea
                            and evening party of Ladies and gentlemen, most of them strangers to me,
                            at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s closed the day— As they went
                            into supper I took French leave and with my Son returned to Quincy home.

                            rise, last saw him set at 7.33. I dallied all day at home for repose
                            from the fatigue and burning face of yesterday, and found nothing to
                            cheer in visiting my seedling trees unless it be that several of the

                            expire, precisely at the time when Crawford expected to come in as
                            President. Louis the Dauphin, had been bred a federalist as hot as his
                            father, and was member of the house of Representatives from Delaware
                            when the Presidential election of 1825 came into the house— His vote was
                            the vote of a whole State; and he had sold it to Crawford I have no
                            doubt for a pledge that in the event of his election—Allan should be
                            renominated for his collectorship and inspectorship— But being afraid of
                            my resentment he was constantly tampering with my friends for a pledge
                            from me to the same effect. <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"

                                Lunt’s</persRef> morning text was from 1. Peter 3.4.—[“]the ornament
                            of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God, of great
                            price.”—part only of the last clause of the verse— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s purpose was to bring the principle
                            pressure of his discourse to bear upon the idea of a meek and quiet
                            spirit as an <hi rend="italic">ornament</hi> of great price in the sight
                            of God.— In the original Greek this word ornament is not in this verse—
                            The first six verses of the chapter are addressed espesially to
                            wives—commanding them in the most unqualified terms to be in subjection
                            to their husbands; and with out directly interdicting the natural
                            passion of the sex for ornament directs them to seek it in a meek and
                            quiet Spirit which he declares to be of great price in the sight of God—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did not remark that the lesson
                            taught by the apostle in this case is addressed exclusively to married
                            women— The Spirit is no doubt equally precious in the sight of God, in
                            either sex; but as an ornament, is more peculiarly the glory of married
                            women— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt took care not to confound
                            meekness with meanness or pusillanimity, but said it was perfectly
                            reconcileable with the spirit of command, of which he gave an example in
                            the case of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>— He commented also
                            largely upon the Picture of the <persRef ref="mary">Madonna della
                                Seggia</persRef> of <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello"
                                >Raphael</persRef>, for the union of exquisite beauty, extreme
                            simplicity, destitute of all personal ornament, and maternal affection,
                            all tenderness and love— I have seen some of these sentiments and
                            opinions before, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did not
                            entirely fail to give credit for them— His afternoon text was Luke
                            17.25. [“]But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
                            generation.”— On the progress of Christianity, of the Kingdom of God.
                            There is variety of memorable matter in this chapter— Among them the
                            incident of the miraculous cleansing of then lepers, while on his way to
                            Jerusalem— Upon their appeal to him for Mercy, he only told them to go
                            and shew themselves unto the Priests. That was the direction of the
                            Levitical Law— They were all cleansed on their way to the Priests, but
                            nine out of the ten forgot their benefactor, and one only, and he a
                            Samaritan, alone returned to give glory to God— As I came out of Meeting
                            this afternoon, <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> told me
                            that <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> had informed him
                            that my woods on Pine hill were on fire; and that the fire had already
                            covered about 30 acres of the ground— About Sunset, <persRef
                                ref="fuller-gardiner">Fuller</persRef> took Charles and me in the
                            Carryall, to <persRef ref="spear-charles">Charles Spear’s</persRef>
                            house. He was out at the Methodist meeting in his neighbourhood. We went
                            there, and had him called out, and he went with us to the place where we
                            were told that the fire had been—for it was said to be nearly or quite
                            extinct. It was not on pine hill but on the adjoining lot of Lawyers
                            common. I went upon the lot, but it was so dark that I could not trace
                            the path to the spot where the fire still burnt, but my Son and Charles
                            Spear did— They thought it confined to the low bough, and stumps of old
                            fallen trees, and was subdued. Before we returned however we saw the
                            flame rising from the tops of lofty trees— There is no water in the
                            woods and no fire engine can reach them. We came home leaving the sequel
                            to Providence</p>

                        <p>I rose at 3. O’Clock, and as soon as daylight came I saw from my Southern
                            window volumes of smoke like light clouds rise and pass in the direction
                            north-eastward from near the spot where we had found last evening the
                            fire in the woods.— The Calamity of fire of which I now live in
                            perpetual terror, has reached me—beginning with the woods— For many
                            months not a day has passed without an alarm of fire in some one or more
                            of our cities. Fires has become a standing Article of News in all our
                            daily newspapers— Three times since the beginning of last Spring, my
                            dwelling house at Washington has been in imminent danger of being burnt
                            to the ground—twice actually on fire— I must yet rely on Providence—
                            Tremendous fires within a few weeks have desolated the cities of
                            Pittsburgh and Quebec, two in each city, and the newspapers of this
                            morning recount the conflagration of 250 dwelling houses last Saturday
                            in the city of New-York— To each his sufferings: all are men; condemn’d

                        <p>The Clock struck three a few minutes after I rose: the twilight had
                            barely begun, but as I passed from the bed chamber to my library the
                            flashes of lightening were so incessant and so bright that the whole
                            atmosphere seemed in a blaze—but I heard no thunder, and there was no
                            rain— This continued a full half hour before I heard the rumbling of
                            distant thunder which then became as incessant as the lightning; and
                            swelled peal on peal till it became terrific— I thought there were two
                            or even three distinct collisions of thunder cloud, at the same time,
                            for a long rolling peal far distant was interrupted, with a short
                            rattling crack, sounding as if close over my head— Soon after the
                            thunder sounded it began to rain, not profusely but by successive
                            moderate showers till about 6 O’Clock— The sky then gradually cleared up
                            and I went in the Barouche to Boston with <persRef ref="smith-louisa"

                            should come in— Neither of us knew that he was in Boston, where he is
                            only upon a short visit— I apologized to him for not having answered two
                            Letters from him relating to <persRef ref="powers-hiram"
                                >Powars</persRef> the Sculptor— From Amory Hall I went to the Office

                            Street—where I received from the Actuary <persRef ref="lowell-francis2"
                                >Francis C. Lowell</persRef> a check on Cashier of Columbian bank to
                            me or bearer for 2962 dollars 64 cents for which I signed two receipts
                            in full, one on the deed itself, and the other upon the record of it in
                            the office— I delivered up the deed, but they gave me a copy of my
                            receipt— I went to the shop of <persRef ref="mellen-moses"
                                >Mellen</persRef> and <persRef ref="hopkins-charles2"

                            too bulky to be taken out in the carriage I was compelled to postpone my
                            determination.— At one O’Clock I found the barouche waiting at the door

                            the disposal to be made of the proceeds from the annuity upon trust held
                            of the Massachusetts hospital life insurance company for her eldest
                            daughter <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Abby Smith Angier</persRef> who died on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> of last February.— By the terms of the investment, the
                            property stood in my name subject to be withdrawn once at the end of
                            every five years— Two of those terms had passed away, and the third was
                            approaching when it was the intention of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                            Angier as she informed me last autumn to have withdrawn the deposit—
                            Upon her decease the amount due upon the deposit with the interest for
                            one quarter subsequent to the decease was to be paid to me, my Executors
                            or Administrators, without any direction how it is to be disposed of by
                            me— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier died without making any
                            testamentary disposal of it— As I understand the Law, I am bound to pay
                            the money over to him as his lawful property; but it was evidently her
                            intention that in the event of her own decease it should revert to her
                            family, and <persRef ref="angier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Angier</persRef> in his Letter to me proposes that it should be
                            secured to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and her surviving
                            daughter Elizabeth— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams is in all
                            probability on her death-bed— In the autumn of 1840. she underwent an
                            operation to extirpate a cancer in the breast, but it has reopened soon
                            after her daughter’s death, and she has been several months confined to
                            her chamber, and almost entirely to her bed— I spoke first with
                            Elizabeth and stated to her the substance of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Angier’s Letter to me. She was affected by it to tears— And
                                M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, was still more agitated by my
                            statement— Both expressed the most grateful sensibility to the
                            generosity and kindness of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier, and a
                            disposition to acquiesce in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier’s
                            disposal of the property— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
                            requested my advice, which concurred with his suggestions—but we came to
                            no definite conclusion— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams said her
                            sickness had drawn after it considerable expence, and she was in great
                            want of money. <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> gave me to

                            to-morrow. They both promised to come My next visit was to <persRef

                            feet 6. both too high for my chamber.— Then I went to Amory hall and

                            Overseers of Harvard University in the Senate chamber. The time of
                            meeting was 12 O’Clock, and I was punctually there to the minute. But it
                            was near half an hour, before any other member came, and more than half
                            an hour before the meeting was opened— Neither the <persRef

                            was that the Senior member of the Executive Council present should
                            preside. This was now <persRef ref="hoar-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Samuel Hoar</persRef>, who accordingly took the chair—
                            The first communication was of the appointments to honorary degrees to
                            be conferred at the approaching commencement— They were all referred to
                            a Committee of 3 members to report at the adjourned meeting of the board
                            on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of next month at 1/2 past 12.
                            O’Clock at the Senate chamber.— The next Communication from the
                            Corporation was that Josiah Quincy had resigned the Office of President
                            of the University. That they had accepted his resignation and asked
                            leave of the Overseers to elect a President in his place. There was an
                            honorary resolution of the Corporation, accompanying that of the
                            acceptance of his resignation— A vote was immediately taken confirming
                            the acceptance of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy’s resignation—
                            After which <persRef ref="gray-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
                                C. Gray</persRef>—enquired if it was not usual for the board of
                            Overseers on accepting the resignation of the President to pass some
                            resolution expressive of their sense of the services of the retiring
                            officer— It was suggested that it would be necessary to reconsider the
                            acceptance of the resignation, before acting upon M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray’s enquiry, and he made a motion to
                            that effect, and that a Committee of 3 be appointed by the chairman to
                            consider and report upon the whole subject at the adjourned meeting— I
                            observed that there seemed to be no need of reconsidering the acceptance
                            of the resignation but the appointment of the committee to report at the
                            adjourned meeting. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray modified his
                            resolution accordingly which was adopted and the Chairman appointed me,

                            Good and Evil have followed us alternately— The thread has been of
                            checkered yarn. Altogether my lot has been a happy one upon Earth, and
                            every feeling of my heart ought to be a sentiment of Gratitude to him
                            who is the disposer of events— I have met with bitter disappointments—
                            Heavy calamities have befallen me— All my children with one exception
                            have been taken from me— <persRef ref="adams-louisa2">One</persRef> in

                            on this earth— The common them of reason is death of fathers, and it is
                            one of the fatalities of old age, to follow to the tomb all the joys of
                            cotemporary kindred and friendship.</p>

                            has been with severe vicissitudes, on the whole highly auspicious. With
                            advantages of education perhaps unparalleled, with principles of
                            integrity, of benevolence, of industry and frugality, and the lofty
                            Spirit of patriotism and Independence taught me from the cradle, with
                            the love of Letters and the arts useful and ornamental, and with
                            aspirations of Science, limited only by the scanty spark of ethereal
                            fire in the soul, my intercourse with my cotemporaries, has in all its
                            fluctuations been more successful than I deserved— My life has been
                            spent in the public service— <persRef ref="washington-george"

                            1.19. [“]We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well

                            the next Lord’s day. He walked home and dined with us— It began to rain
                            all this morning, and continued till half way between noon and Sunset,
                            with a Southeast veering to a Northeast wind, and then cleared up cold.

                            reception—and he accompanied me in the Steamer from Cincinnati as far as
                            Portsmouth Ohio, on my way to Pittsburgh. It had escaped my
                            recollection; the multitude of persons from whom I received
                            extraordinary civilities on that journey was so great that I have not

                            inexpressibly absurd in this book that I can never think without
                            amazement of the fact that its author is the founder of a religious sect
                            and that multitudes of respectable, intelligent men believe in his
                            pretended supernatural intercourse with angels— The system appears to
                            consist of the doctrine of correspondences, which might with more
                            propriety be called analogies. “As all things which are according to
                            divine order, correspond to Heaven, so all things which are contrary to
                            divine order correspond to hell. The things which correspond to heaven
                            all have relation to good and truth; those which correspond to hell, to
                            evil and the false.” The two Althaea trees in front of the Southern and
                            Eastern door of my house began to blossom yesterday, the anniversary of
                            my wedding day. This is a pleasant and a cheering correspondence.</p>

                        <p>I went to the Quincy Stone Bank, and deposited there the check on

                            at the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Office for the annuity in

                                    >rs</hi> Angier</persRef>, and drew a check on the Quincy Bank
                            payable to <persRef ref="angier-john">John Angier</persRef> or order,
                            which I enclosed in a Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier,
                            and for which I requested of him a receipt. This transaction has
                            exercised my discursive faculties with many reflections, upon the
                            nature, obligations and responsibilities of trusts. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier a few days before she was married
                            invested 2000 dollars in this company, for an annuity, of which I was
                            the trustee— I understood that nothing was desired of me, but the use of
                            my name. A few days after the execution of the deed, my niece was
                            married— The deed was delivered to her husband M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Angier, and I kept no voucher to shew that I had any agency
                            or interest in the whole concern. For seven years till 1838. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier received the annual interest on the
                            investment; but from that time no interest has been drawn and the
                            principal has increased to near 3000 dollars— She never had a child—
                            Last autumn it was her intention to withdraw the money at the expiration
                            of the third term of 5 years from its investment and make other disposal
                            of it— She died without leaving a Will, or any direction concerning it—
                            The final provision of the Deed of trust was that in the event of her
                            decease the whole amount should be paid to me, my Executors, or
                            Administrators, without any direction what to do with the money. By the
                            revised Statutes of Massachusetts Part 2. Title 2 Chap. 61. Section 1.
                            Rule 3. and Chap. 64. Section 1. Rule 4. The husband is by law entitled
                            to the whole sum—though but for him, it would go in equal portions to
                            the mother and surviving brothers and sister.— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Angier’s Letter to me suggests the wish to divide it between
                                <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier’s
                                mother</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">her
                                sister</persRef> Elizabeth.— But it was doubtful whether M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Ann Adams the mother would survive this
                            day— She will probably not survive the week, and her death would raise
                            new questions.— On full reflection I deemed my duty clear to pay the
                            money to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier— I accordingly wrote to
                            him, and enclosed the check on the Quincy Stone bank, payable to him or
                            his Order— The check on Columbian Bank was payable to me or <hi
                                rend="italic">bearer</hi>— Could I by endorsement make it payable to
                            order? a Question.— Payable to me, or bearer, sent by mail; liable to
                            accident, it might fall into other hands, and bear record of payment to
                            me, but not by me. My deposit and check on the Quincy Stone bank—makes
                            it a record of payment by me to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier,
                            and if in transit, it should fall into other hands it will be payable
                            only by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier’s endorsement— These are
                            my reasons for the mode of the transaction— <persRef

                            school to see me, before I go hence, which could not be remote; and he
                            wished also to inspect my farm. He said he had always since he came to
                            this Country taken much interest in me and my public career; because he
                            had learnt that I had resided heretofore in his native country—to which
                            he still felt a strong attachment, although from long absence, he had
                            lost the use of his native language and spoke nothing but English— I
                            continue my plantations of mazzard cherry stones, for the chance of
                            raising stocks, and I this day gathered a plum from the tree near the
                            Summer house cellar, proceeding from a stone of those that I brought
                            from the Garden of the President’s house at Washington in 1828— This
                            tree bore half a dozen plums two years ago— It was in full and profuse
                            blossom when I came here last May— It has now ten or twelve plums
                            ripening on it, and I gathered one full sized, and of deep crimson
                            colour, though yet hard, to save it from pillagers, and fix the time of
                            its ripening in this climate— Smitten in conscience by my waste of time
                            I resumed this afternoon my design to collect and have bound in volumes
                            as a gift to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, all my
                            miscellaneous writings which have been printed in 8<hi
                                rend="superscript">vo.</hi> pamphlets— I began this collection three
                            or four years ago, and have postponed the binding of the volumes from
                            year to year to make it if possible complete— I expected to make it of 3
                            volumes, and have two or three times prepared indexes for them; but have
                            still hunted up additional publications till they will now make 5. large
                            volumes, so that the indexes are all to be made over again— They are
                            still incomplete and I have shrunk from the repetition of ineffectual
                            labour— At length I have resolved no longer to delay the execution of my
                            purpose, lest I should be taken from it unachieved— I made out this
                            afternoon a final index to Vol. 1. and spent three hours in overhauling
                            old printed documents to find if possible two or three yet missing,
                            altogether without success— But I take consolation in having made this
                            collection so nearly complete, which will of itself be almost equivalent
                            to an autobiography, from 4 July 1793. when I delivered the Boston town
                            Oration, till my address to my Constituents 3. April 1845— The papers of
                            Marcellus and of Publicola, Columbus and Barneveld, the Report to the
                            Senate in the case of <persRef ref="smith-john6">John Smith</persRef> of
                            Ohio, and sundry trifles in prose and verse will yet be missing, but
                            will not be missed, and a list of them may be made by myself from
                            memory, and minuted in a supplementary volume; if I should be able to
                            collect one There must be no more delay— “Le Mieux est l’Ennemi du
                            Bien.”</p>

                        <p>In the Night there was a very heavy thunder shower and when I rose there
                            were yet frequent flashes of lightening at the Southwest— The prospect
                            of the morning was unsettled and equivocal, and I dallied till it was
                            close upon 10. O’Clock before I started with <persRef ref="cutts-mary"
                                >Miss Cutts</persRef> and my Grand daughter <persRef
                                ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> for Boston. They alighted at

                            depositing my documents at the Historical Society’s chambers, and
                            stopping to pay a provision bill at Seaverns’s shop gave the 4<hi

                                King</persRef>. He had with him a beautiful boy about 5 years old,
                                <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>— At 12 I attended the monthly
                            meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society which was very thin— The
                            President <persRef ref="savage-james">James Savage</persRef> was absent,
                            and I was chosen to preside at the meeting. The recording Secretary was
                            likewise absent and<space/><persRef ref="paige-lucius">Page</persRef> was
                            chosen Secretary for the Meeting. I presented the Annual Congressional
                            Document, on the Commerce and Navigation of the United States for the
                            last ten years, from 1835 to 1844 inclusive; for the recorded minute of
                            which I had written a Letter to President Savage which was read— There
                            was a donation in pamphlet form of a document printed in a newspaper,
                            pasted on leaves of 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> size, the original
                            being a manuscript belonging to the Society; which <persRef
                                ref="thornton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Thornton</persRef> had borrowed, and taken and had printed in the
                            newspaper which he presented without leave obtained of the Society—
                            There was much question on whether this present should be accepted and
                            several members denied the right and the propriety of publishing in
                            newspapers, manuscripts belonging to the Society, without their
                            permission— The whole subject was finally referred to the publishing
                            committee with instructions to present for consideration some rule or
                            regulation against the publication, in newspapers without leave,
                            manuscripts borrowed from the Society— I proposed that the publishing
                            Committee should consider the expediency of having one of the well
                            painted Portraits belonging to the Society handsomely engraved, and
                            inserted with a short Memoir of the person in every successive volume
                            published by the Society. Some objection was made on account of the
                            expence—but the proposal was on the whole well received—and it was
                            agreed that the Committee should take it into consideration— The meeting
                            was adjourned to Tuesday the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            August— I called at the shop of <persRef ref="mellen-moses"
                                >Mellen</persRef> and <persRef ref="hopkins-charles2"
                                >Hopkins</persRef> at the corner of Ann and Union Streets and

                            baths. Then took up my companion young Ladies and returned home to
                            Quincy to dine. After dinner a young man from Roxbury named <persRef

                            apprized him of the difficulties in the way of obtaining this situation,
                            and shewed him the large list of supernumerries yet waiting for
                            warrants, but offered if he desired it, to have his name entered on the
                            books of the Navy Department as an applicant for a warrant; and promised
                            him any assistance that I can give him to obtain it— <persRef
