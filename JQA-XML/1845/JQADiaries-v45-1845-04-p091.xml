						<p>I took this morning a walk, and after delivering at the Bank of the
							Metropolis a Letter from <persRef ref="otis-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Otis</persRef> of Barnstable to
								<persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis
								Johnson</persRef>, and at the Department of State, a signalement, or
							description of their persons for the Passports of <persRef
								ref="codman-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Codman</persRef> and his Son
								<persRef ref="codman-robert">Robert</persRef>. I went to the
							Astronomical Observatory, within the last two years on the hill upon the
							borders of the Potomac and under the charge of <persRef
								ref="maury-matthew2">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Maury</persRef>. I found him there but it was past Meridian, and
							with a beclouded sky. The site is beautiful, on the spot originally
							reserved by <persRef ref="washington-george">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l</hi> Washington</persRef> for a University.— The building is
							small and low, without any dwelling house or garden connected with it—
							The instruments which I saw were, on the first floor a mural circle
							fastened to a granite pier perhaps seven feet high a transit instrument
							in the form of a double cone suspended between two granite cubic
							columns. These two are in one room, and with sky-light doors on the roof
							over them and a sidereal clock in the room— In another there is an
							excellent solar clock, and about forty box chronometers kept for
							regulation to be supplied from time to time to the ships of the Navy
							going to sea— On the chamber floor, under a dome easily moveable round
							is a <persRef ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauenhofer</persRef> Refractor of
							14 feet focal distance with an object glass of 9 inches diameter— These
							instruments are susceptible of being used for valuable observations, but
							the building is not yet completed, and I apprehend not well built.— They
							concluded to make the magnetic observations underground, and have
							accordingly a subterraneous station; but it leaks either from springy
							ground or from rain— The stone floor is covered with water. They have
							been obliged to suspend the observations, and the instruments which are
							there, if suffered to remain there long, will perish by the dampness of
							the atmosphere— Lieutenant Maury was very obliging, and promised to call
							on me the first clear and dark evening, to go and look through the large
							refractor at the nebula in the sword of Orion— <persRef
								ref="morsell-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. I.
								Morsell</persRef> came this afternoon and paid me 300 dollars the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> years instalment for the house,
							which I sold to him in 1839.— He seems not to be satisfied with the
							house nor with his bargain—and seems impatient to get his deed that he
							may sell the place and remove from it— <persRef ref="campbell-archibald"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell</persRef> breakfasted
							with us, and <persRef ref="hague-thomas">Hague</persRef> the Star-gazer
							was here in the Evening flustered.— He told me that <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk’s</persRef> Cabinet would be smashed within

								Todsen</persRef> called this morning, but I had not been able to
							find the volume of my Silesian Letters which he wanted to borrow for his
							friend, who, he said he believed had found them in the first volume of
							the Port-Folio— <persRef ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lewis Johnson</persRef> came and gave me to read the
							Letter from <persRef ref="otis-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Otis</persRef> of Barnstable which I had delivered to him two
							days since— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson told me of several
							strange rumours which had got abroad and come to his ears, arising from
							the successful interference of the late Senator from Maryland <persRef
								ref="merrick-william">Merrick</persRef>, on the very last day of
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler’s</persRef> administration,
							which obtained from him an order for the payment of his claim of 6812:68
							as administrator of <persRef ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>.
							He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrick had been attacked in the
							Baltimore Patriot, for his final speech and vote on the Texas question,
							and had published in the Globe an answer in his own defence addressed to
							the Editor of the Patriot, who in his reply charges M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrick with this arrangement for
							extracting money from the Treasury. And he added that he heard, as if by
							casualty severe and very erroneous remarks by Strangers relating to this
							affair, charging not only M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrick, but
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler himself and the <persRef
								ref="mcculloch-james">comptroller</persRef> with sharing largely of
							the money. I said I was not surprized at the circulation of such
							rumours— They were natural exaggerations, of what I thought very
							exceptionable in the conduct of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Merrick—
							Receiving 500 dollars for obtaining by personal influence from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler the positive order on the last day
							of his administration for the payment of this claim, against the earnest
							opposition both of the auditor and comptroller of the Treasury. I
							believed the claim just, and rejoyced that it had been paid. But I could
							not approve M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrick’s agency in obtaining
							it— I received from the Office of the National Intelligencer the proof
							slips of my Address and intended speech on the Bill to indemnify the
							owners of the Spanish Schooner Amistad and the report with which that
							bill was ushered into the house. I revised the copy, and took it to the
							Office for publication to-morrow. <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> promise to print for
							me 100 copies in 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> form— He spoke of the
							multitudes of removals of persons from public offices, the besom
							sweeping at the present time without remorse, and being for the first
							time avowedly founded not only upon the principle of dismissing
							political enemies and providing for friends but for the further purpose
							of official rotation. Gales told me further that it was reported in the
							diplomatic circle that <persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Buchanan</persRef>
							the new Secretary of State had already exposed himself to ridicule by
							some official incongruity.— <persRef ref="campbell-archibald"
								>Campbell</persRef> dined with us. While I was on my twilight walk I
							met <persRef ref="maury-matthew2">Lieutenant Maury</persRef>, who had
							called at my house to say that this Evening, being hazy was not suited

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="macy-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Savage</persRef>, heretofore Chief Justice of the State of New-York,
							but which Office he resigned before he had reached the constitutional
							termination of threescore years— He told me that he had spent the winter
							here, in private life for the benefit of a milder winter climate than
							that of New-York— I answered a kind invitation yesterday received from
							my belle-fille, <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Charles F. Adams</persRef> at Boston, and shall have
							finally to break away from hence without accomplishing almost any of
							those tasks which I had imposed upon the leisure of the present Spring

								ref="paine-robert5">R. F. Paine</persRef>, and the Address and
							Speech on the Bill to indemnify the owners of the Spanish Schooner
							Amistad with the slanderous report of the Committee of foreign Affairs.—
							The address and speech were published in the National Intelligencer this
							day— I called at the Office, and took back my manuscript, and three
							copies of the paper, which I directed to the Editors of the Old Colony
							Memorial at Plymouth, of the Quincy Aurora, and of the American Whig at
							Taunton requesting each of them to publish the Address and speech in his
							paper— <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef> had forgotten his promise to print for me 100 copies
							of the address and speech in 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> form, and
							he said the types were already distributed, but he would in two or three
							days print 100 copies for me in another form without charge; and he gave
							me to read a Letter from <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, with two slips from the Philadelphia Public
							Ledger of 25 and 26. October 1843. being a Law Academy Lecture on the
							Law of Foreign Missions delivered by him and which he request Gales to
							republish in the National Intelligencer— It is the offscouring of a
							common-place book of extracts from a multitude of writers from <persRef
								ref="moses">Moses</persRef> to <persRef ref="mackintosh-james">Sir
								James Mackintosh</persRef> upon the Laws and usages of embassies.—
							This republication now must be to remind <persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk</persRef>, of his peculiar
							qualifications for a foreign mission— The Lecture is an Olla Podrida,
							written in a lively Style, and as in all his compositions full of
							inaccuracies. I continued my walk to the Capitol, where I bespoke a
							second chest for transporting books and papers to Quincy; and received
							the additional sheets of the Journals of both Houses at the recent
							Session of Congress, and documents published since the close of the
							Session.</p>

						<p>I find it impossible to carry out the Resolutions formed during the
							Session of Congress, to devote the recess to subjects of public interest
							which I was then compelled to overlook— I have indeed disposed of two of
							them for the present—but the rescinding of the gag-rule— The Jackson
							fable of the <persRef ref="erving-george">Erwin</persRef> Treaty with
							Spain; the Smithsonian bequest— The controversy between Massachusetts
							and South Carolina— The new States of Texas, Iowa, and Florida—The
							territories of Nebraska and Oregon—and the Errors of the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> census— All sub which I did intend
							thoroughly sift before the next Session of Congress— They are slipping
							through my hands— I have made out this day to answer a Letter which has
							been six weeks on my table from <persRef ref="ridgely-charles">Charles
								W. Ridgely Esq<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> of Baltimore
							and to despatch 5 copies which he had enclosed to me of the Abstract of
							the proceedings of the National Lord’s day Convention, held in that City
							on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 28<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of November 1844— I receive also, and despatch from day to
							day 4 copies of the annual Report of the <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry"
								>Commissioner of Patents</persRef>. The importance which this
							document has acquired is apparent from the fact that at the recent
							Session the House ordered 25000 and the Senate 50,000 extra copies to be
							printed for gratuitous distribution.— The document of the present year
							is a volume of 520 pages, besides the list of patents issued in 1844.
							not yet printed— In opening its leaves I find much useful instruction
							upon a great variety of subjects, which have already diverted hours and
							hours of my time; and from which I must tear myself away— I can now only
							note down— That the Patent Office was burnt down 15 December 1836— On
							the preceding 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July An Act of
							Congress had passed, to promote the progress of useful arts, and to
							repeal all acts and parts of acts heretofore made for that purpose— On
							the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1837. was passed an Act in
							addition to the act to promote the progress of science and useful arts,
							and on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1839. was approved
							an Act in Addition to “An Act to promote the progress of the useful
							arts.” Before this last act the annual reports from the Patent Office
							were little more than lists of the patents issued and expired in the
							course of the year— They Since 1839. have swollen into Treatises of
							agriculture, chemistry, manufactures mechanical inventions and general
							statistics, and have become such favourites with Congress, that both
							houses have ordered these extraordinary numbers of the report of the
							present year to be printed for gratuitous distribution.— <persRef
								ref="campbell-archibald">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>In looking over the documents printed during the progress of the recent
							Session of Congress the objects of enquiry multiply upon me so that I
							begin to fear for the soundness of my intellect, and get bewildered in
							the effort, to select from the mass a very few of the most important and
							confining myself to them to discard all the rest— The Patent Office
							Report made at the recent Session, for the year 1844. roused to such an
							extent my curiosity, that I have collected from my Chaos of old papers,
							the Reports of the two preceding years, and have devoted several hours
							every day of this week to trace the history of this office since its new
							organization by the act of 4. July 1836. and the subsequent fire of 15.
							December of that year.— By the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> section
							of the act of 3. March 1839. 1000 dollars were appropriated, for the
							collection of agricultural statistics; and for other agricultural
							purposes, for which the <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry"
								>Commissioner</persRef> was required to account in his next annual
							report.— This is the seed from which the annual Patent Office Report has
							gradually swollen into a volume.— On the 24<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1833. a standing
							Committee on Patents was instituted in the House of Representatives of
							the United States; and such a Committee, of 5. members is appointed from
							Session to Session— I must pursue these enquiries further. I called this
							day on <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Madison</persRef>, and delivered to her according to the request of
								<persRef ref="elliott-jesse">Commodore Jesse D. Elliott</persRef>
							the silver medal in honour of <persRef ref="cooper-james">James Fenimore
								Cooper</persRef>, which he caused to be struck and of which he left
							with me, for the purpose— The other copies for the historical Societies,
							for <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, and for myself were
							all in bronze; this one only was in silver— Her Son <persRef
								ref="todd-john">John Payne Todd</persRef>, and her niece <persRef
								ref="payne-anna">Anna Payne</persRef> were with her— I then paid a
							visit to <persRef ref="pakenham-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pakenham</persRef> the British Minister, and had a conversation of
							more than two hours on the general politics of the present times; and
							especially upon the Texas and Oregon questions— I spoke to him with
							unlicenced freedom, without drawing out anything but generalities from
							him— He lent me a small volume by <persRef ref="falconer-thomas">Thomas
								Falconer</persRef>—London 1844. on the discovery of the Mississippi,
							and on the South-western, Oregon, and North-western boundary of the
							United States— I took my twilight walk, and as it darkened <persRef
								ref="maury-matthew2">Lieutenant Maury</persRef> came with a Hack and
							took me to the Observatory where, I looked through the large <persRef
								ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauenhofer</persRef> Refractor at the

						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church this morning <persRef ref="knox-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> preached from
							Matthew 26.38.— [“]Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding
							sorrowful, even unto death”— The sufferings of the Saviour constitute an
							inexhaustible fund for pulpit eloquence. The mystery of those sufferings
							is incomprehensible.— The narrative by its simplicity and minuteness,
							beggars all human invention, and staggers all rational belief— He was
							executed for blasphemy, in strict conformity to the <persRef ref="moses"
								>Mosaic</persRef> Law delivered from Sinai.— The accusation attested
							by two false witnesses was that he had said he was able to destroy the
							temple of God, and to build it in three days— He had said what was
							equivalent to it, but in a figurative sense, referring to his own death
							and resurrection.— When charged with the words before the High-Priest,
							he answered nothing, till by him adjured by the living God, to say
							whether he was the Christ, the Son of God he answered Thou hast said—and
							then added—nevertheless, I say unto you—hereafter shall ye see the Son
							of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of
							Heaven—whereupon the high-priest rent his clothes; declared Jesus guilty
							of blasphemy upon his own confession, and took a vote of the chief
							Priests, elders and council who sentenced him to death— All this he
							foreknew. Yet he had three times prostrated himself in prayer to God the
							father, that if possible this cup might pass from him— And yet when
								<persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef> smote off the ear of the
							high-priest’s servant, Jesus sharply rebuked him—said he could pray to
							his father who would give him more than twelve legions of angels—and
								<persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef> says that he touched the man’s
							ear and healed him. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox’s argument dwelt
							chiefly on the mental agony of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, of far
							more cruel torture than the suffering of the body by crucifixion; and
							this was urged as a consideration to fortify the doctrine of the
							atonement— In the afternoon, at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							church, <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pyne</persRef> read the evening service for the second Sunday after
							Easter, and <persRef ref="u">Professor Goodman</persRef> preached from
							Matthew 27.54. “Truly this was the Son of God.” It seemed little more
							than a continuation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox’s morning
							discourse. The sufferings of the crucifixion and the incidents of
							humility, resignation, benevolence and self-sacrifice then exhibited by
							Jesus Christ were recapitulated in a very well written though not very
							well delivered Sermon. The Roman centurion exclaims truly this was the
							Son of God— The high-Priest adjures Jesus to say whether he is the Son
							of God. But are we not all Sons of God?— <persRef
								ref="polk-james;polk-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi

							Presbyterian Church this morning; and as we came out this morning—after
							handing his Ladies into their Carriage he turned back and came up to me,
							and shook hands with me very courteously— I received these advances with
							a return of equal civility— <persRef ref="thornton-anna">M<hi

						<p>Patent Laws. I have imposed upon myself a task which enlarges as I
							proceed, so as already almost to frighten me from my purpose— I began
							this day by writing a page of my intended memoir, and it opened before
							me a field of enquiry at which I stood appalled— Without completing an
							abstract of the first Patent Law of 10. April 1790. I recurred to the
							Register of Congressional debates of the first Congress to ascertain if
							there was any discussion of principles in the concoction of the Law.— I
							found there some information, and more matter for further enquiry. In my
							morning walk I stop’d at the Patent Office, to converse with the
							Commissioner <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">Henry L.
							Ellsworth</persRef>; but he has been gone a week to Boston, and is not
							expected back before the end of this week— I obtained from the chief
							clerk a pamphlet copy of the present Patent Laws—one of Information to
							persons having business to transact at the Patent Office.— A
							supplementary Digest of Patents printed in 1842 of the Digest itself
							printed in 1839. there was no copy to spare— A complete copy of the
							Commissioners Report for the year 1843. which in the Executive Documents
							28. Congress 1. Session. Vol. 4. is printed without the list of Patents.
							I borrowed also for hurried inspection <persRef ref="godson-richard"
								>Godson’s</persRef> practical Treatise on the Law of Patents for
							inventions, and of Copy-right. 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Edition,
							London 1840.— A Supplement printed in 1832 to the first Edition of the

								>Perpigna</persRef>, the French Law and practice of Patents for
							Inventions, Improvements and Importations— At the National Intelligencer
							Office, I stop’d and left the proof sheet of my Address and Speech
							revised and ordered 100 copies— At the Bank of Washington, I received 90
							dollars due the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this month, interest
							on corporation 6. per cent Stock— I had purchased last week of <persRef
								ref="corcoranandriggs">Corcoran and Riggs</persRef>, at 2 per cent

						<p>Fahrenheit 30.— Funeral of Richard Cutts </p>
						<p>There was a new Moon last Sunday afternoon The weather was cool but
							moderate— The plum, cherry and Apple-trees in full blossom. The lombardy
							poplars dressing themselves in light green Monday, calm; barely cool,
							with the Indian Summer haze thickening to a dark cloud till 8 or 9 in
							the Evening. Then a sudden sweeping gale from the Northwest scattered
							all the vapours of the atmosphere, till the Sun rose bright yesterday
							morning with <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at
							26. The day and night were of January cold, March winds, and mountains
							of driving glassy dust. The wind subsided in the Night, and this morning
							my thermometer immediately after Sunrise was at 30.— The note from
								<persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Richard D. Cutts</persRef> to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> received yesterday
							afternoon, was to enquire if I would serve as a Pall-bearer at the

							4. O’Clock P.M. to which I consented— I went accordingly at that time to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts’s house, where the service was
							performed by <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pyne</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts was not a

							read the preliminary part of the service at the house and the remainder

							returned with my three fellow Pall-bearers to the house of M<hi

							O’Clock— There were three several alarms of fire this evening, and for
							the last fortnight there has been scarcely a day without one— I made
							small progress this day in the historical memoir upon the Patent Office,
							the plan of which is yet to be shaped so as to form a discourse so as to
							take from an hour and a half to two hours in reading— It must not be
							more and might perhaps be compressed within the space of one hour— The
							most formidable difficulty is to give it an interest by a dash of
							philosophical speculation. I am endeavouring to trace the origin of
							Patent and Copy-right Laws to the Laws of Nature, and the primitive
							rights of man.</p>

						<p>My enquiries concerning the Patent Laws, are leading me into a boundless
							Ocean, upon which I am already afloat, without rudder or compass.— In
							analising the first Patent Law of Congress, of 10. April 1790, an
							example of the exercise of the power granted by the Constitution, and
							considering whence it originated I was brought immediately to a search
							into the details of the English Law. I came at once to the Statute of
								<persRef ref="james-i">James I.</persRef> Chapter 3. 1624. which
							unfolds the whole theory of natural right— That Statute, published in
								<persRef ref="godson-richard">Godson’s</persRef> Treatise, declares
							all monopolies and grants of special privileges by the crown contrary to
							Law null and void— By a Section of the Act, Patents for new inventions
							for 14 years, and under, are specially excepted, provided they do not
							increase the prices of good, are not contrary to Law or inconvenient—
							The authority of the crown to issue such Patents is recognized as a part
							of the common Law— I hunted an hour or two in the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef> papers to see if there was any
							trace of a debate in the Convention which formed the Constitution, upon
							the introduction of the clause giving the power to Congress to issue
							Patents— In England it is a flower of the Royal Prerogative— The
							inference from the clause in the federal Constitution is that it was
							held to have reverted by the Revolution to the whole People of the Union
							and was proper to be conferred upon Congress— It is a nominal power to
							promote the progress of Science and useful arts, <hi rend="italic"
								>by</hi> a specific power to secure to authors and inventors, for a
							limited time, the exclusive right to their writings and inventions.— I
							found nothing about it in the Madison papers. I had received last
							evening a note from <persRef ref="lewis-isaiah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> I. W. P. Lewis</persRef> advising me that he would this
							evening at half past 7. light up his french light-house lamps, on the
							ground floor of the Patent Office building and inviting me to come and
							see it— I went accordingly and was astonished at the effect of the
							lighting of the <persRef ref="fresnel-augustin">Fresnel</persRef> lamps
							There were lighted at the same time, two of the lamps late in use at the
							Boston light-house, and similar to those now in use there— The
							difference is scarcely conceivable between the illumination of the old
							lamps, and the first class of the new— But it was not equal to the
							difference between the illumination of the first and fourth class— This
							last produced a blaze as insupportable to look at as the Sun at noon day
							with a clear sky.— <persRef ref="larned-james;larned-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Larned</persRef> and <persRef ref="newman-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Newman</persRef> were there and a few
							others afterwards, men and women— The largest lamp consumes 518. gallons
							of oil in a year.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="sewall-thomas">Doctor Thomas Sewall</persRef> died
							yesterday morning at 1 O’Clock, of Pneumonia, the same disease for which
							he had attended <persRef ref="bates-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bates</persRef>— The last time that I saw him was as he
							passed before me to go out of the Senate chamber, called out as one of
							the physicians of the deceased, following the hearse of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates to the Railway depot. He then
							probably took the disease for he sickened the next morning, an died on
							the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> day— He was born at Augusta Maine
							16. April 1786. and about the year 1820 came and settled as a physician
							in this city, when I became acquainted with him— In 1828. he joined as a
							communicant the methodist episcopal church, in which he was for several
							years a class leader— In 1821 he was appointed professor of anatomy in
							the Columbian College, in which stationed he continued till his death—
							He has been in full practice as a physician and much distinguished as a
							medical writer, especially on phrenology and Temperance— I attended his
							funeral, this afternoon which was from the methodist episcopal church at
							the corner of F and fifth Street. <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> went with me but the church was so crowded that I
							had some difficulty to get in, and make my way up to the side of the
							pulpit— Religious services were performed, and a very plain and modest
							discourse of an hour upon his life and character was delivered by the
							minister of the church— The procession of carriages was numerous, and I
							joined in it, till it passed by my house, when I withdrew from it and
							remained at home. <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Bancroft</persRef>, now Secretary of the Navy
							called on me this morning, and again in the evening, and I had two long
							conversations with him on subjects connected with the Navy Department,
							the Observatory, the magnetic apparatus and observations, the
							Smithsonian bequest; and the National Institute; and finally upon
								<persRef ref="lewis-isaiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lewis’s</persRef> catoptrical Light-House Lamps and the Patent
							Office— He asked for advice with regard to the Observatory and the
							magnetic observations, which are suspended. My advice was, 1. To build a
							dwelling house adjoining the Observatory 2. To order immediately the
							resumption of the magnetic observations.— Much—too much loose and
							desultory conversation besides to be very much restricted hereafter—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft professes great zeal to make
							something of his Department— I heartily wish he may. He intends to be a
							hard working man— Practice should follow and realize theory— Drop the
							Anchor, Hope!</p>

								ref="dyer-robert">Dyer</persRef> the auctioneer to be sold.— It was
							sold at the auction, and purchased by Burch for 80 dollars the minimum
							of the price prescribed. The morning being clear and cool I walked to
							the observatory to witness the fall of the ball from the top of the
							flagstaff over the dome of the building, at noon— As I approached it I
							saw the ball hoisted by a line to the top of the staff, and entered the
							house just in time to hear the signal given to drop the ball— This is
							not done however as I supposed it was by an actual observation of the
							Sun passing over the meridian, but merely by the indication of a good
							astronomical Clock— I went with <persRef ref="maury-matthew2">Lieutenant
								Maury</persRef> over the whole of the first floor of the building,
							and inspected again the great mural circle constructed by <persRef
								ref="troughton-edward">Troughton</persRef> and <persRef

							with its appendages made by <persRef ref="ertel-traugott"
								>Ertel</persRef> and <persRef ref="ertel-georg">son</persRef> at
							Munich— In another room there is another smaller and more easily
							manageable transit instrument which I had not seen at my former visit—
							The complications of mechanical inventions in the construction of these
							instruments form a wonderful exhibition of the faculties of the human
							mind, and a humiliating demonstration of the weakness of mine, in my
							inability even to understand the causes and effects of this minute
							machinery. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury invited me to come again
							this evening which I promised to do, if the sky should continue clear;
							but immediately after Sunset it clouded up, and I did not go— I
							mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury my opinion of the
							absolute necessity of a dwelling house adjoining the Observatory of
							which he has a feeling conviction He is also now sensible that the
							wetness of the cellar which has caused the suspension of the
							meteorological observations, comes not from rain but from the moisture
							of the ground.— He promised me a list of the persons employed on this
							service, and the special duties assigned to each of them— As I was
							walking home, a stranger very civilly accosted me in the street, and
							introduced himself to me, as <persRef ref="bagby-arthur">M<hi

							On reaching home I found at my door <persRef ref="gurley-r">M<hi

						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church this morning, <persRef ref="knox-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> preached from
							Psalm 90.2 “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
							formed the earth, and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,
							thou art God.” Without indulging an irreverent Spirit, or an infidel
							propensity, I often fall into philosophical enquiries, setting aside all
							belief of miraculous events, and of divine inspiration, what it is that
							has made the tribe of <persRef ref="judah">Judah</persRef> the
							Legislators of all civilized men, and the Bible, of all books in the
							world the most beloved and respected— Why is it that of all nations of
							antiquity the books of the Hebrews constitute the holy Scriptures, and
							that the law delivered from Sinai is at this day the code of the
							Christian world? Is it not that with them originated the idea of
							Elohim—of Jehovah— Of one omnipotent creator of the world— The
							omnipotence and eternity of God, is the germinating idea of man’s
							immortality and of his responsibility to his creator emanates— There is
							no more copious fountain of eloquence in the pulpit, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox handled it much more to my
							satisfaction than he, or any other man can do, with the doctrine of the
							atonement—or of the trinity, or of the god-head of the Son of man— If
							God has created man with a sense of right and wrong, the measure of his
							rights and his duties must be the will of his maker, and that will must
							be Justice tempered with mercy.— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the Evening
							service for the third Sunday after Easter, and preached from Psalm 34.8
							[“]O taste and see, that the Lord is good.”— There seems to be and
							incongruity of figure in this sentence, inasmuch as taste is not the
							sense which administers to the eye—but the remainder of the verse is the
							lesson that completes the sense, and the summary of the whole Psalm—
							Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.— The goodness of God is a theme
							most acceptably following immediately after that of his eternity and his

						<p>My task of writing a historical memoir on the patent Office grows so
							irksome as I proceed, that I begin to feel discouraged, and apprehensive
							that I shall slacken in diligence and give it up in despair. I began
							with it this morning immediately after the exercise of the rising hour
							but my work advanced so sluggishly that it was near 4. P.M. before I
							completed the daily page— I had not been out of the house; and was left
							to my twilight walk and the evening Lamp, for the record and remaining
							occupation of the day. I passed this day from the first to the second
							act of Congress constituting the Patent Law, for the time— This system
							continued in force till the act of 4 July 1836. The improvements of the
							second act upon the first were to be correctly ascertained and noted.
							The additional provisions indicated and both continually compared with
							the cotemporaneous condition of the English Law— Dry and heavy, dull and
							tiresome—it drags its slow length along.— By way of relaxation and
							amusement from hour to hour I roused myself and folded up and despatched
							in various directions copies of the abstract of proceedings of the
							Baltimore Lord’s day convention of last November, of <persRef
								ref="hall-willard">judge Willard Halls</persRef> Plea for the
							Sabbath, of my address and speech on the report and Bill to indemnify
							the owners of the Amistad, and of my Letter of 4 July 1843. to the
							Bangor Committee—which four documents I enclose under one cover and send
							off without much discrimination to whom— I had morning visits from
								<persRef ref="gurley-r">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> R R.

						<p>My morning hours slip’d away in reading the Message of <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> to Congress of 20. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> last communicating despatches from
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Henry A. Wise</persRef>, U.S. Minister to
							Brazil relating to the Slave trade carried on there, and to the
							participation in it of Citizens of the United States, and of British
							Subjects. This Message was referred in the House to the Committee of
							Foreign Affairs—which made no report upon it; for which they had indeed
							no time, the message and documents not being printed till after the
							close of the Session— The Message and Documents form a pamphlet of 88
							pages, of which I read 30— Two hours gone and call to Breakfast.—
							Shortly before noon I called at the Navy Department to see <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bancroft</persRef>, but he was gone to a Cabinet Meeting at the
								<persRef ref="polk-james">President’s</persRef>. I left with his
							chief Clerk <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lee</persRef> a copy of my Report of March<space/>1840. on the
							Smithsonian bequest to be given to him with my particular request that
							he would read it— I rode to the Capitol— Returned to the Library some
							books that I had taken out— They told me, that of 900 copies of the
							Digest of Patents printed in 1839. deposited there had been distributed
							among the States by joint Resolution of Sept<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> 1841. and 200 remain in the Library to await the further
							order of Congress which has not yet been given. I asked if I could not
							borrow one of the copies— No— Not without an order from Congress— I
							enquired at <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Clerk’s office of <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">B. B. French</persRef> late Clerk of the
							House. He did not know that such a book existed. There was not a copy of
							it in his office— But I got a copy of the Acts of Congress passed at the
							late Session, and the Reports of the Commissioner of Patents for 1843
							and 44. with the lists of Patents.— At the Patent Office I found that
							the <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">Commissioner</persRef> was returned
							from Boston, but not at the Office. I made further enquiry for the
							Digest of Patents, and a copy of it was afterwards sent to me from the
							Office.— <persRef ref="lewis-isaiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I.
								W. P. Lewis</persRef> walked with me from the patent office to my
							house and proceeded to the Treasury Department to see the Secretary
								<persRef ref="walker-robert">Robert J. Walker</persRef>.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis said the merchants of Boston had
							addressed a memorial to the Secretary of the Treasury requesting him to
							cause a lenticular glass lamp of the french <persRef
								ref="fresnel-augustin">Fresnel</persRef> forth class to be erected
							at the long island lighthouse in Boston harbour— Towards evening we had

									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> with <persRef ref="campbell-frances">her infant

								ref="grattan-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. C.
								Grattan</persRef> the British Consul at Boston. Long conversation
							with them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft gave now another
							reason for the suspension of the meteorological observations at the

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft promised me that he would

							system of lighting with that now existing. He estimates a great increase

								Markoe</persRef> from the Department of State called on me this

							the origin of some commercial privilege in the kingdom of the two
							Sicilies, first enjoyed by France and Spain by virtue of some secret
							Article and stipulation in a Treaty; afterwards obtained by
							Great-Britain by force— And which all the diplomatic agents of the

							had never heard of this privilege before, and knew not what it was, but
							I referred him to <persRef ref="martens-georg">Martens’s</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="jenkinson-charles">Jenkinson’s</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="chalmers-george">Chalmers’s</persRef> collections of Treaties

								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of the American Archives— I
							called afterwards at the Department of State to see the Secretary
								<persRef ref="buchanan-james2">James Buchanan</persRef>, but he was
							at the <persRef ref="polk-james">President’s</persRef> attending a

									>r</hi> Thomas</persRef> was here to visit <persRef

							several days confined to her chamber by bilious complaints and symptoms

							20. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> last with the correspondence of
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">H. A. Wise</persRef> concerning the
							Slave-trade— Wise’s passion for notoriety and his mountebank abhorrence
							of the African Slave trade has drawn him into a position from which it
							will be curious to see how he will extricate himself.— The Slave trade
							piracy is carried on from Brazil as it was and is from the Havana
							Instead of falling in with and aiding and abetting it, for a share of
							the plunder as <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">Trist</persRef> did at the

							moralizes and heroizes with the British Minister <persRef

							of Rio till he takes a lover’s leap from the sublime to the ridiculous—
								<persRef ref="hague-thomas">Hague</persRef> the Astrologer was here

						<p>I had read part of the book lent me by <persRef ref="pakenham-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pakenham</persRef>, on the
							discovery of the Mississippi, and on the Southwestern Oregon, and the
							Northwestern boundary of the United States; by <persRef

							Society of Lincolns Inn— London <persRef ref="clarke-samuel3">Samuel
								Clarke</persRef> 18. Pall mall East— I resumed the reading of this
							book this morning, which is a sort of argumentative Treatise, upon the
							Texas and Oregon questions of such fearful magnitude in the present
							condition of our Country. There is much information with some important
							errors in the Dissertation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Falconer;
							but the chief interest of his book, is in the translation of Original
							Memoirs of <persRef ref="lasalle-robert">La Salle</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tonti-henri">Tonti</persRef>, and other documents recently
							published which I had never before seen. I called this morning first at
							the Department of State, and had a long conversation with the Secretary
								<persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Buchanan</persRef>.— I enquired what
							had been done with the call of 25 Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> for
							the correspondence of the former Consul at Rio de Janeiro, <persRef
								ref="slacumb-george">Slacum</persRef>—he made enquiry of <persRef
								ref="derrick-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Derrick</persRef> who found the Resolution, and said it had been
							received too late to be answered before the close of the session— I
							enquired if any further despatches had been received from <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise</persRef> since
							his letter to <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> of 14. December 1844 communicated with the message
							of 20. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> last— He said, speaking
							confidentially that a very long despatch had been received, and a
							voluminous correspondence which he had not yet had time to read
							through—but there had been great excitement, and a quarrel of which he
							gave me a brief summary. A confused account of it has been published in
							the Newspapers, in a private letter from Rio de Janeiro dated 9. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y.</hi> last— I said I highly approved M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise’s exposure of the scandalous slave
							trade carried on by Americans and English from Brazil. But I was
							apprehensive he had carried out the spurious doctrine that the flag
							carries territorial jurisdiction with it all round the world to an
							untenable extent—and I hoped the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>President</persRef> would not assume it, for it could not be
							maintained He said he thought so too— He said he would examine the whole
							correspondence, and see me again. In the chief Clerk (Derrick)’s chamber
							I met <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ellsworth</persRef> the Commissioner of Patents, and shortly
							afterwards called on him at his office. I put many questions to him
							concerning the origin and early history of the Patent Office; but the
							fire of 1836 has consumed almost all the primitive records— The Digest
							of 1839. divides all the patents issued into 22 Classes of subjects with
							an alphabetical list of patentees— I asked if there was a chronological
							list marking the succession of tim in the dates of the issues. There is
							not— Nor any list of the eminently useful important and successful
							patents. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellsworth spoke to me of the
							obstinate resistance he had to encounter from John C. Calhoun to the
							improvements in his reports, since the new organization of the Office in
							1836. and the bitter complaints of <persRef ref="black-edward">Edward J.
								Black</persRef> of Georgia that the Patent reports are regarded as
							Tariff Documents, and actually defeated his election.— The <persRef
								ref="collins-joseph">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Collins</persRef> came with a
							subscription paper for a history of the United States in 4 volumes,
								by<space/><persRef ref="frost-john2">Frost</persRef>— I had a long and

							on Massachusetts Avenue near 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Street— I
							went accordingly, and found the place not without difficulty; for long
							as I have lived at Washington I did not even know in what direction the
							Massachusetts avenue was to be found— I was wandering round in the
							neighbourhood of 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Street when a stranger
							who was walking with a Lady, met me, and seeing I was upon the search
							asked me if I was looking for the Methodist Church— I said I was, and he
							told me it was two squares above. The Massachusetts avenue runs
							parallel, with the Pennsylvania avenue, due north, and about half a mile
							distant from it— But it is not laid out as a street— My strolling had
							belated me— The Church was excessively crowded and there were numbers of
							people standing in the street without the doors— An attendant at the
							Church saw me as I approached, beckoned to me to follow him, and made
							way for me through the throng up to the Chancel fronting the pulpit
							where they gave me an armed chair— The Secretaries of State and War,
								<persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Buchanan</persRef> and <persRef

							reading the first chapter of Isaiah—after which he read the latter part

							preached from Isaiah 11.9. the latter clause of the verse—“the earth

						<p>Some six or seven days since a slight soreness of my left thumb at the
							edge of the nail announced an inflammation, not otherwise perceptible—
							Hoping that it would pass away I said nothing of it and did nothing for
							it until yesterday afternoon when the thumb was swollen, the
							inflammation manifest, and the pain so pungent that I could no longer
							keep my counsel, and resorted to <persRef ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goods</persRef> for a bread and milk
							poultice. With this I went to bed last Night, but suffered acute pain
							without possibility of sleeping till about 1. A.M. when I threw off the
							poultice, and obtained about two hours of sleep— I sent this morning for
								<persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas</persRef> who ordered a flax-seed poultice—with laudanum
							which asswaged the pain, and quickened the suppuration— He came again
							towards evening, ordered a fresh poultice and another at bed-time, with
							a potion of hoptea mixed with a tea spoonful of paregoric— My
							occupations are much disturbed by this incident, but will, I hope not be
							entirely broken up.— <persRef ref="bond-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bond</persRef> was here, and I had much conversation
							with him respecting the Astronomical and Magnetic observatories.— He
							thinks the dwelling house, and the building for the magnetic
							observations indispensable here, and that they may be detached from the
							Observatory, but connected with it by covered ways— The magnetic
							observations have been superseded at Cambridge as well as here, and I
							see that <persRef ref="bancroft-george">Bancroft</persRef> will talk
							more than he will act.— I finished the reading of <persRef
								ref="falconer-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Falconer’s</persRef> book on the discovery of the Mississippi and on
							the Oregon, which gives me an entire new view of the Louisiana
							question.— The Second Memoir of <persRef ref="lasalle-robert">La
								Salle</persRef> printed first in this proves that his expedition
							from La Rochelle in 1684 was warlike against the Mexican mines.— But I
							must suspend my further enquiries on this subject—and return the two
							volumes of <persRef ref="hennepin-louis">Hennepin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="tonti-henri">Tonti</persRef>; and <persRef ref="joutel-henri"
								>Joutel</persRef> to the Library of Congress. I had the curiosity on
							my Meridian walk to ascertain the walking distance by 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> street from the Pennsylvania to the
							Massachusetts Avenue—found it 13. minutes—two thirds of a mile.—
								<persRef ref="thornton-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> sent me several papers of the <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">late Doctor</persRef> relating to the
							Patent-Office useful to my enquiries; but which suggest others— I find
							myself continually arrested by chronological uncertainties which I
							cannot stop to ascertain— In all undertakings to write Lectures,
							Addresses, Orations or Memoirs, if I suffer myself to be interrupted, I
							scarcely ever am able to resume the subject. My abortions of this kind
							are almost numberless— As <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"

						<p>The flax-seed poultice tinctured with laudanum and the hoptea with
							paregoric gave me a sound sleep last Night, so that I heard nothing of
							the ringing of bells a full hour for a fire, between 1 and 3 of the
							morning. There have been similar alarms the two preceding nights, and
							scarcely a day without some alarm has passed within the last month— This
							morning I was compelled to omit my daily frictions; and took a Seidlitz
							powder. <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> had not left
							her chamber till this morning when by <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas’s</persRef> direction she took
							a morning ride. I went with her and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> who is also much indisposed with symptoms of fever—
							I had received a Letter from <persRef ref="addison-thomas2">Thomas G.
								Addison</persRef> Louisville Kentucky, enquiring after a Memorial to
							the House of Representatives, sent me last January by <persRef
								ref="lee-edmund3">Edmund F. Lee</persRef>, of Jeffersonville
							Indiana— I found by my minutes that I presented it last 15. January and
							that it was entered on the journal of the house of 16. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> as referred to the Committee of roads and
							Canals—on attempting last Evening to answer Addison’s Letter, I could
							not find on the Journal whether the Committee had reported— So I went
							and enquired at the <persRef ref="french-benjamin">Clerk’s</persRef>
							Office, and found they had not— I borrowed from the Supreme Court’s Law
							Library the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> volumes of <persRef ref="wheaton-henry">Wheaton’s</persRef>

								ref="evans-oliver">Oliver Evans</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="eaton-isaac">Eaton</persRef>, and the note on the patent Laws
							in the Appendix to Vol. 3. p. 13.— At the patent office I stop’d and
							left the Carriage to return home— I enquired of <persRef
								ref="ellsworth-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ellsworth</persRef> if there was in the office any record to shew
							who the Clerks were charged with the duty of making out the Patents
							before <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef>; and who after his death were the superintendants
							of the Patent-Office; and when he Ellsworth was appointed to that
							Office— He said that if there had ever been any records of the early
							administration of the Office they had been burnt in the fire of December
							1836. He thought it probable there might be such records at the
							Department of State— He said that he was appointed in 1835
							Superintendant of the Patent-Office; and obtained in 1836 the
							reorganization of the whole establishment by the act of 4. July 1836.—
							That <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and the whole Southern interest
							were utterly opposed to his plan and <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> was much
							influenced by them.— That Forsyth had a plan of his own, but they were
							both submitted to the Committee of the Senate, who by the influence of
								<persRef ref="ruggles-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ruggles</persRef>, then a Senator from Maine, pronounced in favour
							of his plan.— That he drew the Bill, which was submitted to the
							examination of <persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef>, who
							suggested some slight modifications, and it was carried through the
							Senate by the influence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruggles</p>

						<p>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="perkins-jesse">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jesse Perkins</persRef> of North
							Bridgwater expressing an apprehension that efforts were in progress to
							effect the removal of <persRef ref="southworth-edward">Edward Southworth
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> Postmaster of the
							principal Post-Office in that town—strongly remonstrating against it,
							and requesting me to exercise my influence, if I have any to prevent it.
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> who is yet
							indisposed and threatened with fever, rode out with <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">her mother</persRef>, and left me at the General
							Post-Office— I read to <persRef ref="johnson-cave">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef> the material parts
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins’s Letter. He sent for the
							papers relating to the office at North Bridgwater, and one of the Clerks
							brought them to him. There were two representations from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southworth against his removal, and four
							or five remonstrances signed by as many hundred names, also against
							it—but no application for the removal— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Johnson made a minute on the papers that if an application for the
							removal, notice of it should be given to me.— I went next to the Office
							of the National Intelligencer for the paper of last Monday, which we had
							not received, and of yesterday which contained my obituary notice of
								<persRef ref="cutts-richard">Richard Cutts</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef>
							gave me to read two Articles, one from <persRef ref="bennett-james2"
								>Bennett’s</persRef> Herald, and the other from the New-York
							Commercial Advertiser, upon the flare up, between <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">H. A. Wise</persRef>, and the Brazilian Government
							about the Slave-trade. Wise has undertaken to carry out the ridiculous
							pretensions of territorial Jurisdiction carried round the world by a
							flag staff, palmed upon a Slave ridden Senate by <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef>, and upon this Nation
							by the tame and Slave-ridden Senate— From M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Seaton I went to the Department of State and enquired of <persRef
								ref="derrick-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Derrick</persRef> now acting as chief Clerk about the administration
							of the Patent Law under the first act of Congress, and until the
							appointment of <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thornton</persRef>—also the dates of the appointment of
							the <persRef ref="jones-thomas2;craig-john;pickett-james"
								>successors</persRef> of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton as
							Superintendants of the Patent Office until 1835. when <persRef
								ref="ellsworth-henry">Henry L. Ellsworth</persRef> was appointed.
							Derrick knew nothing about it, and that there was nothing of the
							Documents or information that I wanted on the files or among the
							vouchers of the Department he was perfectly sure— But he would enquire
							and ascertain and let me know— I was thus cast back on my own resources,
							and in looking for the annual reports of the List of Patents found in
							the Executive Documents of 21. Congress 2. Session. N 58.—a Report of
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef> Secretary
							of State, with a Digest of all the Patents issued until that time, dated
								Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1. 1831. prepared by Thomas P.
							Jones, then a clerk in the Department of State, but shortly before
							superintendent of the Patent Office—which was then held by John B.
							Craig.— This Document was reported under a Resolution of the House of
							Representatives of 2. April 1830. offered by <persRef ref="taylor-john"
								>John W. Taylor</persRef> of New-York— It includes a digest of the

							the insolence of <persRef ref="polk-james">President Polk’s</persRef>

							first spark of Spirit that they have exhibited to meet a continual
							series of gross insults from the conclusion of the <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty to this day. I
							called at the Navy Department to converse with <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bancroft</persRef> upon the Astronomical and magnetical
							observatories— I proposed to him a plan for transferring the Observatory
							already built to the Smithsonian Institute, as in the draughts of the
							bills that I have reported to the House at three successive
							Congresses—and to put the keeping of maps and charts, and chronometers
							and quadrants upon another establishment— He was all acquiescence and

								>Commodore Crane</persRef>, now one of the Commissioners <hi
								rend="italic">of</hi> the Navy Board, who thought the custody and
							regulation of the Chronometers, Quadrants and other instruments for

							always under the charge of the Navy Department— So that a compromise
							appears to be impracticable— I came home despairing of my own project
							for the disposal of the Smithsonian fund; and renewed my historical
							enquiries concerning the Patent Office. <persRef ref="seybert-adam"
								>Seyberts</persRef> report of 12 June 1812. recommending a Home

						<p>I received this morning a note from <persRef ref="lewis-isaiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis</persRef> mentioning that the
							Secretary of the Treasury <persRef ref="walker-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker</persRef> proposed to visit the
							lenticular apparatus at the Patent Office building at 8. O’Clock this
							evening, and expressing the wish that I would invite the Secretary of
							the Navy also to attend— I called immediately at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Latimer’s</persRef> where <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bancroft</persRef> lodges, but he was gone to his office and I found
							him there.— He agreed to call at my house this evening at 8— I met in
							the street <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> who was coming
							to see <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">our
								Ladies</persRef>.— The thermometer was at 80 with a burning Sun.
							With <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> I packed up a
							Chest, 3 feet long 1 foot 6 inches wide, and same deep, (iron key), with
							Books, Congressional Globe 11 volumes from 3 to 13. Executive
							Documents—Senate Documents Reports of Committees and Senate and House
							Journals. 26. Congress. 2. Session. 1840–41.—and 27. Congress 3. Session
							1842–43. and Sundry, loose documents and other papers— <persRef
								ref="seybert-adam">Seybert’s</persRef> report of 12 June 1812 in
							favour of a Home Department, occupied me writing and reading all the
							leisure of the day— A heavy gust and shower of thunder, lightning and
							rain continued from 7. to 11 in the evening in the midst of which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft came and went with me to the
							Patent Office building where we saw the three forms of the <persRef
								ref="fresnel-augustin">Fresnel</persRef> Lenticular refracting lamps
							lighted up, in comparison with the old lights with Parabolic
							reflectors.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker the Secretary of the
							Treasury, and <persRef ref="dallas-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dallas</persRef> Vice-President of the United States,
							and several other gentlemen were there, and expressed much satisfaction
							at the success of the experiments— I said to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Walker that I hoped he would cover with them the whole Coast
							of the United States. I thought it not creditable to the country to
							receive visitors from abroad in darkness. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lewis gave us the summary of a lecture explanatory by sundry diagrams
							the operation of the lense in diffusing and giving intensity to the
							light.— The principal advantage of refracted over reflected light is
							that its emanation is seen all round the horizon while reflected light
							issues only in one direction— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft
							returned with me, and <persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> took
							him to his lodgings at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Latimer’s about
							10. He asked me what I thought of the proceedings of the British
							Parliament, on the reception of <persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk’s</persRef> inaugural address— I
							gave him my opinions with more freedom than discretion.— Reserve is the
							first selfish virtue of a politician— Fish for the opinions of others
							and hide your own.— Our Ladies were disappointed in missing the Ball of
								<persRef ref="korponay-gabriel;u">Monsieur and Madame de
								Korponay</persRef> by the thunder-storm but Walter Hellen went. </p>

						<p>The heat of dog-days has come in April. The thunder-gust and shower of
							last evening has purified the atmosphere, with scarcely any abatement of
							the heat.— I presented my third and final account at the Orphan’s Court
							as Executor of the Will of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Thomas
								Baker Johnson</persRef>
							<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef> only brother—
							To this account I was sworn by the Register <persRef ref="roach-edward"
								>Edward N. Roach</persRef>, who closed the account and sent me a
							copy of it this evening. This conclusion has been delayed since the
							close of the Session of Congress by my carelessness in not keeping all
							my private documents and vouchers together— I missed at first the will
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson itself. Then the copies of my
							preceding accounts settled at the Orphans court, and lastly the receipt
							of <persRef ref="boyd-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Harriet
								Boyd</persRef> and her husband <persRef ref="boyd-george">George
								Boyd</persRef> for the 80 dollars, her portion of the balance of
							proceeds of the sale of the personal effects. On ransacking the valise
							of private vouchers I found the copies of the accounts, and the copy of
							the Will, and probate in the small quarto manuscript volume, and on
							rummaging my files of Letters received last winter I found that from
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boyd with the receipt pinned into
							it.— The Will, and inventories and first account, as stated by the
							Register, and settled are yet missing— I drew up my third account and
							presented it to the Register, with the receipt of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boyd—
							The Register made out the Statement according to the official forms— At
							the Office of the National Intelligencer I exchanged the paper of Monday
							14. for that of Monday last— At the Franklin Insurance Office <persRef
								ref="grammer-g">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grammer</persRef> the
							President told me, he thought there would be a dividend of 5 per cent
							next month and the stock might then be sold at par.— <persRef

							had asked me for a Deed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson
							of a lot of land which by his will he bequeathed to <persRef
								ref="frye-thomas">Thomas B. J. Frye</persRef>. On looking over M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s papers I found the deed and took
							it this afternoon to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fryes house, and
							delivered it to him.— I found also an unsigned certificate of 3. shares
							in the Bank of the United States. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye
							told me there had been an explanatory order issued this day by the
								<persRef ref="marcy-william">Secretary of War</persRef> requiring
							the attendance of the Clerks from half past 8 in the morning till half
							past 3. P.M—but the Offices must be kept open till 6— A man from
							Syracuse in the State of New-York a democrat and mail contractor, came
							to see me as a curiosity—very civil and respectful, much attached to
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van

								Tyler</persRef>, but goes for <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Polk</persRef> and <persRef ref="dallas-george">Dallas</persRef>
							because they could be elected— <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> was here— My thumb is
							still inflamed and unavailable— The Doctor’s remedy this day is to steep
							it twice in lye as hot as it could bear, and cover it with a poultice of
							lye on going to bed— This was accordingly done— <persRef
								ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goods</persRef>
							is confined to her chamber and much to her bed— My wife is now my
							nurse.— The Patent Office works hard.</p>

						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> preached from John 4.24
							“God is a Spirit.” and he commented largely and well upon the opposite
							and united natures of Spirit and Matter, incomprehensibly united in the
							living creature man, still more wonderfully combined in the person of
							Jesus Christ—separated according to all outward appearance forever by
							death, and yet to be reunited by faith in the resurrection of the body,
							the heaviest tax upon faith of the whole doctrine of Christianity. God
							is a Spirit—but divest him of the human form, and what conception of <hi
								rend="italic">him</hi> remains— of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>? why
							him? <persRef ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> says that Spirits can
							assume either sex at pleasure—but how does he know that? Christ himself
							taught us to call God our <hi rend="italic">father</hi>? can we call him
							our mother? Yet we are told that Jesus himself was the only begotten son
							of God— How can we conceive of God as a Spirit, without losing ourselves
							in pantheism? God as a Spirit is infinite? where is its location? and
							how can Spirit act upon matter but by material instruments?— This is the
							chapter in which Jesus reveals himself in direct averment to the woman
							of Samaria that he is the Messias—the Christ—the anointed— This amazing
							revelation he makes in a manner equally astonishing by accosting at
								<persRef ref="jacob">Jacob’s</persRef> well, a Samaritan woman and
							asking her to give him water to drink— The whole dialogue is
							incomprehensibly wonderful— The Samaritans were converted by his
							knowledge of the Samaritan woman’s secret adventures—and by his
							discourses. The Galileans by his exercise of power in healing the
							nobleman’s son who lay at the point of death at Capernaum— But in Judea,
							Jesus testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country— The
							surprize of the woman that Jesus, a Jew, should ask a draught of water
							from her, a Samaritan, shews in blazing proof the bitter hatred between
							those two fragments of one family. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox
							prayed for <persRef ref="mclellan-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’lellan</persRef>; not that he might recover, which he considered
							past praying for, but that he might have an easy passage to the better
							world— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church,
								<persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pyne</persRef> read the evening service for the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Easter, and preached from
							1. Thessalonians 5.7. “For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and that
							be drunken are drunken in the Night. 8. But let us who are of the day be
							sober, putting on the breastplate of faith, and love; and for a helmet,
							the hope of salvation.” The doctrine was that the Sleepers and the
							Drunkards were only two classes of enemies of Christ and his gospel. The
							first cold, indifferent and heedless; the second positively depraved and
							vicious— The services were partially interrupted by a sudden very heavy
							thunder gust, with a shower and floods of rain— I was detained about a
							quarter of an hour after church for the rain to subside.</p>

							opened the door for me, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker
							received me with civility— I had about half an hour’s conversation with
							him concerning the Smithsonian bequest, and gave him my reasons for
							arresting in the House of Representatives on the last Night of the
							Session the Bill which had passed the Senate— I mentioned to him my
							objections to the organization of the board of managers; qualified as a
							Committee of Congress; but a majority of whom though elected as members,
							three from the Senate by their President, and three from the House by
							their Speaker would be no longer members, when call to act as members of

							him and by <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> of New Hampshire
							to force the bill upon the house in its last agonies—and the selfish
							purpose transparent through their motions.— Burke’s made close upon the
							midnight hour to take it out of Committee in ten minutes— M<hi

							heretofore as a member of the National Institute which was unsuccessful,
							said that his preference for the employment of the fund was first for an
							Astronomical Observatory on my plan—and secondly for a large Library
							chiefly of such books as are not to be found in other public libraries—
							He would cheerfully co-operate as far as he might be able to carry such
							a purpose into effect. He agreed with me that a Corporation and not a
							Committee of Ex-members of Congress was the proper organization for the
							management of the fund, and that measures should be taken for redeeming
							the principal, and interest from the State of Arkansas. I left him with
							a lingering hope that something may be done for the disposal of the
