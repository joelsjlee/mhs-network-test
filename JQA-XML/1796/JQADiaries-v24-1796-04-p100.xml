						<p><date>28. </date>Visit to see <persRef ref="sargent-john">J. T.

								>Hoppner</persRef> as a portrait painter. He appears to me to be

							himself fit for little more than a sign post. He has however one good

							painters much superior to either of them, but whose talents are chilled
							by neglect because they are not fashionable. The fault of Opie is that
							his colours are harsh and stiff, with a vulgar appearance from which no
							one figure of his painting that I have ever seen is exempt. Hoppner’s
							defect is that he finishes nothing. All his pictures look half done, and
							have a studied indistinctness in every part of the picture except the
							face. Surely this is not the perfection of the art.</p>
