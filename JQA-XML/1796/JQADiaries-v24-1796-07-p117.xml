							the subject should render it proper. Told him my object was to obtain

							Upon that respecting the Wilmington Packet he said he had no
							information. As to that concerning the appointment of Consuls, he
							recollected that the memorial was taken ad Referendum by the States of

							of the members that the Colonies could not be considered as a
							constituent part of the Republic, and the article of the Treaty did not
							therefore perhaps apply to them.— But he did not know whether this would
							be the answer.— Mentioned his having seen me yesterday in the Gallery of

							Leyden, is a mild, pleasant; modest man.— Such men are much more
							comfortable to treat with but very often not more easy, than harsher
							characters.— Was to have taken a lesson of Italian at <persRef ref="u"
								>Bielfeld’s</persRef> lodgings, but he has just changed, and I could
							not find him out. As I was going out met <persRef ref="u">M: Du

						<p><date>11. </date>I enter this day upon my thirtieth year. The periodical
							days of reflection are seldom satisfactory to me. The principal reproach
							my conscience can make me for the last year, is too much time spent in
							relaxation, perhaps lost. Let me strive to make a better improvement of
							the next. My apology for the past must be the state of my health. Though
							insufficient it is the best I have. The irresistible dissipation of
							London is none. The weakness of the heart—is only a plea for mercy.—
							Much more might have been done by me. Of positive wrongs I feel very
							clear during the last year. None of its predecessors for a long time
							have been so innocent. Yet none of them have been more exposed to
							temptation.— Visit this morning from <persRef ref="u">Captain

							Memoirs of <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles">Dumouriez</persRef> this
							afternoon, and read some pages in those of <persRef
								ref="garat-dominique">Garat</persRef>. The great characteristic
							trait of Dumouriez is ambitious vanity. It is the common feature of
							almost every eminent political character which the french Revolution has
							produced. There appears about him great ability in the military line, a
							great facility at repartee and address in conversation, but miserable
							ignorance and folly upon the subject of Government. His style is rapid,
							but not precise, his manner of relating, attractive in the highest
							degree, but with a colouring to his own advantage, for which allowances
							are to be made. He professes a great love for his Country and a strong
							sense of humanity; but in both cases it is evidently the result of a
							sentiment and not of a Principle. He loves his Country because the
							People at times shew attachment to him. He detests proscriptions,
							because he was proscribed, and indeed if you look through his book for a
							moral principle as the guide of his actions, you will find abundant
							proof that he had none. His first ambition is to be a monk, and six
							months after he is willing to be any thing on earth but monk. He
							attempts a suicide in the rage of a momentary obstacle in his love, and
							repents just in time to save his life. He offers to serve the Genoese
							against Corsica, and the Corsicans against Genoa. He forms a plan to
							conquer Corsica by the breach of a Treaty, and quarrels with the
							Minister who refuses to execute this plan. He declares his aversion upon
							principle to duelling in relating an attempt to force a man to fight a
							duel with him, which was prevented only by the base submission of his
							antagonist. He relates every thing that happened to him at the Bastille,
							and adds that on coming out of it he had a formal oath administered to
							him never to reveal any thing that he had witnessed there; while to shew
							that it is not <hi rend="italic">inconsistency</hi> with which he is
							chargeable, he tells us that he considered the oath as a mere formality,
							binding him to nothing. He affects a regard for <persRef ref="lafayette"
								>La Fayette</persRef>, for <persRef ref="roland-marie"
								>Rolland</persRef>, and for several others whom at the same time he
							endeavours by every part of his narration concerning them to ruin in
							reputation. In short there is scarce a page of his book but proves a
							deficiency of principle, and an overruling vanity, in a mind very
							vigorous and active.</p>

							it is not esteemed so much as it is worth, and it will please more, the
							better it is known. I have never read it before, and have been gratified
							in the perusal. I have occasionally compared it with the original, and
							find that the translator has added near an hundred lines at the end of
							the tenth book to close the action. It is not an epic poem. Nor is it a
							fair criticism to compare it with the Eneid. It has certainly much more
							originality, and the characters are much more striking than those of
								<persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef>. The sentiment and language
							are sometimes turgid and sometimes sublime. There is not much diversity
							of incident; but after <persRef ref="homer">Homer</persRef> who can
							undertake to invent? Virgil generally copies, but what <persRef
								ref="lucanus-marcus">Lucan</persRef> gives is all his own. He has
							more sentiment and philosophy, than is usual in Poems of such length.
							Much more than Homer in the Odyssey. But his great delight seems to be
							the description of things terrible. The cutting down of the sacred wood,
							the troops in a vessel of <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar’s</persRef> party, who by consent destroy one another to
							avoid falling into the hands of the Enemy, the scene of Caesar embarking
							in the night in a small barque, and the storm that he weathers in it;
							the sorceress <persRef ref="erichtho">Erictho</persRef>, and her
							incantations, the battle of Pharsalia, the Death of <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> and the march of <persRef
								ref="catoyounger">Cato</persRef> through the Thessalian desarts with
							the various venomous reptiles that infest his army, are all full of
							horror, but many of them are disgusting. The author appears to have
							wanted taste to select his incidents of description. The imagination
							revolts from many of them, though all are striking. The Gods are treated
							very cavalierly. In the very outset he charges them with taking the
							wrong side in opposition to Cato. He afterwards says they never take
							offence at any crimes but those of the unfortunate, and he more than
							once apostrophises their injustice in suffering the crimes and success
							of Caesar. The. heroes are painted larger than life. The daring ambition
							of Caesar, the inflexible stoicism of Cato; and the declining greatness
							of Pompey, are well contrasted. The Egyptian characters are not so well
							drawn. <persRef ref="photinus">Photinus</persRef> is too bare-faced a
							villain. His policy might have been attributed to him without a
							departure from nature; but he should have been made more plausible.— On
							the whole my opinion not only of the translator but of the author has
							been raised by this perusal.— The address to <persRef ref="nero"
								>Nero</persRef>, is more extravagant but not more fulsome, than that
							of Virgil to <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Augustus</persRef>, and must
							have been more excusable at the time when it was doubtless written, that
							is in the golden years of his reign. This is very evident from the
							complection of the whole poem: for certainly Lucan would not have
							ventured to publish the bold sentiments of Liberty that prevail in every
							part of it during the tyrannical part of the monster’s government. It is
							very probable however, that they cost the author his life. Though a mere
							rivalship, for Poetical fame is only mentioned by the historians as the
							cause from whence originated the conspiracy in which Lucan joined, and
							for which he suffered.</p>

							</hi>rather than a <hi rend="italic">residentiary</hi> traveller. He
							should have remembered that the barn of a gleaner should be proportioned
							to his character and employment. He appears ambitious to be thought an
							imitator of Yorick, and some of his sensibilities are not uninteresting.
							He must be content however in this walk with a station much below that
							of his master.— His accounts from Holland, whenever they relate to the
							Government of the Country are very inaccurate. He is right only in the
							most superficial details, which to be sure every traveller in this
							Country sees, but which very few travellers think it worth while to
							record. He frequently calls these Provinces the United States and talks
							of the <persRef ref="wiliam-v">Prince of Orange’s</persRef> subjects.
							What can be the constitutional <hi rend="strikethrough">language</hi>
							knowledge of a man who knows no better than to use these expressions <hi
								rend="italic">here</hi>? it must be very small, and accordingly M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pratt discovers his ignorance in every page that
							he writes on this point.— His liberality is indeed laudable, not only as
							it is extraordinary for an Englishman, but as I think it in a great
							degree <hi rend="strikethrough">Dutch</hi> just. He carries it perhaps
							too far.— The Dutch are far from being the unfeeling People, which the
							arrogance and levity of travellers among them have represented; but
							neither are they the people of refined sensibility which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Pratt seems disposed to allow them.— In spite of all he
							says I cannot reconcile myself to their language. It is founded neither
							on sentiment nor on science. It differs indeed very little from the
							English, but that difference is wholly to its disadvantage. The English
							have been for several centuries continually softening the teutonic
							gutturals and aspirates; they have been continually introducing french
							and Italian, as well as Roman and Greek derivatives. <pb n="125"
								type="ms"/>The Excessive harshness of the Teutonic original language
							has been in some measure corrected by these practices. In the dutch <hi
								rend="italic">classical </hi>language it subsists in all its
							horrors. Pratt observes that in the mouth of a pretty woman the Dutch
							often assumes a tone far from unpleasant. But he does not observe, what
							is in fact the case, that the pretty Dutch women, even in speaking their
							own language, use a <hi rend="italic">vast number</hi> of words <hi
								rend="italic">merely french</hi>, which the custom of female
							conversation has sanctioned among them, and has extended through all
							ranks of the sex, but which are seldom or ever used by the men, and are
							not to be found in any of the dictionaries or books of the language.
							Almost all the terms which naturally recur most frequently in common
							female discourse, are of this description, and enjoy this species of <hi
								rend="italic">denization</hi> from the french into the Dutch
							language. This Author’s politics are like his other qualities
							superficial and momentary; and some of his opinions were refuted by
							Events before his book was published. Why burden the world with them?— I
							suppose after the trouble of writing, he could not afford to sacrifice
							them. A book must be made—and when the quantity was provided there was
							no haggling for the quality. The poem of Humanity, is in smooth verse,
							but contains only common place ideas.— Pratt is not an <hi rend="italic"
								>original thinker</hi>; but how few of these does the world
							produce.— It has a much greater defect. It is in two books; contains
							near two thousand verses and has no plan. It is altogether desultory
							slips alternately from one topic to another, and resumes the same again
							after having once taken it up.— It is likewise feeble, and deficient in
							the poetical fire the first and most essential characteristic of poetry.
							Those who can be satisfied with the well-tuned bells of rhyme, and the
							hot bed flowers of expression may read it with pleasure.</p>

							it.— Walk in the Voorhout in the Evening. Met Bielfeld, with a German <hi rend="italic">Author</hi>;
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Levsen</persRef>. Walk’d
							sometime with the latter. I had enquired of him whether any application
							had been made by the friends of <persRef ref="lafayette">M. La
								Fayette</persRef> to the Danish Court, to request its interference
							to obtain his liberation. He then told me he believed not. This Evening
							he told me he had written to the <persRef ref="bernstorff-christian"
								>Comte de Bernstorff</persRef> on the subject, and could now answer
							me for certain they had not. He could further add that La Fayette was
							now detained by the <persRef ref="francis-i">Empero</persRef>r as a
							prisoner of the <persRef ref="frederick-william-ii">king of
								Prussia</persRef>, and was kept under a promise made to him. That
							the Emigrants were at the bottom and his liberty could probably be
							obtained only by application from the king of Prussia, who would make it
							whenever the <hi rend="italic">french</hi> Government may desire it. But
							that no other application would probably be successful. This short
							conversation of Levsen suggests many reflections to me and will deserve
							further meditation.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day. July 1796</hi>.</date> Rise at half past
							five, and set myself to reading or writing at six. continue till half
							past nine, when I go to breakfast. from thence till eleven read
							newspapers, and English Monthly or critical Reviews, and dress. from
							eleven till one, translate from the Dutch or Italian, or attend to
							visitors upon business or of complaisance. from one till half past two
							taking my Italian lesson at <persRef ref="u">Bielfeld’s</persRef>
							lodgings and my own alternately by weeks.— The days when we do not take
							a lesson, these hours are passed like the two immediately preceding.
							From half past two, one hour’s walk. from half past three to five, at
							dinner, and a little conversation after it. from five till dark, reading
							for amusement, a book of heroic English verse, and some miscellaneous
							prose. Another hour’s walk in the Evening. Supper at ten; bed at eleven.
							This course throughout the month has been regular with scarce a single
							exception. The greatest variation has been from the reading to writing
							in the morning before breakfast; and perhaps the present excess is that
							of writing too much, and reading not enough of the books of knowledge
							and importance.</p>
						<p>The reading of the month has carried me through <persRef ref="luzac-elie"
								>Luzac’s</persRef> Richesse de la Hollande, and the Traité General
							de Commerce; the latter as mentioned on the day when I finished it. The
							life of <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles">Dumouriéz</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="garat-dominique">Garat’s</persRef> Memoires, and <persRef
								ref="pratt-samuel">Pratt’s</persRef> gleanings. Of all these books I
							have made mention and some slight observation at the time of finishing;
							and also of <persRef ref="pitt-christopher">Pitt’s</persRef> translation of the Eneid, <persRef
								ref="rowe-nicholas">Rowe’s</persRef> Lucan, which I have gone
							through, and <persRef ref="garth-samuel">Garth’s</persRef> compilation
							of the Metamorphoses which I have not yet finished. To improve in the
							Dutch language I have usually translated a page every day and after
							going thus through the Constitution of the National Assembly which is
							now in session, I took the Introduction to <persRef ref="u"
								>Reudorp’s</persRef> Memoirs. I shall give the preference to all
							interesting state papers, because I send the translations to the
								<persRef ref="pickering-timothy">Secretary of State</persRef>, and
							thus answer two good purposes at once.— My progress in Italian is slow,
							and I can only translate two or three Stanza’s of <persRef
								ref="tasso-torquato">Tasso</persRef> at a time. the language itself
							is enchanting, but with no opportunity to speak or hear it spoken my
							advances are very small, and with my other occupations I may perhaps
							grow tired of that.— To keep alive my latin, I have begun to translate a
							page of <persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef> every day, and am going
							through the life of <persRef ref="agricola">Agricola</persRef>, which in
							the year 1784. at this place I translated into french. I find this
							author still new, and a special application to his writings will I hope
							be useful to me on several accounts. His language, his wisdom, his
							style, his method, all afford subject for meditation and improvement.
							This is not the part of my time the worst employed.— My other writing is
							principally confined to writing and answering letters, or to this
							journal. The time for original composition has not yet come; I know not
							whether it ever will. I shall probably never have a time so favorable
							for it as the present.— But I have no <hi rend="italic">subject</hi>,
							and am far from being yet satisfied with my style.</p>
