						<p><date>2. </date>Lesson of Italian at <persRef ref="u"
								>Bielfeld’s</persRef>. Our Master appears to interest himself very
							much in the progress of the french. There is here a man with whom he
							consorts; an author; who being acquainted with the Geography of Lower
							Saxony his native Country, offers his services as a guide to the french
							troops now invading that territory, to conduct them where the richest
							plunder is to be obtained. <persRef ref="noel-francois">Noël</persRef>
							is therefore going to send him to the army of the Rhine. Bielfeld thinks
							the morality of the man rather inaccurate, but says he is a<hi
								rend="italic">bon diable</hi>, and that it is not avarice but
							fanaticism that inspires him. I believe it is the fanaticism of the
							followers of Catiline and Cethegus.— Walk in the wood.— Evening at the
							Dutch play.<hi rend="italic">Menschenhaat </hi><hi
								rend="strikethrough italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic"> en
								Berouw</hi> (Misanthropy and Repentance.) a translation from a
							German Comedy of <persRef ref="kotzbue-august">Kotzebue</persRef>.
							The Misanthropy, is that of an husband, whose beloved wife has been
							seduced by a young man, and has eloped with him. The Repentance is that
							of the wife, for having been seduced, and her consequent elopement. It
							closes with a reconciliation. <persRef ref="u">Bingley</persRef> was
							very good in the husband, and <persRef ref="wattier-johanna"
								>Mademoiselle</persRef>, bating a little too much roaring in her
							lamentations excellent in <persRef ref="eulalia">Ulalia</persRef> the
							wife. From her performance she should more properly have been called <hi
								rend="italic">Ulularia</hi>. I cannot forgive Pratt for comparing
							her with <persRef ref="siddons-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Siddons</persRef>. For the nice delicate shades that distinguish
							similar Passions she is altogether incompetent, and she knows little
							more than how to weep and wail and gnash her teeth. Her performances are
							therefore very monotonous. Bingley has the same fault though not in the
							same degree. Yet this Evening and the former they beguiled me of some
							tears, and received the same tribute from many others. The house was
							full The play is very long. I know not how many acts it pretends to
							have; but the natural divisions give it six or seven.— The farce, a
							translation from <persRef ref="spleen-jacques">Jacques Spleen</persRef>,

							character. It was late, and I was weary.</p>

								>Tasso</persRef> at the head of his translation. A romantic life

								<persRef ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef>, that he was when in
							Italy acquainted with <persRef ref="manso-giovanni">Manso</persRef>,
							Marquis of Villa the intimate friend of Tasso and his patron. My doubts
							arose from the distance of time between the two sublime Poets, and from
							an idea taken from one of the biographers that Manso is celebrated in
							the Gierusalemme Liberata. This poem was finished and published in 1574.
							Milton was in Italy, about 1638. A period of sixty-eight years, appeared
							long for the life of a man already of an age to be celebrated as a
							magnanimous knight.— I ascertained however that it was really the same
							man, by turning to the Latin Poem which Milton addressed to him. But it
							is in the Jerusalem Conquered that Tasso mentions Manso. this Poem, was
							published only three or four years before the Death of the Italian bard.
							Walk in the Evening. Met Bielfeld. Conversation with him. He made some
							observations upon the curious practice of fabricating books, in Germany
							at this time. There is a sort of literary mania prevalent there. His
							literary Cethegus has told him some new anecdotes upon that subject. At
							the last semi-annual Fair of Leipzig, an hundred and seventy nine new
							Novels made their appearance.— He mentioned too the smothered flame of
							democracy, as burning with great fury in every part of Germany, and
							especially in the Danish Dominions.</p>

							courtier, and not a very profound thinker. <persRef ref="u">His
								son</persRef> says that one of the great advantages of reading his
							works is that they cost not the smallest effort of the mind. At least
							one half of these volumes consists of descriptions either of Palaces and
							Gardens belonging to the king and Princes of Prussia, or of festivals
							and ceremonial parades upon princely marriages and other similar
							occasions. <hi rend="strikethrough">It</hi> They contain also many
							particulars of his private life. He was by birth a Hamburger, and
							attached himself to the <persRef ref="frederick-ii">late king of
								Prussia</persRef>, before his accession to the throne. Soon after
							this Event, which is detailed in one of the letters with the true Spirit
							of a Courtier, he was employed as Secretary to a legation at the Court
							of <persRef ref="george-ii">George the 2<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi></persRef>
							at Hanover: he afterwards went to England in the same capacity. He spent
							some time there, but his letters written from thence do not shew that he
							became very intimately acquainted with the Nation. Two of them however
							are interesting; the one upon the question as to the benefits of
							civilization, which <persRef ref="rousseau-john">Rousseau</persRef>, has
							since made so famous, and the other containing a sort of historical
							dissertation upon Romance and novel writers ancient and modern. On his
							return from England, where he was not many months, he was placed as a
							counsellor in the department of foreign affairs. He was afterwards
							appointed Governor of the king’s youngest brother <persRef
								ref="augustusferdinand">Ferdinand</persRef>. Upon his marriage the
							king made him a Baron, and Curator of all the Prussian Universities.— He
							probably found some time after his style of living too expensive, and
							retired altogether from the Court of Berlin to an Estate in Saxony
							called Treben. Here he was routed by the contending parties in the seven
							years war, and retired to Hamburg where the last Letters are dated in
							1760. The volumes are dedicated to <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
								>Voltaire</persRef> in an Epistle rather too encomiastic. The last
							years, are embittered by misfortune; his property suffered by fire and
							the sword; and he lost a number of children successively in their
							infancy. The book will not add much to the wisdom or Virtue of any one,
							but it may amuse the leisure of a few hours. I am particular in this
							account chiefly on account of the intimacy I have formed with his son
							which has added much to the interest I take in his history. <pb n="133" type="ms"/>Called this Evening to see <persRef

						<p><date>25. </date>At length have a moment of relief. Again at the sale of
							books. Finished this morning the translation of the life of <persRef
								ref="agricola">Agricola</persRef>, by <persRef ref="tacitus"
								>Tacitus</persRef>. I translated the same work into french in the
							year 1784. It merits a very particular attention— Walk to Scheveling.—
							Finished reading <persRef ref="hoole-john">Hoole’s</persRef> translation
							of <persRef ref="tasso-torquato">Tasso</persRef>.— The book is popular.
							The versification is very smooth; but it appears to be feeble. It is
							cold, and has been read like a task, and of course with very little
							attention. I have compared most of the first book with the original. The
							sense is diluted. The poetic charm the soul of the verse is in many
							instances lost, or rather is in very few preserved. But when Tasso is
							robbed of this attraction he has but little left. His invention is
							wretchedly poor and strangely absurd. His machinery is pitiful. But his
							details of sentiment, character and language are admirable. “La Poésie
							says Voltaire, ne plait que par les beaux details.” This is a very mean
							and false idea of Poetry, but it suits the delicate tenuity of a french
							critic, and is just calculated to place The Henriade or the Jerusalem
							above the Iliad, and the Zaïre above the Othello. Upon this maxim the
							poem of Tasso would be superior to any production of the epic Muse till
							the days of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>. Tasso
							excels very much in his female characters. His Sophronia, Clorinda,
							Erminia, Gildippe, and even Armida, are all extremely interesting. The
							Gerusalemme therefore is above all others the Epic Poem of the Ladies.—
								<persRef ref="homer">Homer’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="andromache">Andromache</persRef> stands alone, and bears a
							very subordinate part. His <persRef ref="penelope">Penelope</persRef>
							though much praised excites little attention. All the rest are either
							obnoxious, or <pb n="135" type="ms"/>have so little agency that they are
							not to be mentioned.— <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> is noted
							for his severity to the fair sex. He seems to delight in aggravating
							their infirmities &amp; insulting their misfortunes. <persRef
								ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> has but one female. But alas!
							Hinc illae lacrymae. She is the instrument which</p>
						<lg><l>“Brought Death into the world, and all our woe.”</l></lg>
						<p><persRef ref="lucanus-marcus">Lucan’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="cornelia">Cornelia</persRef> though respectable is
							employed in little else besides lamentation, and Voltaire’s Belle
							<persRef ref="duchatelet-emilie">Gabrielle</persRef> is not much better than his
								<persRef ref="sorel-agnes">Agnes Sorel</persRef>. But all that is
							tender, generous and amiable as well as brave is united in the heroines
							of Tasso. Their adventures comprehend the most pleasing parts of the
							whole poem, and indeed there is scarce any part of it, but in which some
							one or more of them appears.— The story of <persRef ref="edward2"
								>Edward</persRef> and <persRef ref="gildippe">Gildippe</persRef> is
							upon the model of <persRef ref="nisus">Nisus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="euryalus">Euryalus</persRef>, but is much more affecting, to a
							chaste Imagination. <persRef ref="armida">Armida</persRef>, is a
							composition of <persRef ref="calypso">Calypso of Circe</persRef> and of
								<persRef ref="dido">Dido</persRef>, and a great improvement upon
							them all. <persRef ref="erminia">Ermini</persRef>a has some traits in
							common with <persRef ref="helen">Helen</persRef>, but is much her
							superior, as is <persRef ref="clorinda">Clorinda</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="camilla">Camilla</persRef>.— <persRef ref="sophronia"
								>Sophronia</persRef> appears to be an original, and is a very
							pleasing one.— One of the great advantages which this Poem, has over
							those of antiquity, arises from the superior <hi rend="italic"
								>manners</hi>. There is a refinement of passion and a delicacy of
							sentiment, which can be attributed only to the operation of the precepts
							of Christianity upon the human character. The loving passions of
							antiquity were coarse; their hatred was implacable.— <persRef
								ref="achilles">Achilles</persRef> restored the body of <persRef
								ref="hector">Hector</persRef> to <persRef ref="priam"
								>Priam</persRef>; but that was from a motive of generosity when he
							felt no resentment. at all other times he was unrelenting. The Pious
								<persRef ref="aeneas">AEneas</persRef> is equally inflexible to the
							compunctious visitings of nature; but <persRef ref="tancred"
								>Tancred</persRef> and <persRef ref="rinaldo">Rinaldo</persRef> are
							both merciful and generous to their vanquished enemies.— Their love is
							gentle and their anger is humane. This is one of the benefits of
							Christianity the most clearly evident, as the revolution of manners is
							indubitable, and can be traced to no other source, while it naturally
							flows from that.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Hoole has omitted some of the concetti, from which
								<persRef ref="boileau-nicolas">Boileau</persRef> inferred that Tasso
							was all tinsel. There are too many of them in the original, but from
							such defects what modern Poet is altogether exempt.— I ought to have
							finished this book two days ago. As the weight of the task encreased, I
							felt my disposition to slip from under it grow upon me, and I have
							omitted the work of two days.</p>

							Evening walk, and retired about 11.— Pleasant as this course was to my

							shortening and the evening will soon be unfavourable for walking. It is
							already much less inviting to that effect, and I begin to prefer taking
							the necessary exercise before dark. I cannot therefore always avoid
							trespassing a little upon the Evening for study. The morning Muse of
							History, and the Evening Muse of Epic song, are now my only constant
							attendants: all the rest are abandoned or have only an occasional moment
							of attention.— The particular attention I am beginning to devote to
