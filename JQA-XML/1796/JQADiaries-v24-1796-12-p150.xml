						<p>With the commencement of the present year I began the practice of noting
							monthly the usual distribution of my employments and amusements through
							the course of the day. A practice which is not without its use for my
							own retrospection. The five first months of this year, spent in London
							were a period of leisure accidentally given me, and too much of which I
							allowed to the indulgence of indolence. The seven last months pass’d at
							the Hague have on the contrary been a time of as steady and constant
							application as ever occurred in the course of my life. I have
							endeavoured to contract the habit of early rising, and although since
							the commencement of the Winter, the severity and darkness of the Season
							have produced some relaxation in the execution of my determination, yet
							I have maintained it upon the whole with less flexibility than I
							apprehended I should. I have in a great measure repaired to my own
							satisfaction the loss of my time in the dissipation of London, and have
							now only to hope for resolution and health to continue the same degree
							of industry, with some variation in my objects of pursuit.— With my
							conduct also since my return from England I am more content than I was
							there, and in the course of seven months I can have nothing essential to
							regret. I have indeed happily nothing vicious to reproach myself with,
							during the whole year, though I remember with the regret which I hope
							will tend to my improvement many errors, and some follies. At least I
							have not knowingly injured any human being, and I can form no more
							fervent prayer to Heaven than that at the termination of every
							succeeding year which may be granted me, and at the end of life my own
							heart may yield me a testimony as pure and as favourable as it does at
							this moment.</p>
