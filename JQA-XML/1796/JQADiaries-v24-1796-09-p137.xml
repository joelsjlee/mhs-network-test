							encreases in my mind upon every perusal.— A criticism upon it would take
							too much time, and could have nothing original.— I mention therefore
							only two observations which occur to me upon censures expressed by
							eminent men without Justice.— <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope</persRef> after noticing the quibbles of the Angels and
							Archangels (an undoubted blemish to the Poem) adds that <persRef
								ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> makes “God the Father turn a
							school-divine.” This is epigrammatic, but if the Subject of the Poem,
							Paradise lost, and the object of the Poet, To justify the ways of God to
							Men, be considered, it appears to be an absolute necessity that the
							Justice of the Divine proceedings should be established upon the
							assertion of free election in Man. This could not be explained without
							metaphysical argument; without the nice distinctions which appear in the
							passages, that the sarcasm of Pope would condemn. <persRef
								ref="johnson-samuel">Doctor Johnson</persRef> among other objections
							to the conduct of the Poem, says that the <persRef ref="raphael">Angel
								Raphael</persRef> in his conversation with <persRef ref="adam"
								>Adam</persRef>, speaks in a comparison of “timid deer,” before deer
							could be timid. There is no such expression, or idea, as that of “timid
							deer,” through the whole course of the poem.</p>

							tempted to suspect it to be the composition of <persRef
