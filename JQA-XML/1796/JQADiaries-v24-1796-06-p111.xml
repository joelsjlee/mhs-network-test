							had a bill of £200 sterling on Hamburg (a second) and finding himself
							short of money to proceed on his voyage wanted to have twenty pounds
							sterling discounted upon his bill. He had a Passport from <persRef

							refused but let him have 240 florins upon my order on the bankers at

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> On my return from England I
							determined to resume a life of application to business and study, which
							during the principal part of my residence there I found altogether
							impossible. It has not yet settled into a course perfectly regular, but
							it is hitherto equal to my expectations. Rise and dress at six. Read
							works of <hi rend="italic">instruction</hi>,<hi rend="italic"> </hi>from
							thence till nine. Breakfast. read the papers and translate from the
							Dutch till eleven or twelve. Then dress for the day. Write letters or
							attend to other business that occurs till between two and three. Walk
							till half past three. Dine and sit till five. Read works of <hi
								rend="italic">amusement</hi> till between eight &amp; nine. Walk
							again about an hour. then take a very slight supper, and my segar, and
							retire to bed at eleven.— The variations from this course are not
							considerable. those that have taken place as yet are marked in the
							diary. I have as before mentioned now devoted an hour a day to the study
							of Italian, which <persRef ref="u">Bielfeld</persRef> and I are learning
							together.— Too much of this time is devoted to reading, and too little
							to Society. But I was not formed to shine in company, nor to be
							delighted with it; and I have now a considerable lapse of time to
							repair. While in London, by far too large a portion of my time was spent
							it.— I hope and intend at a future time to take some of my present
							reading hours, for the purpose of writing. I wish no other change.</p>
						<p>In my morning reading I have gone through <persRef ref="smith-adam"
								>Smith’s</persRef> Wealth of Nations, and commenced <persRef
								ref="luzac-elie">Luzac’s</persRef> Richesse de la Hollande. I have
							never had the advantage of systematic reading in its perfection, because
							I was never taught a system. To form one for myself has been the subject
							of my frequent meditations, but I have never satisfied myself as to the
							detail. My studies are indeed all directed to one point, which is
							pointed out to me by the station that I hold. The ultimate object of all
							reading must be the improvement of the mind— But how to compass the
							greatest quantum of improvement, in a given portion of time and study is
							a problem, that I have not yet solved, and of which I still seek the
							solution.— My afternoon reading has been, one hour of epic verse in
							English, which has carried me through <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope’s</persRef> Homer &amp; <persRef ref="dryden-john"
								>Dryden’s</persRef> Eneid. I have now begun upon that of <persRef
								ref="pitt-christopher">Pitt</persRef>.— The Memoires Secrets at
							Critiques des Cours d’ltalie of <persRef ref="gorani-guiseppe"
								>Gorani</persRef>, I read in consequence of their reputation, and
							because I wanted information relative to the present state of that
							Country. They have accordingly furnished me with new materials for
							knowledge, but the book is superficial, and dull; full of common place
							political folly and personal scandal. Such books cost only the trouble
							of writing them. The author thinks himself a profound legislator, while
							he is only a coxcomb and a pedant. The life of <persRef
								ref="dumouriez-charles">Dumouriez</persRef>, is of quite a different
							description. The book is as entertaining as the principles of the author
							are depraved.— I mean to speak of him again.</p>
