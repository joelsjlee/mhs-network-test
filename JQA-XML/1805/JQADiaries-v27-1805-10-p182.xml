						<p><date>6. </date>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Whitney</persRef>, who preached the
							whole day from one text. Prov: XXIV.l0.—“If thou faint in the day of
							Adversity, thy strength is small.” It was an occasional sermon of
							comfort to several of his parishioners, who have recently been bereft of
							children; by a distemper which prevails much at this Season— He drew
							from his text and the occasion the usual and obvious topics of
							consolation. I gave an hour to Aristotle, in the afternoon— Read
								<persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef> Sermons XXIII. on
							the Parable of the rich Man and <persRef ref="lazarus"
							>Lazarus</persRef>; a charity Sermon, XXIV. on Pride and XXV. On
							Humility. The course of Argument in these two is the same— The
							dissuasive from the vice, and the exhortation to the Virtue naturally go
							together; and they are both very good Sermons. It has been objected
							against the Christian Religion that it carries its doctrine of Humility
							to excess; but Pride is so universal and so inexpugnible, as well as so
							mischievous a Passion, that it cannot be encountered by too strong an
							opponent— The marks of hasty composition appear in these discourses as
							in most of the former— Sterne’s greatest defect of Style is the length,
							and complication of his Sentences— He begins to express a thought, and
							before he has got half through, it suggests some collateral idea, which
							he instantly takes in; that leads to another, and so on ad infinitum— At
							least so it would be; but that the necessity of finishing somewhere,
							brings him to at last; and after a page of rambling, when he comes to
							conclude his period, he often is very awkward at connecting the end,
							with the point of departure.— Style, says <persRef ref="gibbon-edward"
								>Gibbon</persRef> is an image of Character— And so it is with
							Sterne— It is all Genius and Eccentricity.— In the Evening I read
								<persRef ref="flechier-esprit">Fléchier’s</persRef> funeral Oration
							on the <persRef ref="mariatheresa2">Queen of France</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="louis-xiv">Louis XIV.’s</persRef> wife.— Last Sunday I had read
							that of the first President <persRef ref="lamoignon-guillaume"
								>Lamoignon</persRef>.— The style is the same, as in the former
							discourses upon like Occasions— Except that in the last there is a
							quaintness of thought in some instances, which seems the result of an
							embarrassment to say much where there was little to say— Fléchier
							praises the King, more than the Queen— Praises him too for things not
							very praise-worthy— His Persecution of the Protestants, and his <hi
								rend="italic">Necessary Wars</hi>. Yet Fléchier was a good Man—full
							of humanity. And incapable of courtly flattery.— He was blinded by his
							religion, into one part of this applause, and dazzled by the Splendour
							of Lewis’s victories into the other—</p>
