							and a Chapter of <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef>.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Whitney’s Sermon was from 1. Timothy
							IV.8— His divisions— Godliness is profitable 1. in the pursuits of this

							Remarks on the promise contained in the text— This division appears to
							me defective in point of Unity. The third head not being congruous to
							the first and second.— He preached all day on one text taking up the
							first head, in the morning, and the others after dinner. He had a long
							quotation from an author in a style too different from his own. His
							delivery is not absolutely bad; but he has the singing tone, and is very
							monotonous.— Little Management of accent; none of emphasis— He begins
							his sentences at a low note, uniformly the same; then gradually rises a
							note or two upon every emphatic word, untill at the close he drops plum
							to a note somewhat lower than that with which he commences— He reads the
							Bible, and the Psalms to be sung, in the same manner— His pronunciation
							of words is generally good.</p>

							the rich young Man, who lacked the one thing needful— They were both
							discourses of the historical kind, a miscellaneous collection of remarks
							drawn from the stories, told in those passages— Of course without much
							method— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ely is a young Man, of copious
							Imagination, and ardent zeal— What he principally wants is polish. His
							manner partakes of the same good qualities and defects— He speaks with
							great earnestness, and without the reading whine— But his voice wants
							flexibility, and correctness— His pronunciation has the ordinary fault
							of frequently slurring over certain vowels; and one peculiar to himself;
							of misplacing often the accent on long words, as propitiat<hi
								rend="italic">ó</hi>ry, subl<hi rend="italic">ú</hi>nary, &amp;c.—
							Time and Industry will make him a very good preacher— I read <persRef
								ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef> Sermons 11. On

								<persRef ref="joseph3">Joseph</persRef> and his brethren; and 13.
							Moderation of our Desires—in the case of <persRef ref="elisha"
								>Elisha</persRef> and the Shunamite.— They contain little or none of
							the author’s pathetic powers; but they are full of just and ingenious
							observations upon human life and manners— The style is careless— The
							sentences often in so many members, so intricate, and <hi rend="italic"
								>cumulative</hi> of thought, that they are often perplexed, and
							sometimes not grammatical; the close of the period running wide from the
							beginning.— I also read the second, and part of the third of <persRef

							sufficient connection with the text— Job’s expostulation is chiefly
							remarkable, as containing the various explanations attempted of the
							strange passage, “Curse God and Die”— The Character of Shimei, is
							satyrical: and might as well have been called the character of Abishai—
							It is the time-serving, treacherous sycophant— But the latter part of
							the Sermon, flies from the subject, and sinks almost into insipidity— It
							bears numerous marks of hasty and careless composition</p>

							Ourselves.—and in the afternoon 1. The love of God to the world 2. The

							ingenious, and less easy than the other— Both are sufficiently
							methodical. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pearce speaks very well, and
							excepting that he occasionally slurs a vowell pronounces well
								too—figu<hi rend="italic">r</hi>tively, was the word where the
							omission of a letter was most remarkable— He falls occasionally into a
							tone, but generally avoids it.— Read <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef> Sermons. XVII. The Case of
							<persRef ref="hezekiah">Hezekiah</persRef> and the Messengers, or against Ostentation— XVIII. The Levite

							to <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>—or against <pb n="180" type="ms"/>Avarice— Sterne’s usual mode
							of sermonizing, is to work up some historical incident in the Bible,
							into a little novel—and to intersperse characters, general maxims of
							morality, and pathetic touches, through the discourse as occasion
							offers. He is very fond of personifying the Passions, and often
							introduces supposed soliloquies or dialogues; with occasional strokes of
							humour and of Satire— The whole compound forms a singular species of
							Sermon— Never very profound; but very animated, and generally full of
							good morality— There is however too much sameness both of manner and of
							doctrine in them, and the morals are sometimes too lax, as particularly
							in the Story of the Levite and his Concubine— Yes, there are crimes of
							deeper die than female frailty, but the pulpit is not a place to
							apologize even for that— The moral of this Sermon, is exactly that of
							<persRef ref="kotzbue-august">Kotzebue’s</persRef> Misanthropy and Repentance; but what will do for the Stage,
							is not always suitable for the temple— I read this afternoon also

							of Aristotle— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner, and <persRef ref="shaw-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Shaw</persRef>, who came with him, returned to
							Boston this Evening— We had had another dry Storm these <hi
								rend="strikethrough">Evening</hi> two days— I came home early this
							Evening, read alone.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Whitney’s Sermon
							was from 1. Corinthians X.32. “Give none Offence.”— His divisions were
							1. The restrictions under which this precept must be received; or the
							cases when we ought to give Offence; and 2. The cases to which the
							injunction does extend.— The discourse was altogether moral, in the
							usual strain of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Whitney’s Sermons. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner’s text was. Philippians III.1.
							“Finally, my brethren, <hi rend="italic">rejoice</hi> in the Lord.”—
							Upon this theme, the Sermon, was an ingenious, satyrical dissertation
							upon religious <hi rend="italic">Melancholy</hi>; with particular
							application to field-preachers, and camp meetings— Some of which within
							these few months have been held and numerously attended, in the
							neighbourhood of Boston.— But religious <hi rend="italic"
								>melancholy</hi>, and field-preaching, or attendance upon it are
							very distinct things. The former may deserve a very <hi rend="italic"
								>serious</hi> treatment, while humour and severity may be justly be
							used against the latter— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner treated
							both parts of the subject superficially— In tracing religious
							melancholy, the only cause of it which occurred to him was <hi
								rend="italic">bodily indisposition</hi>; and accordingly he
							recommended to the sufferer, a physician— Now there are other Causes of
							this distemper, much more within the preacher’s department, which he
							might have noticed— So in censuring camp-meetings and field-preachers,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner did not enter into any
							consideration of their mischievous tendencies, and effects; he only
							viewed them as the schools of religious melancholy; kept by “fanaticism,
							which (said he) is religion run mad; or superstition, which is religion
							frightened out of her wits”— His arguments to prove that no man at this
							day can be guilty of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, or the deadly Sin;
							or the unpardonable Sin, were plain and obvious enough, and his
							explanation of the texts where this offence is mentioned I suppose just—
							He appeared somewhat embarrassed with an Article of the Church of
							England, which asserts <hi rend="italic">Predestination</hi>, nor did
							his quotation from the <persRef ref="sanderson-robert">Bishop of Lincoln</persRef> help him out of the difficulty—
							This prelates idea is that predestination, in the 39 Articles means
							nothing but <hi rend="italic">fore-knowledge</hi>.— It is better to be
							silent on this topic, than to attempt such escapes from its difficulty—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner’s manner is good. He reads
							and Speaks well—that is according to the rules of <persRef ref="sheridan-thomas2">Sheriden</persRef> and <persRef ref="walker-john2">Walker</persRef>—
							His accent, emphasis, pause, and modulation, are all correct; but he
							wants flexibility of voice— He also wants a certain sensibility of
							manner, which gives animation to a speaker— His pronunciation has none
							of the ordinary faults of this climate; he was bred in England, and is
							studious of the English utterance— But he has considerable faults
							peculiar to himself, the most remarkable is sounding wrong the <hi
								rend="italic">r</hi>, after a consonant—for he says g<hi
								rend="italic">o</hi>reat—g<hi rend="italic">o</hi>racious—t<hi
								rend="italic">o</hi>rumpet—and in other instances, sinks a vowel
							preceding the r, where it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, as suff<hi
								rend="italic">r</hi>ing—for suffering, &amp;c.— I began this morning
							the first Epistle to the Corinthians in the Greek Testament.—and read
							Sterne’s Sermons XX. The Story of the Prodigal Son— XXI.— National
							Mercies considered— An Occasional Sermon, upon the King’s Inauguration;
							and XXII. On the unfortunate life of the Patriarch <persRef ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef>.— I noticed
							last Sunday the general characters of <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef> manner— His introduction
							to the 19<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Sermon gives the <hi
								rend="italic">principle</hi>, upon which he thus writes— That Sermon
							is one of his best— It has some of his finest touches of pathetic— Some
							of his most pleasant strokes of humour— Many of his most ingenious
							deductions of generalities, and an adaptation of antient Scenery to
							modern Manners, which is striking, and very agreeable— And yet the whole
							ends in satyrical remarks on the practice of sending young men to
							Travel, for their Education— Many of Sterne’s Sermons rise in a blaze,
							and fall extinct like a sky-rocket. He spends all his brilliancy, before
							he has got half through his work, and ends with a pitiful conclusion.
							The inaugural Sermon is of a cast somewhat different, but has nothing
							very remarkable. The Story of Jacob, has no single moral; but raises a
							variety of good doctrines, from the various incidents of his life. The
								<hi rend="italic">subject</hi>, is the shortness and misery of life—
							But Sterne’s lesson is “to enjoy is to obey.”—</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> Rise about 6. The Racines
							Grecques, and the Greek Testament still employ me till 9 or 10 O’Clock,
							when we generally breakfast— I then employ half an hour in hearing
							<persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef> learn to read in French. Pass the remainder of the forenoon, when
							not interrupted, in writing this Journal; keeping my daily accounts, and
							sketches for future lectures. at 1. we dine. I rest or work in my garden
							an hour— Walk down to <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>— There read and Analyze a Chapter of
							<persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle’s</persRef> Rhetoric— Pass an hour with the family at my father’s—
							Return home for the Evening, and read an hour or two, to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="pope-eliza">Sister</persRef>— Between 10 and 11. after a very light supper, we retire to bed—
							After having gone completely through the first part of the Racines
							Grecques, learning by heart 3. Stanzas every day—I found that my memory
							scarcely ever retained more than the lesson of the day; and I had no
							more command over any previous lessons than if I had never bestowed half
							an hour upon the Book. This proved to me the necessity of going through
							it again— My former labour however facilitates my present toil; and I
							now learn five Stanza’s every day— I have thus gone through 85 Stanzas
							the second time— I also now use an additional exercise, and make a
							practise of repeating over the lessons of four or five successive days,
							at once— As for instance the whole letter Α.—then Β. Γ. Δ—then Ε. Ζ. Η.
							Θ.— So that I shall divide the whole into about eight lessons. Yet is
							the memory so much like the buckets of the Danaïds, that I still find my
							learning run out almost as fast as I pour it in— And I shall be obliged
							to go through this Book a third Time, to attain any thing like a ready
							command over its contents— The days have already become so short, that
							one Chapter of Aristotle occupies the whole time I can find in the
							afternoon— And I have now but one Month left, before I must take my
							departure for Washington; and abandon for the winter the studies, which
							have so agreeably occupied me since the beginning of July— My knowledge
							of Greek is yet imperceptible. From my own dulness I learn to excuse
							that of my Son George, whose progress in French is as slow, as my own in
							Greek.</p>
