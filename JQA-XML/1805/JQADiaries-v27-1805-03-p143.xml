                                Bayard’s</persRef> Resolution was this morning taken up, and debated
                            untill after the hour, at which the Court had determined to pass
                            sentence.— It was finally adopted against the importunate and violent
                            opposition of <persRef ref="wright-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r:</hi> Wright</persRef>, who struggled to the last instant for
                            the form adopted in the case of <persRef ref="pickering-john2">Judge
                                Pickering</persRef>; varying only the Answer of the Senators, which
                            he was willing should be Guilty or not Guilty instead of aye or no—
                                <persRef ref="giles-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                                Giles</persRef> made a speech entering largely into the question as
                            to the extent of the powers of Impeachment, and repeating the arguments
                            he had <pb n="144" type="ms"/>used at the early part of the Session on
                            this subject— He still insisted that the House might <hi rend="italic"
                                >Impeach</hi>, and the Senate <hi rend="italic">convict</hi> not
                            only for other than indictable Offences, but for other causes than high
                            crimes and misdemeanors: but however that might be, as in the present
                            case the charges were avowedly for high crimes and misdemeanors, he was
                            willing to take the question in the manner proposed by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard’s Resolution; protesting however
                            against its establishment as a precedent for any future occasion— After
                            the Resolution had pass’d, <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi
                                    rend="superscript">l:</hi> Smith</persRef> of Maryland insisted
                            that the question on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi> and fourth
                            Articles should be taken in the singular number, as on all the others,
                            observing that although there were several specifications, they were
                            adduced in support only of one charge— And it was agreed that the
                            question should be the same on each of the Articles— At half past 12
                            O’Clock the Court met— The Hall was crowded with Spectators— <persRef
                                ref="burr-aaron">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Burr</persRef>
                            ordered the civil Officers in the upper Galleries to turn their faces
                            towards the Spectator, and to seize and commit to prison the first
                            person who should make the smallest noise or disturbance— He then
                            directed the <persRef ref="otis-samuel">Secretary</persRef> to read the
                            first Article of Impeachment, which being done he called upon each
                            Senator by name and put the question as agreed upon—the same course was
                            pursued with all the succeeding Articles. The Answers were as
                            follows.</p>

                            Articles of Impeachment brought against him by the House of
                            Representatives— The Court then immediately adjourned, and thus
                            terminated this great and important trial.— The Senate returned to their
                            Legislative Apartment, and after half an hour of relaxation resumed
                            business; and sat untill 7 in the Evening. Various Bills were read— The
                            North-Carolina Law, relative to foreign Seamen at Wilmington, and the
                            Bill assenting to it were read the third time— On the question for its
                            final passage, I again renewed and enforced the objections I had urged
                            against it, at every stage— It was rejected; only 5 members voting in
                            its favour. As I was coming home I overtook M<hi rend="superscript"

                            by the misrecital of the Virginia-Law, referred to, in the 5<hi

                            said must have been intentional— He told me he had always been very
                            sorry that this Impeachment was brought forward, and though when
                            compelled to vote his judgment had been as unfavourable to M<hi

                            would have a tendency to mitigate the irritation of party-Spirit— He
                            said M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Randolph had boasted with great

                            the facts were so; it was not a very glorious feat, for a young man to

                            of his Country, might be excusable, but was no subject to boast of— On

                            postponed, and made the order of the day for the first Monday in

                            finishing all their Legislative business, sat from 10 this morning,
                            untill 7 in the Evening, with the interval of an hour from 3 to 4.— They
                            pass’d a great number of Acts; postponed many others, and confirmed the
                            nominations of <persRef ref="smith-robert">Robert Smith</persRef>, as
                            Attorney General, and <persRef ref="crowninshield-jacob3">Jacob
                                Crowninshield</persRef>, as Secretary of the Navy— At about 1.
                            o’clock this day, <persRef ref="burr-aaron">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r:</hi> Burr</persRef> the Vice-President, after clearing the
                            Galleries, stated, that it had been his intention to go through his
                            Constitutional career without leaving the chair; but as he felt an
                            indisposition coming upon him, he had concluded now to take leave of the
                            Senate. He then in an address, of about twenty minutes recapitulated the
                            principles by which his conduct in the chair had been governed during
                            the whole period of his presidency. He mentioned one or two of the
                            Rules, which appeared to him to need a revisal; and recommended the
                            abolition of that respecting the <hi rend="italic">previous
                                question</hi>, which he said had in the four years been only once
                            taken, and that was upon an Amendment— This was a proof that it could
                            not be necessary, and all its purposes were certainly much better
                            answered by the question of indefinite postponement— In reflecting upon
                            the decisions he had been called to make, though he had doubtless
                            sometimes been mistaken, he could recollect no instance which he should
                            now feel justified in recalling. Gentlemen to whom at any time they had
                            particularly applied, would naturally have their feelings excited at the
                            moment, but he had no doubt they would on deliberate consideration
                            acquit him of any intentional disrespect to them, and he was not
                            conscious of any one member to whom on this account he owed an Apology.—
                            He had made it a general rule not to give any reasons for his decisions
                            at the time when they were made, because in most questions of order that
                            arise in such an assembly it was still more essential that they should
                            be settled promptly, and without hesitation, than that they should
                            always be settled right— Yet he trusted that Gentlemen would not infer
                            that because there was no reason given, there was therefore none to
                            give—that they would readily perceive that an instantaneous was not
                            necessarily a precipitate act, and that what had been done without
                            delay, had not been done without reflection— It had been his invariable
                            and resolute purpose to preserve the dignity of the situation in which
                            he stood, and he took great satisfaction in the certainty that he should
                            transmit the <hi rend="italic">prerogatives</hi> of the chair,
                            unimpaired to his successor— “In saying this (he added) I must offer to
                            every member of the Senate my thanks for the firm and uniform support I
                            have experienced in the discharge of my functions, and to add that the
                            established propriety and decorum, which have always distinguished this
                            body beyond any other assembly I ever have known, have essentially
                            contributed to assist me in discharging this part of my duty— In taking
                            leave, of you, which may probably be a final one, I offer you
                            individually my acknowledgments for your uniform support—for your
                            candour, and forbearance under circumstances when my decisions may have
                            excited occasionally unpleasant feelings— And permit me to recommend to
                            you in your future deliberations, inflexibly to maintain and to cherish
                            these habits of order and regularity, which upon experience are found to
                            be intimately connected with important principles— On a superficial view
                            only they appear of inconsiderable consequence, but on full
                            investigation it will be discovered that there is scarce a departure
                            from order but leads to or is indissolubly connected with a departure
                            from <hi rend="italic">morality</hi>.— This body is growing in
                            importance— It is here if any where, that our Country must ultimately
                            find the anchor of her safety; and if the Constitution is to perish,
                            which may God avert, and which I do not believe, its dying agonies will
                            bee seen on this floor— I have now, Gentlemen, only to tender you my
                            best wishes for your personal welfare and happiness[”]— Immediately
                            after finishing this Speech, he left the chair, and the room— It was
                            delivered with great dignity and firmness of manner; but without any
                            apparent emotion of sensibility— It was listened to with the most
                            earnest and universal attention— Many of the members appeared deeply
                            affected, and two of them, <persRef ref="wright-robert">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright</persRef>, and <persRef

                                Anderson</persRef> was chosen again President pro Tem. And <persRef

                            moved a Resolution of thanks to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Burr,
                            for the impartiality, integrity and ability, with which he had presided

                            his conduct in that capacity— It pass’d unanimously, and M<hi

                            the Impeachment was this day taken up and pass’d unanimously, though
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard himself was absent having
                            left town this morning.— The invalid Bill which I introduced at an early
                            period of the Session, and which after being reduced down to a single
                            Section barely rubb’d through the Senate, came back this day from the
                            House with an Amendment striking out the whole Bill, and introducing one
                            entirely different— The Senate immediately disagreed to the Amendment.
                            The House insisted; and proposed a conference. <persRef
                                ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                                Bradley</persRef> moved immediately an <hi rend="italic"
                                >adherence</hi>, to the original bill; but I objected to this, as
                            not being sufficiently respectful to the House; whereupon he withdrew
                            his motion, and conferees were appointed.— The Bill for preservation of
                            Peace in the Ports and Harbours pass’d to the third reading— Several
                            motions were made to read it the third time but I objected, under the
                            Rule that a Bill shall not be read more than once in the same day,
                            unless by unanimous consent— I got home this Evening, at about 8
                            o’clock, and found the <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

                            Great part of the business of the Session having been protracted to this
                            time, by the trial of the impeachment— Several Bills were this day first
                            sent to the Senate by the House of Representatives; read three times and
                            pass’d— Others were stop’d and lost by the objections of single members,
                            to their having all their readings in one day. The Conferees of the two
                            Houses on the Invalid Bill, could not agree; whereupon the Senate <hi
                                rend="italic">adhered</hi>, to their original Bill, and the House
                            finally receded from their Amendments; so that the Bill pass’d as it
                            went from the Senate— The Bill providing for payment of the witnesses on
                            the Impeachment was not equally successful— The amendments made to it in
                            Senate were disagreed to by the House; insisted on by the Senate, who
                            asked a conference— The conferees of the Senate, were Mess<hi

                                ref="early-peter">Early</persRef>— They met and could come to no
                            agreement— Each House adhered to its own purpose, and of course the Bill
                            was lost— No provision therefore is made, for the payment of any of the
                            witnesses, summoned on either side— After the loss of the Bill, an
                            attempt was made in the House of Representatives, to pay the witnesses
                                <hi rend="italic">summoned on their part</hi>, by Resolution of that
                            House alone, and by charging it on their <hi rend="italic">contingent
                                expences</hi>— The only circumstance which defeated this Resolution,
                            was, that whenever it was taken up, so many of the members immediately
                            left their seats that a Quorum could not be made to pass it without
                            them— The Bill for the Preservation of Peace in the Ports and Harbours,
                            was finally pass’d in Senate this day— I first moved its postponement
                            untill the next Session; but withdrew the motion on finding it opposed
                            from all quarters— I then moved various amendments only one of which was
                            adopted— There was, as usual on the last day of a Session, an extreme
                            reluctance to hearing any debate, and a determination to pass this Bill—
                            The final question was taken by yeas and nays—3 to 25. and my name among
                            the former— At about 1 O’Clock, <persRef ref="moore-andrew">M<hi

                            day— It was granted him.— A member of the Committee was to be chosen in
                            his stead— On taking the ballots there were 6 votes for <persRef

                            said I was chosen; which I contested— The <persRef ref="anderson-joseph"
                                >President</persRef> said that by our Rules, when two members had an
                            equal and the highest number upon a ballot, the person first in
                            alphabetical order was considered as chosen— I replied that upon looking
                            over the Rules, I could find none to that point— The President corrected
                            himself, and said that instead of Rule, he should have said universal
                            practice— He said however, the Senate could excuse me from this Service,
                            which was not an agreeable one, if I desired it; he knew I had already
                            once performed it; and it was not usual to require of any one member
                            that he should twice be burthened with it— I therefore requested to be,

                            undertook it— My motive for declining was not the labour, but because I
                            thought the object of those who voted for me was to make my absence from
                            Senate absolutely necessary to discharge the duty, and thus to get rid
                            of a troublesome member— In this project I did not wish to gratify
                            them.— At half past 3 o’clock the Senate <pb n="148" type="ms"
                            />adjourned untill 5. and I went over to <persRef ref="stelle-pontius"

                                Chase’s</persRef> trial— At 5 O’Clock Senate met again— Among the
                            new Bills sent from the House this day, two were stopp’d by single
                            members— <persRef ref="stone-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                                Stone</persRef> stopp’d a Bill for erecting a Light-House on
                            Watch-Hill Point, Rhode-Island— And M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                            Maclay stopp’d a Bill to continue and amend the Law prescribing the mode
                            of taking Evidence in cases of contested elections— But after thus
                            arresting this Bill, <persRef ref="maclay-samuel">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r:</hi> Maclay</persRef> moved that it should
                            be postponed untill next Session; on the ground of objections to the
                            Merits of the Bill— I objected to this as giving a colour to our
                            proceedings different from the reality— A postponement to the next
                            Session would appear to be the Act of the whole Senate; and might be
                            taken unkindly by the House, as the Bill related to a subject,
                            peculiarly and in some sort exclusively concerning them— When in truth
                            the Bill was defeated by the objection of a single member— Some high
                            words pass’d between <persRef ref="jackson-james2">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jackson</persRef> and M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Maclay, who finally withdrew his motion
                            for postponement. A Resolution was pass’d giving a gratuity to the
                            Officers of the Senate, for extraordinary Services, this Session,
                            chargeable on the contingent fund— Also a Resolution to defray the
                            expences incurred by order of the <persRef ref="burr-aaron">V.
                                President</persRef>, for arrangements in the Hall, and other charges
                            on the impeachment.— It was stated by the President, that although by
                            the Rules, a Bill cannot be twice read on the same day; without
                            unanimous consent, yet after it has been stop’d by the objection of a
                            member, it may again be called up to be read; and that this call may be
                            repeated as often as any member pleases, in the course of the day.— When
                            the business was finished, I moved the usual order for a Committee with
                            such as the House should join, to notify the <persRef
                                ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef> that we were ready to
                            adjourn— On this Committee I was appointed, with <persRef
                                ref="smith-samuel2">General Smith</persRef> of Maryland— We called
                            at the House for their Committee, who were Mess<hi rend="superscript"
                                >rs:</hi> J. Randolph, <persRef ref="nelson-roger">Nelson</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="huger-benjamin2">Huger</persRef>— We accordingly went
                            to the President who was in one of the Committee-Rooms; and I gave him
                            the information, as we were directed— He desired us to inform the two
                            Houses that he had no further communications to make to them; whereupon
                            we returned; and the Senate was, at half past 9 in the Evening adjourned
                            without day. It was almost 11. at Night when I got home.— Thus has
                            terminated the second Session of the Eighth Congress; the most
                            remarkable transaction of which has been the trial of the Impeachment
                            against <persRef ref="chase-samuel">Samuel Chase</persRef>— This is a
                            subject fruitful of reflections, but their place is not here— I shall
                            only remark that this was a party prosecution, and has issued in the
                            unexpected and total disappointment of those by whom it was brought
                            forward— It has exhibited the Senate of the United States, fulfilling
                            the most important purpose of its institution, by putting a check upon
                            the impetuous violence of the House of Representatives. It has proved
                            that a sense of Justice is yet strong enough to overpower the furies of
                            faction; but it has at the same time shewn the wisdom and necessity of
                            that provision in the Constitution which requires the concurrence of two
                            thirds for conviction upon Impeachments— The attack upon M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chase, was a systematic attempt upon the
                            independence, and powers of the Judicial Department, and at the same
                            time an attempt to prostrate the authority of the National Government,
                            before those of the individual States— The principles first started in
                            the case of <persRef ref="pickering-john2">John Pickering</persRef> at
                            the last Session, have on the present occasion been widened, and
                            improved upon to an extent, for which the Spirit of party itself was not
                            prepared— Hence, besides the federal members, six, out of the
                            twenty-five, devoted to the present administration voted for the
                            acquittal of Judge Chase on all the charges, and have for a time
                            arrested the career of political frenzy.— The Resolutions for amending
                            the Constitution, brought forward by two of the Managers, of the
                            Impeachment, immediately after the decision, and the proceedings of the
                            House upon them, are ample indications that this struggle will be
                            renewed, with redoubled vehemence at the next Session of Congress— How
                            far the firmness of the Senate, or of individual Senators will support
                            the promise of this time, I presume not to conjecture— Untill the final
                            question was taken, I confess I had no reliance upon that firmness now,
                            because I had seen it yield the last Session to a breech of principle to
                            my mind as great, as it would have been at this time— They certainly
                            have shewn now a degree of perseverance and of spirit in their
                            resistance, which then failed them— Their conduct now has partly
                            redeemed their characters in my opinion; yet the extent of their
                            compliance before, has proved beyond redemption that they are made of
                            materials which will break— The prophetic and solemn words of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Burr, that the dying agonies of the
                            Constitution, will be witness’d on the floor of the Senate, were uttered
                            with <pb n="149" type="ms"/>a pointed allusion to what had just pass’d,
                            and they lead to an anxious consideration of the temper of metal, to be
                            found in the body as now composed— The essential characters which <hi
                                rend="italic">ought</hi> to belong to the Senate are <hi
                                rend="italic">coolness</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">firmness</hi>. I
                            hope that when the occasion shall call they will be found to possess
                            them; and it would be doing injustice to the body, and its members not
                            to acknowledge that in this memorable instance these qualities have been
                            eminently displayed. It has however furnished several instances of weak
                            compliance, as well as of honourable resistance, and I have some reason
                            to believe that more than one member voted for the conviction of the
                            Judge, who at the same time disapproved altogether of the prosecution—
                            On the subject of the Bill for paying the witnesses, M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Anderson this day told me, that it would
                            have given him pain more than he could express, if a single member of
                            the Senate had been found, who would have yielded, upon the point in
                            dispute.—for if the principle were once established, that an Officer <hi
                                rend="italic">acquitted</hi> on Impeachment should be burthened with
                            the payment of the witnesses essential to his justification, while the
                            Nation was to pay all the witnesses produced against him, not an Officer
                            in the Union would be safe, and there would be no bounds to the
                            persecutions of the other House. I observed to him in a jocular manner,
                            alluding to the two resolutions for altering the Constitution introduced
                            by two of the late Managers, that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Burr
                            appeared to have been mistaken, as the agonies of the Constitution were
                            happening on that floor, and not upon ours— Upon which he answered me
                            with great earnestness—No Sir—the sense in which he said that was, that
                            the struggle <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, would be to <hi rend="italic"
                                >preserve</hi> the Constitution; and <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,
                            it would be to <hi rend="italic">destroy</hi> it.— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles too upon this Article, has been
                            firm, and correct— He seems indeed to consider himself as personally
                            implicated in the question—for the form of the subpoena to witnesses was
                            adopted on the Report of a Committee of which he was chairman, and it
                            makes no discrimination between those summoned by the Managers, or by
                            the Respondent— Hence the obvious propriety of treating them all alike.
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles this day told me that the
                            ardour of his feelings upon political subjects had very much abated—
                            That there was not a man in the Union against whom he harboured any
                            resentment or aversion, and that he had accepted his seat in Senate,
                            only because he knew that if he had not come, a person of violent
                            principles would have been sent, who probably would have done mischief—
                            But he did not tell me who this was.</p>

                            in which he contrasted the appearance of this part of the Country, with
                            that of New-England and New-York, much to the advantage of the latter— I

                                Dennie</persRef> called upon me this morning— On application at the
                            Mail-Stage Office, I found the Mail would go just at noon— It travels
                            all Night, and I was therefore determined not to take passage in it— But
                            I was told that by going as far as Brunswick (58 miles) which it would
                            reach by 9 O’Clock in the Evening, I could stop there for the Night, and
                            take seats in the morning in the Industry Stage, which left
                            Philadelphia, at 8 this morning, and which does not travel in the
                            Night.— I likewise found that unless we took passage this day, we should
                            be obliged to wait untill Monday; as all the Stages which leave the City
                            on Saturday’s, are compell’d to travel all Night; being prohibited
                            travelling through the State of New-Jersey on Sunday, after the morning—

                            were out.— We travell’d very slowly the two first Stages—dined at
                            Bristol; but did not reach Brunswick untill after midnight, instead of 9
                            in the Evening— Here I found some difficulty to obtain the seats in the
                            Industry Stage, which had been engaged to me at Philadelphia, and for
                            which they had given me a ticket— On producing this ticket however my
                            right to the Seats was acknowledged. We lodg’d at a house in Brunswick
                            where I had never been before, and a very indifferent one.</p>

                            Woodbridge, and reached Paulus Hoek between 1 and 2 O’Clock afternoon—
                            The weather was so bad, that <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
