								ref="widowofzarephath">widow of Zarephath</persRef>, 6. On the

							to himself.— Also in the Introduction to the Origines Grecques— And
								<persRef ref="valckenaer-lodewijk">Valckenaer’s</persRef>
							Manuscript.— A recent occasion has made it necessary for me to give a
							redoubled attention to the subject of public speaking, both the theory
							and the practice— I therefore observed particularly M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Flint’s discourse, and propose to do the
							same in future, at all the public discourses I shall hear— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Flint’s Sermon was on one text the whole
							day. Ecclesiastes 8.11.— He treated the subject ingeniously and
							methodically. His divisions naturally arose from his text, and his
							arguments were clear and forcible— His language, both in sermon, and in
							prayer was not merely correct, but elegant— He attempted nothing but to
								<hi rend="italic">reason</hi>. His tone was wholly that of
							moderation, and his choice of hymns for singing, discovered judgment,
							and taste. With a good delivery he would pass for an uncommon preacher—
							Yet there is scarcely any man who appears in <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Whitney’s</persRef> pulpit less popular. His defect is mere <hi
								rend="italic">monotony</hi>, from two causes— 1. The want of proper
							inflexions in the voice, and 2. a pronunciation giving to almost every
							syllable the same <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of time— He must have
							formed this habit, by too much anxiety to speak <hi rend="italic"
								>distinctly</hi>.— But it gives such a slow, drowsy a movement to
							his utterance, that it has all the appearance of excessive indolence,
							and is wearisome to every hearer— The faulty inflexions are common to
							almost all our Preachers; and all readers of written discourses are apt
							to fall into them— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Flint has also in
							some degree the faults of the New-England pronunciation, consisting
							chiefly in giving to the vowels <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi
								rend="italic">o</hi> occasionally Sounds which do not belong to them
							as benev<hi rend="italic">e</hi>lence, philos<hi rend="italic"
								>e</hi>phy.—goodn<hi rend="italic">o</hi>ss p<hi rend="italic"
								>o</hi>rmitted, and the like— Sounding the <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
							as <hi rend="italic">oo</hi>, is a practice, which I apprehend will not
							soon be remedied, because my countrymen adhere to it upon principle.</p>

							second degrees, were succeeded by the ceremony of conferring them— The
							whole was finished at about 3. O’Clock— I dined at <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Quincy</persRef> brought home Eliza— My brother
							does not return untill to-morrow.</p>
						<p>The performances of this day, were both in point of composition, and of
							delivery, much better than I expected. Taken altogether they were a very
							handsome specimen of public declamation— The young men all spoke
							audibly; many of them with gracefulness— Their language was in general
							correct; ornamented with the figures of which youth is peculiarly
							ambitious, and diversified, partly by the tone of serious declamation,
							and partly by attempts at humour; not always unsuccessful. The
							particulars in which it was susceptible <pb n="175" type="ms"/>of
							improvement, appeared to me to be these.— 1. The subjects assigned to
							the candidates as themes of discourse, are not sufficiently diversified—
							There are two modes of declamation, which were altogether omitted, and
							which might be added to these exercises, with advantage— <hi
								rend="italic">Panegyric</hi>; or an Eulogium upon some character
							distinguished in Ancient or Modern History. And <hi rend="italic"
								>Declamations</hi> such as those of the Antients, on some assumed
							state of facts— <hi rend="italic">Critical parallels</hi>, between
							celebrated writers, are a third sort of subjects which might be
							introduced, and doubtless many others might be suggested. 2. The
							performers, did not sufficiently adhere to their subjects— This is a
							fault very general on such occasions; and proceeds from the comparative
							neglect of logical studies at the University.— There was a conference on
							the efficacy of Statuary, Painting, and History, in transmitting events
							to Posterity.— History was here put into strange company; to be degraded
							to such a level of competition— But scarcely a word was said about
							transmitting <hi rend="italic">events</hi>— Each of the three conferees,
							spoke an eulogium upon the art, entrusted to his protection, passing
							some reflections upon the two others.— Another conference on the
							changes, produced in the <hi rend="italic">State of Society</hi>, by the
							reigns of <persRef ref="constantine">Constantine</persRef>, <persRef ref="charlemagne">Charlemagne</persRef>, and <persRef ref="peter-the-great">Peter of Russia</persRef>, became a mere
							personal panegyric on those Sovereigns. This to be sure was much the
							easiest way of performing the task; but if the <hi rend="italic"
								>subject</hi> assigned was above the powers of the speakers, a theme
							more suited to their state of knowledge should have been given, with
							injunction to keep close to it— In the forensic disputes, one party
							never undertook to refute the arguments of the other, but the speakers
							made each a disconnected disquisition, the one <hi rend="italic"
								>pro</hi> the other <hi rend="italic">con</hi>— This may be one
							proper mode of discussion; but a true forensic ought to be a grapple of
							intellect between the speakers, a genuine image of real judicial
							litigation— There appeared to be no idea of method in the compositions
							of the speakers; and I certainly had no idea of methodical arrangement,
							untill long after I left College.— Of course they had no ingenious
							divisions of their subjects, and no artifice of construction in their
							discourse— As to the delivery— They spoke almost all of them too fast. A
							fault occasioned by the necessary limitation of their time, but which
							ought to be corrected— Many of them were very deficient in their memory,
							and required the prompter too frequently— I believe the exercises of
							Memory so much recommended by the antients is almost entirely neglected
							at this College.— Their pronunciation had the common errors of the soil—
							Confounding the sounds of the vowels—as f<hi rend="italic">o</hi>rm, for
								<hi rend="italic">firm</hi>. Sc<hi rend="italic">o</hi>rcely,
							&amp;c—and elision of vowels as <hi rend="italic">Nat’ral</hi>.— In the
							manner of speaking there was too much sameness— Some had the reading
							whine; and none had a just idea of accent, emphasis, or inflexion of the
							voice— The distinction of character between the Orators for the first
							and those for the second degree, was obvious as usual.</p>
