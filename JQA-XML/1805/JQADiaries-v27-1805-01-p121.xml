						<p><date>2. </date>This was the day appointed for the appearance of <persRef
								ref="chase-samuel">Judge Chase</persRef> to answer the Articles of
							Impeachment against him; at twelve O’Clock the Senate went from the
							Committee Room into their Hall, which has been prepared for the
							occasion. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chase was called and appeared.
							He requested and obtained the permission of a Seat; upon which he read a
							paper of some length, requesting time to prepare his answer, and for
							trial; untill the first day of the next Session— He was interrupted
							several times by the <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Vice-President</persRef>,
							but proceeded and read his paper through— The Vice-President, then
							required him to reduce his request to writing in the form of a motion,
							which he did— The Vice-President informed him, the Senate would meet
							again to-morrow; and the Senate, (without adjournment of the Court,[)]
							returned, to the Committee Room— A debate of four hours immediately
							ensued, on the next step to be taken. <persRef ref="giles-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles</persRef> was for fixing on a
							day for trial, without taking any notice of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Chase’s request.— He repeated over again his whole system
							of Impeachments—contended there was no occasion for any answer or
							pleading, other than simply of not guilty— That we ought to discard all
							precedents derived either from the English practice upon impeachments,
							or from the proceedings of our own Courts of Justice, and that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chase’s motion was no more than a request
							for another <hi rend="italic">appearance</hi> day.— This theory however
							has got much weakened since it is brought to the test— The Rules as
							reported by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, and adopted by the
							Senate, had departed from the form of proceeding in the case of <persRef
								ref="pickering-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pickering</persRef>; The Oath required by the Constitution was at
							that time taken, before any <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> made in the
							Cause— By M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles’s Rule it was to be
							taken, only when the trial between the parties should commence. But now
							that a decision was to be made, on which the whole Cause might depend,
							the question as to the Necessity of being under Oath, was again brought
							up; and after long debate, the decision was that the Oath should be
							taken to-morrow morning. The other points were left undecided— Adjourned
							after 4 o’clock— I found some difficulty in walking to and from the
							Senate, on account of the snow that fell yesterday— Found the family at
							dinner and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Marin</persRef> with them— In the Evening they went to a Ball at
								<persRef ref="peter-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> T.

						<p><date>3. </date>I attended sometime this morning, and examined some books
							previous to the meeting of Senate— When they met <persRef

								Bradley</persRef> made a motion to assign a day (in blank) to
							receive the Answer of <persRef ref="chase-samuel">M<hi

							moved to assign a day, to <hi rend="italic">receive the Answer and
								proceed to trial</hi>—after a debate of about two hours, on the
							respective merits of these questions, the Senate pass’d from the
							Committee-Room to their Hall— The Oath was administered to the <persRef
								ref="burr-aaron">President</persRef>, by the <persRef
								ref="otis-samuel">Secretary</persRef>, and to the members by the
							President— The questions were then taken by yeas and nays, on striking
							out M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley’s motion 20 yeas 10 nays; on
							inserting M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles’s 22 yeas 8 nays. Then
							on filling the blank— First Monday in December, negatived 12 yeas 18
							nays.— fourth day of February—22 yeas 8 nays— And then on the order thus
							completed 21 yeas 9 nays. So the 4<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> day of
							February is fixed, for receiving the answer, <hi rend="italic">and
								proceeding to trial</hi>— On this system the trial will be on the
							Articles alone, and no regard paid to the Answer, whatever it may be— As
							was done in England in the case of <persRef ref="wentworth-thomas">Lord
								Strafford</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles himself
								<pb n="122" type="ms"/>seems ashamed of the virulence with which he

							into the Hall, I heard him ask <persRef ref="smith-israel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Israel Smith</persRef> to make it
							there; saying he did not like to make it himself— Smith however
							declined, and Giles made it— On returning to the Committee-Room, the
							Senate only read a couple of bills from the house of Representatives and
							adjourned.— Dined with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my

								<persRef ref="giles-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Giles</persRef>, this morning, on the George-town Dam-bill. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Giles again referr’d to a compact between
							the States of Virginia and Maryland, about which there was much debate
							when this bill was considered in the House of Representatives— I stated
							my reasons for believing that this Article of the compact was null and
							void ab initio, as violating the Articles of Confederation; and if not
							so, yet absolutely annulled by the present Constitution of the United
							States—the Article of the Confederation to which I referred, neither of
							these Gentlemen, recollected— Nor was it mentioned during the whole
							debate in the House— I am afraid there is some solution to this
							objection of which I am not aware— It certainly took both my colleagues
							by surprize; so completely that they had no plausible answer to give it—
							I know that by not mentioning it at-all in Committee, but reserving it
							for the fire of debate on the Report, it would have been more decisive;
							but on full deliberation, I thought this mode of proceeding would not be
							fair— That in honourable dealing, I ought to give them the ground I mean
							to take, though it will give them an opportunity to be prepared for it,
							and even of taking undue advantages to refute it, if they can.— If Giles
							has or can find a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> reply to my objection
							against the compact he will use me as candidly as I have him, and
							mention it in Committee— If he can hunt up nothing but quibbles to
							support him, it is of no great consequence whether he opens the box of
							them in Committee or in the house— The Bill itself is of very little
							importance; but this <hi rend="italic">compact</hi>, has drawn some
							important Constitutional questions into the discussion— As the grounds
							upon which I hold its nullity, have been taken by no other person, and
							as they are in my opinion much stronger than any that were taken in the
							House, I am afraid that the pride of opinion, and a paltry Vanity
							mingles itself with my judgment on this occasion— I know how often this
							happens to me; and it often ends in mortification as is most just— The
							Committee are to meet again to-morrow. In Senate, various reports were
							made, and many bills at the second reading committed.— As our Committees
							are all chosen by <hi rend="strikethrough">Committee</hi> ballot, the
							influence and weight of a member, can be very well measured by the
							number and importance of those upon which he is placed— In this respect
							I have no excitements of Vanity— But as much of the labour of business
							is transacted in Committees, an exemption from those which are
							important, is also an exemption from toil; and leaves proportionable
							leisure— I reported the invalid-Bill without amendment. That is, both my
							associates in the Committee are against it on principle.— A Committee
							was raised on the Louisiana Memorial— Adjourned to Monday— Weather very
							cold; and the snow so drifted, I could scarcely walk.— We were invited
							in the Evening, on a party at <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison’s</persRef>, but sent an
							excuse— The <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">family</persRef>

							existed, was at 20 degrees below 0 in Paris— It was never for six weeks

							had included the bed of the river; but the compact, had made it common.—
							It is singular however if this be the case; that among the Vouchers

							and reported by the Committee were rejected: the Bill pass’d to the
							third reading. Upon the first amendment, respecting the pretended
							compact between Maryland and Virginia, I took a large part in the
							debate, and indeed an exclusive one on the side I advocated, as to the
							question of right— There were not more than seven members, (I think not
							more than six) who rose in favour of the Amendment— On this occasion as
							on almost every other, I felt most sensibly my deficiency as an
							extemporaneous speaker.— In tracing this deficiency to its source, I
							find it arising from a cause that is irreparable— No efforts, no
							application on my part can ever remove it. It is slowness of
							comprehension— An incapacity to grasp the whole compass of a subject, in
							the mind at once, with such an arrangement, as leaves a proper
							impression of the detail— An incapacity to form ideas properly precise
							and definite, with the rapidity necessary to give them uninterrupted
							utterance— My Manner therefore is slow, hesitating, and often much
							confused— Sometimes from inability to furnish the words to finish a
							thought commenced, I begin a sentence with propriety, and end it with
							nonsense— Sometimes after carrying through an idea of peculiar force to
							its last Stage, the want of the proper word at close, drives me to use
							one which throws the whole into a burlesque— And sometimes the most
							important details of argument, escape my mind at the moment when I want
							them, though ever ready to present themselves before and after. Hence I
							never know when I have finished any given subdivision of my subject. And
							hence in making the transition from one part of it to the other, I am
							often compelled to take a minute or two for recollection, which leaves a
							chasm of silence always disagreeable to the hearers— I must therefore
							never flatter myself with the hope of oratorical distinction— At the
							same time it is possible that by continual exertions, application, and
							self-censure part of the ill-effects of these infirmities may be
							remedied— One rule for this purpose will be to take part in the debate,
							only at its late Stages, and after the ground has been travell’d over by
							others— To take minutes of the strongest points assumed by the opponent;
							and to methodize them by very short Notes before commencing a reply.—
							Another is attentively to observe the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi>, of
							the best Speakers— To mark whether they are not occasionally struggling
							with some of the same difficulties which I so often experience; and how
							they get over them. A third is to take great pains to understand the
							subject upon which I speak— If these endeavours will never suffice to
							give me the palm of eloquence, they will at least make me better
							qualified to be useful in the Station where I am placed.— Senate sat
							untill near 4 o’clock— I pass’d the Evening in examining papers relative
							to the Cause of <persRef ref="graves-john">J. B. Graves</persRef> vs the

								ref="hazen-charlotte">Charlotte Hazen</persRef>, pass’d, according
							to the report of the last Committee; that is, giving her a pension of
							$200 a year for life. The history and progress of this Bill furnishes a
							striking example of the motives, and means by which legislative
							assemblies are governed— At the beginning of our Revolutionary War,
								<persRef ref="hazen-moses">General Hazen</persRef>, this Lady’s
							husband, was residing in Canada, and in half-pay as a lieutenant in the
							British service— Taking the American side of the question, he was on the
								22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of Jan<hi rend="superscript"
								>y:</hi> 1776. Appointed by Congress, Colonel of a Canadian Regiment
							to be raised in the service of the Union— And a Resolution pass’d the
							same day, that the United <hi rend="strikethrough">States</hi> Colonies
							would indemnify Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Hazen, for any loss of
							half-pay he might sustain in consequence of his entering into their
							service. In 1781. he was struck off from the British half-pay list: but
							though in his life-time he repeatedly presented his claim for indemnity,
							it was never settled, for want of proof on his part to establish the
							fact— In Feb<hi rend="superscript">y:</hi> 1803. he died— And since his
							Death, his Executors <persRef ref="white-moses">Moses White</persRef>
							and M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Hazen, have petitioned for this
							indemnity— Thus stands the open and ostensible demand— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Hazen, the widow, is here in person to
							pursue the claim— Moses White, the Co-Executor is not here— General
							Hazen’s Estate is so deeply indebted to Moses White that if the grant
							were made conformably to the claim it would be absorbed for the payment
							of that debt— M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Hazen sends for
							individual members of Congress, requesting them to call and see her at
							her lodgings. There, she represents herself as in great distress;
							dependent upon this grant alone for subsistence, and intreats that the
							grant may be to her, to the exclusion of her Co-Executor, and of all
							Creditors of her Husband— This manoeuvre partially succeeded in the
							House of Representatives; where the bill was founded on a formal
							admission of the Justice of the Claim; and yet directed that it should
							be paid exclusively to her use— When it came into the Senate, it was
							opposed on various grounds— The first select Committee reported a grant
							to her of a sum of money— About 2000 dollars. This was rejected—
								<persRef ref="moore-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Moore</persRef> of Virginia and <persRef ref="franklin-jesse">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Franklin</persRef> of North-Carolina,
							declared themselves of opinion that the claim was a just one; but that
							Congress could not interfere with the course of the Law, to divert the
							money from its proper destination. Being of the same opinion, I moved to
							substitute the words <hi rend="italic">legal Representatives</hi>,
							instead of Charlotte Hazen— After a long debate upon this, the whole was
							committed to a second select Committee, of which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Franklin was a member, and which reported <hi rend="italic"
								>a pension</hi> to Charlotte Hazen, without any reference to the <hi
								rend="small-caps">claim</hi> of the Executors— <persRef
								ref="maclay-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Maclay</persRef>, the chairman of the Committee said their object had
							been to <hi rend="italic">avoid</hi> any opinion on the validity of this
							claim— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Franklin said he considered it as
							a virtual <hi rend="italic">rejection</hi> of the claim— And thus the
							bill pass’d, in spite of every effort to amend or recommit it; both M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Franklin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Moore, the members who had at first most vehemently opposed
							any diversion of the grant from its legal course of payment, now voting
							for it. The pension is of $200. to commence from 1. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y:</hi> 1805.— It is one of many instances I have
							witness’d, how impossible it is, to hold a legislative assembly to any
							correct principle for the settlement of claims— It also proves how much
							more powerful, an appeal to the humanity and benevolence of such an
							Assembly, is, than a call to their Justice— A third point demonstrated
							by this transaction, is the effect of a petitioner’s presence, and
							intrigue, in operating upon public measures— Had Moses White the
							Co-Executor been here, I do not believe the grant would have been as it
							now stands— A debate took place on a bill concerning certain Roads— But
							was not completed— A question arose upon an Amendment proposed by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Franklin— The ayes were 12 the noes 11.
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the President pro Tem. was called upon to vote,
							but declined on a doubt as to his right, and declared the amendment
							carried. This gave rise to a question of order, as to the right of a
							President pro Tem. to vote, in other cases than that of an equal
							division. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Anderson declared that had he
							voted it would have been in the negative; in which case M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Franklin’s Amendment would not have been
							carried— After some discussion a member of the majority moved a <hi

							taken up, and <persRef ref="franklin-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Franklin’s</persRef> Amendment again debated— This
							debate disclosed an attempt of the part of those who brought in and
							supported the Bill, which I consider, as no better than a fraud upon the
							Union— By the Law of Congress authorizing the North Western Territory to
							form itself into a State, Congress made several propositions to the
							Legislature of that Territory; among which one was, that they should
							agree not to tax the Lands of the United States which might be sold, for
							five years after their sale—in consideration of which, the United
							States, would apply one twentieth part, or 5 per cent of the net
							proceeds of the lands sold, toward laying out <hi rend="italic"
								>roads</hi>, from the Atlantic <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the State
							of Ohio, <hi rend="italic">and through the same</hi>.— The Convention
							that form’d the Ohio Constitution, <hi rend="italic">agreed</hi> to
							these proposals of Congress, on condition of certain further additions
							to them, and a <hi rend="italic">modification</hi> of this one— The <hi
								rend="italic">modification</hi> was, that <hi rend="italic">3 per
								Cent</hi>, of the net proceeds of the lands, <hi rend="italic">so
								offered to be appropriated</hi> by Congress, should be expended on
							roads, <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the State of Ohio, and under the
							direction of its Legislature.— To this <hi rend="italic"
								>modification</hi> Congress agreed, and by a subsequent Law,
							directed the payment of this 3 per Cent to the Agents of the Ohio
							Legislature; and it has accordingly been paid to them ever since.— This
							then left 2 per Cent of the net proceeds, as offered by Congress, to be
							applied to laying out roads from the Atlantic <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
							the State of Ohio— But in this Bill as introduced by <persRef
								ref="worthington-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Worthington</persRef>, <hi rend="italic">one twentieth</hi> part of
							the net proceeds was appropriated to laying out roads <hi rend="italic"
								>to</hi> the State of Ohio; and that on pretence that it was already
							authorized by the former Law of Congress.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Franklin’s Amendment was to strike out the words “<hi
								rend="italic">one twentieth part</hi>,” and insert “<hi
								rend="italic">remaining two per Cent</hi>,” this brought the whole
							subject to the test of examination, and Worthington with his supporters
							gravely maintained, that the modification, meant an addition of 3 per
							Cent, and that Congress were already bound to appropriate 8 per Cent, to
							the roads—viz one twentieth by the first offer, and 3 per Cent, by the
								<hi rend="italic">modification</hi>; which as <persRef
								ref="stone-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Stone</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, observed to me, was only contending that a modification
							of 5 means 8.— And it was the merest accident in the world that this
							stratagem did not yesterday succeed.— The investigation this day, was
							more full and the questions were taken by yeas and nays—for striking out
							16 yeas 9. nays—for inserting 14 yeas 11 nays— <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> voting in the negative on both.— After going
							through the bill as in the house; M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Franklin offered an Amendment, which the President declared not in
							order—but said it might be offered at the third reading.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dayton presented a petition, for opening
							a passage at the Rapids of the Ohio; and moved its reference to a select
							Committee— When the ballots were returned, there were only 13 not making
							a quorum— The members were called in from the lobby, and the President
							ordered a new ballot—much against the will of <persRef
								ref="dayton-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Dayton</persRef>, who thought the first ballot good, for those who
							had voted; and that the other members coming in should have added their
							votes to those first received— It is surprizing how these questions of
							order are multiplied, whenever a person unused to preside takes the
							Chair— After Senate adjourn’d, I went into the lobby of the House, and
							heard a debate, upon a Resolution from the Committee of Claims, for a
							grant to <persRef ref="murray-alexander">Captain Alexander
								Murray</persRef>— This subject I presume will come before Senate, in

							against which he voted; at the hazard of displeasing his party, which he

							he did not care for that, as he had acted conformably to his own sense
							of duty; and made several other observations indicative of an honest and
							independent Mind. He told me an instance of a procedure by <persRef
								ref="tucker-stgeorge">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Tucker</persRef> the Virginian Judge, which he said was no doubt
							legal, but which was much harsher than any thing charged against Judge

						<p><date>25. </date>The Committee on the Bill to amend the Charter of
							Georgetown, met this morning; and a Committee from the Corporation came
							before them, with some amendments which they proposed introducing into
							the Bill— We had only time to read over the Bill, which is long, and the
							Amendments, before the Senate met— The Bill containing the Articles of
							War was debated— It is a very long Bill, and a very strong disposition
							appeared to carry it through all its Stages, without reading it,
							at-all.— It had already pass’d the House of Representatives in this
							Manner. Its defects of various kinds were numerous, and among the most
							conspicuous, was a continual series of the most barbarous English that
							ever crept through the bars of legislation— In many instances the
							Articles prescribing Oaths, and even penalties of death, were so loosely
							and indistinctly express’d, as to be scarcely intelligible, or liable to
							double and treble equivocation— Besides this there were many variations
							from the old Articles, which I did not approve— I did therefore, under
							the conviction of its necessity, insist upon the reading of the Bill
							through by paragraphs— The <persRef ref="anderson-joseph"
								>President</persRef>, the Senate, and most particularly the chairman
							of the select Committee to whom the Bill was before referr’d, manifested
							great impatience at this.— I expected as much before I determined upon
							my course on this occasion, and was therefore prepared to meet all this
							impatience with patient perseverance. I offered many amendments, which
							merely went to make the Articles read in grammatical English, and common
							sense— Most of these were adopted— Other Amendments, to substantial
							parts of the Articles, I also proposed—some few of which, but very few
							were carried— Other members, particularly <persRef ref="white-samuel2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wright-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright</persRef>
							offered various amendments, which were as unwillingly received as mine—
							At near 4. O’Clock, the Senate had gone through only 35 out of 103
							Articles— A motion for Adjournment was made and rejected— <persRef
								ref="jackson-james2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> then moved to recommit the bill to a select
							Committee; which was agreed to— It was proposed to refer it to the
							former Committee, of which he was chairman— But this he opposed, saying
							that Committee had already offered <pb n="130" type="ms"/>all the
							Amendments they thought necessary to the Bill, and he hoped it would be
							committed to some of the Gentlemen who offered so many Amendments of <hi
								rend="italic">who</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">such</hi>, and <hi
								rend="italic">as</hi>; alluding to me— Accordingly the Bill was
							recommitted to me, with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> White— Immediately after which the Senate
							adjourn’d until to-morrow— <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson</persRef> in his Manual
							says it is generally best not to contend against the impatience of the
							House, as it is seldom shewn without reason— I believe this to be good
							advice— Yet I should have been ashamed hereafter to read in the
							Statute-Books a Law upon so important a subject, so grossly and
							outrageously defective and blundering in every part of its composition
							as this, with the consciousness that I had been a member of the
							Legislature which enacted it.— It was impossible to attempt any
							Amendment without raising Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Jackson’s
							temper— For he having been Chairman of the former Committee naturally
							concluded, that it had come from their hands with the last polish of
							perfection, and would of course feel irritation at any presumption of
							improving it further— It was impossible to move Amendments on many
							Articles in a bill so long, without raising impatience in the Senate;
							and there was of course no alternative but to encounter this tempest, or
								suffer<hi rend="strikethrough">ing</hi> the Bill to pass the mockery
							of legislative deliberation, and go into the world with all its
							imperfections on its head.— I know not how I shall get through— But I
							think it not yet time to abandon my purpose.</p>
