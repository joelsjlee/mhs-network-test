						<p><date>7. </date>At 11. this morning, I attended the Committee on the

							When ready, he is to call the Committee together again— M<hi

							experience, and a thorough familiarity with the <hi rend="italic"
								>order</hi> and course of legislative proceedings— His manner is
							peculiarly accommodating and conciliatory; his command of temper
							exemplary.— In public affairs it appears to me there is no quality more
							useful and important than good-humour, because it operates continually
							to soften the asperities which are continually rising in the collisions
							of adverse interests and opinions; and this quality Tracy possesses in a
							high degree— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Worthington is a man of
							plausible, insinuating address, and of indefatigable activity, in the
							pursuit of his purposes. He has seen something of the world, and without
							much education of any other sort has acquired a sort of polish in his
							manners, and a kind of worldly wisdom, which may perhaps more properly
							be called cunning.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright with a
							capacity below the ordinary level, a violent temper, at once obstinate
							and unsteady, and a perpetually bustling disposition is one of the least
							respected, though not the least effective members of the Senate.— He
							takes a part in every debate— Speaks upon every subject; and very seldom
							without exposing himself by some absurdity in argument, or some
							confusion of learning— He told us this day, very seriously, that
							Praisegod Barebones was a Massachusetts name.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Anderson is a lawyer of good understanding, and good
							education— Acquainted with good principles, but often warped by the
							pressure of popular opinions.— Seldom daring to act according to his own
							ideas, and willing to see the burden of responsibility fall any where
							but upon himself— I dined this day at <persRef ref="u">Lieutenant
								Thompson’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="eaton-william">M<hi

							naval Officers were there; with some other Gentlemen— <persRef

							various colours—had beads at the nose and ears, birds feather’s, fox and
							squirrel skins and tails, and the other decorations usual to the Savages
							of <pb n="197" type="ms"/>this Continent before their intercourse with

							the more genuine Savages of the rest then present; and the Osage said
							that after travelling so far, he hoped he should go home wiser than he
							came—the interpreter of the Osages spoke only French, so that a second
							interpreter was required to give their speeches— They used considerable

						<p>In Reviewing the occurrences of the year, which is now closing I find

							the year were pass’d in attendance on my duty in Congress, where I have
							not been so profitable a servant as I might be— Not that I have
							positively neglected my duty; but because I have not exerted myself in
							its discharge with sufficient vigour and ardour— When I returned to
							Quincy last Spring, my intention was by an assiduous application to
							subjects of public concern to remove part of the ignorance which often
							interferes with my wishes to serve the public— I had barely commenced
							the execution of this design, when ill-health compell’d me to lay it
							aside— And before I could resume it, my appointment to the Professorship
							at Cambridge gave my studies necessarily a new and different direction.—
							From the beginning of July a large portion of my time has been devoted
							to the Greek Language, and to Rhetorical Writers— And these are fields
							which I must for years to come (if my life be spared) explore and
							cultivate with unabating industry, or without effect.— My health has
							been worse during the course of the whole year than I had long
							experienced, and its prospects are not flattering; but <persRef ref="adams-john;adams-abigail">my Parents</persRef>, <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
							wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-george;adams-john2">my children</persRef> have all lived, and in general been blest with
							health, for which Heaven be praised— My political prospects continue
							declining. The state of my affairs in other respects remains nearly as
							at the commencement of the year— In some respects improved; in others
							less advantageous; but on the whole more favourable and promising— The
							privations to which I have found it necessary to recur have been very
							painful as they respect my family, and in their effects, though on my
							own account they never had on my mind or spirits the weight of a Straw—
							Thus much for the past, upon which reflection can be of no use, but as
							it may influence the conduct of the future— Let me then resolve to
							devote that future to the steady pursuit of real Wisdom and Virtue; and
							let me pray for assistance from above that the general imperfections of
							humanity and my peculiar individual frailties and infirmities may be
							successfully overcome by the stronger and increasing powers of Justice,
							Temperance, Patience, and Fortitude.</p>
