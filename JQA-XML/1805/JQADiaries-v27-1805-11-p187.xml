						<p><date>25. </date>I had engaged our passage in the Newcastle Packet,

							breakfast, and to attend <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;pope-eliza">the Ladies</persRef>; but
							when we came down to the wharf; the packet had left it about five
							minutes; and with a wind so fair, that although she was still within
							hailing distance of the wharf, we could not get a boat to take us on
							board— We were therefore compelled to return to our lodgings, and
							content ourselves with remaining another day at Philadelphia. At the
							corner of Water-Street, as we returned; we met <persRef
								ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy</persRef>,

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> John Vaughan</persRef> called
							on me, as did <persRef ref="rush-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Rush</persRef>— The object of the latter was to inform
							me of a conversation which he had with <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison</persRef>, the Secretary of
							State in the course of the last Summer, respecting me. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison he said had express’d himself in
							very favourable terms, of me; and had told him that the <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">President’s</persRef> opinion of me was
							equally advantageous; &amp; that it was his wish to employ me on some
							mission abroad, if I was desirous of it— The Doctor therefore intimated
							that I might govern myself accordingly, and take such measures to
							manifest my views as I should think expedient. I told him that I had
							heretofore received suggestions of a similar nature— That I was obliged
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison, for their good opinion— That I
							never had, and I hoped never should ask for any office of any Man; and
							certainly never should sollicit M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jefferson, for any place whatsoever— That all I could say to him was
							that if M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson should nominate me for
							any Office abroad to which he thought me competent, I would not refuse
							it merely because the nomination should come from him— He said this
							assurance was entirely satisfactory; and that he believed the
							apprehension of a disdainful refusal, was the only thing which could
							deter M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson, from offering me an
							appointment— I assured him there was no Office in the President’s gift,
							for which I had any wish, and that without being rich, I possessed the
							means of maintaining my family, without feeling the necessity of any
							public Station.— He then made some remarks on the obligation a citizen
							is under to serve the public in places for which he is qualified, and
							concluded in complimentary terms, which I need not repeat, and ought to
							forget— I have no doubt but the Doctor’s intentions in this conversation
							were as friendly to me as possible, and that it was dictated entirely by
							his good wishes; but I am to remember, <pb n="191" type="ms"/>that
							upwards of four years ago, when I first returned from Berlin, <persRef
								ref="smith-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Smith</persRef> told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jefferson had spoken of me, just in the same manner; and yet within
							twelve months afterwards he <hi rend="italic">removed</hi> me from the
							Office of Commissioner of bankruptcy; which I held under the appointment
							of <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge Davis</persRef>— I am also to
							remember the conversation, which I had with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Jefferson the 23<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> of November
							last year, and then reduce to their true value all these professions of
							regard and esteem, and of a wish to employ me in public Office— I spent
							this day somewhat heavily; and in compulsive idleness: attended about an
							hour at the Supreme Court of the State, which this day, commenced its
							Session; <persRef ref="u">judge Yates</persRef> presiding; this
							afternoon called upon M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy; early in

							occasion in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s correspondence
							with <persRef ref="genet-edmund">Genet</persRef>, and by an Act of Congress at that period we had seemed only
							to claim the usual distance of three miles from the Coast; but the
							President replied that he had then assumed that principle, because Genet
							by his intemperance forced us to fix on some point, and we were not then
							prepared to assert the claim of jurisdiction to the extent we are in
							reason entitled to; but he had then taken care expressly to reserve the
							subject for future consideration, with a view to this same doctrine for
							which he now contends— I observed that it might be well before we
							ventured to assume a claim so broad, to wait for a time when we should
							have a force competent to maintain it.— But in the meantime he said it
							was advisable <hi rend="italic">to squint at it</hi>— And to accustom
							the Nations of Europe to the idea, that we should claim it in future.—
							The subject was not pushed any further— I called on <persRef ref="skipwith-f">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Skipwith</persRef>, and had some conversation with
							him respecting <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boylstons</persRef> demand; but he
							could give me no satisfactory information— I called at the Office of
							<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, the Secretary of the
							Treasury, but he was not there.— We spent part of the Evening at <persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi
