						<p><date>1. </date>I attended early this morning at the Capitol.— In Senate—
								<persRef ref="giles-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles’s
							</persRef>new Bill for the Government of Louisiana was debated at the
							second reading and postponed— The Treaty with the Creeks was taken up,
							and I express’d my opinion in favour of its Ratification— This opinion I
							believed surprized, almost every member of the Senate; and dissatisfied
							almost all— It is a sincere and honest, though not perhaps a prudent
							opinion.— <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bradley</persRef>, who has heretofore been warm in favour of the
							Ratification, appears to shiver in the wind— He offered this day an
							amendment equivalent to a conditional Ratification, and intimated that
							he would not vote for the Treaty without it.— Adjourned without taking
							the question— After Senate adjourned, I sat some time with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, waiting for <persRef
								ref="dayton-jonathan">General Dayton</persRef> which whom I had
							agreed to go to <persRef ref="turreau-louis">General Tureau</persRef>,
							the french Minister’s; where we all were to dine; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles gave me his opinions very freely on
							various subjects of a public Nature; with an evident view to draw from
							me my opinions— I hope I was sufficiently upon my guard— He talked about
							his own Louisiana Bill; and disapproved of <persRef ref="randolph-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Randolph’s</persRef> Report to
							the House of Representatives; which he said was a perfect transcript of
							Randolph’s own character— It began by setting the claims of the
							Louisianians at defiance, and concluded with a proposal to give them
							more than they asked— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Randolph was
							undoubtedly a man of very correct theories; but for his part he wished
							above all things to be in matters of Government a man of practice.— From
							this subject he pass’d to that of the Georgia Land-claims, which, for
							some days have been debated with great heats and violence in the House
							of Representatives and are not yet decided— In this case his theory and
							his practice agrees entirely with those of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Randolph— Vehemently opposed to the claims, and urging
							against them suspicions, jealousies, and menaces instead of arguments—
							He said if those claims were not totally and forever rejected, Congress
							would be bribed into the sale of the United States Lands, as the Georgia
							Legislature was to that sale— That nothing since the Government existed,
							had so deeply affected him as this subject— That the character of the
							Government itself was staked upon its event. In the State of Virginia,
							there was but one voice of Indignation relating to it— That not a man
							from that State, who should give any <pb n="133" type="ms"/>countenance
							to the proposed compromise, could obtain an election after it— <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> himself would lose an election in Virginia, if
							he was known to favour it— And there was a gentleman, in the House who
							had voted for the Resolution, and who <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi>
							would lose his election by it— (I understood him to mean <persRef
								ref="jackson-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jackson</persRef>, who married <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="madison-dolley">wife’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="jackson-mary">sister</persRef>.)— He then proceeded to
							speak with much severity of <persRef ref="granger-gideon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Granger</persRef>, the
							Post-Master-General— Intimated strong suspicions that he had bribed
							members of Congress to support him in these claims.— He said by the list
							of the Contracts for carrying the mail, it appeared that several members
							of Congress had contracted for that purpose— <persRef ref="lyon-matthew"
								>Matthew Lyon</persRef>, to the amount of several thousand dollars.—
							A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Claiborne</persRef> a
							member from Virginia, a man of ruined fortune and habitual intoxication,
							was another— That the Constitution forbids any Member of Congress from
							holding any Office of honour or profit under the United States— That a
							contract to carry the mail was not indeed an Office of honour, but to
							such men as Lyon and Claiborne, it must be considered as an Office of
							profit; for that they could have made the contracts with no other view
							than to profit— That for his part, he never trusted a man who had
							nothing but professions to support him— That M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Granger was a man of too many professions, and he must take
							the liberty to suspect him— That these people were perpetually
							clamouring for reward, on account of their services to the Republican
							Cause— Eternally labouring to keep up the memory and resentment of past
							times and dissensions, which ought now to be but of <hi rend="italic"
								>secondary</hi> consideration— That the President had told him he
							never had received from the State of Virginia one application to remove
							a single federal Officer—while from other States he had been harrassed
							by them without number; and had letters, and certificates, and
							affidavits, and God knows what in support of them— That such insatiable
							avidity for Office was no great proof of merit; and he told such
							people—Gentlemen, if you supported Republican principles because you
							thought them essential to the welfare of your Country, you surely cannot
							expect personal reward for that— If from merely interested and selfish
							purposes, you have no right to reward— He said much more to the same
							effect— His tongue runs fast when once a going, and he slides from one
							subject to another by light, and successive transitions which generally
							land his discourse wide from where it started— From the specimens I have
							had of his conversation, he is very free in his animadversions both on
							men and things. This is what some men may be with impunity; but I am not
							one of them.— At Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Turreau’s he renewed
							the subject of the Georgia Land-claims, and said over again to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison, all he had said to me, and much
							more against them— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison appealed to
							the agreement between the United States and Georgia, and the reservation
							of lands made for the express purpose of quieting those claims— Giles
							said that was a very incorrect and improper proceeding, and ought not to
							be sanctioned by us. General Turreau’s dinner was to the Heads of
							departments, with their Ladies—<persRef ref="mason-john">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l:</hi> Mason</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tayloe-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tayloe</persRef>
							with <persRef ref="mason-anna;tayloe-ann">their Ladies</persRef>—Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Giles, <persRef ref="dayton-jonathan"
								>Dayton</persRef> and <persRef ref="logan-george">Logan</persRef> of
							the Senate, and Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="nicholson-joseph">Nicholson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="eppes-john">Eppes</persRef> of the House— I was not very well,
							and came home immediately after dinner; which indeed was at almost 9. in
							the Evening.</p>

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Brown moved as an Amendment to the
							Resolution of Ratification, to strike out all but the introductory

							question was called for, and of course the first question was only on
							the striking out— There were 20 votes for striking out and 11. “that the
							words should stand”—according to the mode of taking the question
							prescribed by the Senate’s 38<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Rule.— The
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">President</persRef> decided that the

								Tracy</persRef> supported this decision of the President, which was
							in direct opposition both to the letter and the intent of the Rule— The
							embarrassment arose from its being an unusual mode of taking questions
							at this time— I was a familiar one in the old Congress and there such a
							question would not have arisen— I went in to the House of
							Representatives and spoke to <persRef ref="plater-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Plater,</persRef> respecting the

						<p><date>5. </date>On going to the Senate this morning, I found them already
							engaged upon the Clearance Bill.— And an incident not very singular in
							these times soon occurr’d— On the 14<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of
							last month this Bill, together with some Amendments proposed by a former
							select Committee were re-committed to a second select Committee of five,
							who were to report an entire new Bill, that which came from the House of
							Representatives being after long and repeated debates given up as
							untenable by all sides. This second Committee accordingly reported some
							ten days since a new Bill, and upon its being taken up this morning I
							expected that this would be the subject of the debate— But <persRef
								ref="giles-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles
							</persRef>was not in his seat; and when the first question, on striking
							out the original Bill was called, <persRef ref="breckinridge-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Breckenridge</persRef>, without
							making any observations barely called for the yeas and nays, and by a
							majority of 19 to 12 the striking out was <hi rend="italic"
								>rejected</hi>— So that the debate then was immediately thrown back
							upon the very bill which three weeks since had been as by Common Consent
							abandoned. This was so evidently the result of consultations out of
							doors, that it had the appearance of a determination to crowd the Bill
							down at all events— The new Bill, which <persRef ref="smith-samuel2"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Smith</persRef>, the Chairman
							of the Committee had taken great pains to draw up, and which was very
							long, could not be discussed at all; and he was driven to move
							Amendments in that which came from the house— Some of these were at
							length adopted after M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles came into the
							Senate, and took the wheel at helm from Breckinridge— <persRef
								ref="logan-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan</persRef>,
							seemingly encouraged by the turn of tide on this subject gave notice
							that before the final passage of the Bill he should move for an
							additional section prohibiting the trade to S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Domingo, altogether— He came to my seat and shewed me a
							letter from his kinsman <persRef ref="dickinson-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> John Dickinson</persRef> on this and
							other subjects— Urging strongly a total interdiction of the trade; and
							censuring severely the Bill pass’d by the House, as sanctioning the
							trade under colour of restraining it.— He also gives it as his opinion
							that Louisiana may be admitted into the Union as a State, without an
							Amendment to the Constitution; but hopes Congress will not be <hi
								rend="italic">hurried</hi>, or driven into any such measure, by
							terror— As to the impeachment of <persRef ref="chase-samuel">Judge
								Chase</persRef> he says “however I may have been hurt by his conduct
							on the Bench, <pb n="135" type="ms"/>I cannot decide him guilty, untill
							all the Evidence shall appear.”— The Clearance Bill was postponed, and
							some other objects of less moment pass’d upon— <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							moved for the printing of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chase’s

							was simply a statement that they were personally not ready; and of

							assigned the same reasons; and referr’d for precedent to the practice in
							the British Parliament, particularly on <persRef ref="hastings-warren"
								>Hastings’s</persRef> trial— He said upon all such incidental and
							occasional motions, he thought for avoiding delay and unnecessary
							inconvenience, he could decide, subject however to a call from any one
							Member of the Senate, who might dissent from his opinion, for a regular
							question to be taken— At 12. O’Clock the Court of Impeachments, met in

								Randolph</persRef>, Chairman of the Managers, in a Speech of about

								ref="randolph-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Randolph’s</persRef> opening previous to the examination of the

							adjourned for half an hour— On returning, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Campbell stated that he was unable then to proceed, and

							with time untill the morning— This was allowed, and the Senate returned
							to their Legislative business— Several bills were pass’d at various
							stages, and among the rest I obtained that the George-town Charter-Bill
							should pass to the third reading— The Resolution for printing the
							Impeachment Journals, was also at length taken up and pass’d; though by
							a small majority—without discussion. Adjourned between 5 and 6. O’Clock—

							Counsel who treated the part of the Articles to which this testimony
							belonged had finished.— They added that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Holmes had been here these three days, and complained at the Managers

							had forborne to introduce him, only to avoid interrupting M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chase’s Counsel in their Argument; and he
							hoped they would have full liberty to comment upon the testimony he
							might give— He added that the Managers after all laid very little stress
							on M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Heath’s evidence “for, thank God, the
							issue of the Cause did not depend on the testimony of any

							witness. <persRef ref="nicholson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Nicholson</persRef>, with a manner of defiance, and of arrogance,
							which is peculiar to him, said the Managers did not ask as a favour,
							they demanded as a right the examination of this witness.— The question
							was taken by yeas and nays—and the result was 21 yeas; among which was
							my votes and 11. nays— The witness was examined, and proved that the
							Story told by Heath was impossible; so that instead of confirming, he
							gave the finishing stroke to its discredit.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Harper continued his argument untill about 7 in the
							Evening, and then closed the Argument of the Defence. <pb n="142"

							at variance with any rule— I supposed it admissible or not at the

							testimony merely to the <hi rend="italic">credit</hi> of another
							witness; rendered necessary or proper, by facts which have arisen in the
								<hi rend="italic">course</hi> of the trial— Testimony, the use for
							which could not have been foreseen previous to the trial; and which the

								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard warmly urged, the
