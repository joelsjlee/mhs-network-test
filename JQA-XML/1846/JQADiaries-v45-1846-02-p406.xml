						<p>I attended Public worship this morning at the Hall of the House of
							Representatives where the services were performed by a stranger neither
							of the <persRef ref="tustin-septimus;milburn-william">Chaplains of the
								two Houses of Congress</persRef> being present. His text was from
							Hebrew 11.26. “Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
							treasures of Egypt” omitting the remainder of that verse “for he had
							respect unto the recompense of the reward”— The discourse was calm and
							temparate without declamation or enthusiasm—consisting chiefly of
							philosophical remarks upon the nature and operation of reproach upon the
							temper and the minds of men— With an application of it as a trial of the
							character of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>— He did <pb n="407"
								type="ms"/>not, however, explain by what authority the Apostle,
							represents Moses, as having been subjected to the reproach of Christ
							fifteen hundred years before Christ appeared upon earth, it must have
							been altogether in a figurative sense— <persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul</persRef> is expatiating upon the power and efficacy of Faith
							as the foundation of Religious principle—the Faith of Moses was in the
							promises, of Jehovah from whom he is stated to have received direct and
							personal revelations. there is however nothing which indicates, that the
							future existance of Christ, was ever revealed to him— It is somewhat
							extraordinary that in this passage of the Epistle to the Hebrews the
							name of Christ, should have been introduced at all— Returning home from
							the Capitol I met, coming and from the door of my own house <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef ref="ritchie-montgomery">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Harrison Ritchie</persRef> of Boston
							Grandson of <persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Harrison Gray Otis</persRef> who returned, and made a visit of a few
							minutes to me— After dinner at Saint John’s Church, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Doudnay</persRef> read the
							evening service for the fourth Sunday after the Epiphany and preached
							from St Luke 15.10. “Likewise I say unto you there is joy in the
							presence of the Angels of God over one sinner, that repenteth.” This
							Discourse was not upon the duty or the efficacy of repentance but it was
							an Essay to maintain the assertion that there are Angels in the presence
							of God, and that they take interest in the Characters and fortunes of
							mankind. The text is indeed conclusive of the existance of such
							spiritual Beings and leads to the inference not however so certain of
							the doctrine of Guardian Angels. One of the most pleasing opinions that
							can be entertained in the Faith of Christianity— There are other
							passages especially in the Book of <persRef ref="daniel"
								>Daniel</persRef> perhaps, more strongly supporting this Doctrine—
							Which however I do not consider as positively revealed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Doudnay is a sober and sensible but not
							an eloquent Preacher— <persRef ref="campbell-archibald">Archibald
								Campbell</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull

						<p>The weather on Saturday last was almost at Summer heat— I went to dinner
							with <persRef ref="seward-william">Gov Seward</persRef> without a great
							coat— Yesterday was severely cold and I found myself on rising with
							hoarseness, sore throat, and with threatned Catarrhal cough</p>
						<pb n="408" type="ms"/>
						<p>This morning <persRef ref="perry-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Thomas H. Perry</persRef> a Professor in the navy of the United
							called on me. He had visited me twice in the course of the last Summer
							and Autumn at Quincy, he is anxious with regard to his station in the
							Navy <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Bancroft</persRef> the Secretary of that Department having in his
							late Report to the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef>
							proposed to abolish that corps of Officers. He appears to apprehend also
							some personal aversion or prejudice of the Secretary against himself— I
							assured him that if he wished a representation should be made in his
							behalf I should cheerfully render him any service in my power— He had no
							particular request to make but stated that he might call on my good
							offices on certain contingencies and if such should occur he would do
							so— At the House, three new resolutions relating to the Oregon Territory
							Controversy were introduced the first by <persRef ref="dargan-edmund"
								>Edmund S. Darjin</persRef> of Alabama, the second by <persRef
								ref="tibbatts-john">John W. Tibbatts</persRef> of Kentucky and the
							third, by <persRef ref="pettit-john">John Pettit</persRef> of Indiana.
							Objections were made to the reception of them all and they were all
							received by suspension of the rules and referred to Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert
								C. Winthrop</persRef> presented a Memorial from <persRef
								ref="gray-martha">Martha Gray</persRef> widow of <persRef
								ref="gray-robert">Capt Robert Gray</persRef> the discoverer of the
							Columbia river in the North-West coast of America praying for Pension,
							on the ground that her deceased husband was in the service of this
							Country during the War of the Revolution and that she has been debarred
							from a pension as his widow only because her marriage took place in Feb.
							1794. the limitation commencing with the 1. of January of that year. The
							Memorial was referred to the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions and
							ordered to be printed. A 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> resolution
							relating to the Oregon Controversy was offered by <persRef
								ref="brown-william13">William J. Brown</persRef> of Virginia, and
							referred with the rest to the Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union and ordered to be printed. <persRef ref="bayly-thomas3">M<hi

							was permitted to make an other personal explanation in reply to the
							Speech of <persRef ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew Johnson</persRef> of Tenn
							made last Saturday Johnson replied again this day and Bayly rejoined and
							Johnson surrejoined and Bayly had the last words— Much of the
							controversy between these two gentlemen related to me, Bayly having
							taunted the Democratic supporters of the Notice to be given to Great
							Britain by the charge that they were taking <pb n="409" type="ms"/>me
							for their Leader and saying it was a lead which he was not disposed to
							follow— Upon this remark, Johnson’s answer on Saturday was very severe
							and this day still more Cutting. Bayly after manifesting several times
							great excitement at the remarks of Johnson finally left his Seat and
							went out of the House. By a singular coincidence two citizens of North
							Carolina named <persRef ref="jones-thomas7">Jones</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="johnson-daniel">Johnson</persRef> fought a Duel this morning at
							Bladensburg in which Johnson was killed and a rumor was circulated
							throughout this City this day that this Duel was between Bayly and
							Johnson in which my champion of Tennessee had fallen—fortunately I heard
							nothing of this rumor till it was ascertained to be unfounded;—the only
							Duel between these Parties this day having been as on Saturday merely a
							strife of words— <persRef ref="stockton-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>I finished reading, this morning, the Mystères de Paris, the last,
							volume, being in the English translated, which I had taken, out, from
							the Library of Congress, and this Day, returned— It is, a dismal, and
							melancholy tale, painting in glowing colours, the vices, crimes, and
							wretchedness, of the City, of Paris, It is, a subject, of interesting
							comparison, with, the “Paysan perverti” of Retif de La Bretonne,
							published, shortly before, the French Revolution, and with, the Tableaux
							De Paris, by <persRef ref="mercier-louis">Mercier</persRef>, published,

									>rs.</hi> Smith</persRef>, still remains, confined, to hers. At
							the House <persRef ref="black-james2">James, A. Black</persRef> of South
							Carolina, offered, a Joint Resolution, with a long preamble,
							authorizing, the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef>, to give
							notice, to the British Government, of the annulment, of the Convention,
							of 1827. with a proviso, for further negotiations, and <persRef

							introduced, a Bill, for effecting, the same purpose, with an
							appropriation, of money, the amount, left in Blank, and further
							negotiation, recommended. The object, of multiplying these projects of
							Legislation, I suppose, to be intended, for the purpose, of defeating
							them all which I have little doubt, is the systematic proceeding, of the
							Polk Adminis<pb n="410" type="ms"/>tration. I hinted, as much, in
							anticipation, in my speech, of the 2. January and this day, <persRef
								ref="thomasson-william">Thomassin</persRef> of Kentucky said to me
							laughing that in addition to all my other properties I should prove in
							this case a Prophet. <persRef ref="ashmun-george">George
								Ashman</persRef>, of Springfield, Sixth Congressional District of
							Massachusetts moved a call on the President, of inquiry as to the
							proceedings of the Army of the United States towards Mexico and also the
							movements of the Navy it was laid over one day for consideration— The
							Oregon Debate was resumed in Committee of the Whole on the State of the
							Union, and <persRef ref="leake-shelton">Shelton. F. Leake</persRef>, of
							Virginia, made a warm, hour speech, against giving the Notice, with no
							little excitement, under the imputations against <hi
								rend="strikethrough">the</hi> Virginia, and her Delegation, on the
							floor, for deserting, the Administration, upon, this Oregon Question.
							The next Speaker, was, <persRef ref="strong-stephen">Stephen

							rather, dull, and heavy, and next came <persRef ref="sawyer-william3"
								>William Sawyer</persRef> of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congressional District, of Ohio with the wildest and most original
							speech yet delivered on the Question. He considered the Oregon region as
							a gift of Heaven to the North American Union for propagating the
							principles of Liberty, and good Government. This he thought was
							equivalent to the manifest destiny of <persRef ref="baker-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Baker</persRef> of Illinois and he
							lead with a sledge hammer. The doctrines of the new Anglo-Virginia
							School especially of <persRef ref="pendleton-john">Pendleton</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="bedinger-henry">Beddinger</persRef> one of whom has
							asserted that Great Britain had never committed an outrage or done a
							wrong without atoning and apologising for it— This he denied and said it
							was a question of veracity between him and the gentleman from Virginia
							who thereupon started up and repeated in a highly excited tone, the
							words, a Question of veracity, upon which Sawyer looking at him with a
							smile said I mean nothing personal— He was very bitter in replying to
							the assertion that Great Britain had done us no wrong without atoning
							and apologising <hi rend="strikethrough">he said</hi> it, he said he
							owed her an old grudge as <persRef ref="u">his Father</persRef> had
							before him, and specified a number of wrongs from the first settlement
							of this Country down to the present day which she had committed and
							never had apologised or atoned for and never would, at this very day he
							said Great Britain was paying the Indian Tribes within our Borders
							hundreds of thousands of <pb n="411" type="ms"/>dollars, a year, to
							purchase, their hostility against us, for which we were obliged, to pay,
							the same Indians, one million; and three quarters, every year, to
							purchase back their friendship.— <persRef ref="bell-joshua">Joshua. F.
								Bell</persRef> of Ky next, took the floor, and at his motion the
							Committee rose— <persRef ref="collamer-jacob">Jacob Collamer</persRef>
							of Vermont, offered, a resolution, calling, on the President, for copies
							of any correspondence, between, this Government, and that, of Great
							Britain in relation to the Country west of the Rocky Mountains which may
							have occurred, since the last Annual Message of the President objection
							was made to the reception of this Resolution, but on motion of Collamer
							the Rules, were suspended. <persRef ref="houston-george"
								>Houston</persRef> of Alabama made a motion to lay the Resolution on
							the Table, which was refused by yeas and nays 62 to 94, <persRef
								ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac. E. Holmes</persRef> of South Carolina
							asked leave to present a Memorial of a Southern Convention, held at
							Memphis, in Tennessee to deliberate on measures calculated to promote

							taken by yeas and nays this morning on the motion to suspend the Rules,

							2. and moved <pb n="412" type="ms"/>a Call of the House— <persRef
								ref="ashmun-george">Ashman</persRef> moved, to lay the Resolution on

							it was identical with a Resolution offered yesterday and then laid on

							sustained this objection for the Rule is not that a Motion identical
							with one laid in the Table cannot be renewed on the next day, it applies
							only to a Resolution rejected but the decision of the Speaker was, not
							Question and the objection was avoided by merely changing the hour of
							the proposed closure of the Debate from 1/2 past 2. to 2. o’clock—
							Ashman withdrew the motion to lay it on Table but it was renewed, by

							observing that <persRef ref="inman-henry">Inman</persRef> one of the
							Painters employed under the authority of Congress to paint one of the
							large pictures to be suspended in the Rotunda of the Capitol had
							recently died, that he believed he had not even commenced upon the
							painting though he had received a large part of the sum <pb n="413"
								type="ms"/>which was to have been paid for the work. He said that he
							was very desirous of obtaining the engagement to supply that picture a
							subject of deep interest to him as of great importance to his
							reputation— I promised to do all in my power, to obtain this employment
							for him. He observed that it might be objected that his talent had been
							hitherto tested only in the painting of Portraits, but he thought it
							might be answered that at the time of Inman’s appointment he had never
							been distinguished except as a portrait Painter, which is true— He made
							some comparison of opinions upon the comparative merits of the two
							Pictures already suspended in the Rotunda by <persRef ref="chapman-john"
								>Chapman</persRef> and <persRef ref="weir-robert">Weir</persRef>— We
							agreed that this last was a work of real merit— The baptism of <persRef

							of his approbation as of mine— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Healy
							asked my advice also for the choice of a subject in the event of his
							obtaining the employment for the work. I mentioned several to him and
							among the rest the first Congress of the Colonies held at New York in
							1765. He thought well of this, but it is subject to many objections and
							only fit for future consideration— At the House <persRef
								ref="price-sterling">Sterling Price</persRef> moved a Resolution to
							close the debate on the Oregon Notice resolution next Monday at 3.
							o’clock P.M. and moved the Previous Question <persRef ref="mckay-james"

							the Resolution on the Table; refused by yeas and nays, 86. to 107. the

							109 to 87. I now voted against laying on the Table and for the

								>Tibbatts</persRef> in the Chair on the Oregon notice Resolutions—
								<persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Meredith P. Gentry</persRef> of

							which he thought would infalibly lead to War and said he believed that

							appealed to <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles. J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, Chair <pb n="414" type="ms"/>man of the
							Committee of Foreign Affairs, who answered that he believed negotiation
							had been resumed and that a Communication from the Executive would be

								<persRef ref="delano-columbus">Columbus Delano</persRef> both in

							continued before and after supper till between 1. and 2 o’clock in the

						<p>This was the day upon which there should have been, a meeting of the

							after the Resolution of the House, to meet till next Tuesday, at 10.
							o’clock in the morning; he came to me, and we agreed to postpone, the
							meeting of the Committee, till after next Monday.— The House accordingly
							met this morning at 10. It was already in Session, when I reached the
							Hall. The Quorum had not been formed precisely at ten, and motions to
							dispense with the reading of the Journal, to go into Committee of the
							Whole on the State of the Union, without a Quorum, and to adjourn, had
							been successively made— The Journal of yesterday was read. A Quorum had
							come in and went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
								<persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef> in the Chair, and
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Robert B. Rhett</persRef>, who had the

								<persRef ref="davis-jefferson">Jefferson <pb n="415" type="ms"

							giving the notice— <persRef ref="houston-george">George S.

								>Charles W. Cathgart</persRef> of Indiana and <persRef
								ref="martin-john">John P. Martin</persRef> of Kentucky followed in
							succession all in favour of giving the notice but expressing different
							opinions with regard to the extent of our title to be insisted upon with
							our Controversy with England. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Martin,
							referred, to the opinion which I had expressed that the Notice would not
							lead to War because one or the other of the Parties would yield of their
							pretensions till it should come to an agreement of compromise had
							misunderstood me, and I repeated what I had said that if our Government
							should persist in our Claims to the whole of Oregon Great Britain would
							ultimately yield, but if they should not and Great Britain should refuse
							to yield our own Government would and I had more apprehension that the
								<persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef> would back out and
							yield too much than that the notice would yield to War— <persRef
								ref="parrish-isaac">Isaac Parish</persRef> of Ohio offered four long

							of power in this American Union or any permission to European Monarchs
							of interfering in the Territorial rights of this Nation of any

							but he made no speech in support of his Resolutions— <persRef
								ref="clark-henry3">Henry. S. Clarke</persRef> of North Carolina
							moved the Committee to rise, which was refused and he made his hour
							speech in favour of the Notice, because he had considered the Annexation
							of Texas and the occupation of Oregon to be kindred objects parts of one
							system and having himself supported the annexation of Texas, he should
							vote, for the occupation of Oregon, for consistency sake. If in
							negotiation our Government should accept of the parallel of 49. he would
							not raise an insurrection against it, and if we should insist upon the
							whole of Oregon he thought it would lead to War— <persRef
								ref="foot-solomon">Solomon Foot</persRef> of Vermont repeated the
							motion for the Committee to rise— On taking the Question there was no
							quorum—upon which the Committee rose and the Chairman reported the fact
							to the House— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> moved
							a Call of the House A motion to adjourn succeeded, rejected by yeas and
							nays 47. to 74. a quorum voting. Droomgoole withdrew the motion for a
							Call. Tibbatts resumed the Chair of the Committee of the whole and Foot
							made his hour speech, animated and eloquent against the notice and
							descriptive of the horrors of War— <persRef ref="starkweather-david">D.
								A Starkweather</persRef> of Ohio made a backwoodman’s speech sharp
							as a <pb n="416" type="ms"/>needle, and blunt as a Mall in support of
							the notice, and specially defencive of the people of the West, against
							some reflections which had been cast upon them, by others— <persRef

							informed us, that the Dear child <persRef ref="adams-arthur"

							Milburne, made very little of his text, which connected with the

						<p>We received another Letter, from <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth. C. Adams</persRef>, dated on Saturday, and advising us,
							that <persRef ref="adams-arthur">the child</persRef>, still lived, but
							without a cheering glimpse of hope— At 10. o’clock this morning, I
							attended at the House, which I found in Committee of the Whole on the
							state of the Union— <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef>, in
							the Chair, and <persRef ref="king-thomas2">Thomas. B. King</persRef> of
							Georgia, speaking, against the Resolution for giving the Oregon Notice—
							I had scarcely taken my seat, when he addressed himself personally to
							me, with a charge of inconsistency, for having in years 1818. and 1827.
							agreed, to the temporary Conventions, with Great Britain, concerning the
							Oregon region and now declaring myself ready, to put an end to that
							compact. He turned his face from the <persRef ref="davis-john8"
								>Speaker</persRef> towards me and asked the question Why, this
							change had come over my mind? I had been for several days, urged, by
							sundry members of the House to address the Committee, on this subject,
							but the wretched state of my health, and the burden of affliction,
							bearing me down, at this moment, had so totally discouraged me that I
							entered, the House, with a determination to wait for the decision, and
							give to it only my affirmative vote— This direct call from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> King however I could not resist— I rose
							and said, that without admitting the right of the gentleman from
							Georgia, to put a direct and personal question to me in that House, I
							was however ready to answer him— His question was “Whether the title of
							the United States to the whole of Oregon to Latitude 54.–40. was clear
							and indisputable? This question I said was susceptible of two different
							constructions—one with referrence to right and wrong, and another with
							referrence to fact—that as to the question of right—I <pb n="419"
								type="ms"/>did hold the Title of the United States to be, clear, and
							indisputable, but as to the <hi rend="italic">Fact</hi>, if every thing
							is disputable which is disputed I could not say, that the title was
							indisputable, and if every thing disputed by Great Britain was
							disputable, I thought it would be difficult any indisputable title,
							without a change in the definition of words— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> King replied that my answer was just such as he had
							expected, but that as I held these opinions he marvelled why I had not
							formally protested against any claim of title, by Great Britain to
							Oregon in 1818. and 1827. Without rejoining immediately I suffered M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> King to finish his speech and then
							rose—and made myself a fragment of a speech which was arrested, before I
							had half done, by the expiration of the hour— I took some notice of the
							disorderly manner in which M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> King, had
							thought proper to address himself to me, in the course of the Debate,
							whereupon, he explained that he had intended nothing disrespectful,
							which I have no doubt was true or disorderly which it certainly was— I
							then, entered upon the consideration, of the title—and requested the
							Speaker to hand over to the <persRef ref="french-benjamin"
								>Clerk</persRef> the small Book which he occasionally used for
							administering to the Members of the House their solemn oaths, to support
							the Constitution of the United States— He passed the little Bible over
							to the Clerk B. B. French who at my request read the 26, 27. &amp; 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> verses of the first chapter of
							Genesis—which I said in my judgment contained the foundation of all
							Human Territorial rights—whether of eminent domain—National Jurisdiction
							or Individual Property from the right of the United States to the soil
							upon which the Capitol to the seat in the Chair, occupied by the Speaker
							of the House— This was the general title of the whole Human race to the
							whole of this Globe of earth, from this all other Human titles, must be
							derived— I then requested the Clerk to read the 8. verse of 2.
							Psalm—which he did—“Ask of me, and I shall give thee, the Heathen for
							thy inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
							possession”—and the preceeding verses declare that the speaker of this
							promise was God Almighty, and the person to whom the promise was made
							was Jesus Christ— Then without calling on the Clerk to read, I referred
							to the 18. and 19. &amp; 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verses of
								<persRef ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef>, in which after his
							ressurrection from the dead—Jesus Christ, spoke to his eleven disciples
							his last words saying—“All power is given unto me, in <pb n="420"
								type="ms"/>Heaven and in Earth, go ye therefore, and teach all
							Nations baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
							the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I had
							commanded you, and lo; I am with you, always even unto the end of the
							World. Amen” I proceeded to say that at the time of the discovery of
							this Hemisphere, by <persRef ref="columbus-christopher">Christopher
								Columbus</persRef> it was an Article of creed of all christian
							Nations, that the Bishop of Rome, as the successor of <persRef
								ref="peter">Saint Peter</persRef> was the Vicar of Jesus Christ,
							upon earth and the Administrator of all that power, with which he had
							declared himself to be invested in Heaven and on Earth at the time of
							His ressurrection and that then, and for several preceeding Centuries,
							it had been a part of the Religious creed of Christendom, that the right
							of disposing not only of uninhabited Countries and of Countries only
							inhabited by Savages, but even of all earthly Kingdoms, was vested in
							the Pope of Rome as the Vicar and representative, of Jesus Christ, upon
							earth and hence it was by this assumed and recognised authority that in
							1493. the spring after the discovery of Columbus, <persRef
								ref="alexander-vi">Pope Alexander 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi></persRef> gave this whole Hemisphere to <persRef
								ref="ferdinandofaragon">Ferdinand</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="isabella-i">Isabella</persRef>, King and Queen of Castille,
							Leon, and Aragon— I then proceeded to deduce Historically, our title, to
							the North West coast from Latitude 42 to 54–40. till I was arrested by
							the expiration of the hour— <persRef ref="haralson-hugh"
								>Haralson</persRef> of Georgia immediately took the floor, <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> moved to
							suspend the hour rule to give me the opportunity to conclude— But this
							led to a Debate which terminated without suspending the rule— Haralson
							made his speech, Charles. J. Ingersoll, followed, for an hour, and
								<persRef ref="darragh-cornelius">Cornelius Darragh</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania, consumed the remaining twenty minutes till three oclock
							the hour, at which it had been agreed that the Debate should close— The
							voting then commenced, and numerous Amendments were proposed, and voted
							upon, without Debate. The original resolution was amended and a second
							resolution added to it, recommending further negotiation, and was
							reported, to the House, where, the final vote, was taken, by yeas and
							nays 163 to 54. It was read a third time and passed— A motion to
							reconsider with the Previous Question was rejected and at six o’clock in
							the evening the House adjourned— I returned home, gratified with the
							result, but deeply dispirited, and disconsolate—</p>

						<p>We received this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth. C. Adams</persRef> dated on Monday morning that <persRef
								ref="adams-arthur">the Child</persRef> had not yet breathed his
							last. It mercifully prepared us, for the event, no longer doubtful— In
							the heaviness of my heart, I attended the meeting of the House; now
							again fixed at twelve o’clock, where, <persRef ref="carroll-charles2"
								>Charles. H. Carroll</persRef> of New York, appeared and took his
							seat— <persRef ref="king-thomas2">Thomas. B. King</persRef> asked leave
							to make a personal explination, of his reasons, for not voting, on the
							Resolution, for giving the Oregon Notice last Monday— Having obtained
							leave, he began in substance, an Argument against the Notice, whereupon
								<persRef ref="rathbun-george">George Rathbun</persRef> rose and
							objected to his proceeding. He said that he was very desirous, to give
							his reasons, why he did vote upon that Resolution; and if the gentleman
							from Georgia, was permitted to make an Argument; against the measure,
							under colour of a personal explination, he thought he was himself,
							equally entitled, to deliver a counter Argument of his reasons, for
							voting— A straggling Debate ensued, ending in a permission, to Thomas.
							B. King by yeas and nays 86 to 63. to proceed in his explanation— The
							substance of what he said was that the reason for his declining to vote
							had been that the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef> had not
							communicated, the whole of the late correspondence; with the British
							Government, called for by the Resolution of the House, last week— He
							believed, that an important portion, of that correspondence, had been
							suppressed— Hereupon Rathbun objected again to his proceeding and after
							some farther chicanery he was again allowed to proceed, and finished his
							explination, which gave no substantial reason for flinching from his
							vote— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="brodhead-richard">Richard Brodhead</persRef> in the Chair, on
							the Pension Appropriation Bills— The Chairman had yesterday decided that
							an Amendment moved by <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef>
							enlarging the extent of the Widows Pensions, to be out of order, from
							which Tibbatts had taken an Appeal. He now modified his Amendment, with
							an additional Section to <pb n="424" type="ms"/>reduce the time of
							Service, giving title to Pensions to three months. The Chairman decided
							the whole to be out of order, from which Tibbatts appealed, a long
							Debate followed and Brodhead’s decision was sustained by Tellers 103 to
							38— <persRef ref="smith-caleb">Caleb B. Smith</persRef>, of Indiana,
							moved an addition to the Bill, making arrearages of Pension, recoverable
							by Executors and Administrators. but <persRef ref="black-james2"
								>Black</persRef> of South Carolina moved the Committee to rise, and

						<p>A Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, gave us

							Monday the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February at 1/2 past six
							o’clock, in the evening. He has passed away, like a delightful vision,
							and leaves a memory of blighted hopes, and blasted prospects, for which
							there is no consolation, to his <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">bereaved
								parents</persRef>, or to me, but in that resignation, for which I
							supplicate our Father in Heaven for them, for <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my partner in Life</persRef> and for
							myself— <persRef ref="healy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Healey</persRef> was here again this morning, and spoke of his
							desire, to be employed to paint the Picture, intended to supply a panel
							in the Rotunda of the Capitol, which has failed by the death of <persRef
								ref="inman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Inman</persRef>—
							He said he had since he last spoke to me on this subject, reflected
							much, upon the selection of a subject, and the more he had thought of
							it, the more confirmed he had found himself in the opinion that the
							Congress at New-York, of 1765, was the best that could be chosen— I
							renewed my promise to do what I could, to obtain this work for him—but
							shortly afterwards, on attending at the House of Representatives, I
							found that this purpose also, was destined to be disappointed— <persRef
								ref="stephens-alexander">Alexander H. Stephens</persRef> offered a
							Resolution, calling on the <persRef ref="french-benjamin">Clerk of the
								House</persRef>, for the reasons of the delay in delivering the
							remaining Copies, of <persRef ref="fremont-john">Capt
								Fremont’s</persRef> Report. <persRef ref="rathbun-george">George
								Rathbun</persRef> of New-York, presented Resolutions of the
							Legislature of that State, against any increase in the rates of Postage—
							Among the Resolutions presented was one by <persRef ref="smith-caleb"
								>Caleb. B. Smith</persRef>, of Indiana, from the Committee on
							Foreign Affairs, calling on the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>President</persRef>, for Documents, relating to the payment, of the
							fourth and fifth instalments of the Mexican indemnity—which have been
							paid but not received.— <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett
								Davis</persRef> of Kentucky, from the same Committee made an adverse
							Report, on the Petition of <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander.
								H. Everrett</persRef> for extra allowances, upon his accounts, in
								<pb n="425" type="ms"/>his Mission to Spain. <persRef
								ref="henley-thomas">Thomas. J. Henry</persRef> of Indiana, from the
							Committee on Patents, reported a Bill, to enlarge the Powers, of the
								<persRef ref="hand-jw">Chief Clerk of the Patent Office</persRef>,
							which was passed— <persRef ref="campbell-william3">William. W.
								Campbell</persRef>, of New York, from the Joint Committee on the
							Library, reported a Resolution instructing that Committee, to inquire
							into the present condition, of the Painting, ordered to be painted, by
							the late Henry Inman, and if found unfinished, authorising and requiring
							the Committee, to have it finished, at an expense, not exceeding the
							original appropriation— Campbell moved for the immediate passage of the
							Resolution, but <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, moved its referrence to the Committee of the
							whole— A Debate arose, in which, I suggested, the expediency, of
							referring to the Committee the inquiry, whether another Artist, should
							be employed, instead, of procuring a Picture, commenced by one Artist
							and finished by another, which I believed, would necessarily result in a
							signal failure— After considerable discussion the whole subject, was at
							the motion of <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef>, referred back to the Joint Committee on the
							Library— The Pension Appropriation Bill, was then resumed for
							consideration, in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
								<persRef ref="brodhead-richard">Richard Brodhead</persRef> in the
							Chair, which was debated, tediously, until <persRef ref="tibbatts-john"
								>Tibbatts</persRef> offered, an additional Section, providing that
							no Widow whose husband was pensioned at the time of his decease, should
							be required to furnish further evidence of the husband’s service, nor
							any evidence, in the possession of the <unclear>Government</unclear>
							itself— A similar proposition had been yesterday ruled by the Chairman
							Out of Order—it was now modified, so that the Chairman pronounced it in
							order— <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Reuben Chapman</persRef> of
							Alabama, appealed from this decision—and after further Debate, the
							question on the Appeal, was taken, the vote upon it by Tellers, 63 to
							5—no quorum. <persRef ref="jones-seaborn">Seaborn Jones</persRef> of
							Georgia moved a Call of the House. A motion for adjournment was taken by
							yeas and nays 34. to 132—a Quorum and business was recommenced but soon
							failed for want of a Quorum again. More Debate ensued— Call of the House
							agreed upon, Doors were closed before the proper time, and then opened
							again till a Resolution was adopted to take the Question. At three
							o’clock this day—and accordingly, at three o’clock the voting on the
							Amendment commenced, and after much waste of time, the Bill was reported
							to the House; the previous Question was called and without deciding it
							the House adjourned—</p>

						<p>I attended the meeting of the select Committee, upon the Smithsonian <pb

								<persRef ref="wilmot-david">Wilmot</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Owen’s Bill was further discussed. The
							Question was taken, upon my Motion to strike out the provision for the
							appointment of Professors of Agriculture and Horticulture and for the
							establishment of Teachers for normal schools, both of which however,
							were carried, by a vote, of five to two— There was in the Bill, an
							appropriation of five-thousand dollars a year, for the formation of
							Library— I moved to strike out, in this section the word five, and
							insert twenty— Believing this, better adapted, to promote and increase
							the Diffusion of knowledge among Men, than the waste of the Funds, to
							pay the expenses, of Schools for Children— A Duty, which I believe
							incumbent, upon the American People themselves, who will be disgraced by
							recurring to a Foreigner, for charges which they ought to support
							themselves— My Motion was however, rejected and the Committee, were
							prepared to report the Bill, as the majority of them have shaped it— A
							Question was however reserved for the next meeting on Friday next— We
							found the House in Session.— A report from the <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">Clerk of the House</persRef>, was received in
							answer to an inquiry yesterday made, for the cause of the delay in the
							distribution of the ten thousand, extra-copies of <persRef
								ref="fremont-john">Capt Fremonts</persRef> Report, The answer is,
							that all the Copies received by the Clerk had been distributed. Among
							the Bills, this Day reported, was one by <persRef ref="lawrence-john2"
								>J. W. Lawrence</persRef> of New York from the Committee on
							Commerce, for the relief of <persRef ref="holmes-joseph">Joseph
								Holmes</persRef>, and others, owners of the Schooner, Industry— This
							Bill, is founded on a Petition, presented by me, several years since,
							and will demand special attention from me, to carry it through— <persRef
								ref="smith-thomas11">Thomas Smith</persRef>, of Indiana, presented
							resolutions from the Legislature of that state, approving the course of
							the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef>, in relation to the
							Oregon Territory. Laid on The Table and ordered to be printed—on the
							motion of <persRef ref="daniel-john">John. R. J. Daniel</persRef> of
							North Carolina, the House went into Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef>, in the Chair,
							on Private Bills and Business. Two Bills, were reported to the House,
							and passed— Two others, one for the relief of the Heirs of <persRef
								ref="thornton-presley">Capt Presley Thornton</persRef>, and one for
							the relief of <persRef ref="jones-elizabeth2">Elizabeth Jones</persRef>,
							and other children, if any, of <persRef ref="carr-john4">John
								Kerr</persRef>; were reported, with recommendation that they should
							not pass and were rejected— The case of Capt Thornton, was one of those,
							which had been recommended to me, by M<hi rend="superscript">r. </hi><pb
								n="427" type="ms"/><persRef ref="taliaferro-john">John
								Talliaferro</persRef>, former Member from Virginia— The Claim, was,
							of the Heirs of Capt Thornton, to Commutation Pay for Military service,
							to the end of the Revolutionary War— I supported it—to the best of my
							ability, but without success— It was deemed, to be difficient, in
							evidence, of service, to the end of the War— soon after three o’clock,
							the House adjourned— On the day after the passage of the Resolution, for
							giving notice, on the Oregon Convention, <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles. J. Ingersoll</persRef>, came to my
							seat, and had some conversation with me, respecting an Amendment, which
							I had proposed to him, to insert in the resolution, and which he had
							promised to move, but had not the opportunity so to do— After he left my
							seat, <persRef ref="thomasson-william">W. P. Thomasson</persRef> of
							Kentucky, with a smile said to me, that another Member of the House on
							remarking, the conversation of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Ingersoll
							with me, had observed, that it was the meeting of <persRef
								ref="pontiuspilate">Pilate</persRef> and <persRef ref="herodantipas"
								>Herod</persRef>— I said that this was not very complimentary, but
							that if it was intended as a censure upon me, for inconsistency, I would
							answer as <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> had done before
							me, upon his reconcilliation after the death of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, with some of the Loco-foco
							tribunes with whom he had long been in violent opposition and hostility,
							that I would wish my enemies to be transient, and my friendships to be
							eternal— Thomasson was much amused at this answer and circulated it
							freely in whispers, around the House—</p>

						<p>I called this morning, at the Bank of the Metropolis, where it was

							and <persRef ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale Owen</persRef>, of Indiana,
							presented Resolutions, of those States, respectively— <persRef

							to negotiate with Spain, for the purchase of the Island of Cuba, upon

							withdrew These are mere explosive effusions of the Spirit of
							aggrandizement, which has taken possession, of this People—and which
							will hereafter characterize their History— The North American Continent,
							and the Archipeligo of Islands, separating them from the southern Island
							must and will, in no great distance of time, form component parts, of
							this great Confederated, Anglo Saxon Republic. The House then proceeded,

							Committee of the Whole <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett
								Davis</persRef> of Kentucky, in the Chair, and others reported to

								<persRef ref="anderson-john2">John Anderson</persRef>, of Missouri,
							during the Debate upon which, on the third reading, the House adjourned

								ref="billings-moses">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Billings</persRef>, the Painter from Erie, Pennsylvania, for my

						<p>At the Unitarian Church I heard, the <persRef ref="dewey-orville">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Orvil
								Dewey</persRef> of New-York, morning and evening— His morning Sermon
							was from Hebrews. 9.27—part of the verse—[“]It is appointed unto men
							once to die” It was a Discourse upon death— A subject, always deeply
							affecting, but at this time, to me, more than usual— The Sermon however,
							took a view of death, rather philosophical, than sensitive. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Dewey, maintained that death, was not to
							be considered in a scriptural sense, as a penalty—that the words
								<unclear>. . .</unclear>
							<pb n="429" type="ms"/>in the text are it is “appointed unto men once to
							die” which he said did not apply, a penalty—but he omitted the remaining
							words of the text “But after this the Judgment” which seemed to imply a
							penalty, or certainly, a heavy responsibility— He said there were three
							periods, incidental, to the life, of Man, in the Christian dispensation,
							Baptism, Marriage, and Burial, neither of which necessarily imputed
							punishment— I did not entirely comprehend, the drift of his Argument,
							but so far as I did, it seemed to lean, towards the Universalist Creed,
							without explicitly avowing it— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull
								Adams</persRef>, dined with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>.— After dinner at Saint Johns Church, <persRef
								ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne</persRef>,
							read the evening service for Sextuagesima Sunday, and preached, from 2
							Corinthians, 5.4—“For we, that are in this Tabernacle, do groan, being
							burdened”—part of the verse— A general Discourse, rather gloomy in its
							character, upon the numerous burdens, of human Life— In the evening, at
							seven o’clock, D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Dewey, preached again,
							from the closing part of Revelation 2.10. “Be then faithful, unto death
							and I will give thee, a Crown of Life”— A text from which, about forty
							years ago, I heard a funeral Discourse, by <persRef
								ref="willard-joseph2">President Joseph Willard</persRef> of Harvard
							University, upon the death of <persRef ref="howard-simeon">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Howard</persRef> of Boston. D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Dewey
							did not treat it however, as a funeral Discourse— He commenced by some
							general reflections, upon the natural and universal desire, of Men, for
							distinction, and observed, that according to the common ideas of
							mankind, a Crown, was the most exalted emblem of distinction, that could
							be bestowed; and he maintained, that the pursuit of distinction, was
							very generally attempted, by the description; of glorious deeds, but
							that it could only be deserved, by the practise, of virtue, which was in
							the power of Men of all degrees and conditions—that it was a common and
							very erroneous idea, that eminent virtue, could only be obtained and
							manifested, by persons, in eminent station, of wealth, or power. But
							that virtue of the purest character, and deserving of the brightest
							Crown, was within the capacity, of every human being, in whatever
							condition of Life, they may be placed; and he said he had known, an
							instance of a man in the humblest condition of Human Society, whose
							life, had been distinguished, as a pattern, of the most exemplary
							virtue, which consisted, not <pb n="430" type="ms"/>merely, in admiring,
							and extolling but in performing, virtuous deeds— This is excellent, but
							not very profound morality— It is remarkable, that in the English Bible,
							the word virtue, is not to be found— Wisdom, righteousness, and
							Obedience, to the Will of God, are the words used in scripture to
							signify, what in the Roman language, was called virtue— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Dewey’s evening Discourse, interested,
							and affected me, more deeply, than that of the morning— The House full,
							both morning and evening.</p>

							to 10.— I voted against it, believing that it will sleep, in the Senate,
							or be returned to the House, with an Amendment, touching, the
							constructive pay of the Members of the House, which will be sure to
							demolish the Bill— It is the constant practise, of many members of the
							House, to absent themselves, without leave, for days, weeks, and
							sometimes months, and yet receiving pay, as if they attended regularly
							every day of the Session, and this is the Body of economists, so
							severely prohibiting <unclear>that</unclear> constructive pay, to

							moved to go into Committee of the whole, to take up Bills, on the

						<p>In the Hall of the House of Representatives, Divine Service, was

									rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Orvil
								Dewey</persRef>, who preached, from 2. Samuel 12.5. “And <persRef
								ref="david">David’s</persRef> anger, was greatly kindled, against
							the man, and he said to <persRef ref="nathan">Nathan</persRef>, as the
							Lord, livith, the man that hath done this thing, shall surely die 6. And
							he shall restore the Lamb, four fold, because he did this thing, and
							because he had no pity. 7. And Nathan said to David, Thou, art, the
							man.”— The Discourse, was a running commentary, of this most memorable
							story, of David’s transgressions, in relation, to<space/>the
							Hiti<space/>and of all the, admirable lessons of morals, so thickly
							sown, throughout, the Holy Scriptures, there is none, more awful, and
							impressive;—none which exhibits, in such burning characters, the
							frailty, and perversity, of the human heart— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Dewey presented, in glowing characters, the transcendant
							virtues, and gigantic intellect, of the Man, after God’s own heart, of
							the Author of the Psalms, inspiration a part, the most sublime,
							compositions, of piety, virtue, and devotion, that ever emanated, from
							the mind of Man, contrasted, with the baseness, the meanness, the
							hypocrisy, the cruelty of this succession of conduct, and exhibiting,
							the lamentable, infirmities, of the most exalted, of the Human race— It
							was a saddening and melancholy, and I may hope instructive Lesson— In
							the afternoon, at Saint John’s Church, <persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the evening
							service, for the Sunday, before Lent, and preached, from 1. Corinthians,
							13.6—“Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth, in the truth” a fragment
							of a sentence, not even indicating who it is that rejoiceth, but he told
							us it was Charity—and briefly expounded, that noble description of
							Charity, so happily characterized in the context of the Chapter—
							Returning home, from Church, I walked, with <persRef ref="dix-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> John. A. Dix</persRef>, now a Member
							of the Senate, from the State of New-York, <pb n="440" type="ms"/>who
							came in, and sat with me about half an hour, in conversation, on the
							present state, of our Public Affairs, and the recent news, from Europe—
							In the evening at the Unitarian Church, I heard D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Dewey, again preach from Mark, 16.16. “He that believeth,
							and is baptised, shall be saved, and he that believeth not, shall be
							condemned,” So he read the text—the word in which is damned— He said
							that as this word had become exceptionable in consequence of its abuse
							sometimes, in profane language, he substituted, the word condemned,
							which was the meaning of the word in the original— The word baptized
							also in this text, he said meant, an open profession of Christianity—
							The Sermon, was a dissertation <unclear>upon</unclear> faith and an
							ingenious argument, to exhibit the reasons, why the Gospel, ascribes, so
							transcendent a power to belief, for accomplishing the Salvation of
							Man—</p>

						<p>The birthday of <persRef ref="washington-george">President
								Washington</persRef>, is usually celebrated on the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February— His real birthday having
							been on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February 1733, old
							style or according to the Julien calendar— The computation of that
							Calendar is still observed in Russia, and there is now, twelve days of
							difference, between that and the Gregorian Calendar, according to which,
							this is the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> day of February, at this
							time— But the change of Calendar having been made, in the British
							Dominions, by an Act of Parliament, in 1752, after that time, so long as
							Washington lived, and until the year 1800. the difference between the
							two Calendars, was only 11. days. By the reform of the Calendar that
							year 1800, was not a Bisextile, by the Julien Calendar it was, and thus
							added one day more, to the difference between the two— The practise of
							keeping Washington’s birthday, as a festival, having commenced, before
							his death, had fixed it, on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>, and
							has been continued on that day, hitherto, during the present Century,
							though it should now be kept on the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>—
							This has been affected, for the present year, only because the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> came on a Sunday.— The same Chronological
							rule, applies to <persRef key="adams-john">my Father’s</persRef> Birth
							day, which was the 19. October, 1735. His family and friends, observed
							it, even after the commencement of the present Century, on the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> October—<unclear>by accor</unclear>ding
							to <pb n="441" type="ms"/>the reformed Calender, it should be on the
								31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> The House of Representatives on
							Saturday adjourned over this day, in honor to the memory of Washington—
							The Senate, had adjourned, from last Thursday, to this day, when they
							merely met, and again adjourned till tomorrow— I spent this morning,
							with my Grand daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef>, in
							partly retrieving, the arrears of this Journal—and about three o’clock,
							walked to the Office of the National Intelligencer, to procure the paper
							of the day, which had not been left at our house, this morning— We had
							no interruption of visitors, and beguiled the time in the evening, by
							reading the European News, brought, by the Steamer Cambria, which
							arrived at Boston last Wednesday— By the same vessel I received a
							Speech, in pamphlet of <persRef ref="thiers-marie">M. Thiers</persRef>
							in the French House of Deputies, addressed to me, by <persRef
								ref="king-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> William. R.
								King</persRef>, Minister of the United States, in France, at this
							time— <persRef ref="dix-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Dix</persRef>, the Senator from the State of New-York, had also sent
							me, the [“]Courrier des Etats-Unis,” of the 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> July 1845.— which contains a Speech of the French minister
							of Foreign Affairs, <persRef ref="guizot-francois">M. Guizot</persRef>,
							to the House of Deputies, in June last—explaining, his system of Policy,
							and the principles, upon which the Government of France and Great
							Britain, have interfered, in the Affairs of the American Continents, and
							especially to prevent the annexation of Texas, to this Union— <persRef
								ref="polk-james">President Polk</persRef>, in his Message, at the
							commencement, of the present Session of Congress, complained, of this
							interference, on the part of France, and boasted, that the measure had
							been accomplished, in spite of it— M. Guizot’s system, openly avows,
							that France, has an interest, and a right to hold the balance of power,
							between the three, Great Powers of the American Hemisphere—the United
							States, England, and the States of Spanish origin, and he maintains that
							it is the interest of France to support, an equilibrium between them— To
							this system of Policy, the People of this Union cannot assent, and M.
							Thiers in his speech, of 20. January last, assails it, as a total
							departure from the ancient and undeviating system, pursued as he
							asserts, towards the United States of America, by France from the period
							of the American Revolution— That Policy he says, had always been, to
							favor the aggrandizement of the United States, with referrence to great
							Britain, and yet to hold a balance between them—that Great Britain, was
							the natural, <pb n="442" type="ms"/>rival, and antagonist, of France,
							but that there never could be antagonism, of principle, or of Policy,
							between France and the United States; that it was absurd, and
							ridiculous, that there ever could be, a hostile Policy, or a rational
							fear, of the United States, on the part of France, and therefore, that
							the true policy of France was at all times, to favor the prosperity of
							the United States, and their aggrandizement in America— He thought
							therefore, that the President of the United States, had complained, not
							without reason, of this principle of equilibrium asserted by M.
							Guizot—“Gentlemen, said he, I acknowledge it to my shame, I have for a
							very long time, studied the Map of the World, and the interests,
							crossing each other upon it. Well, I declare to this House, it is the
							first time in my life, that I ever heard pronounced the words, ‘American
							equilibrium’— Never, never, to my knowledge, was it pronounced, by any
							statesman”— The report of the speech says, that this produced a
							“movement in the Chamber of Deputies”—and well it might— M. Guizot’s
							equilibrium, should produce a movement, more extensive, than the House
							of Deputies of France— M. Thiers admits, the European balance, of power,
							but denies its extension, to the American Hemisphere, and refers, to
								<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Winthrop’s</persRef> speech, at this Session of Congress, as an
							evidence, that he, in recommending an Arbitration for the settlement of
							the Oregon Question with England, did not venture to recommend a
							European Crowned Head, as the arbitrator, which he M. Thiers attributes,
							to his disgust, at M. Guizot’s system of equilibrium—</p>

						<p>At the House, the reading of the Journal, of Saturday last was dispensed

							and Portland Canal— M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Connell, moved to
							strike out, the first Section of the Bill, and sputtered a speech, of
							about 10. minutes, when his Motion was rejected.— <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Robert. B. Rhett</persRef>, moved to strike out,
							all after the enacting clause, and delivered a diatribe, against the
							whole system of internal improvements, to which, <persRef
								ref="thomasson-william">Thomasson</persRef> of Kentucky replied—
								<persRef ref="crozier-john">Crosier</persRef> of Tennessee, proposed
							an Amendment, an appropriation of $250,000. to complete the Canal; round
							the Muscle Shoals, of the Tennessee River— He complained, that the North

							Money, upon the Lakes, and that a grant, made several years ago of four
							hundred thousand Acres of Land, to the State of Alabama, to dig a Canal,
							round the Muscle Shoals, had not accomplished the object— <persRef

							made an hour speech, in favor of the Bill, animadverting to the
							composition of the Committee of Commerce, and defending them, against
							the censure of Crosier— He complained also, that the Annual Message of
							the President, had totally omitted all recommendation, not only of
							Public improvement, but even of Harbour defences.— The Committee rose,

						<p>At ten this morning, I attended again, the Convention, for promoting the
							observance of the Sabbath, at the first Presbyterian Church, on four and
							a half street— At the Meeting last evening, a Delegation, from the
							Congressional Prayer meeting, were invited, to participate, in the
							proceedings of the Convention, and several of its members, attended this
							day— There has been it seems, for several years, an Association of
							Members of Congress, who hold occasional meetings, for uniting in
							Prayer; to which, I have never been invited, and the existence of which,
							I had not till now known— The Resolutions, reported from the Meeting
							last evening, were now produced, and adopted, with certain

							twelve, the time for Meeting, at the House of Representatives, I was
							obliged to leave, the Chair of the Convention, and repair to the House—

							Chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs, reported a Bill, to reduce

							improvements, a separate vote of the House, may be taken, upon each item
							separately— <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatt’s</persRef> moved to

						<p>At ten o’clock this morning, I attended a Meeting of the Select Committee

							the order, adopted at the last meeting had prepared a Report, to be
							submitted with the Bill, to the House— It contained a statement, of the
							embezzlement of the Fund, by investing it in the stocks of the states of
							Arkansas, Illinois, and Michigan— I had moved, to have this statement
							made and provided for in the Bill—but excepting M<hi rend="superscript"

							an expression of the opinion of the Committee, that there would be, no

							could not honestly avow— It was accordingly struck out—leaving a bare

							was directed, in presenting the Report, and Bill, to move that they
							should be printed, and made the special order of the Day, for the second
							Tuesday, in April— The Committees upon this subject, of the House, have

							opinion, with regard to the future management of the Fund— I doubt, if
							there will be more harmony in the House, for never was there, a
							benevolent and charitable purpose, more unfortunately endowed, than that
							of <persRef ref="smithson-james">James Smithson</persRef>, intrusted, to
							the good faith, and intelligence, of the North American Congress—</p>
						<p>In the House, <persRef ref="chipman-john">John S. Chipman</persRef> of
							Michigan, a member of the Committee of Elections, moved to take up their
							Reports, upon the New Jersey contested election— The House preferred to
							go, into Committee of the whole, on Private Bills, by virtue of the rule
							that on the first and fourth Friday, of each month, this being the
							fourth, the calendar of Private Bills, shall be called over, and those
							to the passage of which no objection is made, shall be first considered,
							and disposed of— Thirteen Bills were thus reported to the House, and
							passed; and a Bill granting a Pension, to <persRef ref="crosby-orris"
								>Orris Crosby</persRef>, was objected to, by Simms, of South
							Carolina— Whereupon <persRef ref="wentworth-john2">Wentworth</persRef>
							of Illinois, if his objection should be persisted in, he would object,
							to every other Bill which should be called up— Which he accordingly did,
							till a debate arose, which finally compelled the Committee to rise—
								<persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef>, moved to
							go into Committee again—but without success— <persRef
								ref="douglas-stephen">Stephen Douglass</persRef> of Illinois,
							Chairman of the Committee on Territories, moved to go into Committee of
							the whole, on the State of the Union, upon the Oregon Territorial Bill—
							Which motion also failed— After the receipt of several Communications
							from the Executive Departments, <persRef ref="cobb-howell"
								>Cobb</persRef> of Georgia, moved to go again into Committee of the
							Whole on private Bills, but on taking the Question, there was no Quorum,
							voting, and the House adjourned— <persRef ref="rockwell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> John. A. Rockwell</persRef>, of
							Connecticut and <persRef ref="rockwell-charles">his brother</persRef>,
							an inhabitant of Norwich, passed part of the evening here—</p>

						<p>A Snow storm began last night, and continued, and violent all this day—
							At the House, <persRef ref="sims-alexander">Alexander. D. <pb n="448"
									type="ms"/>Simms</persRef>, of the fourth Congressional District
							of South Carolina, in the form of a personal explanation, assigned his
							reasons, for objecting yesterday, against the passage of the Bill, for
							the relief of <persRef ref="crosby-orris">Orris. Crosby</persRef>, which
							arrested the progress of the Committee of the whole, in clearing out the
							Private Calendar— <persRef ref="wentworth-john2">John
								Wentworth</persRef> of Illinois, who had yesterday, objected to
							every Bill, after that in favor of Crosby, and thereby, broken up the
							Committee of the Whole, made a counter explanation and an Argument for
							the Bill, in favor of Crosby. But there was no Question, before the
							House, and the two personal explanations ended in smoke— <persRef
								ref="hubard-edmund">Edmund. W. Hubard</persRef> presented
							resolutions, from the Legislature of Virginia, requiring of Congress, to
							provide by law, for the satisfaction, of all Virginia Military Land
							warrants for Revolutionary service, now unsatisfied. Referred to the
							Committee on Public Lands—numerous Reports were received from the
							Committees— <persRef ref="harper-alexander">Alexander Harper</persRef>
							of Ohio, presented resolutions of the Legislature of that state, against
							any increase, of the rights of postage— Referred to the Committee on
							Post Offices, and Post Roads— <persRef ref="owen-robert2">Robert. Dale.
								Owen</persRef>, Chairman of the Select Committee, on the Smithsonian
							Bequest, presented a Report and Bill, as a substitute of that, which he
							had introduced; and moved, that the Report be printed— That the
							substitute be referred to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
							Union, and printed separately, in the form of a Rule, and be made a
							special order of the day of the second Tuesday, in April next— A
							division of the Question was called, upon which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Owen. urged the propriety, and necessity, for the credit of
							the Country to make it a special Order, for a not distant day— The
							Resolution was carried, by a vote of more than two thirds—and the
							specific assignment, for discussing the Bill, was made. The House then
							went into Committee of the whole, on Private Business— <persRef
								ref="rathbun-george">Rathbun</persRef> of New York in the Chair— The
							Bill, granting commutation, of half pay, to the legal Representatives,
							of <persRef ref="grayson-william2">Colonel William Grayson</persRef>, of
							the Revolutionary Army, was again debated. Speeches in its favor, were
							made by <persRef ref="seddon-james">James. A. Seddon</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="bayly-thomas3">Thomas H Bayly</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="johnson-joseph">Joseph Johnson</persRef> of Virginia, and
								<persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> of Kentucky and
							against it, by <persRef ref="clark-henry3">Henry. S. Clarke</persRef>,
							of North Carolina— <persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Samuel Gordon</persRef>
							of New York moved to lay the Bill aside, to be reported to the <pb
								n="449" type="ms"/>House, with a recommendation that it do not pass—
							I moved to strike out those words, but the Chairman thought, it was
							sufficient, to strike out the word not— The Question was taken by
							Tellers, and carried 64 to 60— The Bill was reported accordingly, and
							the House adjourned without taking the Question upon it— I rode to and
							from the Capitol on account of the snow—</p>
