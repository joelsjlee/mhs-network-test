                        <dateline>Baltimore Friday 14. August 1846.<lb/>Philadelphia— New-York—</dateline>
                        
                        <p>After a Night of calm repose, I rose at half past 4. this morning.
                            Fahrenheit 86. We breakfasted at 8 and took the train of Railway Cars
                            which started at 9. A.M. from Baltimore for Philadelphia From Barnum’s
                            hotel to the Dipot we went in a hack, then in the Cars drawn by horses
                            to the <unclear>borders</unclear> of the City, where the horses were dismissed and the
                            Locomotive took their place— At 3. P.M we reached the outskirts of
                            Philadelphia where horses again took the place of the Locomotive and
                            landed us at the depot in Market Street— Thence we proceeded to Jone’s
                            Union Hotel in Chesnut Street— There we dined at the Lady’s ordinary and
                            at half past 4. proceeded to Walnut Street Wharf and embarked in the
                            Steamer which in an hour and a half landed us at Bristol— There we
                            entered the train of Cars and passing through Trenton, Princeton, New
                            Brunswick, Rahway, and Elizabeth Town and Newark at 9 in the Evening,
                            brought us to Jersey City safe— We crossed the ferry and taking a hack
                            at the fort of Cortland Street at 9.45 reached the Astor House New York.
                            The transportation of this day from Baltimore to New York was but a
                            trivial incident now common to hundreds every day in the year, and many
                            days to thousands— I met on the way—Sundry fellow travellers with whom I
                            had previous slightly remembered or forgotten acquaintance— The only
                            remarkable one of which was the late Vice President of the United States
                                <hi rend="strikethrough">John</hi> acting and self styled President
                            of the United States John Tyler and his eldest son Robert— Civilities
                            very polite but on my part cool passed between us— We had two German
                            women with harps who played and sung popular songs accompanied by a Male
                            Clarion, and made delightful music and pleasant pastime—</p>

                        <p>V. I rose after a good night at 5. Breakfasted at 6.15. Left the Astor
                            house at 6.45. Crossed the battery ferry at 7. Took the Long Island
                            train of Railway Cars from Brooklyn to Greenport 95 miles. Straggely
                            barren strand all the way— Almost suffocated with dust. embarked at 11

                            Worcester. Then through Framingham Natick, Newton, Brighton, to Boston
                            where just before 6 P.M. we alighted at the United States Hotel
                            immediately opposite the Rail road Depot— Tea at the United States
                            Hotel— At 1/2 past 7. the train of Cars of the Old Colony Railroad
                            start— My Son was at the depot to meet us with his Son John Quincy— Both
                            of them came out with us; as did Ex President of Harvard University
                            Josiah Quincy—and Captain Dimmock a new resident of the town— The
                            Stations where the Cars stop are at Savan Hill, Dorchester, Neponset,
                            and Quincy each of which was announced by the Conductor as the Cars
                            reached the Station— At the Depot at Quincy there was a considerable
                            assemblage of persons, to whom as we alighted Captain Dimmock announced
                            with a loud voice the arrival home of John Quincy Adams Representative

                            Massachusetts, whereupon there was a shout of three cheers. I apologized
                            for not returning thanks, in a speech by the extinction of my voice— Our
                            Carriage took us from the Depot home, where we found my Son’s wife with
                            her two sons Charles and Henry to receive us— margaret Delany the

                        <p>V. Blessing, praise and supplication to God on first rising from bed, on
                            returning to my earthly home, after an absence of nine months in the
                            public service of my Country— Some discouragement of Soul follows the
                            reflection, that my aspirations to live in the memory, of after ages, as
                            a benefactor to my Country, and of mankind, have not received the
                            sanction of my Maker— That the longing, of my Soul through a long life,
                            to be numbered among the blessings bestowed by the Creator on the race
                            of man is rejected, and after being trammelled and counteracted and
                            disabled, at every step of my progress my faculties are now declining
                            from day to day into mere helpless impotence— Yet—at the will of my
                            heavenly Father why should I repine? D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John Pierce
                            of Brookline preached at the Stone Temple this day by exchange with the
                                Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt His morning
                            Sermon was from Deuteronomy— 1—21— “Behold the Lord thy God hath set the
                            land before thee; go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers
                            hath said unto thee, fear not, neither be discouraged”— D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r.</hi> Pierce was not thinking of Texas, Mexico, or Oregon, but of
                            the Reports of Caleb and Joshua on returning from their exploration of
                            the Land of Canaan and of the heavenly land set before the Christian of
                            the present age for his exploration and possession All his applications
                            to our times were spiritual— D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pierce dined with
                            us— His afternoon Discourse was from Acts 11.26—“And the disciples were
                            called Christians first in Antioch” This is an incident of historical
                            fact very curious, and interesting upon which the commentary might have
                            been broader and deeper D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pierce is of the salt of
                            the earth— I commenced reading the Book of Proverbs and with a view to
                            go through the remainder of the Bible by the close of the present year I
                            propose to read henceforth 4 chapters every day—</p>

                        <p>I return to a quiet home, and to more than voluntary repose My health
                            apparently firmer than at any time within the last fifteen months, but
                            shaking more and more. I rose with coming daylight but the sky was
                            beclouded, and I could get neither a first sight of Sirius nor of the
                            rising Sun— The first thing that riveted my attention to the progress of
                            civilization and Society in my native Village was the rush by my windows
                            of the train of Cars from Boston to Plymouth at 5.45. followed at 6.45
                            by the return train from Plymouth to Boston— I was all day thinking of a
                            fixed steady specific occupation for the Season during the recess of
                            Congress— I had an unexpected but only momentary morning visit from
                            William. Clarkson. Johnson, from Utica, New York where he says he has
                            opened a Lawyer’s Office, and has as much business as he can do— My only
                            excursion this day was about sunset when I walked up to my Son’s House
                            where I found them at tea—He went to bathe at Daniel Greenleaf’s landing
                            and his wife came to my house with me— My wife was quite ill and almost
                            the whole day confined to her bed. My Cousin Louisa Catherine Smith came
                            out from Boston to spend the Summer with us— Evening visit from Ex
                            President Josiah Quincy, who left me an invitation from his Son Mayor of
                            Boston to attend at the breaking ground of the Aqueduct at Long Pond
                            next Thursday— Also an invitation from William D. Parker, Loring
                            Norcross and James Whitney Subcommittee of the City Council to the same
                            celebration I have received also an invitation from the President of
                            Harvard University M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Everett to the Commencement
                            on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month— I have also a printed
                            Circular from William Mitchell President of the Trustees of the
                            Nantucket Athenaeum, 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> mo. 12 1846. soliciting

                        <p>The expectation of leisure is a delusion— I received by mail a Letter
                            from Oscar F. Keeler Columbus Mississippi Aug<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> 6.
                            1846. with the fragments of a small glass vial encased in a tin cylinder
                            open at both ends and crushed out of shape; under a paper cover torn
                            into pieces, which had been sealed and addressed Hon John Quincy Adams
                            Quincy; Mass. Glass with care— Postmarked Columbus Mississippi—6 August,
                            and under the words glass with care— Broken on its way from Columbus
                            Miss to Montgomery Al.— The Letter was rolled round the cylinder and as
                            well as the paper cover, is stained all over with the cordial that was
                            in the vial, and is of claret colour— But the Letter itself is in
                            handsome hand writing and not at all defaced— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            Keeler says the cordial is a vegetable compound of his own invention,
                            which has cured him of bleeding at the lungs and may others of asthma,
                            bronchitis, and sundry other complaints— That he wishes to make money of
                            it, and sends me a specimen to try, and write him my opinion of it—
                            Harvey Field came to trade with me in land for which I shall refer him
                            to my Son— William. C. Johnson’s was a visit of reconsideration but was
                            as short as that of yesterday—he would not stay to dine— M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>I took yesterday morning a seidlitz powder, which put me on the sick list
                            for the day, which continues this day of transition from intense dog day
                            heat to Autumnal frigidity— I received a diploma in the Latin Language
                            from the Societas Philozetiana of the College of the Western<space/>at
                            Hudson in the Republic of Ohio constituting me an honorary member of

                            of my friendly regard for such institutions— There is a large Seal
                            appended to a blue silk ribband to this diploma which is signed by R. O.
                            Hammond Scribe, but is not signed by the President of the Society— What
                            the Societas Philozetiana is I am not advised and do not understand the
                            etymology of the word—Philozetiana— Afternoon visit from Peter P. F.

                        <p>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they
                            both are abomination to the Lord.</p>
                        <p>—Proverbs 17.15.</p>
                        <p>At eight oclock this morning I walked to the Quincy Station depot of the
                            Old Colony Railroad where I met my Son— Took my Seat in the train of
                            cars which then came in from South Braintree for Boston—25 cents a
                            ticket— Josiah Quincy late President of Harvard University and his Son
                            in Law Waterston were also in the Cars— There are three Stations on the
                            way—Neponset, just beyond the river. Dorchester, and Savin hill— We
                            reached the depot opposite the United States Hotel about 8.45. I walked
                            with M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Quincy and M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            Waterston to the house where M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Waterston now
                            resides in ——— street. Here I passed an hour, chiefly inspecting an
                            Album sent from England by M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Coleman, the jewel of
                            which was an original Letter from Edmund Burke to Sir William Hamilton
                            at Naples. How the hour passed away I know not but a quarter before ten
                            we walked to the depot of the Providence Railroad and found there Josiah
                            Quincy junior Mayor, and the City Council of Boston with whom I went to
                            Long Pond in Wayland to break ground for the construction of an Aqueduct
                            to the City of Boston— This ceremony of striking the spade foot into the
                            ground was performed by the Mayor after a short address to him from
                            Nathan Hale in the name of the Water Commissioners and a handsome speech
                            of about ten minutes from him— He threw up the first shovel full of
                            earth and then with a compliment invited me to strike the second which I
                            did and his father 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Passed Mayor of Boston struck
                            the third. The spade had been made for the occasion and had on its
                            handle a Silver inscription recording in advance the transaction— The
                            company then repaired to a temporary Shed a tabernacle at hand and sat
                            down to the number of about 300. to a temperance cold collation at which
                            the Mayor presided— The company then returned in the cars to Boston just
                            in time for me to take the Cars of the Old Colony Railroad at 5. P.M.
                            for Quincy. I alighted with my neighbor M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Emmons,
                            at the Bridge close to my remaining barn, and found my dear wife ill in
                            bed— Charles came home in the 7. oclock train, and with his wife passed
                            an hour of the Evening here— My health continues to promise<space/>, but my
                            Memory, where is it?</p>

                            called Long Pond to break ground for the construction of an Aqueduct, to
                            furnish Boston with water. I drank a glass of the water on the border of
                            the pond drawn from 20 feet beneath the surface, fresh, cool, pure and
                            soft as I ever tasted. I received a small duodecimo volume entitled
                            Norman’s New Orleans and Environs, containing a brief historical sketch
                            of the Territory and State of Louisiana from the earliest period to the

                            the City, pictorial illustrations of public buildings in New
                            Orleans—published by B. M. Norman. 1845— Degrand sent me out from Boston
                            Wilmer and Smiths Liverpool European Times of the<space/>inst, containing a
                            voluminous account of the visit of Prince Albert, the Queen of Great
                            Britain and Ireland’s husband to Liverpool to lay the corner stone of a
                            building to be called the Sailors home not a hospital, but a boarding
                            and lodging house for Seamen— I slipped through the hours from Breakfast
                            at 8 till Noon, in reading the narrative of this princely pageant—
                            Degrand sent me also, a Map shewing the proposed Railroads from
                            Bridgewater to the Old Colony Railroad, extracted from Bordens State
                            Map. By T. J. Carter Engineer— Towards Sunset I walked out and visited

                        <p>Morning visitors— D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Woodward— The Holbrooks are
                            sons of Ichabod Holbrook a Lieutenant in the Army of the revolutionary
                            War, a pensioner under the Act of 1818, till he died in 1823— These are
                            his children, claimants. The two Holbrooks, Howard in the right of his
                            wife Hannah, a sister of the Holbrooks, and another sister named
                            Elizabeth Kennedy—there was another sister named Relief Ryan, who died
                            since last November when they applied to me before. See my Diary for 25
                            November 1845. Vol. 19. p. 310. But I could tell them nothing of the
                            state of their claim not knowing where to look for their papers— I found
                            however a Letter from Nathaniel Holbrook, Randolph 6. January 1846. with
                            enquiries concerning his claim in right of his father Nathaniel Holbrook
                            who he says drew a pension from 1818, to June 1845, when he died— These
                            are two distinct claims— Walter Hall was here with lobsters. I took one
                            for eight cents— My wife is convalescent and was up part of this day— I
                            began an attempt for a general<hi rend="strikethrough">l</hi> assortment
                            of my papers which are in a Chaos of confusion, and which I would fain
                            put in order for my Execution— They embrace a period of seventy years,
                            besides those of my father which extend to twenty years more— This
                            movement must be systematic, continuous, and persevering, and includes
                            the making of my last Will, to supersede that of 14<hi rend="superscript"

                            both in my family and my property— Relying on divine Mercy for the
                            continuance of my life, and health I propose to postpone the makings of
                            my Will till next Summer, and to avail myself of this Season to set my
                            house in order— Charles and his wife spent their Evening hour here—</p>

                            from 2 Peter 1.3. “According us his divine power hath given unto us all
                            things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
                            him that hath called us to glory and virtue” This was a good Sermon,
                            upon the ordinary tune of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt’s compositions
                            never coming down to the level of mediocrity; and never of faltering
                            interest but the discourse of this afternoon from John 14.16. “And I
                            will pray the Father, and he shall give you, another Comforter, that he
                            may abide with you forever 17. Even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
                            cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him: but ye know
                            him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you”—was transcendant and
                            one of the remarkable discourses that I ever heard He began with a brief
                            historical narrative of the festival days celebrated by the Roman
                            Catholic and English Episcopal churches—Christmas—Easter—Ascension day,
                            and Pentecost, or Whitsunday, when the Holy Ghost descended upon the
                            Apostles— He did not approve of the annual celebration of these days,
                            thinking it tended to superstition, and preferring the simplicity of the
                            puritan worship; but he described with glowing eloquence the
                            transformation of the Apostles in the fifty days between the day of the
                            Crucifixion and the day of the descent of the Holy Ghost—and his
                            application of the subject to the duties of the Auditory was highly
                            solemn and impressive— As I came out of Meeting this afternoon M<hi

                            the exercises of Commencement, at Harvard University— Had the weather
                            been fair or indifferent my purpose was to go— But on rising at four
                            oclock, I found the rain, which commenced last Evening still continued
                            with a northeast wind— At seven, notwithstanding the rain, I walked to
                            the Depot, but the train was gone, twenty minutes before, and the next
                            train went at six minutes past eight, too late for me— At nine, came the
                            mail, and brought a rattle from Christopher Hughes, written yesterday
                            morning at the United States Hotel—Boston— I spent the whole morning in
                            examining the condition of my papers, with the purpose of assorting
                            them, and found them in confusion inexpressible— I have to devise even a
                            principle of arrangement for them— I had received on the 17<hi

                            next Winter, before that Society— The disorder of my correspondence is
                            the unfailing test of my<space/>— This Letter has remained, on my file,
                            unanswered, till this afternoon— I now of course decline the invitation,
                            not knowing what a day may bring forth— I received a Pamphlet copy of

                            North Carolina, under a cover directed by himself, but I did not find
                            time to read it— Charles and his wife spent an evening hour with us— My

                            convention for the District of Columbia held at Washington last December

                            at New York, an account of its proceedings, together with a Treatise of
                            Sir Matthew Hale and the opinions of other eminent laymen concerning the
                            Bible and the observance of the Sabbath. He requested a copy of my
                            address to that Convention which was very brief and extemporaneous. But
                            a Reporter for the Baltimore Sun had asked of me a copy of it for
                            publication in that paper— I wrote it out the next morning and gave it
                            to the Reporter who kept it, but it was not published in the Sun, nor at
                            all— There is no other copy of it extant, and it has faded irrecoverably

                            with his family at breakfast— Wild Jonathan of Braintree, came for a

                            who said he had been about a year in this Country, and expected to
                            return next Summer to Wales— His only object in his visit was curiosity

                            text of his afternoon discourse was John 4.48—“Then, said Jesus unto him
                            Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe”— The morning was of
                            high Summer heat, with clouds gathering for a thunder shower, which came
                            on immediately after I returned home from Meeting— I found P. P. F.
                            Degrand, at my house and afterwards visitors from Boston, M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> George Alexander Otis, with his daughter, now
                            named M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Meade, and her mother M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >rs.</hi> Hickman— They are now residents at Richmond Virginia, and
                            he says they have the charge of a very extensive establishment for the
                            education of females and have 150 pupils under their care M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Otis spoke to me of his translation of Cicero’s
                            Offices—and of D’Olivet’s french translation of the Dialogue de Natura
                            Deorum, which I lent him and which he has returned— We had some
                            conversation also about Socrates: and the Republic, the Laws and the
                            Dialogues of Plato— These visits arrested the progress of my reading of
                            the life of Emanuel Swedenborg Charles and his wife passed the Evening
                            here— And Degrand returned late to Boston—</p>

                        <p>“For Battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in
                            blood; but this shall be with burning and<space/>of fire</p>
                        <p>Isaiah 9.5.—</p>
                        <p>This verse immediately precedes the passage understood to announce the
                            advent of the Saviour— “For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is
                            given: and the Government shall be upon his shoulders, and his name
                            shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting
                            Father, the Prince of Peace— 7 Of the increase of his government and
                            peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his
                            Kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice
                            from henceforth even forever— The zeal of the Lord will perform this[”]—
                            In the Septuagint there is neither Wonderful nor mighty God, nor
                            everlasting Father, nor Prince of Peace— The thought as expressed by
                            Charles Thomson in his translation of the Septuagint had not a trace of
                            the prophecy contained in this passage—and the translation by Lo<space/>is
                            totally different from both— The Summer heat still disqualifies me for
                            the labour of assorting my papers and for reading with any settled
                            purpose— My only visitor besides an Italian vagabond, <hi

                            after the excursion to see the rising Sun, I kept my chamber till
                            between five and six. P.M when I took to the Post Office, my answer to
                            the Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Charles Sumner—a young man of
                            whom I earnestly hope that he will contribute largely to redeem the
                            Spirit of the free people of this Union from the dastardly Servility to
                            the slave mongrel oligarchy into which they have insensibly and almost
                            unconsciously fallen— <hi rend="strikethrough">Revolutionary</hi>
                            Returning home I stopped at the new Eastern porch of my Son’s house—but
                            neither he nor his wife was at home, but they spent the hour from 8 till
