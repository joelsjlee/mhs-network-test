						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Heman Lincoln</persRef>. He has been here for some
							weeks as Agent, for the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions; and is in
							frequent communication with the Indian Division of the War Department
							here concerning the relations between our Government and the Indian
							Tribes and there is a constant interposition of this Association, in the
							negotiation and execution of their Treaties with the United States— He
							told me a long story, of Treaties made in the years 1835. and 36. with
							the Ottoway and Chippeway Tribes, and the discordant movements between
							the Baptist Missionary on that station and Roman Catholic Priests, in
							competition with them for the conversion of the Tribes to the Christian
							Faith;—It is a melancholy <pb n="503" type="ms"/>contemplation that
							these pious purposes, in profession common to them both, are more
							strongly marked by jealousy and hatred of each other, than by their
							success, in Christianizing the heathen Savage— More characteristic, of
							the boundless ambition of the Papal power, than of the progress, of the
							Kingdom of Christ upon Earth— At the House, <persRef ref="mchenry-john"
								>John. H M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Henry,</persRef> asked leave
							to give notice, of a long complicated and quite useless, addition to the
							rules, for, proceedings in Committee of the whole to which objection
							being made, he moved to suspend the rules, to enable him to give the
							notice; which the House refused, At <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole’s</persRef> motion, the House went into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="daniel-john">J. R. J.
								Daniel</persRef> of North Carolina, in the Chair, and took up, the
							Sub-Treasury Bill— Which was debated by <persRef ref="grider-henry"
								>Henry Grider</persRef> of Kentucky <persRef ref="hunt-washington"
								>Washington Hunt</persRef> of New York, and <persRef
								ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> of Kentucky against the

							Louisiana <persRef ref="sawyer-william3">W<hi rend="superscript">m.</hi>
								Sawyer</persRef> of Ohio—Daniel of North Carolina who yielded for
							the time, the Chair to <persRef ref="mcdowell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">c</hi>Dowell</persRef> of Ohio and <persRef
								ref="jones-george4">George W. Jones</persRef> of Tennessee, till at
							a quarter before five the Committee rose and after an abortive effort,
							to adjourn, till ten oclock, tomorrow, they adjourned till eleven— A
							remarkable explosion took place this day, in the Senate, upon the Oregon
							Notice Question— <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef>
							came out for 49. against <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass</persRef>,
							of Michigan, and the 54.40. men, He was replied to, with great
							bitterness by <persRef ref="hannegan-edward">Hannegan</persRef> of
							Indiana— The Administration Democrats, are splitting up into fragments—
							There is a great probability, that the Whigs will do the same, and a new
							organization of Parties, be formed on the basis, of the Oregon Question—
							Evening visits from <persRef ref="sykes-george">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Constituents from New Jersey— The debate in the House this day was so
							dull, that <pb n="504" type="ms"/>I escaped from it, and gave a sitting
							of an hour, to <persRef ref="johnson-eastman">M<hi rend="superscript"

							conformably to his contract, with me, of the 31<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> March, 1840— I should have mentioned also, that <persRef
								ref="lincoln-heman">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Heman
								Lincoln</persRef> yesterday returned to me, the Manuscript Lecture
							upon Faith which I had lent him, and of which he told me, he had taken a
							Copy, as I had given him permission to do— At the House, the reading of
							the Journal of yesterday was dispensed with, a bad practise which I
							strongly apprehend, will become a general one— They went immediately
							into Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="daniel-john">Daniel</persRef> of North Carolina in the Chair,
							and took up the Sub Treasury Bill— <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett

							commenced yesterday, and <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef>, who had introduced the Bill replied to all its

								>Barkly Martin</persRef> of Tenn in the course of which he found an

							to my vote, in favour of <persRef ref="gordon-samuel">General
								Gordon’s</persRef> Amendment offered to a Bill, in 1834, which
							Amendment he represented, as identical with the Bill now before this
							Committee— I rose, and asked him to allow me, but one moment, to explain
							my reason for that vote— But he said he could not spare it from his
							allotted 10. minutes, and after some pleasantry, I surrendered my claim,
							for liberty to explain— I had voted for Gordons Bill as an Amendment to
							one still more obnoxious, intending if the Amend<pb n="505" type="ms"
							/>ment had prevailed, finally to vote against it— This is a very common,
							but very disingenous practise, of adducing, a former vote upon an
							Amendment, as a substitute for a different provision, and concluding
							from it, that the voter is pledged in favor of the Amendment when
							substituted— At one o’clock, the time for closing the debate, came; and
							a multitude of Amendments were voted upon by the Committee, many of
							them, rejected, a few adopted, and the Bill was reported to the House—
							The previous Question was immediately started, and the Bill finally
							passed, by yeas and nays, 123. to 67— Dromgoole moved, a ridiculous
							alteration of the, title, itself as long, as a moderate sized Bill, it
							was rejected, and the title first proposed adopted, and at half past
							three, the House, adjourned— The smart and spicy debate, between
								<persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas. H Benton</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass</persRef>, in the Senate, was
							this day, continued, and concluded, leaving the Parties, precisely where

						<p>As the Spring advances, I am suffering with flying shoots of rheumatism,

							Virginia—offered a resolution, calling on the <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, for a Report
							on the pay and emoluments of the Marine Corps, which was carried by a
							suspension of the rules. <persRef ref="constable-albert">Albert

								n="506" type="ms"/>whole, and took up the Bill, to provide for the

							and Illinois— <persRef ref="wick-william">W. W. Wick</persRef> of
							Indiana, moved as an Amendment, to substitute a Bill, reported from the
							committee on Roads and Canals, granting to those several states, Land
							instead of money, to pay for the continuance of that Road.— This Bill
							with this, and sundry other Amendments, was very earnestly, and
							tediously debated, between the Western, and Southern members—till the
							Committee rose, and <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Lynn Boyd</persRef> of
							Kentucky offered a Resolution, to close the debate in Committee in half
							an hour, after it should again be taken up— <persRef ref="vinton-samuel"
								>Vinton</persRef> of Ohio moved to lay this motion upon the Table,
							but there was no quorum voting, and after two, or three, failures, of
							motions to adjourn, it was carried, about four o’clock by yeas and nays
							59 to 55— In the Senate, the War between the degrees of Latitude, in
							Oregon, was continued and <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef>, gave notice, that next Monday, he would speak, in
							defence, of his <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef>
							Treaty; against sundry collateral attacks made against it, in the Oregon

								Wilson</persRef>, came here this morning, about the Lot, adjoining,

							since, determined, not to let him have it, but he says, that in the

							had required, and had actually, sown the seeds, of vegetables, in the
							ground— Though I thought he had no right to do this, to avoid a quarrel
							with a neighbour, of all things the most odious, I told him, I would
							endeavour, to make arrangements upon which, we might agree, and he
							promised, to call again, in the course of next week— <persRef

							63. The House then went into Committee of the whole, on the Private
							Calender 79. to 36— <persRef ref="cobb-howell">Howell Cobb</persRef> of
							Georgia in the Chair— It was taken up at the point, where the Committee
							had stopped this day last week, upon which Private Bills were debated— A
							Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="culver-william">William
								Culver</persRef>, was discussed and laid aside to be reported— The

								Tustin</persRef> the Chaplain of the Senate, made the prayer and
								<persRef ref="junkin-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Junkin</persRef>, President of Lafayette College at Easton
							Pennsylvania preached, from John 3.1. “There was a man of the
							Pharis<space/>named <persRef ref="nicodemus">Nicodemus</persRef> a ruler
							of the Jews. 2. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him
							Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher, come from God, for no man can do
							these miracles that thou doest except God be with him— 3. Jesus answered
							and said unto him verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born
							again, he cannot see the King<pb n="509" type="ms"/>dom of God 4.
							Nicodemus saith unto him, how can a man be born when he is old can he
							enter the second time, into his mothers womb, and be born. 5. Jesus
							answered verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born of water
							and of the Spirit, he cannot enter, into the Kingdom of God. 6. That
							which is born of the Flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
							Spirit, is Spirit. 7. marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born
							again. 8. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
							thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth, so is
							every one that is born of the Spirit 9. Nicodemus answered an said unto
							him, how can these things be— 10. Jesus answered and said unto him, art
							thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things.” This text
							comprises the whole Roman Catholic and Calvanistic—doctrine of
							re-generation— A creed, upon which the most rigorous reformer from
							Popery, did not separate from the Church of Rome. It is the most
							mysterious of all the Doctrines of Christianity, though, if illustrated,
							by the exclamation of being born of water that is, by baptism &amp; of
							the Spirit, and by the figurative exposition of the blowing of the wind,
							I understand as meaning by the Kingdom of God, nothing more than Faith
							in the Divine Mission of Jesus Christ, and obedience to his commands—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Junkin’s exposition was more
							comprehensive and included much of the metaphysics of <persRef
								ref="calvin-john">Calvin</persRef>— After dinner I attended at the
							2. Presbyterian Church, where <persRef ref="smith-matthew">M<hi

								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith gave notice that there would
							be a third Service, at 7 o’clock this evening, at that Church, and that
							his Sermon of next Sunday afternoon, would be addressed to young women.

						<p>I have been, several days, occupying my Leisure, in answering a Letter
							from <persRef ref="sturge-joseph">Joseph Sturge</persRef> of Birmingham,
							in England, complaining, of my Speech, on the Oregon Question, and
							charging me, with inflaming the temper of my Countrymen, to War.— Sturge
							is a Quaker, and a leading Member of the English Abolition Society— His
							motives are good, and his character, highly respectable— I have
							therefore, disclaiming all intention to kindle War, upon this Question,
							and professing a full concurrence with him, in abhorrence, of all
							agressive War I have marked the distinction, which should be made
							between that sentiment, and the unqualified denunciation of War,
							peculiar to the Doctrines of the Society of Friends, to which I cannot
							subscribe The Question of War and Peace, is identical, with the Question
							of Right and wrong— War for the <hi rend="italic">Right</hi>, can never
							be justly blamed. War for the <hi rend="italic">Wrong</hi> can never be
							justified.— In the House, immediately after the reading of the Journal,
								<persRef ref="brinkerhoff-jacob">Jacob Brinkerhoff</persRef>, moved
							to go into Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, but

								Yancey</persRef>, against Webster, of being a pensioned Agent, of
							the Manufacturing Interest—which Winthrop had said, was not in a just

							words—“not in a just sense,” and M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Webster, now explained, the words as meaning—in every just sense, and in
							every unjust sense, and in all senses whatsoever, and he now told, the
							story of the subscription of one-hundred-thousand dollars raised, from
							certain persons, his friends, in Boston, and invested in stocks for his
							benefit. His narrative was not very clear, but amounted to this, that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Webster, had sold, certain valuable
							Western Lands at prices not exceeding their actual value, the monies for
							the payment of which, were raised, by this subscription of his friends,
							and invested by the provision of an Annuity, for life. Made without his
							sanction or knowledge, and announced to him here, last month— This
							transaction, M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Webster considers, highly
							honorable to himself, and M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Winthrop
							concurs in that opinion— Upon this explanation, Yancey, commented, with
							merciless severity, and questioned, Winthrop, till he shrunk from the

							torturing scrutiny into the private affairs of a Public Man— <persRef
								ref="brinkerhoff-jacob">Jacob Brinkerhoff</persRef> called for the

						<p>In the Hall of the House of Representatives the <persRef
								ref="barrett-benjamin">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> B. F.
								Barrett</persRef>, Pastor of the Society of the New Jerusalem in the
							City of New York, preached from Matthew 13.31. <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>Wherefore</hi> [“]Another parable put he forth unto them saying,
							the Kingdom of Heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man
							took and sowed in his field 32. Which indeed is the least of all seeds,
							but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a
							tree, so that the Birds of the Air come and lodge in the branches
							thereof.” The Sermon, was an exposition of the doctrine of regeneration,
							as understood and represented by <persRef ref="swedenborg-emanuel"
								>Emanuel Swedenborg</persRef>. He did not enlarge; upon the
							correspondences, between the material and the spiritual world, which
							form the special character of the Swedenborg creed— He said little or
							nothing, of those millions of spiritual Beings, which <persRef
								ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> in the Paradise Lost says—“Walk
							the earth, and commune with us when we wake or when we sleep.[”] These
							lines appear to be the foundation of the spiritual system of Swedenborg
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Barrett did not enlarge upon that
							part of the system. His argument was, from this Parable likening the
							Kingdom of Heaven to the growth of a mustard seed, proved that <pb
								n="521" type="ms"/>regeneration, could not be effected by a sudden,
							and instantaneous operation but must be accomplished by slow and gradual
							progress, like that of the process from the sowing of the seed, to the
							complete formation of the tree, and the ripening of the fruit borne by
							it— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Barrett was not eloquent, nor
							animated. The auditory was rather thin and <persRef
								ref="milburn-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Milburn</persRef> Chaplain of the House made the prayer— There was
							no singing— After dinner, at the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							Presbyterian Church the <persRef ref="smith-matthew">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Matthew Hale Smith</persRef>,
							preached <hi rend="strikethrough">from</hi> the second Sermon of his
							course, addressed to young women—from 1. Timothy 5–2. “Entreat the
							younger women, as sisters”— His Discourse, was plain, practical, and
							sensible;—distinguishing the virtues, and graces, peculiarly
							appropriate, to young women— The Address was earnest, affectionate and
							impressive occasionally to the drawing of tears— He gave notice, that on
							the next Sunday afternoon, his third Discourse, would be specially
							addressed to married persons— In his exhortations to young women, I
							thought they would have been more effective, if he had omitted, to
							include in his censures the reading of novels and dancing— These I
							suppose, are considered, as so inadmissible to all, Clergymen, of the
							Calvanistic Creed, that no Clergyman of that Denomination, can forbear
							to press them upon the conscience of his hearers— But the morals of the
							Age prevail so universally, over the discipline of that Church, that I
							believe it would be more profitable to the success of their Preachers,
							if they should forbear to notice them, altogether— The censorial power
							of the Church must, to have any good effect, accommodate itself
							liberally to the Spirit of the Age— I began reading this morning the 2.
							Book of <persRef ref="samuel">Samuel</persRef>, why so called I do not
							know, and think somewhat strange in as much as the death of Samuel, is
							recorded in the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter, of the first
							Book that bears his name— The 2<hi rend="superscript">nd.</hi> Book, is
							confined entirely to the History of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>
							after the death of Samuel and of <persRef ref="kingsaul">Saul</persRef>—
							The life and History of Samuel, is remarkable, as forming the link
							between the History of the Jews as a Republic and a Monarchy—</p>

						<p>I received on Saturday last, a check from the <persRef ref="davis-john8"
								>Speaker of the House</persRef>, for 500. dollars— I had left at the
							Bank of the Metropolis, on the same day, a check for the balance of my

							Washington, and received a Dividend, of 105. dollars—the Interest due on
							the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this month on the Washington
							City Corporation Stocks 6. per cent, standing there in my name— At the
							House, of Representatives, <persRef ref="martin-john">John P.
								Martin</persRef> of Kentucky moved to dispense with the reading of
							the Journal of Saturday, to take up the Mileage Bill— Motion lost and
							the Journal was read— <persRef ref="brodhead-richard">Richard
								Brodhead</persRef> of Pennsylvania, moved to discharge the Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union, from the Bill relating to

							The House went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							and took up, the Bill to protect the rights of American Settlers in the

							the same— <persRef ref="hamlin-hannibal">Hannibal Hamlin</persRef> of

							debate in which I took part—observing that if the limitation was south

							revoking the first commission, extending the Boundaries of that Colony
							to the South Sea, and establishing, the boundaries of the second (“as
							far as our Territories extend”[)]—Great Britain having in the interval,
							by Treatise with France and Spain, bounded, her Territories, on this
							Continent by the Mississippi— I presented also the diversities of
							expression in the Nootka Sound Convention, in our Convention with Great
							Britain in 1818. and 1827. to shew, that Great Britain, had not a shadow
							of right, to any exclusive Territorial Jurisdiction on the shores of the
							Pacific Ocean— The Committee rose, without coming to a Question Several
							Executive communications were received.— I reported from the Committee
							of Manufactures a request to be discharged from the consideration of two
							memorials, and that they be refered to the Committee of Ways and
							Means—which was done and the House adjourned— The Senate agreed to take
							the Notice Question next Thursday.</p>

						<p>In my ruminations of this morning, I composed a Fable, with the title of
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>— One of the symptoms of my desease is
							an itching for the composition of rhymes, which I trust will pass away,
							in the course of a few days, but which while it lasts, is among my worst
							sufferings; for it flies from subject to subject as the rheumatism in my
							body, flies from limb to limb— <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thomas</persRef> was here this
							morning, and ordered new prescriptions, for others, which afford me,
							little or no relief— At the House immediately after the reading of the
							Journal, the Bill to extend the Laws of Ohio, over that of Oregon and
							for sundry other purposes, was resumed— The Amendments reported by the
								Com<pb n="530" type="ms"/>mittee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, were adopted without division, the Bill passed to a third reading
							and under the impulse of the Previous Question, was passed, by the yeas
							and nays called for by <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert. C.
								Winthrop</persRef>—103. to 64. Winthrop <persRef
								ref="grinnell-joseph">Grinnell</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="rockwell-julius">Julius Rockwell</persRef>, of the
							Massachusetts Delegation voting against it— It was passed before I
							reached the House, and therefore I did not vote upon it at all— No
							member from Massachusetts voted for it— <persRef ref="douglas-stephen"
								>Stephen Douglass</persRef> of Illinois, who, like me, was not in
							his seat, when his name was called, asked leave to vote; but it was
							refused— <persRef ref="thompson-james4">James Thompson</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania moved a re-consideration, and the Previous Question—
							Douglass, asked for the yeas and nays in the Question; but they were
							refused, and the re consideration, rejected— The Amendment of the Senate
							to the Joint Resolution of Notice was taken up, and <persRef
								ref="owen-robert2">Robert Dale Owen</persRef>, moved to concur with
							it, with an Amendment—and he moved a previous Question— Owens Amendment
							was carried by yeas and nays, 99. to 87. and the Senate’s amendment,
							thus amended, by 114 to 41— Pettit moved to re consider and the Previous
							Question— The re-consideration was refused— The House then passed to the
							consideration of Private Bills— Three of which were passed, after some
							debate. Two more were passed, after the failure of a motion to adjourn,
							and then the House did adjourn over to Monday—</p>

							13.4. “Marriage is honorable, in all” It was the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> of his intended four Discourses, and was specially
							addressed, to married persons— He gave notice, that the fourth and last
							Lecture of the series, would be delivered, next Sunday, in case of fair
							weather, and would be addressed to Parents— The House was very crowded,
							the auditory very attentive, and the Lecture, sensible, and edifying— In
							the evening, at the Unitarian Church, I heard the <persRef
								ref="bellows-henry">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Henry W.
								Bellows</persRef> of New York, preach, from Revelation, 2.4.
							“Nevertheless I have some what against thee, because, thou hast left,
							thy first love— 5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and
							repent, and do the first works”—and for a second text, Luke, 8.5—[“]A
							sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed, some fell by the way
							side, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it— 6.
							And some fell upon a rock, and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered
							away, because it lacked moisture 7—And some fell among thorns: and the
							thorns sprung up with it, and choked it 8. And other fell on good ground
							and sprang up and bear fruit, an hundred fold”— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Bellows composition is in the first style of elegance, and
							in his exposition of this text I could not, but be amused, in comparing
							his with that of the preacher to the Tuscororo Indians, near Niagara,
							which I heard near Niagara in July 1843— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Bellows argument, was, that moral excellence, the practise of doing
							good, was the great object, of the Christian dispensation— His Sermon,
							was one of the most eloquent, that I ever heard, but was, said, not to
							be equal, to that which he had delivered, at the same Church, this

							chiefly to the organization, of the Trustees of the Fund as a
							Corporation, which he contended was not within the Constitutional power

							next of kin, or residuary Legatees, of <persRef ref="smithson-james"

							preached from Romans 15.4— “For whatsoever things were written aforetime

							Testament were adapted to teach the Christian reader by patience <hi
								rend="strikethrough">and</hi> of investigation, and the comfort
							derived through the perusal and study of them may be encouraged, to
							entertain the hope, of salvation and blessedness, in the future life— It
							was very ingenious, impressive, and eloquent— After dinner, at the
							Second Presbyterian Church, this day had been fixed, by <persRef
								ref="smith-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith</persRef>,
							for the delivery of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and last, of his
							series of Lectures. The one addressed particularly to Parents—and the

							showers, that he postponed the delivery of this Lecture till the next
							Sabbath—and preached upon Isaiah, 55–10— [“]For as the rain cometh down
							and the snow, from Heaven and returneth <pb n="542" type="ms"/>not
							thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth, and bud, that
							it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; 11. So shall my
							word be, that goeth forth, out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me,
							void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper,
							in the thing whereto I sent it”— This was a very seasonable, discourse
							with reference, to the time of its delivery, and the analogies between
							the effects of the rain and snow described in the first verse, and the
							influences of the Holy Scriptures upon the happiness of mankind,
							ascerted in the second, were commented upon, and dilated sensibly, and

								Henry. W. Bellows</persRef> of New York preach from John 15.11.
							“These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy, might remain in you,

							the mission of Christ upon earth was to promote, the happiness of
							mankind and that the text itself indissolubly connected the joy of the
							Redeemer, with the fullness of joy of his Apostles and of all his
							Disciples in all ages— It was full of instruction, and eloquence, but
							not quite so impressive, as that of the last Sunday evening— I met M<hi

						<p>In the British House of Commons, on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>

								“<hi rend="italic">our</hi>” Territory of Oregon, and he proceeded

							hear) and that they would send, British Seamen to the Seaboard of
							America, to speak in terms, that could not be misunderstood, and make
							assirtion of our rights (hear, hear)” The report of this debate is

								>d.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> I deem it my duty to
							reply to this charge, and if possible in my seat in the House of
							Representatives— But if done at all, it must be done with great
							deliberation, and in a written Speech— I began this morning the draught
							of this speech and I pray to God, for resolution, decision, and
							discretion to go through the fiery ordeal, of accomplishing it— At the
							House, <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles. J. Ingersoll</persRef>,
							asked leave to make a personal explanation upon which objection being
							made, he moved and carried a suspension of the rules— <persRef
								ref="ashmun-george">George. Ashmun</persRef> said he wished to move
							an Amendment to Ingersoll’s motion, which the <persRef ref="davis-john8"
								>Speaker</persRef> said, could not be done— The suspension was
							carried out yeas and nays 102. to 25, and Ingersoll, delivered a new
							written attack upon <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef>, for corruption, and embezzlement of Public money,
							and, delinquency in the settlement of his accounts, as Secretary of
							State— He concluded, by asking for a Committee which he said, he could
							not institute to test the truth of his statements— Ashmun asked leave to
							reply, and upon objection made, the rules were again suspended 125. to
							22. and Ashmun did reply by a defence of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Webster, and retorted, charges against Charles. J. Ingersoll in which
							process, he was repeatedly interrupted by calls to order, but sustained
							by the Speaker, and grossly insulted, by foul language, of charges of
							lying and cowardice, from Ingersoll— In the course of this debate, the
							Speaker decided that when all the rules of the House were suspended, the
							Parliamentary Law of England, was, still obligatory upon this House— I
								<pb n="544" type="ms"/>called upon him for his authority, in making
							his decision, he said it was my own, appealing to a decision, which he
							said I had made, while presiding over the House, at the first Session,
							of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress. I denied having ever
							made such a decision, and he did not attempt to produce it— I cannot
							find upon the Journal of the House, of that Session, any Question
							decided by me, which the Speaker, could even construe, into a precedent,
							for his decision of this day— Upon M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Ashmun’s pressing some of his charges against Charles. J. Ingersoll, he
							went over, to implore the assistance of his brother <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph</persRef>, to extricate him, from
							trouble; which he did, as far as he was able, with great propriety, and
							sensibility— This discreditable scene, closed, with a resolution offered
							by <persRef ref="schenck-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Schenck</persRef> of Ohio, for the appointment of a Committee, of
							five members, to investigate the Question, how and in what manner, and
							by whom, Charles. J. Ingersoll had obtained secret documents, from the
							Department, of State, and report to the House, as soon as practicable
							the result of their investigation and by the appointment of another
							Committee also of five members, to inquire into the truth of the charges
							made by Charles. J. Ingersoll, against Daniel Webster with a view to
							founding an impeachment against him— The appointment of both Committees
							was carried and both have power to call for persons or papers, books and
							vouchers. <persRef ref="cobb-howell">Howell Cobb</persRef> of Georgia,
							moved that all debate in Committee of the whole on the Smithsonian
							Bequest Bill, should cease in two hours, after it should be next taken
							up—but this was rejected after an abortive attempt to lay it on the
							Table— Two Messages from the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>President</persRef> were received, with reports from the <persRef
								ref="marcy-william">Secretary of War</persRef>, relating to Treatise
							with the Choctaw Indians— The Messages were laid on the Table and the
							House adjourned— I took a walk after dinner.— The weather oppressively
							warm— We had evening visits from <persRef ref="moseley-william3">M<hi

								>F. P. Stanton</persRef> of Tennessee was appointed in his place—
