                        <p>The snow continued, with little intermission, through the last night, and
                            this day— I rode, not without difficulty, to the second Presbyterian
                            Church, on New York Avenue— Where were assembled, the present Minister,
                                <persRef ref="smith-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Matthew
                                Hale. Smith</persRef>, about twenty men and two women— He performed
                            the usual morning service, according to the forms of the Presbyterian
                            Church, and preached a short Sermon from Hebrews. 6.18. “That by two
                            immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
                            have a strong consolation who have fled, for refuge, to lay hold upon
                            the hope, set before us. 19. Which hope, we have as an anchor of the
                            Soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth, into that within the
                            veil”— This Discourse scarcely gave me an opportunity to judge, of the
                            character and power of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith as a pulpit
                            orator. What I have seen of him, has given me a very favorable, opinion
                            of him, as a man— He gave notice that owing to the inclemency of the
                            weather, the Church would not be open, for Public Worship, this
                            afternoon— But that there would be a service in it, on Wednesday
                            evening— The Storm continued so severe, that I did not attempt to attend
                            any Church, after dinner;—but employed the time in reading a Poem, on
                            the Immortality of the Soul—Canto first— This work, in manuscript, was
                            sent to me, by its Author, through the hands of <persRef
                                ref="brinkerhoff-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                                Brinkerhoff</persRef>—of Ohio—with a request, that I would read, and
                            give my opinion of it— It was said to be written by the Author of a
                            volume, given to me last Spring, by <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r.</hi> Knox</persRef>, on the Philosophy of
                            the plan of Salvation— I have intended, and promised M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Knox to read it—but have not yet
                            performed the promise— The Poem is in the form of blank verse—in the
                            construction of which the Author, is very unskilful— It is accompanied
                            with Notes, more voluminous, than the Poem itself, and consists, in the
                            first Canto, of a series of inquires, to ascertain, what is the <pb
                                n="450" type="ms"/>Soul— The second Canto, which I had not time this
                            day to read, is intitled, “The work of the Soul”—and the notes,
                            beginning with the doctrine of <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef>,
                            dive into all the mysteries, which belong to that, incomprehensible
                            subject— I dread to approach it, and never enter upon it, without
                            remembering, the reprobate spirits in the Paradise lost—“Who find no
                            end, in wandering mazes lost”—</p>

                        <p>The above is an effusion, of my nightly waking hours— When without
                            ability to sleep, or energy to rise, time hangs heavy on me, and I seek
                            consolation, in the jingling of rhyme— This happens to me very often,
                            though I have scarcely ever, made any record, of these my thick coming
                            fancies— I propose however to do so, by way of experiment, for a few
                            days, yet left me. This morning we retrieved the arrears, of this
                            Diary—and I then attended at the House— I found them in Session and
                                <persRef ref="mcconnell-felix">Felix G. Mc Connell</persRef>, had

                            Shoals, of the Tennessee river— The <persRef ref="davis-john8"
                                >Speaker</persRef> said this was the day for calling the states and
                            Territories, for resolutions, commencing with the Territory of Iowa, and
                            going upwards to the state of Maine—but <persRef ref="dobbin-james"
                                >James. C. Dobbin</persRef> of North Carolina called up a Report, of

                            urged the call for resolutions, it being the first time, during the

                            chose to postpone the call for resolutions, and to take up the contested
                            election.— The report of the majority <pb n="451" type="ms"/>closed with
                            a resolution, that <persRef ref="farlee-isaac">Isaac. G.

                            of the Committee of elections, moved to strike out all after the word
                            resolved, and insert that John Runk, is not entitled to a seat upon this
                            floor; that Isaac. G. Farlee, having received a majority, of the legal
                            votes of the legally qualified voters, of the third Congressional
                            District of New Jersey, is entitled to his Seat, upon this floor— Farlee
                            was admitted to a seat on the floor, with the privilege to speak, in
                            support of his claim. The Reports of the majority and minority of the
                            Committee of elections were read— It appeared, that John Runk, was
                            declared to have been elected, by a majority, of 16. votes, but Farlee
                            represented, that this nominal majority was obtained, by the votes of
                            36. Students, at the Theological Seminary at Princeton, and of 5.
                            Students, at the College, at the same place— The Question then was
                            whether the votes of the students, were by the Laws of New Jersey,
                            legal, and valid the debate was maintained, by <persRef

                                >Chipman</persRef>— All members of the Committee of elections— I
                            found it so dull and tedious, that I left my Seat, and went into the
                            Senate Chamber where I heard a Speech of <persRef ref="breese-sidney"
                                >Sydney Breese</persRef>, Senator from the State of Illinois upon
                            the Oregon Question, in favor of giving the notice, of termination, to
                            the Convention of 1827. and stubborn, in support of the right to the
                            parallel of Latitude 54–40. The hour rule, of the House, has not been
                            adopted, in the Senate— Soon after three, I returned to the House, where
                            Chipman of Michigan was still speaking, but stopt immediately, for a
                            motion to adjourn, which was carried— I rode to and from the Capitol—
                            The heaviest, of this, and of many winters, subsided, this afternoon,
                            and began to clear off cold—</p>

                            request, of my opinion as to the construction, in an article of the
                            Florida Treaty so-called, signed on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
                            February 1819. and finally ratified <pb n="452" type="ms"/>on the 22<hi
                                rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February 1821. It related to contested
                            Land Titles, in that region of Country claimed by us, as ceded in the
                            Louisiana Treaty of 1803, and by Spain, as not included in that Treaty—
                            That is, west Florida, east of the Mississippi to the Perdido— These
                            Land titles, have been in litigation from the time of the conclusion of
                            the Florida Treaty, and now, a statement of my recollection is
                            requested, as to an understanding, between the negotiaters of the Treaty

                            recollections upon the subject, but they would have no sort of bearing,
                            for or against any claims to land titles— That the Treaty must of course
                            speak for itself, and at the distance, of 27. years, I could have no
                            confidence, in my own memory, upon points so critical, in the conduct of
                            the negotiation, I could say at once, that M<hi rend="superscript"

                            of it, and we considered it altogether useless, to debate any further

                            lent him the fair manuscript copy of it— At the House, the contested
                            election from New Jersey, was the first subject acted upon— After a call
                            of the House, during the course of which I took my seat, and answered at
                            the second call—one hundred and eighty names were returned— The previous

                            entitled to the Seat but not that Farlee was— The first Question was
                            upon Hamlin’s amendment, which was rejected by yeas and nays, 76. to
                            112—then on the Resolution reported by the majority of the Committee,
                            that Farlee is not entitled to the Seat, which was carried 119. to 66—
                            Hamlin then moved that John Runk, is not entitled to a Seat, in this

                            moved to lay the whole subject on the Table, which was rejected 93. to

                            John Runk, is not entitled to his Seat, was lost, 96. to 96—the Speaker
                            deciding the tie, by voting in the negative— <persRef

                            not give it, Yet he did vote against Runk, and thereby, made the tie— He
                            said he should not have voted if he had known, that the vote would be so
                            close, and this is a sample, of what M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            Bayly holds to be the obligation of good Faith— But for the decision of

                            itself, was unwarrantable— <persRef ref="sawyer-william3">William

                            my seat and told me, that the motion to reconsider was a concerted

                            Democratic members to secure, a reversal of the decision, without
                            changing their votes—and thus turning Runk out of his seat. The majority
                            of the House refused to suspend the call till a number equal to that, of
                            the yesterday vote, was returned, whereupon M<hi rend="superscript"

                            to the persons contesting, who fail, in establishing their right to the

                            was moved and carried by yeas and nays, 105. to 46. to pay Farlee— But
                            no allowance was made for Botts—although Schenck, moved to suspend the

                            100. Psalm— Before Jehovah’s awful Throne and preached from Isaiah 26.3.
                            “Thou wilt keep him, in perfect peace whose mind is staid on thee,
                            because he trusteth in Thee”— The Discourse was upon peace— When I heard
                            him name his text, I had some suspicion, that it would bear a Political
                            complexion— There are rumors <unclear>of War</unclear> prevailing about the Country,
                            fomented, for political purposes, and in some parts of the Country, they
                            have produced, a pious combination, of Ministers of the Gospel, to
                            preach for peace, not in the spirit of the Gospel, but for purposes,
                            altogether worldly— But D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Codman, had no
                            such intention. his exhortations were to peace with God—peace of mind—
                            He is Minister of a congregational Church at Dorchester, adjoining the
                            Town of Quincy. Of the Calvanistic creed, and partly educated at
                            Edinburgh in Scotland— He is a man of most estimable private character,
                            and of good understanding not however remarkably eloquent, or eminent as
                            a Preacher— I heard him again in the afternoon at the 2<hi

                            with him— His text was, Romans 15.4—“For whatsoever things were written
                            aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and
                            comfort of the scriptures might have hope”— The emphatic word of this
                            text was <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, derived from the Scriptures—the
                            exposition of which formed the subject of the Discourse. <persRef

                            insufferably tedious, that I slipt away from the House to day into the

                        <p>Much of my time is consumed, in preparations for distributing, the
                            Congressional Documents, of which an extra number are printed for
                            distribution among the people— I have heretofore always, made out, at
                            the commencement of every Session, a list of the names of the persons to
                            whom I send them consisting, of <persRef key="adams-charles2">my

                            Congressional District, with one or two at Boston the Councillors, and
                            Members of the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from
                            the Counties, and Towns, composing the District, being twenty two Towns,
                            the whole County of Norfolk, four Towns in Plymouth County, and five in
                            Middlesex— At this Session however, I have long delayed to make out this
                            list— This I have however, now completed, but have an accumulation of
                            Documents, to transmit. I have added to my list, a number of names— The
                            usual number of Documents, furnished to each Member of the House is from
                            twenty five to forty, but at this, and one or two preceding Sessions the
                            number ordered to be printed of certain favorite Documents allow to each
                            Member upwards of 100. I have therefore been obliged to make a double
                            list for the small and the greater number— At the House, <persRef

                        <p>This morning I finished reading the Book of <persRef ref="joshua"
                                >Joshua</persRef>; having read two Chapters a day from the first of
                            December last— I attempted the composition of some lines, suited to the
                            day, but without success— It is impossible to foresee at any time the
                            hours of poetic inspiration— I attended at 11. o’clock the service of
                            Public worship at the Hall of the House of Representatives, where
                                <persRef ref="milburn-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                                Milburn</persRef>, the Chaplain of the House of Representatives,
                            preached from Genesis, 49.10—“The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
                            nor a law giver from between his feet, until Shiloah come, and unto him
                            shall the gathering of the people be”— This text requires an exposition
                            more comprensive than is embraced, by the learning or the capacity of
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Milburn— Very few preachers of the
                            Gospel, are competent to it, though it appears to be a favourite topic,
                            with many of them.— Historically speaking it requires much explanation;
                            it is usually understood as refering to the advent of Jesus Christ— And
                            why is he called Shiloah? And why is it said, that the Sceptre shall not
                            depart from Judah, until he come? I walked to, and from the Capitol, and
                            after dinner at the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd.</hi> Presbyterian
                            Church, heard <persRef ref="smith-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r.</hi> Matthew Hale-Smith</persRef> preach from Romans. 9.16.
                            “So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
                            God, that sheweth mercy.” This Chapter contains the principal argument
                            of <persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef> to establish the doctrines
                            of election and pre-destination— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith
                            observed, that in the Epistle of <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>,
                            it is said “That there are in the writings of the Apostle Paul, some
                            things hard to be understood”—and that this remark is especially
                            applicable to this passage, of the Epistle to the Romans.— It seems to
                            import, that the mercy of God, is not obtainable by the will or the
                            exertions of man, but that it is merely the result, of the arbitrary
                            will of the Creator— The Apostle appears aware, that the doctrine is
                            susceptible of great objection. In the preceding context, he says [“]It
                            is written <persRef ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef> have I loved, but
                                <persRef ref="esau">Esau</persRef> have I hated,[”] and then he
                            enquires [“]what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God?
                            God forbid, for he saith to <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> I will
                            have mercy, on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion, on
                            whom I will <pb n="473" type="ms"/>have compassion,” and in the
                            subsequent context—he adds “thou wilt say then unto me, why doth he yet
                            find fault, for who hath resisted his will[”] and to this he replies,
                            Nay, but O man who art thou, that repliest against God, shall the
                            thing formed, say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?
                            This may be called cutting the gordion Knot, but is no answer to the
                            objection— The whole Chapter deserves deep meditation—</p>

                                Dromgoole</persRef> of Virginia, moved to go into Committee of the

                            Bill—which was done.— The voting upon the amendments was resumed— A
                            multitude of Amendments were proposed. Some of them, in derision, and
                            for very unwarrantable sport Among them, one by <persRef
                                ref="fries-george">George Fries</persRef>, of Ohio, grossly and
                            personally insulting, to his Colleague <persRef ref="schenck-robert"
                                >Schenck</persRef>, which occasioned an altercation, and a retort
                            from Schenck, upon which a full hour of the House was wasted, and the
                            time disgracefully lost— The yeas and nays were taken upon numerous
                            Amendments, the first, upon a provision, of five thousand dollars, for
                            removing the obstructions—<pb n="478" type="ms"/>from the Harbour, at
                            Providence Rhode Island; upon which <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Lynn

                            carried, 99. to 96. The appropriation of $15.000, for removing the
                            obstructions of Newark Bay New Jersey, was also carried, by yeas and
                            nays 98. to 89— <persRef ref="crozier-john">Crozier</persRef> of
                            Tennessee, had moved, an item of $100.000., for the Muscle Shoals, which
                            was lost by yeas and nays, 65. to 125. and thereupon, Crozier, who had
                            voted for the appropriation of $5000. for Providence Harbour, moved a
                            reconsideration of that vote, which was lost by yeas and nays 95. 102.
                            This is a specimen, of the slave monger system, of internal
                            improvements— 1/2 past 3. o’clock the House adjourned— Evening visit

                            for, by a resolution of the House; referred to the Committee on Military
                            Affairs— The first Question taken by yeas and nays, on the River and

                            of the 8. Congressional District of New York merely for retaliation upon

                            appropriations; The vote was 82 to 86, and the appropriation, was lost
                            by the votes of the South Carolina Members themselves, <persRef

                            it would have been carried 88. to 80, without Holmes vote— The chalice,
                            was thus effectually returned, to their own lips— The next item $50.000.
                            for the improvement of Savannah Harbour, and the naval anchorage, near
                            Fort<space/>was carried 166. to 77—and then an item of $4.450 for the
                            improvement of Great Wood hole Harbour Massachusetts by a vote of 100.
                            to 89— The purchase, of the stock of the Louisville and Portland Canal,
                            was rejected 56 to 131— The item, for continuing the improvement of the
                            Hudson River, above and below Albany $75.000, was carried, 102. to 79—
                            and for the improvement of the Ohio river, above the Falls at Louisville
                            $80.000. by 112 to 72—and below the Falls of Louisville and of the

                            This is one of the physical developements, which returns upon me,
                            frequently, in the Spring of the year; continues some times for weeks
                            together until a close approach to distraction breaks it off— The above
                            search for happiness, is one of its symptoms; which wasted the hours of
                            this morning— At the House, this was the day for the presentment of
                            Petitions, and the <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> called,
                            on the state of Rhode Island and then on Massachusetts I had a Memorial,
                            from the Massachusetts Historical Society, which I desired to present.
                            And before I could do so, <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Hugh

                            to take up the Bill to raise two Regiments of Riflemen reported by him,
                            very early in the Session— I stated to the Speaker, my wish to present
                            the Memorial, from the Massachusetts Historical Society, and reminded
                            him that he had called the state of Massachusetts for <pb n="485"

                            capacity, to give a proper attention to their contents. Before repairing
                            to the House, this morning, I went to the Pension Office, with a Letter
                            from <persRef ref="taft-alonzo">Alonzo Taft</persRef>, which I left with

                            in September 1842— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Edwards promised to
                            inquire and report to me, whether those papers were at the Pension
                            Office, or not— My own recollection of them, is quite indistinct— I then
                            proceeded to the Capitol, where at the House, the reading of the Journal
                            was dispensed with. The resolution offered by <persRef

                            of Riflemen, and for other purposes, at three o’clock this day; and
                            after an ineffectual motion of <persRef ref="roberts-robert">R. W.
                                Roberts</persRef>, to lay it on the table, was adopted without a
                            division— Haralson immediately moved to go into Committee which was
                            carried. <persRef ref="mcconnell-felix">Felix. G. M<hi

                                    M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Kay</persRef>, declared this not
                            in order— A debate ensued, and continued, until 3. o’clock, when the
                            voting commenced, upon the Amendments proposed to the Bill; one of which
                            was rejected and another adopted— While the process was going on of
                            taking these votes by Tellers, <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert. C.
                                Winthrop</persRef> came to my seat, and told me, he should vote for
                            this Bill.— I said I regretted again to part from him, for that I had
                            come to the determination to vote against it— The Senate not having
                            acted upon the Bill for giving Notice to the British Government of the
                            termination of the Convention of 1827, and the balance, of probability
                            now being, that the Senate would not pass it at all. He said that a
                            message had been received in the Senate, from the <persRef
                                ref="polk-james">President</persRef> in answer to a Resolution of
                            that body, offered some days since, by <persRef ref="dayton-william"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Dayton</persRef>, in which the
                                <pb n="487" type="ms"/>President, declares explicitely, that in his
                            judgment the present position of the Country does require, an addition
                            to its armed force— Hereupon I rose and moved that the Committee should
                            rise, to enable me, to move in the House, a reconsideration of the vote,
                            by which it had been determined, to take the Bill out of Committee, at
                            3. o’clock this day— An immediate, and violent opposition, was made to
                            my motion, with loud calls to order— I asked leave to state my reason,
                            for the motion I had made; but the objections and calls to order,
                            continued and increased, during which, I made out, to give my reason,
                            which was, that a message had been received in the Senate from the
                            President, which in all probability would decide my vote and perhaps
                            that of the House, upon the Bill— The struggle, against granting me the
                            leave, to assign my reasons was so vociferous, and peremptory that the
                            Chairman M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Kay, without taking the Question
                            upon it, said, that he had been mistaken, in supposing that the
                            Committee had assented to give me the leave, and ordered me to take my
                            seat—which I did— Tellers were then called upon my motion for the
                            Committee to rise, and 82 Members, were reported by the Tellers, in the
                            affirmative— This was a majority of the voters present, and the
                            Committee rose— The Chairman, said, that the Resolution in the House,
                            did not require that the Question upon the Bill should be taken this
                            day, that it might be still debated in the House. I replied, that it
                            came to the same thing that if the Bill should be reported, the previous
                            Question would be called and the Question upon the Bill immediately
                            taken. The Committee having risen, I made my motion for reconsideration
                            of the vote, for taking the Bill out of Committee this day— <persRef

                            moved to adjourn— <persRef ref="jones-george4">George W. Jones</persRef>
                            of Tenn. enquired of the <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> if
                            I had voted for the Resolution, which I now moved to reconsider? The
                            Speaker said that this Question would be in order, <pb n="488" type="ms"
                            />when the motion to reconsider, should come up I had voted against the
                            Resolution, and according to the Rules of the House, was not competent,
                            to make the motion to reconsider, but my object was attained by the
                            rising of the Committee and the adjournment of the House, which
                            immediately followed— We shall know the purport of the President’s

                                    >r.</hi> Robert Owen</persRef>, who told me, that he should
                            leave the City to-morrow, about to embark for England, where he
                            proposed, to use his best exertions for procuring the amicable
                            adjustment, of the differences, existing between the Government of that
                            Country, and the United States, and he enquired if I had read an article
                            signed by him, in the National Intelligencer of this morning— I had seen
                            his signature but passed over the article taking it for the repetition
                            of one published some days since— He told me the substance of it, which
                            was, that a final settlement should be made, with the least loss of
                            time, on the base of the 49. degree of Latitude to the Pacific with Van
                            Couver’s Island to the British, and the free navigation of the Columbia
                            River for ten years— He hoped that I would concur with him in this
                            opinion— I told him, that I wished him all possible success in his
                            exertions to preserve the peace between the two Countries, which I
                            believed, to be in no sort of danger, but that as to the terms of
                            settlement, the whole range of my ideas both as to right and expediency,
                            were directly the reverse of his— That I believed our right, to Latitude
                            54–40 on the South Sea, was perfect, with the single exception of actual
                            possession; that Great Britain had no right there, of permanent
                            possession, at all; that with regard, to War and Peace, considered in
                            the abstract, <pb n="489" type="ms"/>I agreed with him, and with all
                            benevolent and humane, throughout the World, I held it in utter
                            abhorence—as much so, as the Roman mother’s in the days of <persRef
                                ref="horace">Horace</persRef> and of <persRef ref="augustuscaesar"
                                >Augustus Caesar</persRef>.— But that there are and always have
                            been, as long as the race of men has existed, times and occasions, of
                            dire necessity for War—and philosophically speaking, I believed that
                            War, was not a corrupter, but rather a purifier, of the moral character
                            of Man.— That peace was the period of corruption to the human race, and
                            I asked him, if he recollected the passage, of the Paradise Lost, in
                            which the <persRef ref="michael">Ark Angel Michael</persRef>, after the

                            Peace, and such it is, that Adam in contemplating it says—</p>

                        <p>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Owen, did not recollect the passage in
                            Milton; probably never having read it. but he expatiated upon his
                            anticipations of the universal revolution, started by him, and now in
                            progress, and which will soon, transform and exalt the nature of Man, to
                            be gouverned, by the laws of God, and not by circumstances, and the Laws
                            of Man— He thought that his purposes and mine were the same, the
                            ultimate improvement, and exaltation of the nature of Man and his
                            condition, upon earth, but the means by which we believe this revolution
                            is to be effected are widely different. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            Owens visit, delayed my departure for the Capitol, so that when I
                            reached the House, I found them in session, having laid on the Table, my
                            motion to reconsider, the vote for taking the Bill out of Committee
                            yesterday, no longer necessary and they were already in Committee of the

                            already been adopted, by authorizing the <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >President</persRef>, at his discretion, to increase the number of

                            Artillery, and Infantry to any number not exceeding 80. The enlistment
                            to be, for three years, unless sooner disbanded, by the President— The

                            149.—and then the Bill was passed, by yeas and nays 164 to 15. <persRef

                            on the route to Oregon.— The House accordingly went into Committee

                            conversation with him, concerning his imaginary revellations and
                            inspirations— He believes that a universal revolution, in <pb n="491"
                                type="ms"/>the Gouvernments of this World, is at this moment in
                            progress.— though as yet, imperceptible, to all but himself— That it
                            commenced, on the equinoxial day, of this month; that all the present
                            Governments, of the earth, are to be overthrown, that of the United
                            States, first, that of Great Britain next, and the rest, in regular
                            succession— In their place, is to arise, a new order of Governments at
                            the head of which, he supposes himself, destined, by revellation to
                            preside, and in which there will be no Department of War, as War is to
                            cease upon earth— He explained to me, in considerable detail, the
                            particulars, of this revolution, and said, he had been subject, of
                            occasional revellations, from the year 1827. having never before, that
                            time, had any religious impressions, of any kind— He illustrated, his
                            imaginary revellations, by numerous references, to Scripture Prophecies,
                            from those of <persRef ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef>, in the Book of
                            Genesis, to those of <persRef ref="john">John the Evangelist</persRef>
                            in the Isle of Patmos; like whom he said, he had been in the Spirit from
                            the Lords Day— He quoted passages from the Books of <persRef
                                ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>, of <persRef ref="daniel"
                                >Daniel</persRef>, of <persRef ref="zechariah">Zechariah</persRef>,
                            of <persRef ref="malachi">Malacchi</persRef>, and of the Apoch-lips
                            always naming the Chapter and verse and repeating the prophecies, in the
                            words of the scriptures— His discourse was consistent, in all its
                            details rational and apparently sincere— He said he was alone in the
                            world, that he had no credit in his own Country, not even in his own
                            family, that <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef> and children with whom
                            he lived in perfect harmony did not believe him; that of his neighbours,
                            some thought him an imposter, and some a monomaniac, not dishonest in
                            his intentions, reasonable, upon all subjects but one, and on that
                            perfectly insane— All this he knew, but he nevertheless, did believe
                            himself not at all times, but on particular occasions, gifted with
                            inspiration from above. That although no one believed him now, he had no
                            doubt, the time would come, and that not distant, when the truth of what
                            he said, would be universally know and understood— I told him, that I
                            did not believe him an Im<pb n="492" type="ms"/>poster and would not
                            call him a monomaniac, but, I believed him labouring under a mental
                            delusion, but, that he had sufficient capacity of reason left, not to
                            take offense, at my candid avowal, of this opinion. He said that far
                            from taking offense, he thanked me for it, and for the kindness with
                            which I had listened to him—and then took his leave— I then went to the
                            House, where I found the <persRef ref="french-benjamin">Clerk</persRef>,
                            reading the Journal of yesterday— The <persRef ref="davis-john8"
                                >Speaker</persRef> laid before the House a report from the <persRef

                            Naval Register for the year 1846— The resolution offered by <persRef

                            table, and another, to postpone its action, till tomorrow— The House
                            immediately took it up, in Committee of the whole on the State of the
                            Union <persRef ref="king-preston">Preston King</persRef>, in the Chair—
                            Then came a long and desultory debate, upon various items in the Bill—

                            of transporting troops into Texas, answered by <persRef

                            at the introduction of Anti Slavery into this, or as he said, all other
                            debates, in this House, <persRef ref="brockenbrough-william2"
                                >Brockenbrough</persRef>, moved an additional item for the benefit
                            of Florida. <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef>,
                            complained, of the precipitation with which this Bill, was to be hurried
                            through the House, and, that there had been confidential communications,
                            from the Secretary of War, to the Chairman of the Committee on Military
                            Affairs, which he, declined communicating to the House— Which was
                            expressly admitted by <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef>—
                            Davis pungently replied by pointing out the base subserviency to the
                            Executive, of the Chairman of the Military Committee, in holding secret
                            communications, with the Secretary of War, and refusing to disclose them
                            to the House. And he then turned to <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac E.
                                Holmes</persRef> Chairman of the Naval Committee and enquired, if he
                            too <pb n="493" type="ms"/>had received any communications from the
                                <persRef ref="bancroft-george">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>—
                            Which Holmes very explicitely denied, and declared, that considering
                            himself as the organ of the House, and not of the Executive, he never
                            would receive as Chairman of the Committee of the House, any
                            confidential communication from the head of our Executive Department—
                            Holmes added, that the Committee had called upon the Secretary of the
                            Navy for a statement, of what further sums, for defence, would be
                            required in that Department, and had received a very short reply, asking
                            for ten additional Steam ships— That the Committee considered this quite
                            unsatisfactory, and a call for more specific details, had been referred
                            to estimates, laid before the Senate; that the Committee had received
                            copies of these, which they would lay before the House, as the organ not
                            of the Executive but of the House— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"

                        <p>Yesterday morning I commenced reading the 1. Book of <persRef ref="samuel">Samuel</persRef>, the last of
                            the ruling Judges of Israel, and this morning, read the account, of the
                            extraordinary capture of the Ark and Covenant, by the Phillistines. At
                            this reading of the Bible, I have been curious, to mark, the Historical
                            incidents, connected with this Ark of the Covenant, containing, the
                            volume of the Law—written by the finger of God, and delivered to <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>
                            on Mount Sinai. In the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of
                            Exodus, is contained the command of God, to make this Ark, and the 16<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse, of that Chapter, is in the
                            following words, “And thou shalt put into the Ark, the testimony, which
                            I shall give thee” In the subsequent parts of that Book, are contained
                            the instructions for keeping this Ark, in the Tabernacle <pb n="498"
                                type="ms"/>of the Congregation, which was carried, with the
                            Israelites, in their Journeys through the wilderness— In the 31<hi
                                rend="superscript">st.</hi> Chapter, of Exodus, and the 18<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse, it is recorded, “That God gave
                            unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him, upon Mount
                            Sinai, two Tables of Testimony; Tables of Stone, written with the finger
                            of God”— But while Moses was with God in the Mount, the children of
                            Israel rebelled, and made a molten Calf of gold which they worshipped,
                            as the Gods, which brought them out of the Land of Egypt, upon
                            discovering which, when Moses came down from the Mount, in his
                            indignation, he casts the Tables out of his hands, and brake them,
                            beneath the Mount— In the 34<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of
                            Exodus, the Lord, commanded Moses, to hew him two Tables of Stone like
                            unto the first, on which he wrote the words, that were in the first
                            Tables— In the 40<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of Exodus, it
                            is recorded, that in the first month in the 2. year, on the first day of
                            the month, the Tabernacle was reared up, in the Wilderness and Moses,
                            took and put the Testimony into the Ark— In the 18<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> Chapter of <persRef ref="joshua">Joshua</persRef>, after the conquest of Canaan was
                            completed, it is said, “That the whole Congregation of the Children of
                            Israel assembled together at Shilo<hi rend="strikethrough">a</hi>h and
                            set up, the Tabernacle of the Congregation there[”]— In the subsequent
                            war, with the Phil<hi rend="strikethrough">l</hi>istines, as appears by
                            the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of this first Book of
                            Samuel and the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse, That the people
                            sent to Shilo<hi rend="strikethrough">a</hi>h, and brought thence the
                            Ark of the Covenant, between the cherubims and the two Sons of <persRef ref="eli">Eli</persRef>,
                            <persRef ref="hophni">Hopni</persRef> and <persRef ref="phinehas">Phinehas</persRef> and in the battle of the Phil<hi rend="strikethrough"
                                >l</hi>istines it was taken— Carried into the House of <persRef ref="dagan">Dagon</persRef>; at
                            Ashdod, successively transferred to Gath.— and thence to Ekron was 7.
                            months in the Country of the Phillistines, then brought to Beth Shemesh
                            and thence to Kirjath Jearim and there remained twenty years, till the
                            days of <pb n="499" type="ms"/><persRef ref="david">David</persRef>. Its subsequent History, I shall if
                            it please God, notice hereafter— In the Hall of the House of
                            Representatives, I heard the Chaplain of the House <persRef ref="milburn-william">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Milburn</persRef> preach, from 1. Kings 2.2. part
                            of the verse. “Show thyself a man”—it is the beginning of the injunction
                            of David, on his death bed, to his son <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, and was commented upon,
                            by the Preacher, with some eloquence, but not to me with much
                            edification— The Hall was well filled, and a Choir from one of the
                            Methodist Churches, sung two Hymns— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef> dined here, and

                            Church, I heard <persRef ref="smith-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Matthew Hale Smith</persRef>
                            preach from James. 1.27—[“]Pure religion, and undefiled, before God, and

                        <p>A few painful symptoms of rheumatism. I found yesterday, the papers,
                            which had been put in my hands, in Oct 1842, by <persRef ref="taft-alonzo">Alonzo Taft</persRef>, and took
                            them to the Navy Department, where I saw the <persRef ref="bancroft-george">Secretary M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bancroft</persRef>, and left them with him. He
                            placed them in the hands of the <persRef ref="smith-athomas">Chief Clerk</persRef> of the Department, and
                            promised immediate attention to them— They had been committed to me,
                            during the recess of Congress— I had brought them with me, at the
                            commencement of the Session then ensuing, and had been mislaid upon a
                            file of papers, from that time to this— An instance of forgetfulness on
                            my part, which has seldom happened, as I have made it a practise,
                            specially to note Papers entrusted to me during the recess of Congress,
                            to be used during the subsequent Session— I lament this delinquency of
                            my memory, and gratefully reflect, that it has <pb n="500" type="ms"
                            />not oftener occured— On the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this
                            month, I received a Letter dated on the 20<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> at Boston, from Alonzo Taft reminding me of the papers
                            which he had entrusted to me in 1842, and enquiring what had become of
                            them— I took his Letter to the Pension Office, the Commissioner of which
                            <persRef ref="edwards-james">J. L. Edwards</persRef> reported to me, that they were not to be found either in
                            that Office or at the Navy Department. I found them now accidentally in
                            searching for other papers—and the discovery of them administered to me.
                            A mingled feeling of mortification and of pleasure— At the House; this
                            was the day, for the call of the states for resolutions and the House
                            went immediately, into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union,
                            and took up the Bill, making appropriations to supply deficiencies in
                            the appropriation Bills of the last year. The Questions were taken, upon
                            various Amendments, after which the Bill was reported to the House,
                            followed by further desultory debate, and was finally passed by yeas and
                            nays 108. to 38. <persRef ref="lewis-abner">Abner Lewis</persRef> of New York moved to re-consider the vote
                            of last Saturday, by which the Bill for the relief of the heirs of
                            <persRef ref="grayson-william2">Colonel William Grayson</persRef> was rejected on the question of engrossment— The
                            motion was laid over for consideration— The House, at the motion of
                            <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">George. C. Dromgoole</persRef>, went into Committee of the whole on the state of

                            Bill so-called.— The Bill was read through, after several motions, to
                            supercede, the rule requiring that it should be so read, and then taken
                            up by sections— A debate upon it was commenced, by <persRef ref="smith-caleb">Caleb. B. Smith</persRef>, of
                            Indiana, continued, by <persRef ref="wick-william">William W. Wick</persRef>, of the same State. <persRef ref="leake-shelton">Shelton F.

                            about five minutes, when a quarter to five the Committee rose, and the

                            claim my assistance in a claim, which he has upon the Government— Some
                            weeks since, there were shipped, by a Quarter Master here, in the
                            Schooner Joy, belonging to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Drury,
                            thirteen pieces of Canon, to be transported to Pensacola, for this
                            Government— On the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this month, the
                            vessal was stranded on <unclear>Cran</unclear> Island near Norfolk, Virginia, and there
                            remains, with the Canons, still on board— M<hi rend="superscript"

                            and for the charges of recovering them, and transporting them, to
                            Pensacola, according to the original Contract— I went with M<hi

                            <persRef ref="marcy-william">Secretary of War, Marcy,</persRef> and to the <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">Quarter Master General, Jesup</persRef>; to
                            them he stated his claim, and I left him, to agree with them, upon the
                            measures to be pursued, for the fulfilment, of this contract with the
                            Government, after which, I took him to his lodgings, at <persRef ref="coleman-samuel">Coleman’s</persRef> Hotel;
                            and proceeded to the Capitol, where I found the House in session— <persRef ref="sims-alexander">Alex.

                            until other was ordered. <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> objected— Simms moved, a suspension of
