                            preached his last Sermon for the Session from Ecclesiasts 9.10
                            [“]Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is

                                Milburn</persRef> is said to be blind, but he has no appearance of
                            it at the Clerks table whence he speaks—and he walks without a guide— He
                            was brought here from what is called the far West and among the
                            worshipers of the wilds passes for eloquent— His discourses consist of
                            commonplace Calvinism without intolerance or dogmatism— Quiet,
                            inoffensive, pious, moral, but to my judgment so far from eloquent that
                            from my constant attendance upon his ministrations on the Sabbath
                            through this long Session, there is not a thought which I have heard
                            from him remaining in my Memory. There was this morning a dedication of
                            a new Baptist Church in E Street East of the Post-Office to which I
                            received a printed circular invitation from the Trustees, but which I
                            did not attend— There was no service this afternoon at S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church—and I believe none at the
                            second Presbyterian which is now without a Pastor The change from the
                            Summer to the autumnal atmosphere commenced this day a full fortnight
                            earlier than usual—and with the change a corresponding one is promised
                            of my health— I read a few pages of the philosophy of the plan of
                            Salvation—Calvinism in extremis— But I am yet under the influence of
                            indolence— Is it strenua inertia?</p>

                            reduce and graduate the price of public Lands to actual settlers—

                            This was retaliation for the veto upon the river and harbour Bill—but
                            nothing more— It will not save the public lands—but abandon to ruin the
                            Northern and Eastern harbours— I reached the house immediately after the
                            vote was taken, and did not vote upon it—the Amendments of the Senate to
                            the Subtreasury, were after a feeble struggle all concurred in, and

                            encloses 8 lines of verse full of calm, philosophical and pious
                            resignation under the decays of nature in the last stage of human life—
                            My sympathies with him are more than fraternal. At the House the report

                            the bill passed— The civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill was
                            labouring with amendments pile upon pile between the two houses— While

                            was no Quorum— I moved a call of the House which was carried— At the

                        <p>There was no preaching at the Capitol— I attended the morning service at
                                S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s church where <persRef

                            the prayers for the ninth Sunday after Trinity, and preached from John
                            3.18 [“]He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
                            not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of
                            the only begotten Son of God.” The discourse was upon Faith and
                            disclosed to my mind no new idea.— On Saturday 5. August 1809—I sailed
                            from Charlestown for S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersbourg with

                            next day 6. August 1809 was the ninth Sunday after Trinity and I read to
                            my wife on board ship the service of that day, with an impression which
                            is not effaced— And all the while we were in Europe we continued the
                            practice— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne’s discourse was upon
                            saving Faith—a perplexing subject— At 4 this afternoon I attended at the
                            second Presbyterian church, where the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi

                                Patten</persRef> of the Columbian College, preached from Philippians
                            4.6 [“]Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
                            supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto
                            God.”— The Sermon was upon prayer—supplication with thanksgiving— M<hi

                            qualifying commentary— The spirit of the gospel is frequently monitory
                            against the excess of worldly cares but it is only the excess that is
                            forbidden, to which the more selfish morality of <persRef ref="solomon"
                                >Solomon</persRef> might lead— To be careful for nothing is a
                            hyperbole a figure of speech often used by Jesus— We had evening visits

                        <p>Close of 1 Session 28. Congress.</p>
                        <p>The House met at 8 O’Clock A.M. The adjournment was fixed at Noon for the
                            convenience of members many of whom departed in the Railway Cars for
                            Baltimore at that hour— The day like all the last days of a Session of
                            Congress was a Chaos of confusion— It began by a Committee of the whole
                            on the state of the Union <persRef ref="cobb-howell">Howell

                            declared the disagreement carried though <persRef ref="davis-garrett"
                                >Garrett Davis</persRef> had called for a division and remonstrated
                            that there was no quorum. Cobb rode rough shod over Garrett Davis, and
                            was sustained in his false report, by the Speaker <persRef

                            the amendment of the Senate which was rejected 84 to 48— The Bill
                            afterwards passed, by a report from a Committee of Conference, so did
                            the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill— A joint Committee was
                            appointed to inform P.U.S. that the two houses would adjourn at Noon but

                        <p>After a Night of calm repose, I rose at half past 4 this morning—
                                <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 86— We
                            breakfasted at 8. and took the train of Railway cars which started at 9
                            A.M from Baltimore for Philadelphia— From <persRef ref="barnum-david"
                                >Barnum’s</persRef> hotel to the depot we went in a hack—then in the
                            cars drawn by horses to the borders of the city, where the horses were
                            dismissed: and the locomotive took their place— At 3. P.M we reached the
                            out-skirts of Philadelphia where horses again took the place of the
                            locomotive and landed us at the depot in market street— Thence we
                            proceeded in a hack to <persRef ref="jones-john10">Jonas’s</persRef>
                            Union Hotel in Chesnut street There we dined at the Lady’s ordinary and
                            at half past 4 proceeded in a hack to Walnut Street wharf, and embarked
                            in the Steamer which in an hour and a half landed us at Bristol— There
                            we entered the train of cars, and passing through Trenton, Princeton,
                            New Brunswick, Rahway, Elizabeth town and Newark, at 9 in the Evening,
                            brought us to Jersey city safe— We crossed the ferry and taking a hack
                            at the foot of Cortland Street at 9.45—reached the Astor house New-York.
                            The transportation of this day from Baltimore to New York, was but a
                            trivial incident now common to hundreds every day in the year and many
                            days to thousands— I met on the way sundry fellow travellers with whom I
                            had previous slightly remembered or forgotten acquaintance, the only
                            remarkable one of which was the late Vice-President of the United States
                            acting and self styled President of the United States, <persRef

                            harps who played and sung popular songs accompanied by a male Clarion,
                            and made delightful music and pleasant pastime—</p>

                        <p>V.— Blessing praise and supplication to God on first rising from bed, on
                            returning to my earthly home after an absence of nine months in the
                            public service of my Country— Some discouragement of Soul follows the
                            reflection that my aspirations to live in the memory of after ages as a
                            benefactor of my country and of mankind, have not received the sanction
                            of my maker— That the longing of my Soul through a long life to be
                            numbered among the blessing bestowed by the Creator on the race of man
                            is rejected, and after being trammeled and counteracted and disabled at
                            every step of my progress my faculties are now declining from day to day
                            into mere helpless impotence— Yet—at the will of my heavenly father why
                            should I repine? <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript"

                            1.21. “Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up,
                            and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee: fear

                            not thinking of Texas Mexico or Oregon, but of the Reports of <persRef

                            Canaan, and of the heavenly land set before the Christian of the present
                            age for his exploration and possession— All his applications to our
                            times were spiritual— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce dined with
                                <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— His afternoon
                            discourse was from Acts 11.26. “And the disciples were called Christians
                            first in Antioch.” This is an incident of historical fact very curious
                            and interesting upon which the commentary might have been broader and
                            deeper— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce is of the salt of the

                        <p>I return to a quiet home, and to more than voluntary repose My health
                            apparently firmer than at any time within the last fifteen months, but
                            shaking more and more— I rose with coming dailight, but the sky was
                            beclouded and I could get neither a first sight of Sirius nor of the
                            rising Sun— The first thing that riveted my attention to the progress of
                            civilization and Society in my native village, was the rush by my
                            windows of the train of Railroad cars from Boston to Plymouth at
                            5.45—followed at 6.45 by the return train from Plymouth to Boston— I was
                            all day thinking of a fixed steady specific occupation for the Season,
                            and during the recess of Congress— I had an unexpected but only

                            hill.— We reached the depot opposite the United States Hotel about 8.45—
                            I walked with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy and M<hi

                            Here I passed an hour, chiefly inspecting an Album sent from England by

                            How the hour passed away I know not but a quarter before ten we walked
                            to the depot of the Providence Railroad and found there <persRef
                                ref="quincy-josiah">Josiah Quincy junior</persRef> Mayor, and the
                            City Council of Boston with whom I went to Long Pond in Wayland to break
                            ground for the construction of an Aqueduct to the City of Boston.— This
                            ceremony of striking the spade foot into the ground was performed by the
                            Mayor after a short address to him from <persRef ref="hale-nathan"
                                >Nathan Hale</persRef> in the name of the Water Commissioners and a
                            handsome speech of about ten minutes from him. He threw up the first
                            shovel full of earth and then with a compliment invited me to strike the
                            second which I did, and his father, 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                            Passed Mayor of Boston struck the third. The spade had been made for the
                            occasion, and had on its handle a silver inscription recording in
                            advance the transaction— The company then repaired to a temporary shed
                            or tabernacle at hand and set down to the number of about 300 to a
                            temperance cold collation at which the Mayor presided— The company then
                            returned in the cars to Boston just in time for me to take the Cars of
                            the Old Colony Rail-road at 5 P.M. for Quincy. I alighted with my

                            “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that

                            ordinary of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s compositions, never
                            coming down to the level of mediocrity; and never of faltering
                            interest—but the discourse of this afternoon from John 14.16. “And I
                            will pray the Father, and he shall give you, another Comforter, that he
                            may abide with you forever. 17. Even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world
                            cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye
                            know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you”—was
                            transcendant—and one of the remarkable discourses that I ever heard— He
                            began with a brief historical narrative of the festival days celebrated
                            by the Roman Catholic and English Episcopal
                            churches—Christmas—Easter—Ascension day and Pentecost or Whitsunday when
                            the Holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles— He did not approve of the
                            annual celebration of these days, thinking it tended to superstition and
                            preferring the simplicity of the puritan worship; but he described with
                            glowing eloquence, the transformation of the Apostles in the fifty days
                            between the day of the crucifixion and the day of the descent of the
                            Holy Ghost—and his application of the subject to the duties of the
                            Auditory was highly solemn and impressive— As I came out of meeting this

                        <p>“And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the
                            Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall

                        <p>I have been watching every morning since I got home for a sight of the
                            rising of Sirius the dogstar at his heliacal morning appearance, but
                            there has not yet been an unclouded morning eastern sky on which he
                            could shew his face. This morning gloomed with fog— I took a Letter for
                            Baltimore to the Post-Office, and was told that the Southern mail went
                            out at 6. P.M. Returning home I stop’d at <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >my Sons</persRef> house, and found him with his family at
                            Breakfast— <persRef ref="wild-jonathan3">Wild Jonathan</persRef> of
                            Braintree, came for a pension claim of his mother <persRef

                            Swansea, who said he had been about a year in this Country and expected
                            to return next Summer to Wales— His only object in his visit was
                            curiosity to see me, and his companion a young man residing in Boston
                            had no other— Then came <persRef ref="white-naaman">Naaman L.

                            Braintree next Tuesday at 2. O’Clock P.M. for the benefit of the
                            sufferers by the recent fire at Nantucket— I declined attending this
                            party—though fully approving its object. <persRef ref="french-benjamin2"

                            sent unto me; and lo, a roll of a book was therein; 3.1— Moreover he
                            said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest, eat this roll, and go
                            speak unto the house of Israel. 2. So I opened my mouth, and he caused
                            me to eat that roll.” The text of his afternoon discourse was John
                            4.48—“Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will
                            not believe”— The morning was of high Summer heat with clouds gathering
                            for a thunder shower, which came on immediately after I returned home
                            from Meeting— I found <persRef ref="degrand-peter">P. P. F.

                        <p>This verse immediately precedes the passage understood to announce the
                            advent of the Saviour— For, unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is
                            given: and the Government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall
                            be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father,

                            there shall be no end, upon the throne of <persRef ref="david"

                            zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. In the Septuagint there is
                            neither wonderful, nor mighty God, nor everlasting Father, nor Prince of

                            not a trace of the prophesy contained in this passage—and the

                            different from both— The Summer heat still disqualifies me for the
