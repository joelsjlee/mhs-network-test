						<p>I have received from <persRef ref="sturge-joseph">Joseph

							dated the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this present month, since
							which, the Oregon Treaty, has superceded all necessity, for further
							correspondence, on that subject between him and me I received also a
							Letter from <persRef ref="reymert-jd">J. D. Reymert</persRef>, dated at
							Boston 29 June inclosing a number of Engravings of Articles of Iron
							Manufacture, and a Catalogue of such articles, sold, by <persRef

							He encloses also Cards of the House and of J. P. Robinson He says they
							have received great encouragement, from several of the first Gentlemen,
							of the State and are using their endeavours for the extension of their
							business in this Country, and have for that purpose established several
							Agencies in the different principal Cities— I answered an invitation
							from <persRef ref="edwards-eb">E. B. Edwards</persRef> Chairman of a
							committee of Whig Citizens of the County of Philadelphia, to a public
							Dinner on the Anniversary day next Saturday, declining as I had done to
							the invitation from the Whigs of the City of Philadelphia— At the House
							the debate on the Tariff Bill in committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union, again absorbed the day— <persRef ref="thompson-james4">James
								Thompson</persRef> 23. Pennsylvania, finished his reply to <persRef

								Democra<unclear>cy</unclear> he resented with much worthy
							indignation— <persRef ref="hunter-robert">R. M. T. Hunter</persRef> 8.
							Virginia, hammered out, a common place, invective against protection and
							the tariff of 1842. <persRef ref="toombs-robert">R. Toombs</persRef>. 8.

							had once been a bit of a Federalist himself and was as honest then as he
							is, now which I readily believe: but now he was better informed.
								<persRef ref="carroll-charles2">Charles H Carroll</persRef>, 29. New

							the Bill— But <persRef ref="wilmot-david">David Wilmot</persRef> 12.

							succeeded by <persRef ref="mcconnell-felix">Felix G. M<hi

								<persRef ref="ficklin-orlando">Orlando. B. Ficklin</persRef> 3.

							O’clock. <persRef ref="perry-thomas2">Thomas Perry</persRef>, 2.
							Maryland. took the floor, when wearied out, I left the House— I found my
							carriage, was not at the door, and making a mis-step, from the entrance
							of the Hall, I fell, and struck the left knee-pan, slightly bruising it,
							but not so as to disable me from walking— On coming out from the Capitol
							I met <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas Dumphy</persRef> with the
							carriage in which I returned home— <persRef ref="fuller-gardiner"
								>Gardiner Fuller</persRef>, our Coachman, left us yesterday
							returning to Boston, with <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef> who is in
							the last stage of Consumption— I settled with him, for his wages, and

							had not received it from the City Hall—</p>

								<persRef ref="clark-sally">Sarah Clark</persRef> and <persRef

							Commissioner requires, and complains much, of his decision, but he said
							he must submit to them, and thanked me, for the assistance I had given
							him on sundry of the Claims, for which he said “he was under a
							compliment to me” an expression which he often repeats, but which I
							never heard from any one else. By the word compliment, he means an
							acknowledgment of obligation— I wrote to <persRef ref="macomb-harriet"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Macomb</persRef> a note of
							acknowledgment and thanks, for her note to me, with the Georgetown
							Advocate of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> June last, containing

						<p>I received yesterday, a Letter from <persRef ref="tyson-william">W<hi

								<persRef ref="seaver-jonathan2">Jonathan Seaver</persRef> a
							Committee of the Society of Friends, requesting an interview with me, to

							his Letter there was a Diagram, of the Land, marking, the Road which is
							desired for the Way— I referred him to <persRef key="frye-nathaniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Frye</persRef>, who
							manages my real estate in this City and said that I was willing to have
							a survey made by a competent person or persons to lay out the way and

							the conveyance upon such terms as should be decided to be reasonable, by
							such Surveyor— I receive almost every day, Letters from strangers
							asking, for Documents, or Autographs or Money, loans from ten to five
							hundred dolls. I have a Letter from Curtis and Rall Cincinnati 13<hi

							certain Pension Claims for which I applied to the Office of the <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">Clerk of the House</persRef>, but no record of

							Cincinnati, there to morrow go to Church with him on Sunday and return
							here on Monday morning in time for the Meeting of the House. But I
							perseveringly declined having no feeling for festivity to-morrow. In the
							House this whole day was consumed in voting upon Amendments, to the
							Tariff Bill, first in committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							by Tellers, and after the Bill was reported with Amendments to the
							House, by yeas and nays— The struggle to strike out 20. per cent duty,
							on Tea and Coffee, was successful that to make salt free succeeded in
							Committee, but finally failed in the House; the fishing bounties, and
								<pb n="654" type="ms"/>drawback on Salt, used in the Fisheries were
							carried in committee and restored in the House— The duty of 20. per cent
							on salt, was carried by the casting vote of the <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">speaker</persRef>, but there was a mistake of the
							Clerk, in counting the votes, and the speaker’s vote was nullified but a
							re consideration was carried, and the duty of 20. per cent made, a fixed
							fact all amendments proposing specific for ad valorem duties, were
							rejected— The new Bill levies 100 per cent upon spirituous liquors
							increased from 75. reported in the Bill of the Committee. Then came
							classes of Articles with forty, thirty, twenty, fifteen, ten, and five
							per cent— The Bill was finally passed by a vote of 114 to 95. All the

								ref="quincy-josiah2">Mayor</persRef> and City Council of Boston to
							the Anniversary celebration, there to-morrow but supposed no answer
							necessary. The Senate yesterday passed by a vote of 32 to 13. the Bill,
							which had already passed the House retroceding the County of Alexandria
							to the State of Virginia— <persRef ref="davis-john4">John

							Constitution of the United States is waste paper, and the District of

							Union is shivered to atoms, and the next step will be the removal, of
							the Seat of Government to a Slave State— Notwithstanding the South
							Carolina slave monger <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John. C.

						<p>The continued intense heat of the Season, has produced, a personal

							the power of vital agency extinct; a plant withered at the root, a tree,
							dying downward from the top. I feel above all the want of a bath and was
							disappointed last evening, in going to the Public hot baths of this
							City, to be told that they had no hot water—but could have some if I
							would wait half an hour. Which however I declined— There was no
							preaching this at the Hall of the House of Representatives of which
							notice was given in the National Intelligencer of yesterday, and the
							reason assigned for it was that the Chaplain of the Senate <persRef

								<persRef ref="milburn-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I rose this morning with the dawn, and drawn by an irresistible impulse
							walked over the lower Tiber bridge, to my old bathing spot, on the
							margin of the Potomac—and there, under the shelter of the high bluff yet
							remaining, I bathed and swam, from five to ten minutes, came out,
							dressed myself, and walked home. As I went down the Hill, to the edge of
							the water, I found three young men, neither of whom I knew, already in
							the river, and heard one of them say, there is John Quincy Adams— They
							had their clothes, at one of my old standard rocks, but without noticing
							or disturbing them, I found another rock, a few rods higher, towards the
							Potomac bridge, where I left my clothes. The tide was low, and the time
							not convenient, for entering the river, but I succeeded, in obtaining
							the bath, for which I panted— The time consumed, was as in former days,
							about one hour and a half—half an hour going to the river, 1/2 an<hi

							an hour to return— The Thermometer was at 84. the water warm, the

							throughout the day, was not sensibly relieved and the weariness of the

						<p>I received 26 Letters printed all of one tenor but signed by different
							individuals from Nantucket invoking my influence in support of the Bill
							to indemnify the Sufferers by French spoliations before 1800— The appeal
							to my feelings is most impressive—but the day, of my strength is past,
							and an atmosphere at 90 degrees of <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit</persRef> annihilating— A Scotchman by the name of
								<persRef ref="u">Stewart</persRef> was here.— A benevolent
							undertaker to promote the migration of his poor Countrymen to the United
							States and soliciting money for himself, which I declined to give— At
							the House the new Tariff Bill was received from the Senate, with an
							amendment striking out, the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section.
							The special order of the day, the Warehouse Bill was postponed till
							tomorrow— Call of the House 211 answered, 10. absent, 4 vacancies— The
							question to suspend the special order, and take up the Message from the
							Senate was carried 108. to 100. <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"
								>Winthrop</persRef> claimed that it could be carried only by a
							two-thirds vote— The <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> said
							it was too late to raise the objection— Winthrop appealed and the appeal
							was laid on the table 102 to 98— <persRef ref="stewart-andrew"
								>Stewart</persRef> moved to lay the Bill, with the Senates amendment
							on the table, lost 96 to 113— A second motion to lay the bill on the
							table was rejected 99 to 113— And the concurrence with the amendment of
							the Senate was carried 115 to 92. And thus perishes the Tariff of 1842—
							Carried by a majority of one. <persRef ref="white-john6">John
								White</persRef> then Speaker of the House and now repealed by the

							Bill, there was not a quorum of 113. left, and after some convulsive
							throes—the Committee rose and the House adjourned—no evening

							bill— <persRef ref="smith-truman">Truman Smith</persRef> of Connecticut
							followed with a heavy and bitter invective against the repeal of the

							and <persRef ref="payne-william3">W. W. Payne</persRef> of Alabama
							consumed two successive hours in railing not in good fat terms, but in
