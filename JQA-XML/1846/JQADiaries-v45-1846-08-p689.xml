						<p>I received a Letter from George. H Derby, brevet second Lieutenant of the
							Ordnance, whose admission as a Cadet at the West Point Academy, I had
							obtained by the favor of John Bell Secretary of War in 1842, and who has
							recently graduated 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of his Class,
							soliciting my influence to obtain for him a transfer from the Ordnance
							to the Corps of Topographical engineers— I called this morning at the
							Pension Office with some additional papers in support of the claim of
							Eleanor Shepherd, which I left with the Commissioner of Pensions— Then
							on Col J. J. Abert, was referred by him to Gen<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Scott, who after some pour parler sent for Col Talcott and
							finally promised me that Lieut George. H. Derby should be transferred to
							the corps of Topographical engineers— In the House a Resolution was
							adopted to close debate on the Warehousing bill at noon this day— The
							debate itself was a mockery— The engrossment of the bill was carried
							117. to 52— Grinnell and Winthrop voting for it— Ashmun, Hudson—D. P.
							King, Rockwell and Thompson with me voting against it. Abbott did not
							vote— It is the golden key to<space/>on the revenue The Bill was passed
							and returned without amendment to the Senate— Private Bills, from the
							Senate were then taken up 4. of which were passed— A Bill for the relief
							of Hariette Ward, widow of a Lieutenant in the Navy, produced a perfect
							anarchy of two hours and then was passed without further struggle Army
							Appropriation Bill— Disagreement between the two Houses— Conference
							could not agree— Senate adhere— Ashmun moved to recede by lost 67. to
							69— Dromgoole excused from voting— House insist and ask a second
							conference— Amendments of Senate to the subtreasury bill referred to the
							Committee of Ways and Means The House adjourned— Evening visit from M<hi

						<p>In the Hall of the House of Representatives, the Chaplain of the House
							preached his last Sermon for the Session, from Ecclesiastes
							9.10—“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there
							is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither
							thou goest”— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Milburn is said to be blind
							but he has no appearance of it, at the Clerk’s table whence he speaks,
							and he walks without a guide— He was brought here from what is called
							the far West, and among the worshipers of the wilds passes for eloquent—
							His discourses consist of common place Calvanism without intolerance or
							dogmatism.— Quiet inoffensive, pious, moral but to judgment so far from
							eloquent that from my constant attendance, upon his ministrations on the
							Sabbath through this long Session there is not a thought which I have
							heard from him remaining in my memory— There was this morning a
							dedication of a new Baptist Church in E. Street, east of the Post
							Office—to which I received a printed Circular invitation from the
							Trustees, but which I did not attend— There was no service this
							afternoon at Saint John’s Church; and I believe none at the second
							Presbyterian, which is now without a Pastor— The change from the Summer
							to the Autumnal atmosphere commenced this day, a full fortnight earlier
							than usual, and with the change a corresponding one is promised of my
							health— I read a few pages of the philosophy of the plan of salvation.
							Calvanism in extremis— But I am yet the influence of indolence— Is it
							strenua inertia—</p>

							Washington Hunt, requesting an autograph for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs.</hi> Hunt— House of Representatives, United States— The Veto
							Message was resumed.— John Wentworth had moved an Amendment to
							Dromgoole’s motion to print the Veto Message to print with it parts of
							the President’s annual message to shew his inconsistency— After some
							debate the previous question was carried on the Vetoed Bill, the vote on
							which was 95 to 93. a majority but not two-thirds, so that the Bill was
							lost— French spoliation Bill— Hamlin moved to close the debate in one
							hour— Cobb moved to lay the Bill on the table, lost 68. to 113— Thurman
								M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Clelland Cobb occupied the whole hour

							passed for engrossment 93. to 88. passed for enactment 94 to 87—and

							>c</hi>Clelland moved a call of the House—refused 56. to 113. and the

							public Lands, but abandons to ruin the Northern and Eastern Harbours— I
							reached the House immediately after the vote was taken, and did not vote
							upon it— The amendments of the Senate to Subtreasury were after a feeble
							struggle all concurred in, and after the rejection of a motion by George
							Ashmun to lay the Bill on the table it was finally adopted 101. to 77— A

							full of calm, philosophical and pious resignation, under the decays of

						<p>There was no preaching, at the Capitol, I attended the morning service at

							“He that believeth in him; is not condemned: but he that believeth not
							is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the
							only begotten Son of God”— The discourse was upon Faith, and disclosed
							to my mind no new idea— On Saturday 5 August 1809. I started from
							Charlestown for St Petersburg with my wife, and child, Charles F. and
							others. The next day 6 August 1809, was the ninth Sunday after Trinity
							and I read to my wife on board ship the service of that day—with an
							impression which is not effaced— And all the while we were in Europe we
							continued the practise— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne’s discourse
							was upon saving Faith— A perplexing subject— At 4 o’clock this afternoon
							I attended at the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd.</hi> Presbyterian church,
							where the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Patten of the Columbia College, preached from Philippians
							4.6. “Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
							supplication, with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto
							God”— The sermon was upon prayer, supplication unto thanksgiving— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Patten made no remarks upon the
							injunction to be careful for nothing—which discloses and perhaps
							requires a qualifying commentary— The spirit of the Gospel is frequently
							monitory against the excess of worldly care, but it is only the excess
							which is forbidden to which the more selfish morality of Solomon might
							lead— To be careful for nothing is a hyperbole—a figure of speech often

							<p>Close of 1. Session 29. Congress— The Houses met
							at 8. oclock A.M. The adjournment was fixed at noon for the convenience
							of members, many of whom departed in the Railway Cars for Baltimore at
							that hour. The day like all <hi rend="strikethrough">days</hi> the last
							days of a Session of Congress, was a Chaos of confusion— It began by a
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—Howell Cobb chairman
							upon an amendment of the Senate to the Navy appropriation Bill— There
							was a large Majority to disagree to the Senate’s amendment, but no
							quorum voting— Cobb declared the disagreement carried, though Garrett
							Davis had called for a division and remonstrated that there was no
							quorum— Cobb rode rough shod over Garrett Davis, and was sustained in
							his false report by the Speaker John. W: Davis, who in mastery of
							Garrett Davis remonstrance, said he could receive nothing as done in
							Committee—but the report of the Chairman— He put the question of
							concurring with the Amendment of the Senate, which was rejected 84 to
							48— The Bill afterwards passed, by a report from a Committee of
							Conference— So did the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— A joint
							Committee was appointed to inform the President, that the two houses
							would adjourn at Noon but they made no report— Sims of S.C. and W. W.
							Campbell of New York moved to take up the bill for the relief of
							Elizabeth Hamilton—but failed— As the hand of the Clock was on the line
							of 12. the Speaker declared the House adjourned to the first Monday in
							December— At that moment John Davis was prosing in the Senate about the
							two millions Peace bill, with David Wilmots anti slavery proviso, which
							thereby fell through— G Ashmun a Letter from Capt Guisinger— Kavasales
							was here. My Ladies spent the Evening at M<hi rend="superscript"
