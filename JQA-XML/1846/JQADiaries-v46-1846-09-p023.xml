                        <p>II.45. IV.10. <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 65 at
                            Sunrise</p>
                        <p>How art thou fallen from Heaven, O <persRef ref="satan"
                            >Lucifer</persRef>, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the
                            ground, which didst weaken the Nations</p>
                        <p>Isaiah 14.12.</p>
                        <p>This Lucifer son of the morning is the dogstar, Sirius. I rose this
                            morning before him, but saw him, about three quarters of an hour high,
                            and then from the eastern corner of Charles’s house I saw the Sun rise
                            at 5.</p>
                        <p>The Lucifer of this passage of Isaiah denotes also the king of
                            Babylon—but whether <persRef ref="nebuchadnezzar"
                                >Nebuchadnezzar</persRef> or <persRef ref="belshazzar"
                                >Belshazzar</persRef>, is not apparent.</p>
                        <p>In the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> chapter of this book of Isaiah is
                            a distinct prophesy that within three-score and five years, Ephraim
                            shall be broken, that it be not a people— Ephraim is the kingdom of
                            Israel—the ten tribes, and the prophet foretells the Assyrian
                            captivity.— The Lord commands <persRef ref="ahaz">Ahaz</persRef> king of
                            Judah to ask a sign to prove that the confederacy of Ephraim and Syria
                            shall not prevail against Judah— Ahaz refuses to ask a sign, or to tempt
                            the Lord. Whereupon the Lord says he will himself give a sign—and what
                            is the sign?— [“]Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and
                            shall call his name Immanuel.” and in the subsequent verses the
                            destruction of both the kingdoms of Israel and of Judah is predicted to
                            happen before this child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the
                            good— The whole prophesy relates to the wars and alliances of the
                            kingdoms of Judah, Israel and Syria in the days of Ahaz—742 years before
                            the birth of Christ— But in the first chapter of Matthew v. 18–23. it is
                            said that the angel of the Lord appearing to <persRef ref="joseph5"
                                >Joseph</persRef> in a dream, announced to him that <persRef
                                ref="mary">Mary</persRef> was with child by the holy Ghost, and the
                            evangelist says all this was done, that this prophesy of Isaiah might be
                            fulfilled. A prophesy to Ahaz king of Judah, announcing the failure of
                            an actual confederacy of Israel and Syria, against Judah, but predicting
                            the impending destruction of both the Jewish kingdoms, is the casket in
                            which is enchased, the birth 700 years after of the Saviour of the
                            world, begotten by the holy ghost upon a woman and son of God the
                            father, from whom and from the son, the same holy ghost is said in the
                            Athanasian creed to proceed— It were an exercise perhaps more curious
                            than profitable to collate all the passages in the old testament which
                            are quoted in the new as prophesies fulfilled by the advent of Jesus
                            Christ— I received a Letter from <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">Nathaniel
                                Frye</persRef> at Washington 28 August with a Bill of lading for
                            four boxes, one chest and one leather trunk, shipped at Georgetown in
                            the Schooner Forest king, <persRef ref="u">Kelley</persRef> Master for
                            me. The day slipped away, and left no rembrance behind— I walked up the
                            hill at the approach of Sunset, and rode with <persRef

                                Charles</persRef> down to the Mount Wollaston House to meet and take

                                >Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-henry4">Henry</persRef>
                            returning from bathing at the beach— And Charles and his wife spent an
                            Evening hour here— <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> went

                        <p>At the meeting of the Supervisors of the Adams temple, and school fund on
                            the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last October, it had been
                            voted, that there should be a yearly meeting of the board on the first
                            Monday of September, at 11. O’Clock A.M. at the chamber of the selectmen
                            in the new Granite town Hall. There had usually been a meeting once a
                            year since the decease of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>
                            at my house, but it had not been specially prescribed, and in 1844 had
                            from inadvertence been omitted— The permission of the Selectmen for the
                            use of their chamber had been obtained and the Meeting was held this
                            day. All the members of the board present— <persRef
                                ref="greenleaf-thomas">Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> President,

                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf presented the report of the
                            Committee to examine the accounts of the Treasurer <persRef

                            addressed to the Selectmen requesting them to call a town meeting to see
                            if the town will take any measures for carrying into execution my
                            father’s purpose of establishing a classical school in this place— One
                            of the Selectmen had put this paper into the hands of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf as an advisement to the
                            Supervisors— I thought it should be entered on the minutes and a vote
                            should be taken to notify the Selectmen that the Supervisors had no
                            objection to the call of a town meeting, but had no wish for it and were
                            specially desirous, not to encumber the town with any charge whatever,
                            on account of this trust— But my Son and the other members of the board
                            thought that no notice of the paper should be taken of the paper on the
                            minutes, but that it should be returned by M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Greenleaf to the Selectmen, with a verbal assurance that the
                            Supervisors have no objection to the town meeting, but will take no part
                            in calling it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf, alledging his
                            age and infirmities, invited the Supervisors to elect another President,
                            and expressed a wish that I might be chosen, but I pleaded the same
                            disabilities, in at least equal degree—and requested that the
                            consideration of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf’s proposal
                            should be postponed till the next annual meeting, which was formally
                            moved by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy and unanimously voted—
                            About one O’Clock the meeting was dissolved, and I walked home— M<hi

                            preached this morning from 1. John 3.2. [“]Beloved, now are we the Sons
                            of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know, that
                            when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he
                            is— 3. And every man, that hath in him purifieth himself, even as he is
                            pure.”— We are the sons of God? how then is Jesus Christ the only
                            begotten Son of God? He declared himself times without number to be the
                            Son of God, and spoke of God always as my father— But he taught all his
                            disciples to address God, in prayer as our father, and he habitually
                            called himself the Son of Man— He was born of a woman, born under the
                            Law, according to the narrative of the Evangelists nine months after the
                            miraculous conception, and in the same manner as other children are
                            born— But God is a Spirit, and it is in a spiritual sense only that God
                            is the father of Jesus Christ, though not in the same sense that he is
                            the father of all mankind— Jesus Christ suffered crucifixion, for
                            declaring himself to be son of God and sent on a mission to mankind by
                            his father and Christians have involved themselves in
                                <unclear>confusion?</unclear> inextricable by making Jesus himself a
                            God. The whole doctrine of Trinity in Unity, and of the God
                                <unclear>Man</unclear> Jesus Christ is a mass of absurdities as
                            revolting to my intellect as the whole fabulous Pantheon of the Grecian
                            Mythology. The apostle in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts text of
                            this morning admits that it doth not yet appear what we shall be— The
                            state of the human soul after death is yet a mystery— It was so to S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> John after the Resurrection and Ascension
                            of Jesus— It was equally so to <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
                                    rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef> whose description of
                            the Judgment day and his distinction between the corruptible, and
                            incorruptible body, leaves us precisely where we were— In the afternoon
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt preached from 1 Corinthians
                            15.15. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God because we have
                            testified of God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if so
                            be that the dead rise not? The subject was a sequel to that of the
                            morning discourse. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt observed that the
                            resurrection of Jesus Christ was the most important of all the tests of
                            the truth of the Christian Religion and he delivered an elaborate
                            argument in support of the Resurrection, by adducing sundry analogies in
                            the successive changes in physical nature by alternations of life and
                            death, in the mutations of corporeal substances— This was the hottest
                            day of the Season; the Sun poured forth one continuous blaze throughout
                            the day— I saw him set from the Northern porch of <persRef

                        <p>[“]Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Isaiah 40.1.— The
                            voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
                            Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 4. Every valley
                            shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the
                            crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain 5. And the
                            glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
                            together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”</p>
                        <p>This is the transcendent prophesy of the mission of <persRef
                                ref="johnthebaptist">John the Baptist</persRef>, and of the Advent
                            of the Saviour, and as such expressly recognized by all the four
                            evangelists. It is difficult to imagine, and much more to believe the
                            connection between the prophesy and its fulfilment— At the time when the
                            prophet wrote the kingdom of Israel had been conquered by the king of
                            Assyria Tilgath Pileser, and the ten tribes dispersed no one knows
                            where— <persRef ref="sennacherib">Sennacherib</persRef> second successor
                            of Tilgath Pileser was then invading Judea and besieging Jerusalem. This
                            invasion failed, but the prophet even then foretold the approaching
                            destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the Babylonian captivity— So
                            little apparent connection is there between the historical condition of
                            the kingdom of Judah at that period, and the advent and personal
                            biography of Jesus Christ that it requires a profound investigation of
                            Chronology to bring the two periods into any relation with each other—
                            The old testament closes with the extinction of the kingdom of
                            Judah—with an interval of 70 years and a restoration of the Jews to the
                            city of Jerusalem, and the rebuilding the temple under the direction of
                                <persRef ref="ezra">Ezra</persRef> and <persRef ref="nehemiah"
                                >Nehemiah</persRef>— The next step brings us per saltum, to the
                            birth of Jesus Christ at Bethelem in Judea, a Roman Province under the
                            dominion of <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Augustus Caesar</persRef>— In

                            came, in trouble, with a statement that her son, <persRef

                            the last two years has resided at Philadelphia, has been convicted and
                            sentenced for a crime of which she said he was not guilty— I enquired
                            what the crime was—she said Rape, which of course made it difficult for
                            me to talk with her on the subject. She had no copy of the indictment,
                            the verdict or the sentence; all she knew was that he was not guilty of
                            the crime— A Petition had been presented to the <persRef

                            apparently knew not from whom for his pardon, and the Recorder had told
                            them that if I would interpose the pardon would probably be granted. I
                            wrote a Letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, stating the application
                            of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Taylor to me, and that in
                            consideration of the great respectability of her character and the
                            reputation hitherto unsullied of her family, I had complied with her

                            atmosphere was cooled by the thunder shower, and the Summer closed after
                            four days of heat as intense as I ever witnessed.</p>

                        <p>This prophesy is said to have been delivered 712 years before Christ. The
                            birth of Cyrus was 599 and his death 529 years before Christ— The
                            prophesy therefore names Cyrus 113 years before he was born— The
                            proclamation of Cyrus for rebuilding the temple was 536 before Christ—
                            The building of the temple was then commenced, but was soon after

                            it was not until 457 before Christ, that Cyrus went to Jerusalem, and
                            not till 445. that <persRef ref="nehemiah">Nehemiah</persRef> went up—

                            reaching Boston at half-past 9 first visited my shaver <persRef
                                ref="cadmus-william">Cadmus</persRef> 222 Washington Street— He
                            asked me if the gloves I wore were those upon which I wrote the verses
                            he had read in sundry newspapers? I said they were the same— They were
                            first published in a Baltimore paper, and have been copied into several
                            others, but I have never seen them in print. I called upon <persRef

                            found, I said in the Georgics of <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef>.
                            He said he had sought for it there without success—but he got the volume

                            the Georgics, and found it line 82 of the second Book— I asked him if he

                            town any charge. He said he thought the Town meeting for the next annual
                            elections would be time enough for taking up this matter, in which I
                            concurred— There was a primary meeting of whigs last evening at

                            there is no notice of the Perkins professorship of Astronomy and

                            preparation for the report of the Committee: and there is another for

                        <p>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me
                            to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
                            broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of
                            the prison to them that are bound. Isaiah 61.1. Luke 4.18.</p>

                            Commissioner of the United States at the Sandwich Islands wrote me a

                            Isaiah, which I did and the lines were published by him in some

                            lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to
                            offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, by Jesus Christ.” M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt appears to have a fondness for double
                            texts, taking one from the old and the other from the New testament— His
                            object was to illustrate them one by the other— But the verse from the
                            Chronicles is the institution by <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> of
                            the great musical establishment by David, in the worship before the Ark
                            of the Covenant, when he brought it up from the house of Obed-Edom and
                            placed it in a tent, preliminary to the building of the Temple— The
                            history of this establishment of Music vocal and instrumental, as
                            forming a part of the daily service of divine worship is highly
                            interesting, but was not noticed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt—
                            The instruments named in the common English Bible are (ch 13 v. 8)
                            Harps, Psalteries, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets— [(]ch. 15. v 28.)
                            cornet— Psalm 98 Shawms. Daniel 3.4. Sackbut, flute and dulcimer—

                            Psalteries and Harps Nablas and kinyras— But there is little connection
                            between this institution for the daily religious concert of music, by
                            David, and the exhortations of Peter, to all his disciples, converts to
                            Christianity to become an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
                            sacrifices— Yet the analogy between them is not unnatural— In the
                            afternoon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s sermon was from 1.
                            Thessalonians 1.5. [“]For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but
                            also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assurance.” The
                            argument was upon the miracles performed by Jesus Christ and the
                            Apostles, considered as evidences of the truth of Christianity— Towards
                            evening I rode with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> down
                            to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Ex President Quincy’s</persRef>, and

                            between us last Summer relating to the Observatory at Cambridge— He said

                            Resolutions expressing the public feeling at the recent kidnapping and
                            abduction of a negro man who had escaped from his master at New-Orleans
                            and landed in the neighbourhood of Boston— He was pursued, captured and
                            ship’d off for New Orleans, by the Captain of the vessel in which he
                            made his escape, unknown to the captain— But for retaking him the
                            Captain had no authority from the owner of the Negro. There was a
                            meeting last evening of a few persons indignant at this outrage upon the
                            Laws of the Commonwealth and upon the rights of human nature, who
                            resolved to call a public meeting, and these gentlemen came out as a
                            Committee from this primary meeting to give me the invitation— After
                            expressing my sense of the honour done me, I suggested some
                            difficulties, owing to the state of my health, and especially the near
                            extinction of my voice, disqualifying me, if not from attending at least
                            from presiding at such a meeting, I finally promised to attend the
                            meeting if my health would permit; and to preside, if I should be able
                            to rely upon my voice for a hearing— From my house the Gentlemen went up
                            the hill to my Son’s but he was out for a Sea bath, and they did not see

                            itself was in the possession of the town Clerk of Braintree, but so
                            mutilated and defaced, that he wanted my copy made some twenty years

                                ref="quincy-josiah2">Ex President Quincy</persRef> had been here,
                            and left the Papers relating to the Observatory at Cambridge which had
                            passed between us in the Spring and Summer of 1845. These were all
                            intended as preparatory materials and vouchers for a report of the
                            Committee to the board of Overseers to be presented at their meeting
                            during the Session of the Legislature in January 1846. The decline of my
                            health towards the close of the Summer, and through the autumn of 1845
                            disabled me for the composition of the report, and none was made at the
                            winter Session— The same Committee was continued for the present year
                            and on my return from Washington last Month I found the subject
                            precisely where we had left it this time last year— In the meantime the
                            whole subject had so far faded upon my memory that I am more unprepared
                            for writing the report to the overseers than I was then and although my
                            health is partially restored, I am in deep concern for the perseverance
                            and energy my only hope of which is in the passage from holy writ on the

                            they agree with those of modern times— It is said Genesis 4.21. that

                                Frothingham</persRef> preached at the Temple this morning from 2.
                            Chronicles 15.15—last clause of the verse “and the Lord gave them rest
                            round about.” This text lead to the expectation of a discourse upon the
                            blessings of Peace, and the comforts of tranquility to Nations—but after
                            a general allusion to the bearing of the text upon that condition of
                            human Society, and remarking how happy the lot of ever Nation must be in
                            the enjoyment of rest all about, D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            Frothingham said that the Sentiment of the text was quite as applicable
                            to individuals as to Nations, and that he should confine his
                            consideration of it to that view of its Operation— He then enlarged upon
                            rest all about as essential and indispensable to the well-being of man,
                            and pointed out the various sources from which rest round about must be
                            derived— The Greek and Roman philosophy upon the blessing of rest is
                            painted in <persRef ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Ode to Grosphus
                            2.16. Otium Divos rogat impotenti Prensus Egaeo, and the Hebrews both of
                            the Old and New Covenant regard rest as the consummation of all
                            happiness in Heaven as well as on Earth. The Bible tells us that
                            almighty God, after labouring six days in the creation of the world and
                            of man, rested the seventh day and hallowed it— This was the institution
                            of the Sabbath, and consecrated to religious sanctity the alternation of
                            labour and repose as a condition of human existence embracing all its
                            relations and dependencies.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham
                            made however no allusion to the Sabbath, and understood the words rest
                            round about in this passage as imparting only a state of peace and
                            quiet. He dined with us, together with my Son, and in the afternoon
                            preached from 2 Chronicles 15.17—the last clause of the verse—
                            “Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.” M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham dwelt upon the sacred regard
                            to truth in all the narratives of the Scriptures—noticing the plain
                            simple manner in which they relate all the errors and vices and crimes
                            of the most exalted personages of their histories exemplified in the
                            persons of <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef>, <persRef ref="noah"

                            himself. He explained the qualified sense of the word perfect as applied
                            to the heart of Asa all his days; and noticed the exceptions of
                            deviation from rectitude with which he is charged by the historian of
                            the Chronicles himself. He cautioned his hearers also against the error
                            of concluding that perfection of conduct necessarily follows from
                            perfection of the heart— <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi

                            of the lands overflowed by the Mill pond in this town to support the

                            wants it now for a suit at Law, which he has pending in the County Court
                            at Dedham, against George Veazie for a portion of these Lands— I have
                            some recollections of these deeds, and believe that I have them or
                            copies of them somewhere among the private papers of <persRef

                            It has been the constant labour of my life to keep my books and papers
                            in such systematic order that I may know where to find any one of them
                            at five minutes notice, and for many long years I was enabled to do so
                            with tolerable success—but I have now to go back for files and vouchers
                            an documents of seventy years standing: during four several residences
                            in Europe—in France, Holland, Russia, England, and Prussia, besides
                            travels, in Spain, Germany Sweden and Denmark; and eight passages across

                        <p>I had a sleepless Night— Was up between two and three O’Clock of the

                            rose for the day, with a sore throat, a voice nearly extinct, a

                            bound to New-Orleans and sent him back to his Master— Attempts were made

                            hope over his mind gradually declined— My principal annoyance in the
                            decline of years is that I rise in the morning with thoughts occupied
                            exclusively with concern for my health, and the encroachments of gradual
                            decay—the flickering of the light in the socket.— We had a morning visit

                            that— War so far from being discountenanced in the old testament is
                            frequently commanded, and the total destruction of the Canaanitish
                            Nations, was not only enjoined upon the children of Israel, but their

                            of them in Boston—they were brought out in the freight train of railway
                            Cars, and landed at our own house this evening— The vessel was much out
                            of time, and I had almost despaired of ever hearing from her
                            more—especially after we knew she had sailed from Alexandria, there had
                            been two destructive gales of wind on our coast fatal to great numbers

                            of Common prayer— In my mind the blacksmith’s argument recoiled upon
                            himself— Yet I have joined in worship with the episcopal church both in

                            kingdom as a bequest—reigning forty years; endowed with wisdom specially
                            from heaven, prosperous and happy beyond all other men yet falling in
                            his old age beguiled by fair idolatresses, into the foulest worship of
                            the heathens— This parallel and contrast are deeply impressive and were
                            well handled but might have more widely extended— M<hi

                            from Luke 10.29.—“And who is my neighbour?” This text naturally
                            introduces the parable of the good Samaritan, of which Sterne has made
                            such admirable use— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen barely alluded
                            to it, and meddled not at all with the narrative— The subject embraces
                            the origin and history of the feuds and divisions between the Jews and
                            the Samaritans— I suppose them to have arisen as early as the elevation
                            of Saul to the kingdom; and though smothered during his reign, and those
                            of David and Solomon, broke out broke out and became perpetual, on the

                        <p>I am involving myself in scriptural enquiries beyond my depth and the
                            possible consequences of which begin to discourage me in the pursuit—and
                            absorb too much of my time— This conviction bears upon me especially
                            since I have come to the reading of the prophets— From beginning on the
                            first of last December to read every morning two chapters of the common
                            English Bible without note or commentary, I have come to read four
                            chapters every day—the corresponding chapters of <persRef

                            multitudes of new questions that I cannot stop to investigate and I must
                            discard, and give up the chase of the inaccessible mountaintops— The
                            transpositions of the chapters of the Book of Jeremiah, as scrupulously
                            followed by The Septuagint of Thomson is so perplexing that it is like a
                            dislocation of all my limbs—</p>

                        <p>I slept this morning till near four, and rose at that hour— The

                            Procyon and Sirius— Venus rose after five hastening to her conjunction
                            with the Sun and her station as evening Star. Before Sunrise I walked
                            round the Railroad square but the Sun rose beclouded— My symptoms are
                            convalescent, but my weakness still has the mastery over me. I did not
                            cast a look over the Observatory papers, or write a line for the Report
                            of the Committee— <persRef ref="newcomb-george2">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            all possible, and proper attention to it if able to attend at the

                        <p>And behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the ink-horn by his
                            side reported the matter, saying I have done, as thou hast commanded
                            me.</p>
                        <p>Ezekiel 9.11.</p>
                        <p>This man clothed with linen and with an inkhorn at his side, is called in
                            the Septuagint a man clothed in a long robe, and a girdle of sapphire
                            about his loins— The clothing of linen is said by Scott to denote a
                            Priest, and not a Soldier— The inkhorn may be of the same import, but
                            Hewlett thinks the inkhorn out of place, and that ink was not used in
                            those days; but how a man could be girt with a sapphire girdle is more
                            questionable than that he should have an inkhorn at his side— In the
                            vision of Ezekiel this man was charged with two distinct offices—the
                            first was to set a mark upon the foreheads of the righteous persons who
                            lamented and abhorred the crimes and corruptions of the people, and were
                            therefore to be saved from the general destruction of the city: and this
                            was what he reported he had performed: the second was to go in between
                            the wheels and the Cherubim of the Sapphire throne, and fill his hand
                            with coals of fire and scatter them over the city— He was at once a
                            minister of Justice of Mercy, and of Vengeance—</p>

                        <p>We had a visit this afternoon from this Lady one of the <persRef
                                ref="thaxter-catherine;thaxter-elizabeth2">three maiden
                                daughters</persRef> of <persRef key="adams-abigail">my
                                Mother’s</persRef> cousin <persRef ref="thaxter-quincy">Quincy
                                Thaxter</persRef> of Hingham. I received a second Letter from
                                <persRef ref="oxnard-francis">Frederic Oxnard</persRef> of Portland
                            Maine Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 25. 1846. requesting an
                            Autograph— I receive multitudes of such Letters from entire Strangers
                            none of which I have answered for several years— I have not been without
                            questions of the minor morals whether this course is perfectly right— In
                            good fellowship and good neighbourhood, a civil request is entitled to a
                            civil answer— But no one has the right to ask an autograph of an entire
                            stranger, and the subscription of a name, which collectors of autographs
                            generally desire, is liable to dangerous accidents, and to possible
                            monstrous abuses— A discussion upon the right, would be useless, and
                            exposed to ridicule so that I have consider the omission to answer such
                            requests as a prudent and justifiable mode of declining to gratify them
                            I am not however perfectly with my own conclusion— A request for an
                            autograph from a stranger is an act of personal respect and kind
                            feeling— It deserves return in the same spirit though not necessarily
                            witch compliance— Were I not disabled for writing I would in every case
                            comply, and in the omission to answer, my apology to myself is
                            disability controuling my will. I received also a Letter from <persRef
                                ref="adams-daniel3">Daniel Adams</persRef> of Keene New-Hampshire
                            September 24. making enquiries of the genealogy of the Adams family, to
                            ascertain whether he is consanguineous, as <persRef ref="sirtobybelch"
                                >Sir Toby Belch</persRef> says with us; but from the account he
                            gives of himself he appears not to be a chip of the Old block— The Great
                            Western Steamer arrived at New York in 17 days from Liverpool.</p>
