							consisted of immense and almost numberless crowd and among those who
							came here there were some whose personal conduct towards me had not lead
							me to expect visits from them— I deem it not necessary however to record
							their names— The throng of those who came in and went out after a mere

							with a brokerage of one quarter of one per cent. Thence I attended at

								Cole</persRef> had been here with a subscription paper for the

							the Rule to introduce a resolution that the Committee of the whole House

								>Hugh A. Haralson</persRef> Chairman of the Committee on Military

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Milburne</persRef> preached
							from John 3.16. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only
							begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have
							everlasting Life”— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								McClure</persRef> in his Comment upon this text made a very explicit
							exposition of his own Creed for he said that this was perhaps the most
							solemn and important verse of the whole Bible and further that a very
							eminent Divine had once said to him that if by any possible calamity
							every other Book of the Scriptures except the Gospel of <persRef
								ref="john">St John</persRef> and if every Chapter of that Book
							except the 3. should be involved in the same destruction and every verse
							in that chapter should be swallowed up in the same ruin that verse alone
							would be of power to supply the place of the whole scriptures of the Old
							and New Testament— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Milburne expressed no
							dissent from that saying—and his citation of it and his own observation
							upon the same text—sufficiently testify the wholesale Calvanism of his
							Faith <pb n="367" type="ms"/>Now the whole of this Chapter carries to my
							mind a strong suspicion that it was interpolated into the Gospel
							according to St John some Centuries after the Advent of Jesus Christ.
							The verse is a part of the conversation between Jesus at a very early
							period of his ministry and <persRef ref="nicodemus">Nicodemus</persRef>
							a Ruler of the Jews, who came to him by night and told him that they
							knew he was a Teacher come from God, because he had performed miracles
							such as no man could do except God were with him— Jesus thereupon
							announces to him the Doctrine of regeneration and solemnly declares that
							“except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God” Nicodemus
							amazed at this declaration enquires how this can possibly be. Whereupon
							Jesus replies—but foreshadowing the event of his own death and adds this
							verse representing the Love of God to the world as so great, as to have
							given his only begotten Son as a sacrifice to secure everlasting life to
							all who should believe in him— This declaration implied but did not
							expressly assert that he was himself the only begotten Son of God but
							not only did it make not the most distant intimation that He was himself
							a person of the Godhead but directly excluded that idea by assuming that
							He was the Son of God sent by him on a mission to the World of mankind—
							If then, this single verse contains the whole Doctrine of the Christian
							Faith it certainly gives no countenance to the Doctrine of the Trinity
							or of the Divinity of Christ himself but is of itself an irrefragable
							testimony against those articles of a Creed— If he was the Son of God—he
							could not be God, if he was sent by God—he could not have sent himself
							and if this text is the all important Text of the whole scriptures it is
							fatal to the belief of a God in three Persons— In the afternoon at St
							Johns Church the <persRef ref="pyne-smith">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne</persRef> read the
							evening service for the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday after
							Christmas and the Epiphany and preached from Ecclesiastes 8. part of 5.
							verse “A wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment” a sensible
							Discourse on the employment of time— We had no visitors this evening
							which <persRef ref="adams-mary4">my Grandaughter</persRef> spent at
								<persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Madisons</persRef>—</p>

							<pb n="368" type="ms"/>and <persRef ref="smith-caleb">Caleb B.

								Ingersol</persRef> Chairman of that Committee of the following Joint
							resolution— Resolved (the Senate concurring) that the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">President of the United States</persRef> forthwith
							cause the notice to be given to the Government of Great Britain that the
							Convention between the United States and Great Britain concerning the
							Territory of Oregon of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August

							after the expiration of the said term of notice conformably to the

								>th.</hi> of August 1827— And with the report Ingersol had moved by
							Instruction of the Committee that the resolution should be referred to
							the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union and made the
							special Order of the day for the first Monday in February next— The
							report of the Minority concluded with the following resolution— Resolved
							that the Question whether a notice to terminate the Convention between
							the United States of America and Great Britain of October 1818—and
							continued in force by the Convention of August 1827. ought to be given
							is not a matter for the decision of Congress, and upon it this House at
							the present refrains from the expression of any Opinion— The Question
							debated was whether the resolution reported by the Committee should be
							made the Special Order of the day for the first Monday in February—
								<persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Joshua R Giddings</persRef> of Ohio
							after enquiring of the <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef>
							whether upon that Question the merits of the resolution reported might
							be discussed and being answered that to some extent they might made an
							hours Speech in favor of the resolution admitting that differing in
							Opinion from one in believing that it would be followed by War and
							holding War in utter abhorrence he still preferred it with all its
							horrors to the State into which we were now reduced by the Annexation of
							Texas to this Union the Subversion by that event of the balance of Power
							held until that time by the Free States of this Union the Government of
							which was now transferred to an Oligarchy of Slave holders to restore
							that balance the Occupation of the whole Territory of Oregon by the
							United States was indispensably necessary he should therefore go for it
							and hoped for the preliminary notice to be given to Great Britain of the
							termination of the Convention of 1827. as required by that Convention
							itself— He was followed by <persRef ref="mcdowell-joseph"
								>MacDowell</persRef> of the same State who disclaiming all his
							arguments concurred in his intention of voting for the resolution—
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Robert D. Rhett</persRef> of South
							Carolina a member of the Committee of Foreign affairs who had refused to
							vote either for the resolution of the Committee or for the Minority
							report against it, now in an hours speech opposed the giving of the
							notice with all his ability and all his fire— In the course of his
							Speech he made a deadset against me by saying that the Gentleman from
							Massachusetts across the way had shown himself a Hero by voting against
							the last War with England but now was rabid for War with her—for though
							he said he was for Peace all knew <pb n="369" type="ms"/>that the
							tendency and effect of his policy was War— Whereupon I rose and enquired
							whether the Gentleman in what he had just said about a gentleman from
							Massachusetts voting against the last War had alluded to me— He answered
							that he had— I replied the Gentleman is mistaken— He rejoined that at
							all events I did not support it— I said that the last War had commenced
							in 1812 that three years before that time I had been appointed in
							consequence of the support of the measures of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Jeffersons</persRef> Administration against Great Britain, Minister
							of the United States in Russia, that these were facts not known to the
							Gentleman from South Carolina and after expressing some surprise that he
							should have ventured to make such a charge as he had done against me I
							was willing to impute it to ignorance and not to malignity— Rhett clawed
							off as well as he could by acknowledging his ignorance and by
							insinuating that I was not of importance enough for him to have known
							what my conduct had heretofore been—by expressing his horror upon the
							disastrous conjunction on this occasion between me and Giddings and upon
							my inveterate unmitigated hostility to the South whence his Constituents
							expected whenever they saw my vote on one side of a question to see his
							on the other— When he concluded <persRef ref="sims-leonard"
								>Simms</persRef> of Missouri made a speech in favor of giving the

						<p>I deposited in the Bank of Metropolis the order for ninety seven dollars

								>Rhett</persRef> of South Carolina renewed his attack upon me by
							reading the report in the Union newspaper of his charges against me made
							on Monday last and now repeating the charge that I had been opposed to

								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Chancellor Count

								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander’s</persRef> Mediation for Peace
							between the United States and Great Britain and an Extract of my Letter
							to Levitt Harris written at Ghent in 1814. I repelled this renewed
							attack by relating circumstances under which I had made the remarks to
							Count Romanzoff and under which I had written the letter to <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">Levitt Harris</persRef> showing that the charge
							of my having been opposed to the War inferred by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Rhett from these incidents was utterly unfounded and that
							his charge of hostility to the South on my part was equally false for
							proof of which I referred specially to my successful exertions in
							obtaining indemnity for the Slaves taken <pb n="371" type="ms"/>and
							carried away by the British during the last War— I exposed the
							prevarication of his conduct towards me in these repeated wanton and
							unprovoked assaults on me and concluded by saying, I wished to have
							nothing further to do with him— On my saying that I apprehended no War
							because I believed that the present Administration would finally back
							out from their own ground <persRef ref="yancey-william">Yancy</persRef>
							of Alabama called me to order for reflecting upon the Administration—and
							the <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> as usual set me down

							diatribe in which he admitted my services in obtaining indemnity for the

									>r.</hi> Robert Owen</persRef> still full of his magnificent
							projects for a total abolition of the whole world of mankind and the
							universal reformation of all human Society.— Just as I was going to the

								Benjamin Thompson</persRef> of Charlestown, Member of the House from
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congressional District of
							Massachusetts with <persRef ref="thompson-mary3">his wife</persRef> paid
							us a visit— I was consequently delayed and found the House in Session—
								<persRef ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew Johnson</persRef> of Tennessee
							was moving an Amendment to a Bill reported by his Colleague <persRef
								ref="cocke-william2">William M Cocke</persRef> from the Committee of
							Invalid Pensions in favour of <persRef ref="rhea-joseph">Joseph M.
								Rhea</persRef> to commence the first of January 1846 Johnson’s <pb
								n="372" type="ms"/>Amendment was to make the Pension commence at the
							date of the application which was in 1835. He was urging in a snarling
							tone the lavish manner in which Congress was always ready to make
							extravagant appropriations for the District of Columbia contrasted with
							the stinginess with which they were always ready to refuse or contract
							Pensions to the poor war worn Soldier— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Giddings</persRef> called him to order, and the <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> requiring him to state his point
							of order said it was that the appropriations for the District of
							Columbia had nothing to do with the time when the Pension to Joseph M.
							Rhea should commence— The Speaker decided that Johnson was in Order
							whereupon Johnson thanked him for his decision and insultingly said he
							thanked the gentleman from Ohio also Giddings, for not making a Speech
							on Abolition and Slavery in stating his point of Order— Giddings called
							him to order again and now the Speaker said that Johnson was not
							strictly in order and requested him to confine his remark to the subject
							before the House— Giddings called for a positive decision whether
							Johnson was or was not in Order, the Speaker said that he was not, and
							again requested Johnson to proceed in Order— Giddings denied the right
							of the Speaker to authorize Johnson to proceed without a formal vote of
							the House— And this is uniformly the practise of the Speaker when he
							decides that any other than a Slavemonger is out of order— He made no
							reply to Giddings but a Motion was made and carried without opposition
							that Johnson should have leave to proceed— He soon finished and Cocke
							assigned the reasons of the Committee for fixing the commencement of the
							Pension to the first of January 1846. The Bill was referred to the
							Committee of the Whole— <persRef ref="mckay-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">c</hi>Kay</persRef> Chairman of the Committee
							of Ways and Means reported the five Annual Appropriation Bills which
							were referred to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union.
							After sundry other reports from Committees, at the expiration of the

							the Union, <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef> in the Chair,
								<persRef ref="pettit-john">Petit</persRef> of Indiana moved that the

							that the member from Georgia <persRef ref="cobb-howell">Cobb</persRef>
							had the floor upon the Oregon question and that he could not receive
							Petits motion for the Committee to rise— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Cobb accordingly made an hours Speech in favor of giving the notice in
							the form reported by the Committee of Foreign Affairs assigning reasons
							for his objections to the Amendment proposed by <persRef
								ref="hilliard-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Hilliard</persRef>—which he thought would be to shrink from the
							responsibility which ought to be assumed by Congress in casting it off
							in the spiritless manner upon the <persRef ref="polk-james"

								ref="mcclernand-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>I attended this morning the second Meeting of the Select Committee on the
							Smithsonian bequest— Consisting of <persRef ref="owen-robert2">Robert
								Dale Owen</persRef> of Indiana, myself, <persRef
								ref="jenkins-timothy">Timothy Jenkins</persRef> of New York,
								<persRef ref="marsh-george">George P. Marsh</persRef> of Vermont,
								<persRef ref="sims-alexander">Alexander D. Simms</persRef> of South
							Carolina, <persRef ref="davis-jefferson">Jefferson Davis</persRef> of
							Mississippi, and <persRef ref="wilmot-david">David Wilmot</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania—seven. Of whom Simms and Wilmot were this day absent— The
							first meeting of this Committee was held last Saturday, Owen the
							Chairman had notified me the day before of the Meeting but I forgot the
							notification and did not attend— The Bill introduced by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Owen had then been taken up and partially
							discussed but was not printed—it was again taken up this morning, read
							through, and further discussed, but not seperately considered by
							Sections—it was the same Bill with some immaterial alterations which
							passed the Senate at the last Session and the passage of which without
							discussion or debate I with great difficulty prevented on the last night
							of the Session— I now enquired if in framing of this Bill any notice
							whatever had been taken of the Bill reported by the Committee of the
							House in June 1844 at the first Session of the last Congress— It
							appeared that there was not and M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Owen
							said that it had been his impression, and he believed that of the
							Members of the House generally that the purport of that Bill was to
							apply the whole Smithsonian Fund to the Erection of an Astronomical
							Observatory though he had since read the Bill and found that it proposed
							only the appropriation of seven years interest of the Fund to the latter
							object— It was not however that Bill but the one reported at the
							preceding Congress which M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Owen had read
							for the Bill of June 1844 proposed to apply ten years of the Interest of
							the Smithsonian Fund to the Establishment and perpetual support of an
							observatory— I now said that I had given up all idea of Appropriating
							any part of this fund to an Astronomical Observatory in as much as
							Congress had already established one by Law under the austensible
							provision of a Depot for Maps and Charts, the Observatory was built it
							had one of the finest <persRef ref="fraunhofer-joseph"
								>Frauenhofer</persRef> Refractors in the World and skilful Naval
							Officers for <pb n="374" type="ms"/>Observers— The application of the
							Smithsonian fund must be devoted to other objects I should propose
							therefore that at the next meeting of the Committee a Bill introduced by
							the Chairman and referred to this Committee should be taken up and
							considered by Sections, which was agreed to—but I observed that the Bill
							provided an Appropriation from the public Treasury without including any
							provision for the recovery of the Fund itself, which had been invested
							in Bonds of the States of Arkansas, Michigan, Illinois, and Ohio upon
							which excepting a small Portion in Ohio neither Principal nor Interest
							has been paid— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Owen then recurred to the
							Bill reported by the Committee of the House in June 1844 and moved to
							insert into the present Bill the provision entailed in that Bill for the
							recovery of the money vested in the Stocks of those four States—which
							was done and the Committee adjourned to meet next Friday— In the House
								<persRef ref="wentworth-john2">Wentworth</persRef> of Illinois moved
							to suspend the rules to receive Bills of which notice had been given and
							notices of Bills not occasioning Debate— Rejected— <persRef
								ref="smith-truman">Truman Smith</persRef> offered a Resolution to
							arrest the scramble for the floor by requiring the members who propose
							to speak on the Resolution for giving notice of the termination of the

							the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union and should have the
							right to the floor each in his turn—but the House refused to Suspend the

							on Pensions and several months would pass before any decisive action of

							informed that in the present state of Public Affairs it might be

							told him that it was usual for the Chaplains of the House to invite a
							brother Clergyman happening to be here during the Session of Congress to
							preach for them on Sunday morning. That I had no doubt either of the
								<persRef ref="milburn-william;tustin-septimus">Chaplains</persRef>
							would willingly give him the opportunity of delivering a Discourse in
							favor of peace and leave to his discretion his manner of treating the
							subject. <persRef ref="otis-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John

								<persRef ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>— At the House

								ref="ritchie-thomas">Editors</persRef> of which are the Printers of
							the House and in which he was charged with falsehood by charging <pb
								n="376" type="ms"/>unecessary delay in the delivery to the Members
							of the House of the Pub. Doc printed by its order M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hudson made a statement proving that his
							charge had been perfectly well founded with regard to the delay and
							after justifying himself said that he had no motion to make but left the
							House to act in the matter as they should think proper— In making this
							statement M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hudson was repeatedly, rudely
							and insultingly interrupted by <persRef ref="mcconnell-felix">Felix. G.
									M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Connell</persRef> of Alabama by
							calls to order which the <persRef ref="davis-john8">speaker</persRef>
							did not sustain and of which Hudson himself took no notice. When he

							offered the following Resolution “Whereas <persRef ref="heiss-john">John

							in a newspaper charged Charles Hudson a Member of this House with
							falsehood in Debate therefore resolved that the said John P. Heiss be
							dismissed from the employment of the House as one of its Printers.” This
							immediately started an angry and disorderly Debate in which M<hi

							times till Davis said—“I take no notice of a drunken blaguard” which
							produced quite a sensation—but some of M<hi rend="superscript"
							>c</hi>Connell’s friends gathered round him and prevailed upon him to
							leave the House to which he did not this day return— A long Debate
							followed upon Garrett Davis Resolution which was finally laid on the
							Table on a motion of <persRef ref="bayly-thomas3">Thomas H.
								Bayly</persRef> of Virginia at the close of a long Speech The vote
							to lay on the Table by yeas and nays was 100. to 85. I voted in the

							had heard much about them and mentioned circumstances which came to her

							and of which I had never before heard— She said that she had a Copy of

							Predestination yet he enlarged much upon his profession as an Embassador

							salvation of men— I cannot comprehend the consistency of these Doctrines
							with each other, for if the Predestination of the Fate of Men be

							can be effectual to change it— In the afternoon at Saint Johns Church
								<persRef ref="pyne-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Pyne</persRef> read the evening Service for the second Sunday after
							the Epiphany and preached from Ephesians 2.8. “For by grace are ye saved

							Calvanism again, excluding the idea that any man’s salvation depends
							upon himself, or can be obtained by any effort of his own to be
							reconciled to God. A Doctrine still more enforced by the verse
							immediately following that of the text—“Not of works lest any man should
							boast” M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne however largely commenting
							upon the <unclear>. . .</unclear> is the “gift of God” still admitted that human efforts
							are not entirely useless for securing that grace which accomplishes

						<p>A person by name <persRef ref="fundy-ahasuerus">Ahasuerus Fundy</persRef>
							representing himself as belonging to Water<unclear>vliet</unclear> in the State of New
							York was here this morning— He stated that he had been into Virginia
							upon some business of his own and had come so far back on his way home
							and was now destitute of the means of paying the cost of his return. He
							told a plausible story and prevailed upon me to lend him five dollars to
							make his way home with a promise of repayment within three weeks— I
							expect to hear from him no more. At <pb n="393" type="ms"/>10. o’clock
							this morning I attended at the Capitol a Meeting of the Committee on the
							Smithsonian Bequest. There were present <persRef ref="owen-robert2"
								>Owen</persRef> Adams, <persRef ref="jenkins-timothy"
								>Jenkins</persRef>, <persRef ref="marsh-george">Marsh</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="sims-alexander">Sims</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="davis-jefferson">Davis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wilmot-david">Wilmot</persRef>—all the members. The discussion
							was renewed upon the Question whether the Directors of the Institution
							should be constituted in express terms a Corporation for which purpose
							the Chairman Owen moved a re-consideration of the decision made at the
							last meeting. it was again debated and again decided to make it a
							Corporation the vote now being 4. to 3. Owen Chairman changing his vote
							to the negative and Sims of South Carolina still voting for the
							Corporation with the avowed intention of voting against the whole Bill
							and declaring his purpose to have the whole money sent back to the
							English Court of Chancery— I told him that I thought this proposition
							came rather late, after the formal acaptance of the bequest and the
							appropriation of the money to other purposes with a formal pledge of the
							Faith of the United States that it should be applied to the objects
							designated by the donor. It was however the original proposition of
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef> and will be
							persisted in by the South Carolina School of politics and morals to the
							last, without any idea of returning the money but with the purpose of
							defeating any useful application of it— I proposed a provision that all
							the proceeds of the Bequest be placed in the possession of the Treasurer
							of the United States with a direction that separate accounts of it
							should be kept from those of all the other accounts at the Treasury—
							This had been done in the Act of 1836 which the Committee considered as
							no longer obligatory since the investment of the Fund almost entirely in
							Stocks of the States. The provision itself in the <unclear>Act</unclear> 1836 was
							questioned until I produced it and the provision was now at my motion
							re-inserted in the present Bill. The Committee adjourned to next Friday—
							In the House <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Giddings</persRef> rose to a Question of privilege. He
							sent to the <persRef ref="french-benjamin">Clerk</persRef> a Report in
							the National Intelligencer of the speech of <persRef
								ref="bedinger-henry">Henry Bedinger</persRef> of Virginia delivered
							on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> requiring the Clerk to read one paragraph of it grossly
							insulting him Giddings not by name but with referrence to him equally
							clear. On commencing his comment he was interrupted by the <persRef
								ref="davis-john8">speaker</persRef> who observed that leave had not
							been given him to Address the House on the subject— <persRef
								ref="vance-joseph">Vantz</persRef> moved that he have leave to
							proceed which was carried without opposition— Giddings said that when
							Bedinger had made this assault upon him he was not present in the House
							and had not seen the Report till yesterday when it first <pb n="394"
								type="ms"/>appeared in print. He then referred to a publication in
							the Savannah Republican the <persRef ref="locke-joseph">Editor</persRef>
							of which he said he understood was a Slave Dealer which article in
							giving an Account of Bendingers Speech had said that the only way to
							treat Giddings, was by contempt at the Capitol and holding him up to the
							scorn of the people thoughout the length and breadth of the Land For
							that if the House should expel him he would doubtless be returned again
							by his Constituents. He then added that in the Union newspaper of
							yesterday a Letter purporting to be written by the New York
							correspondent of that newspaper urges the same course of conduct and
							quotes the New York Observer a Religious Paper of that City expressing
							the same sentiments— Giddings remarked the coincidence between these
							articles of the newspaper press with the speech of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bedinger and the fact that yesterday one
							of the Reporters of the leading Whig paper of this City (<persRef
								ref="stansbury-arthur">Stanbury</persRef> reporter for National
							Intelligencer) was hawking about a caricature designed to aid the more
							elevated calumniaters in their work of detraction— In which caricature
							he Giddings was made the principal figure. he stated of these facts to
							the House as indications of a combination to overawe and intimidate the
							members of this House in the discharge of their duties to their
							constituents which he thought should be known throughout the length and
							breadth of the Land. That so far as concerned himself personally the
							combination came too late he was not sent here for personal altercation
							with any member of the House nor was it in the power of any such
							combination to influence or injure him. Bedinger rose and said he was
							not aware that Giddings was not in his Seat at the time when he made the
							remarks to which he had referred that he should have used the same words
							if he had been in his seat that he had as little desire of controversy
							with him as he on his part could desire that although he might be
							ambitious it was not of tilting windmills that he regreted the remarks
							he had made only because they might have helped Giddings in obtaining
							notoriety— <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef> from
							Committee on Military Affairs asked leave to make a Report relating to
							the defences of the Country. Schenck objected unless all the Committees
							should be called for Reports and moved to postpone the consideration of
							the Florida election till the Committees should have been called for
							Reports but the House refused— The Florida Election was resumed and the
							sitting member <persRef ref="cabell-edward">Cabell</persRef> made an
							hour speech in support of his right <pb n="395" type="ms"/>to the seat—
								<persRef ref="brockenbrough-william2">Brockenbrough</persRef>
							replied by a personal explanation sliding into an Argument. <persRef
								ref="schenck-robert">Schenck</persRef> moved that each of the
							parties should have an other hour—which the House refused <persRef
								ref="culver-erastus">Culver</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dobbin-james">Dobbin</persRef> members of the Committee of

								>Brinkerhoff</persRef> moved the Previous Question which was not
							seconded, and the House adjourned on motion of <persRef
								ref="stephens-alexander">Stevens</persRef> of Georgia— Stansbury the
							reporter of Intelligencer and Author of the caricature complained of by
							Giddings went round the house after the adjournment raving against
							Giddings who he said had yesterday seen the caricature recognized
							himself as the principal figure in it with a hearty laugh as Stansbury
							had supposed of approbation. <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi

								Beck</persRef> was here this morning and said she proposed to leave
							the City, this afternoon, that the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions
							at a meeting of only four of its members had refused to take up her
							Petition and returned it to her— <persRef ref="atkinson-archibald">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Archibald Atkinson</persRef> one of
							its members from Virginia, having observed in her presence that he was
							not willing to tax his Constituents for such Claims— I requested her to
							leave the Petition with me and postpone her departure for two or three
							days during which time I would speak to the Chairman of the Committee
							and deliver to him the Papers in support of her Claim which she had left
							but which the Committee had not received perhaps they might change the
							views of the Committee and induce them to make a favorable Report. At
							the meeting of the House I spoke accordingly to <persRef
								ref="brodhead-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Brodhead</persRef> who told me that M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							Beck had misunderstood the proceedings of the Committee in returning her
							Petition to her which had been in order that she might produce the
							testimony in support of her claim I delivered the Petition and papers
							and he assured me that if the testimony would warrant a favourable
							report I might depend that it would be made. I informed M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Beck of this assurance of the Chairman
							of the Committee— In the House, the Report of the Committee of Elections
							on the Florida case was resumed and debated by <persRef
								ref="stephens-alexander">Stephens</persRef> of Georgia <persRef
								ref="seddon-james">Seddon</persRef> of Virginia <pb n="396"
								type="ms"/>and others till the Previous Question was twice moved and
							the second time succeeded. The two Resolutions reported by the majority
							of the Committee first that <persRef ref="cabell-edward">Edward. C.
								Cabell</persRef> is not and that <persRef
								ref="brockenbrough-william2">William H. Brockenbrough</persRef> is
							entitled to the seat as Representative from the State of Florida were
							successively carried by yeas and nays the first 105 to 80. the second
							99. to 85. <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Jacob Thompson</persRef> of
							Mississippi then moved a reconsideration of these votes, and a
							Resolution to continue the call, till some day in February for further
							proof But the reconsideration was refused by yeas and nays 86. to 92 and
							the oath of Office was administered by the <persRef ref="davis-john8"
								>Speaker</persRef>, to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Brockenbrough
							after which the House adjourned. The decision in this case as in every
							other case of a contested election except one since I have been a member
							of the House was glaringly unjust and that was decided by majority of
							one vote. in this case the decision was by a close Party vote and by
							majorities, of 15 and less, the usual majority of the dominant party,
							being from 75 to 80. As I was walking home from the Capital I met
								<persRef ref="sutherland-joel">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Sutherland</persRef> who enquired if I had heard the news brought by
							the Hibernia Steamer arrived at Boston I had not. he said the substance

							had not been able to form an Administration in England and that <persRef
								ref="peel-robert">Sir Robert Peel</persRef> and his abdicated

								Tustan</persRef> the Chaplain of the Senate, was in attendance, gave
							out the Hymn, which was sung in the old fashion, of reading over two
							lines at a time, and made the prayer. The preacher, was a <persRef
								ref="bonhomme-sillian">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sillian
								Bonhomme</persRef>, a Converted French Israelite, and his discourse,
							was from Luke, 21.24. “And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and
							shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be
							trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be
							fulfilled”— The subject was the dispersion and future restoration of the
							Jews Immediately after announcing the text he turned back, to the 28.
							&amp; 29. 30. Chapters of Deuteronomy containing the narrative of the
							blessings and curses promised and denounced by Jehovah as the future <pb
								n="397" type="ms"/>destiny of the children of Israel according as
							they should prove faithful to their covenant or disobedient to the
							commandments of their God. He then remarked upon the fulfilment of those
							prophecies upon the prosperity which they had enjoyed, so long as they
							had been true to their obligations and to the will of their Maker and
							upon the two captivities which they had endured in consequence, of their
							corruption and rebellion against God. The first of these captivities, he
							said, that of Judah was temporarary having last seventy years after
							which he had been restored to the Country by <unclear><persRef ref="cyrus-ii"
								>Sirus</persRef></unclear> conformably to a prophecy of <persRef ref="isaiah"
								>Isaiah</persRef>, predicting Sirus by name two hundred years before
							he was born <unclear>By</unclear> the second captivity the ten tribes of Israel had been
							dispersed among all nations of the earth, and that dispersion had
							continued until the present day there being now fifteen millions of Jews
							scattered through the four quarters of the Globe— He then proceeded to
							indicate the circumstances which portended the final restoration of the
							Jews according to the Prophecies yet unfulfilled but written in the 28
							29. and 30. Chapters of the Book of Dueteronomy.— This he contended was
							to be accomplished by the final conversion of all the Jews to the
							Christian Faith of which he was himself one of the pledges That he had
							been born and bred an Israelite that in the course of his own education,
							and by his own investigations historical, moral and religious he had
							become convinced of the truth of Christianity and of the Divine Mission
							of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament That he had for many years
							preached Christ crucified, to his own kindred the Jews in various parts
							of the world and with encouraging success— He gave numerous instances of
							Jews who had been converted to the Faith of Christ by his labors and who
							had received the rite of Baptism. He concluded by saying that as it was
							not usual to take up a collection in that Hall, he would give notice
							that if any person was disposed to make a small contribution to promote
							the success of this work he might deposit his gift in the hands of any
							of the Clergymen of this City— In the afternoon at St John’s Church a
							Stranger, read prayers for the third Sunday after Epiphany, and preached
							from Matthew 12.18. “Behold my servant, whom I have chosen My beloved,
							in whom my Soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him and he
							shall show judgment to the Gentiles. 19. He shall not strive nor cry,
							neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets 20. A bruised reed
							shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send
							forth judgment unto victory. 21. And in his name <pb
								n="398" type="ms"/>shall the
							Gentiles trust”— The preacher observed that this was a quotation, from a
							prophecy in the Book of Isaiah. 42 Chapter 1. and following verses—and
							he alledged the reasons for concluding that that passage from the
							Prophet could apply to no other person than to Jesus Christ. The
								<persRef ref="matthew">Apostle Matthew</persRef> expressly declares
							it to be the fulfilment of that Prophecy but some of the Modern Biblical
							commentators have made it a Question— <persRef ref="seward-william">Gov

								ref="king-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Charles B.
								King</persRef> the Painter were here this evening— Gov Seward has
							been passing some days at Richmond Virginia. He spoke of some
							proceedings in the Legislature of New York and counter proceedings of
							certain Whigs of the City New York respecting the Oregon Question
							portending some dissension of opinions the result of which he seemed to
							think was doubtful—but he said that the recent news of Ministerial
							revolutions in England had revived the belligerent spirit of the
							Administration Party here—</p>

						<p>Further evidence appears of the flinching of the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> Administration upon the Oregon
							Controversy with Great Britain— In the Union newspaper of last
							Tuesday—there was an Article, strongly intimating, that if a proposition
							should be made on the part of Great Britain to take the<space/>of the 49.
							degree of Latitude as the Boundary to the Pacific Ocean, describing it
							as the offer made by me it might now be accepted. In the Debate in the
							Senate on Wednesday this Article was referred to, by <persRef
								ref="miller-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Miller</persRef>
							a Senator from New Jersey as very clearly indicating that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Polk has no fear of war to arise from
							this Question <persRef ref="hannegan-edward">Edward. A.
								Hannagan</persRef> Senator from Indiana rose and averred upon his
							responsibility that this Article had never been seen by President Polk
							before its publication and was not approved by him— The Union of this
							day admits the fact, but repeats the opinion expressed in the original
							Article— At ten o’clock this morning I attended a meeting of the Select
							Commitee on the Smithsonian Bequest present six Members—<persRef
								ref="owen-robert2">Owen</persRef>, Adams, <persRef
								ref="jenkins-timothy">Jenkins</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="sims-alexander">Sims</persRef>—<persRef ref="davis-jefferson"
								>Davis</persRef>, <persRef ref="wilmot-david"
							>Wilmot</persRef>—absent <persRef ref="marsh-george">Marsh</persRef> of
							Vermont who afterwards told me that it was because he had forgotten the
							time of the Meeting—Some progress very little was made in the discussion
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Owen’s Bill, in the Sixth Section
							provision is made for a superintendant to take charge of the ground,
							Buildings and property belonging to the Institution—and also for the
							Appointment of a Professor of Agriculture, Horticulture and Rural
							economy and also for a distribution among the people of the Union of
							Fruits, Plants, Seeds and Vegetables to be collected by this
							Superintendent with the Professor, and Gardiners, practical
							Agriculturists, and Labourers to be hired from time to time by him, as
							may be necessary— I moved to strike out this Section, which consider as
							a cumbersome expensive, and useless burden upon the Institution— It was
							connected also with a further project, declared in the seventh Section,
							for the appointment of a Normal Branch of the Institution, with an
							indefinite number of professors of common School and other scientific
							Instruction—all which I proposed to expunge from the Bill— The
							discussion was desultory, and before taking the Question upon it some
							Amendments of detail to the Sixth Section were proposed and debated
							until the meeting of the House when the Committee adjourned to next
							Friday. At the House the Committees were called for Reports—many of
							which were made, but none of any material importance. <persRef
								ref="stephens-alexander">Stephens</persRef> of Georgia presented <pb
								n="404" type="ms"/>resolutions from that state claiming
							re-imbursements for sundry expenses incurred by that State in the late
							Wars with the Indians, commonly called the Florida War. Committee of the
							Whole on State of the Union—<persRef ref="tibbatts-john"
								>Tibbatts</persRef> in the Chair. <persRef ref="hoge-joseph">Joseph
								P. Hoge</persRef> of Galena Illinois and <persRef ref="wick-william"
								>William Wick</persRef> of Indianapolis <unclear>Illinois</unclear> in two successive
							hour Speeches supported the giving of the Notice and took to task the
							latter with merciless sarcasm, the contrast of bullying and of sneaking
							off the South Carolina politicians with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef> at their head.
							He ridiculed their clamours about war, though he admitted, that War
							might terminate in the result of this Controversy and <persRef ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew Johnson</persRef> of
							Tennessee took the floor but the Bill was laid aside and a Bill from the
							Senate to establish certain post roads in the State of Texas was taken
							up— <persRef ref="culver-erastus">Erastus. D. Culver</persRef> of Greenwich New York, made an hour Speech
							against the Bill on the grounds of unconstitutionality insisting that
							the Annexation of Texas to this Union by mere Act of Congress was
							UnConstitutional null and void and would be so decided he had no doubt
							by the Supreme Court of the United States if the Question could be
							brought before them. He reviewed with severe censure all the proceedings
							of the Democratic Party and of the Administration in the rise, progress
							and consummation of that iniquitous measure— He adverted to the
							deception practised upon the People of the North at the Baltimore
							Convention by the substitution of James K Polk for <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef> as
							the candidate of the Party for the Presidency of the United States, and
							in the adoption of two Resolutions <unclear>one</unclear> for the Annexation of Texas and
							the other declaring the right of the United States to the whole of
							Oregon to 54.40— as clear and unquestionable and now after completing
							the Annexation of Texas falling back and manifesting the design to
							abandon if not the whole a large portion of Oregon even to the mouth of
							Columbia river with the free navigation of it— Culver was several times
							called to order by southern members—and especially in a very insulting
							manner by <persRef ref="mcconnell-felix">M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Connell</persRef> of Alabama but the
							Chairman steadily and resolutely declared him in order to the great
							annoyance of the interrupting members who dared not however take an
							appeal from his decisions— Culver finished his Speech without losing his
							temper and M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Connell sputtered a few
							sentences in reply to him of personal insult of which he took no notice—
							The Committee of the Whole then reported the Bill and with the help of
							the Previous Question it was passed <pb n="405" type="ms"/>without
							Amendment and without further opposition. <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> went to an
							evening Party at the House of <persRef ref="marcy-william">Gov. Marcy</persRef> the Secretary of War, and we

						<p>I found the House this morning in Debate upon a Resolution moved to print

							the Speaker. Committee of the whole on the State of the Union on a Bill
							relating to Custom House Officers which was debated reported to the
							House, and passed. The House subsequently went into Committee of the
							Whole on the State of the Union again <persRef ref="tibbatts-john">Tibbatts</persRef> in the Chair and took up
							the Oregon Notice Resolution <persRef ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew Johnson</persRef> of Tennessee, made an hour
							speech for earnest in support of giving the notice, in which much to my
							surprise, he completely <unclear>refuted</unclear> a charge against me, made by <persRef ref="bayly-thomas3">Thomas H.
							Bayly</persRef> from<space/>Virginia, who by reading garbled extracts from my speech
							made on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> January last year, had
							misrepresented my opinions then expressed as being inconsistent with my
							Speech on the same subject at the present Session. Bayly who is a
							Beef-witted blunderhead had borrowed this charge, from some of the Party
							newspapers, without discovering the false colouring wilfully and
							intentionally given, by the Articles in the newspapers to my Speeches at
							the two different periods. The inconsistency imputed to me, was by
							picking out from my last winters speech the opposition that I had then
							made to the Bill for organizing the Oregon Territory reported without a
							section for giving notice to Great Britain of the termination of the non
							occupation Convention. I had said that this would be equivalent to war
							which if thus incurred I had foretold would prove not only disastrous
							but unjust and unpopular— This morning before the House went into
							Committee on this subject Johnson came to me and referring to the attack
							upon me made by Bayly said he had understood my speech in a total
							different sense and that my objections had been made entirely <pb
								n="406" type="ms"/>provision for giving the Previous Notice of
							twelve months required by the Convention and he observed that I had
							actually proposed as an Amendment to the Bill, a first section directing
							the notice to be given which the House had rejected though afterwards
							they had adopted a similar Section at the close of the Bill moved by
							<unclear>Hamet?</unclear> of Mississippi and that I had then said that after long
							deliberation and with great reluctance I had come to the conclusion that
							the time was come for giving the notice and was ready to vote for
							it—either by a separate resolution or as a first section to the
							Territorial— I told Johnson that he perfectly understood my speech as I
							had then delivered it and that it had been totally misrepresented by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bayly. I did not then know nor
							expect that Johnson meant to expose the misrepresentation of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bayly, but he did so in his speech,
							thoroughly and unsparingly. I had intended, to perform that service
							myself which I shall perhaps now forbear to do. <persRef ref="wood-bradford">M<hi rend="superscript"
