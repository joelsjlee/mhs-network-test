						<p>A <persRef ref="u">Captain Gamonskie</persRef>, a Polish Exile was here
							this morning, requesting assistance, which I was not able to afford him—
							I enclosed to <persRef ref="hoyt-william">W. K. Hoyt</persRef> of New

									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Ann Pearsee</persRef> would be
							referred to the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions, of the House of
							Representatives, and I accordingly entered the petition, in the Clerks
							Office, and directed its referrence, to that Committee— At the House
								<persRef ref="kaufman-david">David. S. Kauffman</persRef>, appeared
							as one of the Representatives of the State of Texas and was sworn in, by
							the <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef> and took his Seat, as a
							member of the House— The Speaker announced, the business relating to the
							Territories as the special order, for this day. <persRef
								ref="dockery-alfred">Alfred Dockery</persRef> asked leave to offer,
							three resolutions relating to Post Offices contracts. But they were not
							received— Two Bills were presented, from the Committee on the District
							of Columbia, and referred— Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="bowlin-james">James. B. Bowlin</persRef> of Missouri, in the
							Chair, on Territorial business. The first Bill, taken up, was to aid, in
							the construction of certain roads, in the Territory of Wisconsin— There
							were a multitude of appropriations to which sundry others were added by
							Amendments and after several failures to vote for want of a quorum
								<persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef>, Chairman of the
							Military Committee, moved to rise, to take up a Bill from the Senate,
							supplemental to the Act providing for the prosecution of the War against
							Mexico— Haralsons motion was rejected, and the Bill taken up, making
							appropriations, for improvements in the Territory of Iowa— As a sample
							of the mode of proceeding in the House <persRef ref="mcconnell-felix"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Connell</persRef> of Alabama,
							moved an Amendment for breaking up the running gear of ruin <pb n="605"
								type="ms"/>and foul Legislation two-millions of dollars— It passed
							unnoticed— Sundry other Territorial Bills followed, among which, one, to
							direct the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef> of the United
							States to sell, the reserved mineral Lands, in the States of Illinois
							and Arkansas, and the Territories of Wisconsin and Iowa— I objected to
							using the word direct, as applied to the President— Upon which the
								phrase<unclear>ology</unclear> was altered— The debate was continued
							till the Committee rose without coming to a conclusion, and the House
							adjourned— <persRef ref="seaton-william">William. W. Seaton</persRef>

							<persRef ref="hpandwctaylor">H. P. and W. C. Taylor</persRef> several

							to ask them to receive payment for it, but <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> shamed me out of that
							fancy and I merely accepted it with thanks— My principle has always been
							to refuse all presents offered to me as a Public Man, but where the
							value is very small I thought it would be ridiculous to make a point
							upon it— It has not always been easy for me to draw the line of
							distinction— <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="burt-armistead">Armistead Burt</persRef>, moved a

								<persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> moved to lay
							the resolution on the Table; which was refused, and the resolution
							adopted by yeas and nays, 93. to 66.— The House went into Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union, immediately upon that Bill— Garrett
							Davis made an hour Speech not so much against the Bill, as against the
							Executive Administration for having placed <persRef ref="taylor-zachary"
								>General Taylor</persRef> and his Troops, in the most imminent
							danger without providing for him seasonable re-inforcments. Whereupon,
							Burt moved that the committee should rise for a resolution to extend the
							time of debate—which was done. The further consideration of Territorial
							Bills, was then postponed to next Tuesday, and the time for the debate
							on the supplementary War Bill was extended to two oclock P.M. tomorrow—
							Then the House went into committee of the whole again, on the same Bill,
							and <persRef ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef>, and <persRef

							Cherokee Indians.— <persRef ref="morris-joseph2">Joseph Morris</persRef>

							of the Committee of Private Land Claims, reported back, two Bills from

							of Maryland—six of the nine are from the States, where the Public Lands
							are situated, and the <persRef ref="davis-john8">Speaker</persRef>
							himself is from Indiana, one of them— They have a glorious propensity,
							to give away the Lands. The two Bills reported by Bowlin, were referred
							to the committee of the whole <pb n="612" type="ms"/>on the State of the
							Union— <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> of Kentucky,
							asked leave to introduce a resolution of enquiry of the Heads of

							been let, to the lowest bidder, according to Law— Objection was made,
							Davis moved a suspension of the rules, upon which the vote by yeas and
							nays, was 72 to 66. not two-thirds and so the enquiry was suppressed—
								<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert. C. Winthrop</persRef> from

							Illinois another member of the same Committee, had gone off in the same
							way; both of them intending to raise Troops to go as Volunteers to the
							War against Mexico. After some discussion on the irregularity of this
							proceeding, Haralson moved to excuse Yell, from further service on
							military Committee, which was adopted— The Speaker said that he would
							have it so entered on the Journal, that it should not be referred to as
							a precedent, hereafter— Both of these members have gone away, without
							notice to the House, and without intending to return— This though in
							direct violation of a rule of the House, and a gross violation of the
							duty of the Member to his Constituents and to his Country, has become a
							very general practise, and the motive <pb n="613" type="ms"/>for it, is
							as mean, as the practise itself, is vicious— The rule is, “that no
							member shall absent himself, from the service of the House, without its
							permission, but if he asks and obtains permission his pay is suspended,
							during his absence”— If he goes without permission, his pay continues
							without suspension, and Members absent themselves for weeks, and
							sometimes for months, and receive pay, as if their attendance had been
							without interruption— Two or three private Bills, reported yesterday
							from the committee of the whole House, were then passed, and <persRef
								ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew Johnson</persRef> of Tennessee, asked
							leave to introduce a Joint-resolution to close the Session on Monday the

							A.M. the vote on suspending the rules was 111. to 64. not two thirds,

							for M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pyne, in the necessity under which

							prescribed that that in process of time it should be divided into
							States, not less than three, nor more than five In fulfilment of this

						<p>I received this morning a Letter from Dudley. C. Evans.— Worcester 22<hi

							statistical facts, in regard to the subject of Slavery—Enquiries which
							it would take me much more time and labor, than I can bestow upon them,
							to answer satisfactorily— I scarcely know even where to refer him, to
							the Documents which would contain the information that he desires— I met

							upon hearing this text and seeing not one third of the seats of the
							Members of the House occupied— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Tustin
							however was in nowise disconcerted at the prospect, but delivered a
							discourse not according to the severe doctrine, of the Old Presbyterian
							School, which allows, no free will to man no capacity to work out his
							own salvation but on the contrary urging earnestly from the text, that
							it implied, the power of exercising the will, in every individual, by
							making it a charge upon his Auditory that they would not exercise it— A
							charge which could of course, have no application <pb n="647" type="ms"
							/>to them, if they were denied the power. M<hi rend="superscript"

							Services, in the Hall of the House on Sundays, he can set the time, for
							singing the Hymn, and can sing himself, even if he has no hearer to join
							in making melody. Other preachers in that place, frequently have not the
							same power and the singing is entirely omitted— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Tustin gives out two lines at a time, and then sets the
							time, usually followed by a few of the hearers. After dinner at the 2<hi

								ref="nourse-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Charles H.
								Nourse</persRef>, a Licentiate of the Presbytery of this District,

							of God.” 9. “But he, that denieth me before men, shall be denied before
							the Angels of God”— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Nourse is not a
							young man nor was there any thing very remarkable in his discourse. We
							had rain all the evening, and <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
