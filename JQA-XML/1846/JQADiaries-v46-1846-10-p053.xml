                        <p>Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the
                            daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? Ezekiel 13.12.</p>
                        <p>The reading of this passage in <persRef ref="thomson-charles"
                                >Thomson’s</persRef> version of the Septuagint is—[“]Now when the

                            which you anointed it”— But the discourse is of cement and not of
                            ointment—not of salve but of untempered mortar— The daubing of the
                            common bible is better than the ointment of the Septuagint— <persRef

                                Emmons</persRef> in their new house. I found them just ready for
                            tea, with two of their six children— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Emmons’s business is in Boston to which he goes by the morning Railway
                            Cars, and returns between 4. and 5 in the afternoon— The Steamboat and
                            the Railway are working out a revolution in the domestic life of the
                            people of this and of many other Countries, the extent of which it is
                            impossible to foretell. Its tendency here is to concentrate and multiply
                            population— The Railway travel and transportation is of infinite
                            importance to this town, both in its manufacturing interests almost
                            coeval with its first settlements, and to its treasure richer that Mines
                            of diamond or gold—its granite rocks, deemed worthless, little less than

                            to come it— The Ladies went to Boston in the Coach and returned home all
                            safe between 7 and 8 O’Clock, but we were kept till near 9 in painful
                            suspense for my grandson <persRef ref="adams-john17">John
                                Quincy</persRef>, who goes every day to school at Boston, and
                            returns with the evening train of Cars.— By an unlucky and careless
                            accident an engine without any cars attached to it, ran off the railway
                            bridge at the draw, which was raised, and fell into the river— The cars
                            coming from Boston at 7 in the evening were thus arrested at the
                            Neponset Station two or three hours— John Quincy was a passenger in one
                            of them— As soon as the Ladies came home they sent the Carriage back in
                            search of him— He had undertaken to walk from the Neponset Station home,
                            and met the Carriage going for him near <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"

                            series of years till completed; but was then soon disposed of— A second
                            Edition in three volumes was equally successful, and this I believe is
                            the third; said to be revised and edited by <persRef ref="conrad-robert"

                        <p>I went in to Boston this morning in the special train of Cars from South
                            Braintree, which left that place at half past ten, and the depot at
                            Quincy a quarter before eleven— We passed the Stations of Neponset,
                            Dorchester and Savin Hill and alighted in Boston at a quarter past 11.
                            Half an hour is the regular average time for the passage between the
                            Station at Quincy and Boston. My Granddaughter <persRef

                        <p>For thus saith the Lord God, Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and
                            stamped with thy feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite
                            against the land of Israel; 7. Behold therefore, I will stretch out mine
                            hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I
                            will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out
                            of the countries: I will deliver thee; and thou shalt know that I am the

                        <p>This is said of the Ammonites the descendants from <persRef ref="lot"
                                >Lot</persRef>, by one of his daughters— This chapter contains
                            similar denunciations against <persRef ref="moab">Moab</persRef>, the
                            progeny of Lot by his other daughter, and against Seir the Land of the

                            are threatened with destruction, because they exulted at the subjugation
                            of the children of Israel— All these Nations had nothing in common with
                            the Philistines or any of the Canaanitish Nations, which were descended

                        <p>This was communion day at the Temple, and the day when the hours of the

                            henceforth at half past 10 instead of 10 in the morning, and at a

                                Lunt’s</persRef> morning text was Revelation 5.6. “And I beheld, and
                            lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst
                            of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns,
                            and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all
                            the earth”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt commented upon the
                            frequent use in the new Testament of the emblematical representation of
                            Christ as a Lamb, of all animated nature perhaps the most characteristic
                            of innocence gentleness and cheerfulness— He referred also to the four
                            other beasts so conspicuous in the vision of the apocalypse with the
                            faces of a lion, a bullock, or as the book calls it a calf a man and an
                            eagle, but he did not remark the identity of the same complex animal in
                            the vision of the prophet Ezekiel, nor did he observe that these four
                            faces are understood to be indicative of the four Evangelists <persRef

                            to the prophets— They never spoke in their own names— The opening of

                            heard and their form of Speech was “Thus saith the Lord.”— There were
                            false prophets, who used the same form of Speech, besides the Priests of

                            of the prophesy was the test by which the people were to know whether
                            the pretender to prophesy in the name of Jehovah was a true, or a false

                            of that body, and requesting me to name a day and hour when the
                            Committee may meet me, and communicate to me the wishes of the
                            Convention— There is no distinct intimation of what they were; but the

                            of the United States—and they passed two sets of Resolutions,

                            at Boston last week, and with those there offered by <persRef

                            rejected—but both sets were adopted at Dedham— The Liberty party of the

                        <p>Say unto them, As I live saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
                            death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live:
                            turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of
                            Israel?</p>
                        <p>Ezekiel 33.4—</p>
                        <p>Throughout this chapter, the idea constantly maintained is that the
                            reward of righteousness, shall be life, and the punishment of wickedness
                            shall be death— The Lord has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Why
                            will ye die? let the wicked turn from his way and <hi rend="italic"
                                >live</hi>— But <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> says in the
                            Book of Ecclesiastes 9.2 that there is one event to the righteous and to
                            the wicked, and Jesus exhorts his disciples to be the children of their
                            Father which is in Heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and
                            on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.— Equally
                            certain it is, that the evil and the good—the just and the unjust
                            equally die.— Life and death therefore do not depend upon the
                            righteousness or wickedness of the individual, and the words live and
                            die throughout this chapter must be understood in a figurative and
                            spiritual sense— Nor can I understand it in any other sense than as a
                            promise of future life to the righteous, and a warning of total
                            extinction to the life of the wicked— Why will ye die? The threat of
                            punishment after death—death itself is the penalty—as life is the
                            reward— Not life in this world—but life in the world to come. Life and
                            punishment in the future world was not the doctrine of the Mosaic
                            dispensation but was denounced with emphatic and awful solemnity by
                            Jesus Christ— My health continues to droop, and my hoarseness and sore
                            throat still return— I answered the Letter yesterday received from

                        <p>Ezekiel closes the vision of a preceding chapter (20) with an exclamation
                            Then said I, Ah Lord God! They say of me, Doth he not speak parables?
                            which seems to be a remonstrance that the word which came to the prophet
                            was not sufficiently intelligible; and that when he delivered it to the
                            people, they affected not to understand him, and charged him with
                            sporting fables upon them— In the next chapter therefore the same
                            prophesy is pointed expressly at Jerusalem— Almost all the prophesies of
                            the old Testament are parables, and <persRef ref="matthew"
                                >Matthew</persRef> says 13.34 that all the discourses of Jesus to
                            the multitude, were in parables, and without a parable spake he not unto
                            them— The apostle speaks of this as itself the fulfilment of a prophesy
                            of the utterance of things which have been kept secret from the
                            foundation of the world— Is not the secret of eloquence in the parable—
                            This parable of two sticks needed no explanation— It explained
                            itself—immediately following that of the resurrection of dry bones, a
                            figure of surpassing energy.</p>
                        <p>At half past eight this morning I started in the morning train of the old

                            year after the city was smitten, came the vision of the holy city and
                            new temple, the report of which occupies the last nine chapters of the
                            book— In this series of visions the chronological order is repeatedly
                            inverted The book is in form an autobiography in fragments of a Jewish
                            priest a captive in Babylon seeing visions and hearing the word of the
                            Lord from time to time through a long succession of years, prophesying
                            destruction to the government of his own Country—and to all the
                            neighbouring nations around her.</p>

                        <p>A Fog immediately before Sunrise was succeeded by a day of Summer heat
                            and Fahrenheit at 84.— My daily morning walk before Sunrise is round the
                            Railway Square, from half an hour to 32 minutes. My first visitor this
                            afternoon was <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Frost</persRef> who said she had been twelve years a widow, residing

                            State—that she had <persRef ref="u;u">two sons</persRef> one of whom has
                            already been graduated at Princeton College, New Jersey, and the other

                            to me, she said was the desire to see me— The four succeeding visitors
                            must have been actuated by a similar motive. <persRef ref="u">Miss

                            and came to enquire of its condition— In this as in other cases the want
                            of the Journal of U.S.H.R. leaves me unable to answer his enquiries— All
                            I could say to him was that his petition and that of <persRef

                            alternative of which would have been a report against the claim. A part
                            of it however was for pay which <persRef ref="tyler-john">John

                            incident of the day— I received a Letter from my old Correspondent
                                <persRef ref="joy-george">George Joy</persRef> with triplicate
                            copies of his Letters to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Hogan and
                            Thompson of 1. August and 3. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1846—
                            His present Letter to me is dated 19 John Street Pentonville 18
                            September 1846—and complains that his expectation to hear from me by the
                            Mail of 1. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that I had received the
                            copy of his Letter, Pacificus of 1. August to Hogan and Thompson was
                            disappointed, and he fears that his Letter to me enclosing the copy of
                            it has been suppressed, a trick which no mortal could have any possible
                            temptation to practise— He should have received my acknowledgment of the
                            receipt of his Letter and copy if I had written and despatched it as I
                            ought to have done— I answered the Letter of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Samuel Colman dated Boston 2. October 1846 requesting an
                            interview with me to talk respecting his desire to obtain the admission
                            of his Son <persRef ref="colman-william">William</persRef> as a Cadet at
                            the U.S. Military Academy at West Point— I readily agree to the
                            interview, but apprized M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colman of the
                            Rules of the War Department respecting the admission of Cadets, which
                            leave the chance of success to the application for his son hopeless. I
                            walked this morning round the railroad square before Sunrise—my exercise
                            for the day. <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> with

                        <p>It is very strange that in our common english bible the last word of the

                            the wall. The Septuagint reads Mane (without repetition) Thekel, Phares,
                            and the words of the explanation are the same as those of the
                            hand-writing— They were words of no meaning either in Hebrew or in
                            Chaldaic— They were understood by no one, save Daniel, who explained
                            them— <persRef ref="scott-thomas">Scott’s</persRef> commentary says that
                            the word Peres, is the same as upharsin only omitting the prefix and

                            most remarkable part of it was a keen and severe comment upon a
                            pretended World’s convention recently held in London, for the ostensible
                            purpose of uniting the discordant sects of protestants in a new creed— A
                            new theological holy alliance— The text of his afternoon Sermon was from

                            no passage in it more precise and direct than this— The Messiah is

                            specially manifested by the form of voting by ballot— I regarded it as a

                            general course of my conduct as their representative, and I made some
                            remarks in commenting upon which my conduct has been subject to some
                            animadversion and censure— The Oregon question and the Mexican War— They
                            expressed their concurrence with my views and after a short conversation

                        <p>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to

                        <p>No doubt then says <persRef ref="scott-thomas">Scott</persRef>, the
                            resurrection of the dead, the day of judgment and the eternal state of
                            retribution are here predicted; and that shame and everlasting contempt,
                            as well as torment and misery which will be the lot of the wicked— The
                            words are—<hi rend="italic">many</hi> of them that sleep in the dust—and
                            in the preceding verse—every one that shall be found written in the

                            here are attributes not of all mankind—but of <hi rend="italic"
                                >many</hi>, some righteous and some wicked— Life and immortality to

                        <p>This morning was fair and the temperature of the atmosphere mild— I
                            walked round the railway square before Sunrise, without pinching of
                            fingers as yesterday and the day before. I had promised <persRef

                            Nantasket beach; if the weather should be fair. But the clouds were
                            gathering all the morning, and by noon it commenced raining; a heavy
                            gale followed and at night, a Tempest approaching to a hurricane, which
                            continued till near midnight before which its violence somewhat
                            subsided— <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> returned this
                            morning from her visit to Boston, where she went to the Opera last

                            different rivers, streams, and their tributaries, and the distances in
                            leagues from one village or Rancho to another, being an exact copy of

                            taken at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma 9. May 1846— This map is
                            peculiarly valuable at this time, the information having been just now

                            I received also a second Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                        <p>I fell asleep last night very soon after retiring to bed at 10 O’Clock,
                            in the very fury of the gale, and awoke before three this morning, and
                            all was calm at 4. I rose and found the atmosphere warm—the thermometer
                            at 54—the moon Orion, Sirius, and Procyon all visible though not very
                            bright, and soon after 5. Venus rising as morning Star— I walked round
                            the Railroad square to meet the rising Sun—but he rose beclouded—
                            Immediately after breakfast <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi

                            promise of a ride upon Nantasket beach this afternoon; perhaps to pass

                            to attend this meeting, but was disappointed first by the engagement at
                            Hingham, and secondly by the foul weather, which disconcerted both
                            purposes: for the clouds continued to gather, and by the time we had
                            finished our dinner it began to rain— After some hesitation I started in
                            the Carriage but before reaching the Bent’s point bridge the rain
                            increased and I directed my coachman <persRef ref="putnam-albert"
                                >Albert</persRef> to turn back and came home— The rain continued
                            till late in the evening but without a storm, and cleared off before

                            day and I had promised to receive them— To this objection M<hi

                            wait till dark, for that visit be over, and I agreed to go with him—
                            They came immediately after we had risen from dinner, and their visit
                            was not of more than half an hour— They were gone, when M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring came and took me up, and we reached
                            his house at the dusk of evening. The tea party soon followed and an
                            evening company of between forty and fifty Ladies and Gentlemen, all of
                            Hingham, and all friends and neighbours of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Loring— A very handsome supper of fruit cakes, and
                            confectionary, with lemonade to drink closed the evening: the company
                            dispersed and about 11. O’Clock I retired to my bed. A mingled
                            reflection of self-sufficiency, and of humiliation remained on my mind
                            in the consciousness of disproportion of my part of the conversation.

                            things? prudent and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are
                            right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall
                            therein.</p>
                        <p>Hosea 14.9—</p>
                        <p>Hosea is the first of the 12 minor prophets; and his prophesy is chiefly
                            against <persRef ref="ephraim">Ephraim</persRef> that is the kingdom of
                            the ten tribes— He predicts the Assyrian captivity and the dispersion of
                            the Samaritans— He threatens Judah also with the indignation of
                            Jehovah—but finishes with a promise of restoration to Israel; and with
                            this last cheering sentiment to the wise and the prudent—</p>
                        <p>In the English, French, German Bibles the prophesy of Hosea contains 14
                            chapters, and the Septuagint has the same number— <persRef
                                ref="noyes-george">Professor Noyes’s</persRef> translation is in 16
                            chapters, but his notes are only upon 14. He assigns no reason for the
                            change in the number of chapters. </p>
                        <p>I took a single cup of coffee at the party last evening and the
                            consequence was the loss of the whole Night’s sleep— Or rather from 1 to
                            5 in the morning I was in a state of somnambular sleep, consciously
                            awake and yet insensible to the lapse of time— I heard the clock in a
                            room below strike twelve and one, and then lay fretting at my inability
                            to sleep my senses in forgetfulness; <unclear>till</unclear> the dawn
                            came upon me by surprize, and I wondered what had become of the Clock at
                            the hours of 2 3 and 4.— I rose at half past 6. breakfasted at <persRef
                                ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Loring’s</persRef>, and at half past 7. took passage in the
                            Steam-boat May-Flower for Boston. A new boat which has taken the place
                            of the General Lincoln and plies daily between Hingham and Boston. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring went in the same boat, and a young
                            Lady by the name of <persRef ref="u">Brown</persRef> who had been at the
                            party last evening and had lodged at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Loring’s. As passengers in the boat, I met also the young painter
                                <persRef ref="hudson-william2">Hudson</persRef>, who had painted my
                            portrait last year, and an old gentleman about 60. whom M<hi

                                Sohier—<persRef ref="sohier-william2">William Davies
                                Sohier</persRef>— I found he was the Son of <persRef
                                ref="sohier-edward">Edward Sohier</persRef> a graduate of Harvard
                            University of 1781 six years before me, and a senior practitioner at
                            Law, with me at Boston from 1790. to 1793 when he died after a lingering
                            illness of several months; some time before he died he sent for me, and
                            put into my hands the papers of all his business in the courts which I
                            managed for him till his death— I was one of the pall-bearers at his
                            funeral, and then saw this son of his then a child not more than 6 years
                            of age— I had no recollection of having seen him from that day to this;
                            but he said he had seen me at a later date, at <persRef

                            has a son named <persRef ref="sohier-edward2">Edward Dexter</persRef>, a

                            practising lawyer—but I do not know him— We landed from the Steamboat,
                            at the wharf behind Pearl-Street about a quarter before 9. and I walked
                            to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> office, where I
                            staid till I was ten minutes too late for the train of cars at half past

                            is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate
                            wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. Joel 2.3. </p>
                        <p><persRef ref="noyes-george">Professor Noyes</persRef> commences his
                            translation of the Hebrew prophets with the book of Joel— He proposes to
                            substitute a chronological order instead of that in which the Hebrew and
                            the Septuagint concur. But the internal evidence of the book of Joel
                            does not disclose when it was written; and it can scarcely be called a
                            prophesy. It is rather a terrific description of an existing calamity—a
                            plague of Locusts overspreading and desolating the whole land of Judah—
                            The description is awful— The locusts and the mildew are called the
                            great army of the Lord and the picture of the garden of Eden before and
                            the desolation behind startles the imagination to fill up the interval
                            with a volume of the details of destruction. </p>

                            two numbers 1 and 7. Volume 5 of the Orphans Advocate and Social
                            Monitor, a periodical monthly publication of 8 quarto pages, by <persRef

                                Fellows</persRef>— It is devoted to the welfare of destitute
                            children, to benevolence and social improvement— These Ladies
                            superintend also an institution, the object of which is to procure
                            places for indigent children, and homes for the houseless. In each of
                            the two papers were two advertisements, one of places in sundry towns of
                            the Commonwealth, offering to take children—mostly girls as members of
                            the family, or to adopt them, and the other of children, boys and girls
                            needing homes— A third advertisement is of donations received, and a
                            fourth the names of travelling agents, four men and four maiden women,
                            of whom Miss Mary A. Baker is one. I gave 3 dollars as a contribution to
                            the cause, but declined subscribing for the paper— I dined again at

                            evil is not quite so salient in this reading as in that of the
                            Hebrew-English Bible. But is as fully included in it— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s morning text was 1. Timothy 3.16—
                            “And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was
                            manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached
                            unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.[”]—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt analysed the enumeration of
                            particulars in respect to which godliness is said to be greatly
                            mysterious, but they appear to have relation exclusively to the person,
                            and divinity of Jesus Christ— The text of the afternoon sermon was James
                            1.13—[“]Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
                            cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man 14.— But every
                            man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed.”— A
                            text which I cannot undertake to reconcile with that of Amos at the top
                            of this page— I only remember reading when I was at the University, the
                            disquisition of <persRef ref="jenyns-soame">Soame Jenyns</persRef>, on
                            the Origin of evil, whose answer to the objection that his theory makes
                            God the author of evil, is that God must be the author of every thing— </p>
                        <p>I received a pamphlet printed by <persRef
                                ref="gideon-jacob;gideon-george">J and G. S. Gideon</persRef>,
                            Washington being the report by <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Samuel F.
                                Vinton</persRef>, from the select Committee of the House of
                            Representatives of the United States, at the last Session of Congress
                            upon the charges made by <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Jared
                                Ingersoll</persRef> of Official misconduct of <persRef
                                ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef> while Secretary of
                            State— The report exonerates Webster from any misdemeanor punishable by
                            Legislative animadversion, but substantiates official transactions not
                            deserving of approbation— The report was laid on the table, and no
                            action was taken upon it by the house—not even an order that it should
                            be printed— This pamphlet must have been published by Webster himself,
                            or some of his friends— Its title is Alleged Official Misconduct of the
                            late Secretary of State—and in addition to the Report, there is an
                            extract from a Speech of <persRef ref="westcott-james"
                                >Westcott</persRef> a democrat Senator from Florida, to bolster up
                            the tarnished reputation of Webster; whose private character is
                            notoriously loose in morals and of intemperate habits, both of the table
                            and bed chamber— Less odious however than the vices of his accuser. </p>

                        <p>Amos 9–14–15—</p>
                        <p><persRef ref="amos">Amos</persRef> was a common Shepherd, among the
                            herdmen of Tekoa, and he was charged by <persRef ref="amaziah"
                                >Amaziah</persRef>, the priest of Bethel, with conspiracy against
                                <persRef ref="jeroboam">Jeroboam</persRef> the second king of
                            Israel. Amaziah denied the right of Amos to prophesy against the king of
                            Israel, because he was a subject of the king of Judah, and he ordered
                            Amos to flee away into the land of Judah, and eat bread and prophesy
                            there— Amos replies that he was no prophet nor a prophet’s son—but an
                            herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit—or as <persRef
                                ref="thomson-charles">Charles Thomson</persRef> translates the
                            Septuagint—of dates— And the Lord took him as he followed the flock and
                            said unto him, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel— Then he turns upon
                            the priest of Bethel and in defiance of his prohibition, and predicts
                            horrible destruction to him and his whole family—and also the captivity
                            of Israel— And short as the Book of Amos is, consisting of only 9
                            chapters, he prophesies not only against Israel and Judah, but ruin and
                            destruction to all the neighbouring Nations around them—Damascus, Gaza
                            and the Philistines, Tyre—the Ammonites and the Moabites—he denounces
                            one common ruin against them all—closing however with this glorious
                            restoration of the people of Israel; promising that among other
                            blessings reserved for them they shall plant vineyards and drink the
                            wine thereof</p>
                        <p>My thermometer this morning was nearly but not quite down to the freezing

                            their return remained and dined with them up the hill— I found an old
                            paper of <persRef ref="watt-james">Watt’s</persRef> powders for copying
                            paper ink, and made a pint of it according to the directions with the
                            exception that I made a full pint with the two papers which they
                            describe as sufficient for one third of a pint, and that instead of one
                            tea spoonful of French Brandy to guard the ink from moulding I put in
                            about 2 table spoonfuls of wild cherry rum. I have had the papers of
                            powder from the time when I was in London in 1796. just 50 years— They
                            were hardened into cakes, but melted in the boiling water into ink as
                            black as they could have done when perfectly fresh— I received this day
                            by the mail the Liberty Almanac for 1847. published at New York by

                            perished in a night: 11. And should not I spare Niniveh, that great
                            city, wherein are more than six-score thousand persons that cannot
                            discern between their right hand and their left hand: and also much

                        <p>The vision of Obadiah is in a single chapter— It is a prophesy of the
                            destruction of the kingdom of Edom, by a league of the two kingdoms of
                                <persRef ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef>, that is of Judah and of
                                <persRef ref="joseph3">Joseph</persRef>, that is of the ten tribes
                            against it— The names of the two kingdoms of Hebrews here are Jacob and
                            Joseph— The names most commonly given them, by the prophets are Judah
                            and Ephraim— Israel is often substituted for Ephraim and after the
                            captivity, passes generally by the name of Samaria— <persRef
                                ref="ezekiel">Ezekiel</persRef> personifies them by the names of
                            Aholah and Aholibah— A strict attention to all this variety of names is
                            indispensable to avoid utter confusion in reading the prophets, and even
                            informing a strict idea of the sacred history— This vision portending
                            nothing more than the total destruction of the Edomites, is said to have
                            been published precisely at the time of the dissolution of the Kingdom
                            of Judah by <persRef ref="nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</persRef> and
                            the Babylonian captivity— Who Obadiah was, does not appear— Nothing is
                            known of him, except this record of his vision— But the book of Jonah I
                            suppose to be an allegorical parable—a popular tale invented to
                            illustrate the doctrine that God almighty may be propitiated by
                            repentance and prayer to revoke his own sentence of destruction against
                            a guilty city so as apparently to falsify the prediction of a true
                            prophet— Jonas is a true prophet but his prediction <unclear>fails
                                to</unclear> be realized by the discharge of God’s purpose— The
                            disappointment of the prophet by the failure of his prediction drives
                            him to desperation, but his exultation at the growth of the gourd, which
                            shelters him from the heat of the Sun, and his despondency at the
                            withering of the gourd by the visitation of the worm lead only to the
                            antithetical argument of Jehovah that Jonah was wrong in complaining
                            that his prophesy had been falsified by God’s failing to execute his own
                            determination, because it was done in tender mercy to repentance and
                            prayer, and because he himself having felt compassion for a perishing
                            vegetable, could not charge God with inconsistency for sparing from
                            threatened destruction a city of 600000 people—</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the winter cold of the thermometer I walked round the

                            plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift
                            up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. Micah
                            4.1.2.3.—and Isaiah. 2.2.3.4. </p>
                        <p>I hope it may not be presumptuous to remark that as understood by the
                            Jews and by Christians of all denominations this is the distinct and
                            explicit promise of the Messiah and of his kingdom on earth— Its
                            repetition in the same words by two of the prophets may have crept into
                            the manuscripts, but the additional verse in Micah—4. But they shall sit
                            every man under his vine and under his fig-tree: and none shall make
                            them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it, is the
                            most delightful incident of the whole prediction— The cessation of war
                            between the Nations of the earth will be an improvement in the condition
                            of man by perpetual exemption from the greatest of evils— The setting
                            under his vine and his fig-tree with none to make him afraid is
                            improvement of his condition by the enjoyment of blessings never secured
                            to him while he will be exposed to suffer the calamities of War. </p>

                            round the Railway square is the only occurrence of sufficient moment to

                            physical truths and to detect and expose popular errors— This title page
                            does not disclose who is the author of these popular errors: but they
                            are the supposed discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton and especially his
                            theory of gravitation— I had subscribed for this book when M<hi

                            He communicated to me then the outlines of his system, and asked my
                            opinion of it. I told him I was not sufficiently conversant with the
                            subject to give or to form an opinion between the conflicting elements
                            of his system and that of Sir Isaac Newton, but I would take a copy of
                            his book, and endeavour to understand it as well as I can. He left a
                            copy with me for which he took two dollars— Its proper price would be
                            about half a dollar— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and

                        <p>He hath shewed thee, O Man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require
                            of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with
                            thy God?</p>
                        <p>Micah 6.8.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the remarkable passages of the old Testament, placing in
                            contrast with each other the efficacy of sacrifices, and of moral virtue
                            to propitiate the favour of Almighty God— The aspirant enquires by what
                            sacrifice, even the most costly, nay of his own first born Son, he can
                            obtain the blessing of Jehovah? The answer says nothing of sacrifice,
                            but declares that he has been shewn by God himself what is good: and for
                            the enjoyment of it, nothing is required of him but justice, mercy and
                            sincere humility—to walk humbly with his God— There is no rejection of
                            sacrifice not even a word of displeasure at the extension of the
                            question to the sacrifice of a first born Son. The question with regard
                            to sacrifice is left unanswered or rather left to the inference that
                            from the just, the merciful and the humble no sacrifice is required— The
                            whole system of the Mosaic law was founded upon the efficacy of
                            sacrifice as atonement for sin— It was abolished by Jesus Christ himself
                            in the Christian creed a voluntary sacrifice in atonement for the sins
                            of all mankind— </p>

                            came into our bed chamber and requested <persRef

                            relieved her from the pressing danger— I passed the Night sleepless, and
                            in agony, but arose upon the stroke of four by the Clock—
                                <unclear>Al</unclear> was still in the house and as d— as day-light
                            came I walked round the railway square— At the corner of <persRef

                            been—she rose immediately and came down to our house and breakfasted
                            with us— The <unclear>crisis</unclear> with Mary had passed away and she
                            was left with an ordinary hoarseness and sore throat. I went to Boston

                            to my fancy most graphic, applied to the doves— I can find in no English

                        <p>On the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1840. passing the
                            day at Kentville in the British province of Nova Scotia I heard the
                                <persRef ref="owen-henry">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> H. L.
                                Owen</persRef> a clergyman of the church of England, preach at
                            Cornwallis, a temperance sermon from this text— I then remarked, the
                            gross blunders of grammar, in this text as it reads in the common
                            English bible— In <persRef ref="thomson-charles">Charles
                                Thomson’s</persRef> version of the Septuagint—it reads “Wo to him
                            who maketh his neighbour drink a foamy intoxicating draught, making him
                            drunk that he may inspect his caves”— This is grammar, but a prodigious
                            abatement of the picturesque in the conveyance of the thought—the
                            transition from the third to the second person to him that puttest thy
                            bottle is a flagrant breach of grammar—but brings the charge of tempting
                            drunkenness directly to the reader—and observe the difference of the
                            tempter’s motive—in the Septuagint merely to inspect their caves, in the
                            common bible, to look on their nakedness—the transition from the
                            singular to the plural also <hi rend="italic">their</hi> nakedness
                            implying that in making one man drunk you tempt a whole company adds
                            aggravation to the charge. It is a curious reflection for a student of
                            composition, that this setting at defiance all the rules of grammar
                            snatches a grace beyond the reach of art and constitutes the beauty of
                            the Style. </p>

                            written was something more than four hundred years embracing the time
                            between 800 and 400 years before Christ— The first in Time by the
                            Chronology of the Bible was <persRef ref="jonah">Jonah</persRef>, but
                            this was only a prediction against the City of Niniveh even before the

                            preached in the Temple this morning from John 21.22— Jesus saith unto
                            him, if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow
                            then me— This is the text upon which all the fables about the wandering
                            Jew have been constructed— The brethren, that is the disciples of Jesus
                            at the time understood him as declaring that the beloved disciple John
                            should not die— The evangelist himself says that Jesus did not say that
                            he should not die, but from what he did say, the brethren could draw no
                            other conclusion, and there are thousands upon thousands upon the roll
                            of Christians at this day who believe that the apostle is yet living and
                            walking the world without being known— It opens a field for the exercise
                            of imagination, in the invention of facts irresistible to the herd of
                            novelists and Romancers of the present age; but the great stress of M<hi

                            is that to thee? and upon the final injunction follow then me.— He
                            expatiated with great eloquence upon this command which he understood as
                            addressed to all the disciples of all ages, and of every nation—and he
                            enumerated many particulars in which he held it the duty of all
                            Christians to follow their Lord and master, and to hearken throughout
                            their lives to his voice addressing them in the words which he spoke to
                            the Apostle <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, what is that to thee?

                                Tillotson</persRef>, upon this and the three preceding verses.
                            (Sermon 70. vol. 4. p. 256.) which I read many years ago with much
                            satisfaction, and in which he explains this prophesy by maintaining that
                            the greater glory of the second Temple, to consist in the presence of
                            the Messias that is that it was the place in which he revealed himself
                            to the world— This is not directly said by the prophet, nor was it
                            possible for those to whom the prophesy was addressed to form a
                            conception that this was its meaning, but the object of the prophet was
                            to stimulate and urge his countrymen to great exertions to complete
                            rebuilding of the temple, and an indefinite promise of greater glory

                            enthusiasm the zeal of the builders to accomplish the work— The advent
                            of the Messiah was foreshadowed in this prophesy, as distinctly as it
                            had been before by <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>.</p>
                        <p>I have been watching every clear morning these three weeks to witness the
                            rising of Arcturus in the East, and saw him for the first time about 10
                            minutes risen this morning— Orion, Sirius Procyon were shining at the
                            South and Calisto and Helice at the North, and at half past 5 Venus made
                            her appearance in the morning twilight approaching to her conjunction
                            with the Sun— The thermometer at 24 degrees was 2 degrees lower than it
                            had before been this Season, and I sallied forth no farther than to
                            witness the rising of the Sun from the corner of <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house— I pass most of my
                            time in self reproach for doing nothing—though I labour heavily at
                            reading the Scriptures and the Newspapers, and at keeping up with the
                            current of time in this journal— I received this day the Liberty Bell of

                        <p>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
                            behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation;
                            lovely and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</p>
                        <p>Zechariah— 9.9.</p>
                        <p>In the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> chapter of <persRef ref="matthew"
                                >Matthew</persRef> it is related that Jesus sent two of his
                            disciples to fetch him an Ass with a colt for him to ride into
                            Jerusalem, which he did followed by a multitude shouting hozannas to him
                            as the Messiah; and the evangelist says v. 4. All this was done, that it
                            might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying 5. Tell ye
                            the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and
                            sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass— The name of the
                            prophet is not mentioned by the evangelist, but the quotation is in
                            words so nearly identical with this prediction of Zechariah, that it can
                            refer to no other— But in comparing the prophesies of the Old Testament
                            with the references to them in the New, questions constantly occur, why
                            incidents so trivial in themselves should be made so prominent in
                            prophesy, so obscure when delivered, and so insignificant when
                            fulfilled— When Jesus sent for an ass with a colt to ride into
                            Jerusalem, he had express reference to this prophesy, and the special
                            purpose to fulfil it, but he did not disclose his purpose to his
                            disciples— But the prophesy was that the king should come riding upon an
                            Ass, that he should be just, and lowly and should bring with him
                            salvation. The Ass with retrospect to the prophesy was equivalent to the
                            assumption of the kingly crown, and so it was understood by the
                            multitude, who hailed it with rapture, and by the Priests and Pharisees
                            who considered it as a compound crime of Treason and blasphemy— But why
                            should this incident be made a subject of prophesy?— If merely
                            emblematical of the humility of the Saviour, it opened no prospect of
                            future justice or promise of Salvation— </p>

                        <p>These are the closing verses of the old Testament, which I began to read
                            on the first day of last December and finished this morning— I began
                            with reading two chapters every morning which I increased successively
                            to three and four. And for the purpose of fixing my attention more
                            closely to what I read I have adopted the practice of entering upon this
                            daily journal one or more verses of each days reading. Since I reached
                            home on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August I have read
                            every morning the corresponding chapters of <persRef
                                ref="thomson-charles">Charles Thomson</persRef> version of the
                            Septuagint, and consulted daily the Notes of <persRef ref="hewlett-john"
                                >Hewlett</persRef> and of <persRef ref="scott-thomas"
                                >Scott</persRef>, and sometimes the French Bible of <persRef
                                ref="osterwald-jean">Ostervald</persRef>, and the German Bible of
                                <persRef ref="luther-martin">Luther</persRef>— My proficiency in
                            Bible learning bears no proportion to the time and study that I bestow
                            upon it— So many times as I have read the bible through I am surprized
                            at the multitude of passages that I had either never noticed or have
                            totally forgotten that I ever had noticed them before.— The only
                            ultimate purpose of reading the Bible is for religious and moral
                            instruction— Its history, its Chronology, its biography and its
                            geography are not more difficult to understand than those of a profane
                            historian, but the more I read the prophetical books, the more I find my
                            understanding perplexed with them— Christians of all denominations
                            consider them all as predictions of the advent of the Messiah; and most
                            of the readers of the English Language consider <persRef

                            and substance of them all. </p>
                        <p>I have nothing to tell of the incidents of this day— With incessant
                            labour morning and evening I brought up the arrears of journal— I
                            answered the Letter from <persRef ref="pope-alexander">M<hi

                            in England in 1816. and which has never been published— I offer it for
                            publication in her miscellany— There is a sentiment of the ridiculous
                            connected with this multitude of applications, for lectures, and
                            autographs, and lines for Albums from which I cannot escape— Above all
                            are such requests embarrassing yet flattering—from females— <persRef

                        <p>10. The first wrote Wine is the strongest— 11. The second wrote, the king
                            is the strongest. 12 The third wrote, Women are the strongest: But above
                            all things truth beareth away the victory. 1. Esdras 3.10–11–12</p>
                        <p>I began the reading of the Apocrypha. four chapters a day. And still
                            extract from them one verse more, to introduce the daily Diary— I begin
                            with the curious discussion between the officers of the guards of
                                <persRef ref="darius-i">king Darius</persRef> of the question of the
                            relative strength of Wine, the King, women and Truth, which led to the
                            rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem— This event has an important and
                            indispensable connection with the advent, and history of the Messiah;
                            although it is not easy to perceive why the restoration of the temple
                            should have been necessary to introduce the founder of a system of
                            religion which was to supersede the temple and all its modes of worship
                            and all its sacrifices— There is not the most distant allusion to this
                            in any one of the prophets— Under the doctrines of the Law from Sinai,
                            there was but one lawful place for the worship of Jehovah, and from the
                            days of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> that was Jerusalem, to
                            which he had brought the ark of the covenant— The restoration apparently
                            promised by all the prophets was that Jerusalem should again be the only
                            place of worship, not only for the children of Israel, but for all
                            Nations— And that the priesthood, and the worship of sacrifice should be
                            restored as well as the Temple.— </p>
                        <p>I went to Boston this morning in the train cars which left the depot of
                            Quincy at half past ten— On alighting at Boston I walked first to
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> office where I saw

                            not forget at Washington next December— At noon I attended the meeting
                            of the Massachusetts historical Society— There were 22 members present,
                            but no business of importance transacted— The meeting adjourned soon
                            after 1. I dined with <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge John

                        <p>And the word of the Lord came unto me saying 5. Go thy way, and show my
                            people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness, which
                            they have done against me; that they may tell their children’s children—
                            2. Esdras 1.4–5</p>
                        <p>On the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1845. I was
                            compelled to desist from the practice which I had maintained with some
                            four intervals of exception for more than half a century of keeping in
                            my own hand a daily journal of the incidents of my life— Unwilling to
                            give it up entirely, I continued with the assistance of <persRef
                                ref="hellen-mary;adams-abigail4">my two daughters</persRef>, and
                            especially of my grand daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
                                Louisa</persRef>, through the last winter, and until the close of
                            the Session of Congress on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            August— As the Summer came on I recovered partially the use of my right
                            hand, and with untiring labour have brought up my Diary to this day— But
                            I have lost again the command of my right hand and cannot hope to
                            recover it again— I have but a few days more to live, and the record of
                            that remnant can be of little interest even to <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and to those of my family
                            whom I am about to leave behind— There has perhaps not been another
                            individual of the human race of whose daily existence from early
                            childhood to four score years has been noted down with his own hand so
                            minutely as mine— At little more than twelve years of age I began to
                            journalize, and nearly two years before that on the 11<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February 1778. I embarked from my
                            maternal uncle, <persRef ref="quincy-norton">Norton Quincy’s</persRef>
                            house at Mount Wollaston on board the Boston Frigate <persRef
                                ref="tucker-samuel">Captain Samuel Tucker</persRef> then lying in
                            Nantasket roads, and bound to France— I was then ten years and seven
                            months old, and the house whence I embarked had been built by my great
                            grandfather <persRef ref="quincy-john">John Quincy</persRef>—upon his
                            marriage with <persRef ref="quincy-elizabeth2">Elizabeth
                                Norton</persRef> in 1716. There he lived to the age of 77 years, and
                            there he died on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July 1767—the
                            day after I had received his name in baptism— If my intellectual powers
                            had been such as have sometimes committed by the creator of man to
                            single individuals of the species my diary would have been next to the
                            holy scriptures the most precious and valuable book ever written by
                            human hands, and I should have been one of the greatest benefactors of
                            my Country and of mankind— I would by the irresistible power of Genius,
                            and the inexpressible energy of will and the favour of almighty God,
                            have banished War and Slavery from the face of the earth forever—but the
                            conceptive power of mind was not conferred upon me by maker, and I have
                            not improved the scanty portion of his gifts as I might and ought to
                            have done. May I never cease to be grateful for the numberless blessings
                            received through life at his hands—never repine at what he has
                            denied—never murmur at the dispensations of his Providence, and implore
                            his forgiveness for all the errors and delinquencies of my life—</p>
