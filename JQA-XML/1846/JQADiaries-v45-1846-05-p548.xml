						<p>There was no preaching at the Hall of the House of Representatives this
							morning, the process of preparing the Hall not being completed— I
							received two notices, one from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Thompson</persRef> and the other from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> M <unclear>Pon</unclear> that the
								<persRef ref="furness-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
									M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Furness</persRef> would preach
							this day morning and evening at the Unitarian Church. I attended
							accordingly and heard him preach from John. 9.35. part of the last
							clause of the verse. “Dost thou believe in the Son of God”— The
							Discourse without noticing the context, or the occasion upon which he
							spoke these words, to the man whose blindness he had cured by directing
							him, to wash, in the pool of Siloam and whom the Jews had cast out, for
							believing in Jesus— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Furness commented
							upon the text as a general question, addressed, to his own Auditory
							observing there was even at this day very little, real, and practical
							faith, in true Christianity among its professors; that faith was like a
							Sabbath day garment, put on, and cast off one day in the week, and then
							he proceeded, to define, what he thought was true faith, which he
							considered, as a life, of obedience to the commands of Christ and not of
							any more speculative, metaphysical doctrines <pb n="551" type="ms"/>or
							opinions— After dinner, at the Second Presbyterian Church, the <persRef
								ref="smith-matthew">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Matthew Hale
								Smith</persRef>, delivered his fourth and last Lecture of a series,
							and which was addressed, to Parents—his text was, from Proverbs, 29.15.
							the last part of the verse, “A child left to himself, bringeth his
							mother to shame”— <persRef ref="dietz-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Dietz</persRef> a member of this Society had applied to
							me, with a request, that I would preside at a meeting of the Society, to
							be held immediately after the close, of this course of Lectures, with a
							view, to pass a resolution of thanks, to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Smith and a request to him of a copy of them for publication— To this I
							had consented and had prepared a resolution to be offered at the
							Meeting— But before the beginning of the Service this afternoon, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Dietz came to my Pew and told me, that it
							had been agreed not to hold the meeting this afternoon— The Discourse,
							like the rest, of the series, was plain, sensible, and edifying, without
							attempt at pathetic eloquence— It consisted, chiefly, of observations
							upon the duty of Parents, with regard to the education of their
							children, and in exhortation, to that rigorous system, of parental
							discipline, prescribed, by the Proverbs of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>— A system undoubtedly best suited, to the Age,
							and Nation, over which he, ruled, but perhaps, best succeeded by a
							milder, and more affectionate system—at the present day— In the evening,
							I attended again at the Unitarian Church, and heard M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Furness of Philadelphia, from Luke
							10–27—“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with
							all thy Soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy
							neighbour, as thyself”— The subject was treated, as usual, by
							considering this text, as embracing the whole duty of Man— It comprises
							the whole system, of Christianity, but I should be glad to hear, from a
							Man like M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Furness, his exposition, of
							what is meant by the love of God, so emphatically
							<unclear>en</unclear>joined in this text, and so remarkably dis-<pb
								n="552" type="ms"/>tinguished, from the love of the neighbour, with
							which it is connected— What is the love of God, and how is it possible,
							that a worm of the dust should entertain and cherish, and above all
							manifest, the passion of Love, for the Creator of the Universe.
							Reverence, adoration, fear, seem to be the emotions, natural, to the
							relations, between Man, and his Maker, and these are the sentiments,
							which I believe to be embraced, by the command of Jesus, in the text—
							The love of the neighbour, measured, by the intensity, of self love
							embed in the nature of Man, is a different sentiment though perhaps
							derived from the same source.— and perhaps still more imperative upon
							the practise of human life—</p>

							“An instruction to the Committee on Military Affairs to inquire into the

							“I object I will vote for them when the War with Mexico is over”— I
							moved to suspend the rules, to enable me to introduce the resolutions,

							the yeas and nays, supported me, and the suspension of the rules was
							refused 45 to 90. <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"

							the Presidents Message, to be printed— It was merely a formality for
							bringing before the House, and the Country the real character of this
							transaction the shooting of deserters without a trial— He then stated
							the facts according to the report from the Secretary of War— At almost
							every sentence of his Speech he was interrupted by calls to order. but
							he did succeed in producing the Message from <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President Monroe</persRef> of 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>

							first calls to order had ventured, to sustain him, as in Order, finished
							by yielding to the calls of the slave mongers and declared him not in

								<pb n="559" type="ms"/>of the House, with regard, to the
							dismemberment of Mexico, by the foul and detestable conquest of Texas— I
							bow in submission to the inscrutable decrees of Providence, but humbly
							ask, why sleeps the thunder in the skies? <persRef ref="adams-stephen"
								>Stephen Adams</persRef> of Mississippi asked leave to introduce a
							Joint Resolution for adjourning the Session on Monday the 13<hi

							not quite of two thirds— Committee of the whole on the state of the

							up and debated at some length, but to which I paid not sufficient

							to the House, and passed—whereupon the House adjourned— The utter
							indifference and coolness not only, in the House of Representatives but
							of the whole people, to this shooting of diserters without trial, is a
							sign of the times, which affects me, with a profound melancholy at their
							degeneracy and corruption Never before has such a state of things
							existed in this Country and it betokens a depravity of Public Morals,
							which in my firm belief, cannot escape, the judgement of Heaven, upon

						<p>In the Hall of the House of Representatives this morning I heard the
								<persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Welsh</persRef> of Albany, preach,
							from 2. Kings 5.12. “Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus,
							better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be
							clean. So he turned and went away in a rage” The Discourse was a curious
							exemplification, of the manner in which Democracy and demagoguism have
							crept into the Pulpit in this Country— The story of the cleansing of
								<persRef ref="naaman">Naaman</persRef> the Syrian is one of the most
							beautiful narratives of the Old Testament, but this preacher from
							Albany, turned it to political account. Its object in the Scripture is
							by a miraculous event, to display, the superiority of the religion of
							the Hebrews, over that of the Heathen Nations even of the conquerors of
							the Jews.— This is the perpetual object of all the Scriptures of the Old
							Testament— Naaman, Captain of the Host of the King of Syria, was a great
							man with his Master and honorable, because by him the Lord had given
							deliverance unto Syria, he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a
							leper—A ma<hi rend="strikethrough">u</hi>rauding party of his Army had
							invaded the Land of Israel and carried off <pb n="563" type="ms"
							/>captive, a little maid, who waited on <persRef ref="naamanswife"
								>Naamans wife</persRef>, and she said to her mistress would God, my
							Lord were with the Prophet, that is in Samaria, for he would recover him
							of his leprosy— So Naaman goes with a Letter from the King of Israel to
							the King of Syria with presents of immense value and the King thought,
							he sought to quarrel with him, but <persRef ref="elisha"
								>Elisha</persRef> the prophet, went to the King of Israel, and
							requested he would refer Naaman to him. So Naaman came with his horses
							and Chariot and stood at the door of the House of Elisha, but did not
							condescend to see him, but sent a Messenger to him, directing him to go
							and wash in Jordan, and promising, that this would cleanse him from his
							leprosy— Thereupon Naaman flies into a passion and draws the comparison
							between the rivers of Damascus, and the waters of Israel.— selected by
							the Preacher for his text—and concludes by going away in a rage— Upon
							reflexion however by the advice of his Servants, he concludes to go and
							dip himself seven times in Jordan and is cleansed from his leprosy— He
							then returns to Elisha, the man of God, and acknowledges, that there is,
							no God, in all the Earth, but in Israel—and offers to Elisha magnificent
							presents; which he refuses. There is a sequel to the story, not less
							interesting than the tale itself, but of which D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Welsh took no notice, nor can I for want of time. But the
							Democracy of D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Welsh consisted in
							contrasting, the rank and pomp and grandeur of the Syrian Field Marshal,
							with the poverty and humility of the Hebrew Prophet— He commented much,
							upon the scorn, with which, the Grandee treated, the direction, of
							Elisha, and after many invidious contrasts, between the great and noble
							of the Earth, with the lowly condition of the Prophet, he finally
							concluded his Discourse by assuring his Auditory, that they might depend
							upon it, there was no aristocratic way to Heaven. After dinner I
							attended at the Second Presbyterian Church, where the <persRef
								ref="smith-matthew">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Matthew Hale
								Smith</persRef>, preached from Psalms 77–19—“Thy way <pb n="564"
								type="ms"/>is in the Sea, and thy path, in the great waters[”]—a
							sermon, upon the condition of Sailors— Immediately after the close of
							the Service, a Meeting of the Members of the Society was held, of which
							I, was Chairman and presented a resolution of thanks, for his four
							Lectures addressed to young men, to young ladies, to married persons,
							and to parents—with a request, of a copy of them, for publication. The
							resolution was unanimously adopted, the ladies of the Society according
							to the practice of this church, voting as well as the men. The meeting,
							occupied not more than a quarter of an hour, and was then adjourned— At
							half past seven in the evening I attended at the Unitarian Church, where
							the <persRef ref="lothrop-samuel">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Samuel. K. Lothrop</persRef>, Minister of the Brattle Street Church
							in Boston, preached from Genesis 37. part of the 15 verse. “What seekest
							thou,” This is a question put by a certain man to Joseph, when he was
							wandering in the field sent by his Father Israel, in search of his
							brethren, who were feeding their fathers flock in
								<unclear>Shehem</unclear> but M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Lothrop dismissed all notice of this context, but taking the simple
							question “What seekest thou,” by itself and applying it, specially to
							his Auditory, said he would address each one of them, with that
							question, and inquire what they were seeking— He said it was probable,
							that the ready answer of every one would be, he was seeking for
							happiness—and then he proceeded to shew, that happiness, was not, in
							itself, the proper object of search for the Christian— That this proper
							object was, the development of his own character; the pursuits of life;
							of which happiness would be the ultimate result: the practise of the
							virtues, and the control of his own passions, which would lead to
							happiness, and which require An earnest examination and search, for
							practical application, to the duties of human life— On returning home I
							found <persRef ref="thom-george">Lieutenant Thom</persRef>, of the
							Topographical Engineers here—on a visit to the <persRef

						<p>War with Mexico—</p>
						<p>A message from the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef> of the
							United States, to both Houses of Congress, was received this morning,
							after the House had been one hour in Session— It occupied about half an
							hour, in the reading, recommending, not in direct terms, but by
							circumlocution a declaration of War against Mexico.— It begins with a
							referrence to the state of the relations, between the two Countries,
							presented in the Annual Message, at the commencement of the Session, and
							then relates, the series of events, diplomatic and military, which have
							since occured, and brought on a state of hostility now existing between
							them. A voluminous correspondence, accompanied the message, When it was
							received, the House was in Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union <persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Samuel Gordon</persRef>, of the tenth
							Congressional District of New York, in the Chair, upon the Military
							Academy Appropriation Bill—against which <persRef ref="sawyer-william3"
								>William Sawyer</persRef> of the fifth Congressional District of
							Ohio, was playing off, his democratic Artillery. On the receipt of the
							message, the Committee immediately rose.— The Message, and part of the
							accompanying Documents were read, and after some altercation as to the
							mode of disposing of them, they were ordered to be printed and referred
							to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— The House went
							immediately into that Committee at the motion of <persRef
								ref="haralson-hugh">Hugh. A. Haralson</persRef>, of Georgia Chairman
							of the Committee on Military Affairs— <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
								>George. W. Hopkins</persRef> of Virginia, in the Chair— They
							immediately took up Bill N<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> 145, reported
							from the Committee authorizing the President to accept the service of
							volunteers, not exceeding fifty thousand men, with an Appropriation of
							ten millions of dollars.— A long debate ensued, numerous Amendments were
							proposed, a distinction between War and hostilities much discussed and
							numerous efforts made, to shape into a declaration of War, against
							Mexico, one of which finally succeeded— A motion was soon made, by
								<persRef ref="brinkerhoff-jacob">Jacob <pb n="566" type="ms"
								/>Brinkerhoff</persRef> of Ohio that the Committee rise, for a
							resolution to close the debate in two hours, upon which resolution the
							yeas and nays were demanded and refused— At the end of the two hours,
							the Bill was reported to the House, with the Amendment declaring War by
							a lying preamble adopted at the motion of <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Lynn
								Boyd</persRef>, and was passed by yeas and nays, 174. to 14.
								<persRef ref="abbott-amos">Amos Abbott</persRef>, and <persRef

							voting for this declaration of War. Of the 14, besides myself, <persRef

							Kentucky, asked, to be excused, from voting, for which he assigned
							reasons, perfectly conclusive, against the War, and finally withdrew his

							from <persRef ref="taylor-zachary">General Taylor</persRef> now

							was accordingly excused and <persRef ref="jones-seaborn">Seaborn

						<p>Morning employed, in writing, with a view to retrieve if possible the
							arrears of this Journal, which are growing like the leak in an
							unseaworthy Ship— At the House, <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac. E.
								Holmes</persRef> of South Carolina Chairman of the Committee of
							Naval Affairs presented a communication from the <persRef
								ref="walker-robert">Secretary of the <pb n="569" type="ms"
								/>Treasury</persRef> in relation to the Engineers, for the Revenue
							Marine Service— Holmes moved to discharge the Committee of the whole
							House from the consideration of a Bill upon this subject, referred to
							them, and take it up and pass it, in the House—which was accordingly
							done, though in direct defiance, of a rule of the House, that all
							matters touching appropriations of money shall be first considered in
							Committee of the whole— This Committee of the whole, is in our theory of
							Legislation, the great security for the freedom of Speech, and of
							debate, upon all subjects before the House, but it is becoming little
							more than a dead Letter by this evasive practise, of referring subjects
							to the Committee, and then discharging the Committee from the
							consideration of them, without <hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi>
							consideration at all— This together with the other recent practise, of
							limiting the time, for debate in Committee of the whole, takes away, all
							the benefit of free debate intended, by that organization of the rules.
							The Committee was accordingly now discharged and the Bill was taken up
							in the House. It provides for the appointment of Officers in the Revenue
							Service, by the President by, and with the consent of the President.—
							Hitherto they have been appointed by the President alone— It establishes
							a new rank, of third Lieutenants, hitherto unknown in our Service,
							provides for additional Engineers, of Steamers, and increases the wages
							of boatswains gunners and carpenters—to thirty five dollars a month and
							one navy ration a day.— <persRef ref="rathbun-george">George
								Rathbun</persRef>, moved to recommit the Bill, to the Navy
							Committee, with instructions to report a Bill to transfer the revenue
							Marine vessels to the Navy Department, which after desultory debate, was
							carried, 86 to 35— <persRef ref="hampton-james">James. G.
								Hampton</persRef> of New Jersey presented resolutions of the
							Legislature of that State, one of which was against any alteration of
							the Tariff— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, <persRef
								ref="benton-charles">Charles. S. Benton</persRef>, of the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District in the Chair,
							Military Academy Appropriation <pb n="570" type="ms"/>Bill was taken up,
							ten minutes allowed for debate were consumed by <persRef
								ref="gordon-samuel">Samuel Gordon</persRef>. Rathbun’s proposal to
							abolish the Academy was rejected 50 to 94. and the Bill was passed. The
							Army Appropriation Bill followed, the chief debate upon which was a
							proposal, to raise the pay, of Private Soldiers from eight to ten
							dollars a month— About four o clock the Committee of the whole rose
							without taking the Question and the House adjourned— The Marine Band of
							Music played in the garden of the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>President’s</persRef> House. I walked out and entered the Garden
							just as they were closing their performances with the air of Yankee
							Doodle. After returning home, <persRef ref="larned-james">M<hi

								Kavasales</persRef> was here this morning, and I had the unpleasant

							request, the Secretary of the Navy <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi

							favorable as I had expected and hoped— That it contains no charge
							against him, of any specific misconduct, but merely an opinion of his
							incompetency, to exercise the functions of a Chaplain— I regretted this
							circumstance very much because it weakens the hope, of any kindness, on
							the part of the Secretary of the Navy. I believe him fully competent, to
							the duties of that Office, though perhaps well adapted, to exercise it
							on board of a Man of War at Sea— He wished me to intercede for an
							appointment at a Shore station which I promised him to do— I received a
							few days since a Letter from <persRef ref="cox-christopher">D<hi

							Maryland; inviting me to deliver <pb n="571" type="ms"/>a Lecture,

							Organ, for a magnificent Episcopal Church, recently constructed there— I

							day— At the House, <persRef ref="culver-erastus">Erastus. D.

						<p>My call at <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Bancroft’s</persRef> last evening, was occasioned, by a poor insane
							man named <persRef ref="allen-william6">William Winthrop
							Allen</persRef>, who had me called out from my seat in the House
							yesterday morning and inquired, if I had received two or three months
							since, a Letter from him, with a Memorial, claiming the sum of thirty
							thousand dollars, as due from the United States to him. I did not
							recollect having received such a Memorial but inquired upon what ground
							he made this claim— He then told me a wild incoherent story, of a
							conspiracy against his life carried on for a series of years, as
							indemnity for which, he had applied to the Legislature of Massachusetts,
							which had refused to do him justice, and thereby gave him this claim
							upon the United States, whose duty it was to indemnify him by compelling
							the Legislature of Massachusetts to do him justice. I enquired how he
							came here, and drew from him the acknowledgment, that he had been placed
							by his friends in the Alms House, of the Town of Medfield, though he was
							a preacher of the Gospel, and a Teacher of School— That from the keepers
							of the Alms House, he had obtained a permission to go to Boston, and had
							availed himself of that opportunity to come here to prosecute his claim—
							I assured him, that he could obtain nothing by a memorial to Congress,
							and advised him to return <pb n="573" type="ms"/>immediately home— He
							thanked me for my advice and appeared well disposed to follow it—but he
							said he would call tomorrow, on M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Bancroft, who had been his Classmate, at Harvard University. Immediately
							after he left me at the House I spoke of him to <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Winthrop</persRef>, and called at M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Bancrofts in the evening to notify him, of the visit he would receive
							from this poor man tomorrow. I proposed, that we should consult together
							upon the means, of prevailing upon him to return to Medfield— He is
							perfectly harmless, and eminently deserving of compassion— At the House,
								<persRef ref="delano-columbus">Columbus Delano</persRef> asked leave
							to make a personal explanation, but objection was made and persisted in,
							till after moving a suspension of the rules, he withdrew his motion and
							gave it up. <persRef ref="mckay-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>c</hi>Kay</persRef> moved to go into Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union on the Army Appropriation Bill, <persRef
								ref="daniel-john">John. R. Daniel</persRef> of North Carolina moved
							to take up the Private Callender, which was carried— A Bill for the
							Heirs of <persRef ref="smith-larkin">Capt Larkin Smith</persRef>,
							reported by the Committee of the whole for rejection, was rejected—
								<persRef ref="martin-barclay">Barkly Martin</persRef> of Tennessee
							moved again the suspension of the rules to allow M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Delano to make his explanation which was carried— Delano
							complained, that his Colleague <persRef ref="thurman-allen"
								>Thurman</persRef> had misrepresented him, by charging him with
							having said, that the War with Mexico, was a “damnable War.” Thurman
							replied, and the debate fell into a mere question about the use of
							particular words, and ended in nothing. Then came up again, a Bill for
							the allowance, of the usual Bounty of the Fishing Schooner Tancred, lost
							at Sea, which was specially opposed by Daniel of North Carolina, and on
							the engrossment of which the vote was 82 to 80. Daniel then moved, a
							call of the House, which was refused and the Bill was passed 85 to 82,
							Committee of the whole on Private Bills again. <persRef
								ref="foot-solomon">Solomon Foot</persRef> of Vermont in the Chair.
							Among the Bills taken up was one for the relief of <persRef

								/>Jones</persRef>, for certain expenses, for services of a
							diplomatic character at the Sandwich and Otaheite Islands— <persRef

								<persRef ref="blackford-william">William. M. Blackford</persRef> for

						<p>Notice had been given in the National Intelligencer of yesterday, that
							the <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
									M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Tustin</persRef>, the Chaplain
							to the Senate, would preach in the Hall of the House of Representatives
							this morning— I attended there as usual, but instead of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Tustin a stranger whose name I did not
							here preached from Gallatians 6.5. [“]For every Man shall bear his own
							burden,”—a text, which suggested to me many reflections, I hope not
							altogether unprofitable but far from pleasing or satisfactory, but upon
							which, the exposition of the preacher made so little impression, upon my
							mind, that it has left scarcely a trace upon my memory— Whether this, is
							chargable, upon the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sermonizer, or
							upon myself, I am unwilling to pronounce, perhaps upon both. My state of
							mind being very ill suited to give the due attention to any thing, not
							peculiarly exciting, from the Pulpit— In the Afternoon at the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Presbyterian Church, I heard the <persRef
								ref="smith-matthew">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Matthew Hale
								Smith</persRef> from 2. Timothy 4.7. the last clause of the verse—“I
							have kept the Faith.” M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith, related the
							melancholy circumstances, under which the great Apostle of the Gentiles
							wrote, this Epistle, to his friend and convert <persRef ref="timothy"
								>Timothy</persRef>. The note at the end of this Epistle states, that
							it was to Timotheus ordained first Bishop, of the Church of the
							Ephesians, and was written from Rome, when <persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul</persRef>, was brought before <persRef ref="nero"
								>Nero</persRef>, the second time. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Smith said that it was <pb n="577" type="ms"/>written when he was under
							sentence of death. Upon what authority he said that, I know not, but
							there is internal evidence in the Epistle itself that it was written,
							before the sentence had been passed upon him— He complains, that upon
							his first Trial, he had been forsaken by all men,—but that he was
							delivered, out of the mouth of the Lion, and he expresses a confidence,
							that the Lord shall deliver him again and preserve him unto his Heavenly
							Kingdom— He urges Timothy to come shortly to him, and requests him to
							bring with him, his cloak, books, and parchments— Requests him
							especially to come before winter—and though he declares, he is ready to
							be offered, and the time of his departure, is at hand, there is nothing
							in the Letter, which intimates that the decision against him, had been
							pronounced. The principal argument of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Smith was however upon the words of his text—“I have kept the Faith” and
							explaining by the context, the meaning of the words, he drew from them
							an exhortation to his Auditory, to follow the example of the Apostle,
							and keep the Faith, to the last moment of life, through every event that
							can befall the frailty of human nature— The <persRef
								ref="lothrop-samuel">Rev M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Lothrop</persRef> of Boston preached at the Unitarian Church this
							morning and evening, but the weather was so uncomfortable, raining
							almost the whole day that I did not attend in the evening to hear

							broken down entirely— It has already in more than one instance, been
							violated and was especially so, in one case, in the 27<hi

							Florilla, lost at Sea was read the third time, and on taking the

							Daniel enquired if he had voted whether it would have changed the

								ref="french-benjamin">Clerk</persRef> had discovered that it had
							been a tie 77 to 77. and that he voted himself, making the vote 77. to
							78. and rejecting the Bill— This is a perfect exemplification of the
							characteristic discriminations of John W. Davis, the present Speaker of
							the House of Representatives— If his vote would have rejected the Bill
							by making a tie, he would not have given it, but when the Bill was
							rejected, by a tie, he would have added his own vote, to make the
							assurance of rejection, doubly sure— Some question was made whether

							it was not too late, especially by such a questionable procedure, to
							reverse the decision— Other objections were made, to the voting of the

								ref="buchanan-james2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

							the secret papers of the Department— The recent abuse of that privilege,
							by <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles. J. Ingersoll</persRef>, has

						<p>I continue much indisposed under the prescriptions of <persRef
								ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thomas</persRef>,
							but not confined to the House— I enclosed to <persRef ref="ingraham-d"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> D. G Ingraham</persRef>, the
							copies of my correspondence with <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William
								Tudor junior</persRef>, concerning the Manuscripts, yesterday
							received from the Department of State— I wrote also a few lines in the
							Album of <persRef ref="chapman-hm">Miss H. M. Chapman</persRef> which I
							delivered to her relative <persRef ref="chapman-sf">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> S. F. Chapman</persRef>—who called at
							the House to receive them— At the House, the resolution for closing
							debate, on the Bill making alterations in the Pay Department of the
							Army, in half an hour was taken up, and modified, to allow two hours,
							and then was adopted— <persRef ref="boyd-linn">Lynn Boyd</persRef>,
							offered a resolution for the House to meet hereafter, daily, at 10.
							o’clock A.M. and take a recess from two to half past three P.M. The vote
							was 71. to 60. not sufficient to suspend the rules, but a majority,
							which in a few days, will carry the resolution— Some time was allowed
							for the consideration of Private Bills. That for the relief of <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas">Commodore Thomas Ap Catesby Jones</persRef>, was
							passed, without taking the yeas and nays, which were refused. After
							disposing of two or three other private cases, the House went again into
							Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, and took up the Bill
							to regulate the Pay Department of the Army. A long debate ensued, and a
							manggling altercation between, <persRef ref="johnson-andrew">Andrew
								Johnson</persRef> of Tennessee, and <persRef ref="davis-jefferson"
								>Jefferson Davis</persRef> of Mississippi upon the comparative
							merits of West point pupils, and blacksmiths, and tailors for Army
							Officers— <persRef ref="hunt-washington">Washington Hunt</persRef> of
							New York, had obtained the floor, but yielded it for an explanation, to
							Jefferson Davis who from that time kept a running fight with Johnson <pb
								n="602" type="ms"/>till the time for closing the debate, came and
							Hunt lost his chance of making a Speech— <persRef ref="stewart-andrew"
								>Andrew Stuart</persRef>, renewed his attempt to get ten dollars a
							month pay for the Soldiers and volunteers, and <persRef
								ref="constable-albert">Albert Constable</persRef> of Maryland moved
							to strike out ten and insert twenty besides one hundred and sixty Acres
							of Land, which <persRef ref="leake-shelton">Shelton F Leake</persRef> of
							Virginia moved should be located in Mexico After a variety of such
							Amendments, <persRef ref="mckay-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>c</hi>Kay</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of ways and means,
							moved to strike out the whole Bill and insert a very short one
							authorizing the appointment of three additional Pay Masters to serve as
							long as the increased number of the rank and file in the Army shall
							continue— This Bill was reported to the House and passed under the
							previous question, so expeditiously that <persRef
								ref="brinkerhoff-jacob">Jacob Brinkerhoff</persRef> sneerlingly
							inquired, if it would be in order to move that the Committee on Military
							Affairs should be abolished and a Legislator General appointed in its
							place. This was a fling at M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Kay Brinkerhoff
							being himself, a member of the Military Committee, but M<hi
								rend="superscript">c</hi>Kay took no notice of it— <persRef
								ref="haralson-hugh">Haralson</persRef> of Georgia moved to go into
							Committee again, upon other Bills, reported by the Military Committee
							but after sundry motions to adjourn and for a call of the House, the
							motion to adjourn was finally carried—</p>

						<p>The weather continues oppressively warm, and my debility keeps pace with
							it— I attended this morning public worship in the Hall of the House of
							Representatives where in the place of <persRef ref="milburn-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Milburn</persRef> the Chaplain
							of the House a stranger preached <pb n="603" type="ms"/>from Hebrew
							4.16. [“]Let us therefore, come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we
							may obtain mercy, and find grace to help, in time of need”— Whether from
							listlessness, incidental to the state of my health, or from a want of
							sufficient energy, in the performance of the Preacher, he left not, in
							my mind, an impression, distinct enough, to remember, the substance, or
							the drift, of his Discourse, which had at least the merit of brevity. In
							the Afternoon, I attended at the Second Presbyterian Church where the
								<persRef ref="smith-matthew">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Matthew Hale Smith</persRef>, preached his farewell sermon, the text
							of which was, it seemed to me, quite singular, Matthew 26–65—“Then, the
							high Priest rent his clothes, saying, he hath spoken blasphemy, what
							further need have we of witnesses, behold now ye have heard his
							blasphemy.” M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith related the
							circumstances under which, this saying of the High Priest was spoken,
							and whereby the Assembly of the Scribes and the Elders and all the
							Council, pronounced sentence of death upon Jesus Christ, and the
							argument of his Discourse was, upon the wickedness of rash judgments,
							and after handling this topic very shortly, he concluded his Discourse,
							by taking leave of the Society his engagement, having been to supply the
							Pulpit for a limited time, which had expired— He mentioned, that he
							himself, was of the Denomination of the Congregational Church, the
							Society being of what are called new school Presbyterians— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith is a very amiable man, and I regret
							that his connection with this Church is not of longer duration— We had
							evening visits from <persRef ref="healy-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> John Healey</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="campbell-archibald">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Archibald
								Campbell</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull
