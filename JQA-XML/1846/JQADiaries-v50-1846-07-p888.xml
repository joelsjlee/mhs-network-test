				<p>Independence day— 70 years are gone— The average limitation of the life of man.
					Public celebrations as recommended and foretold by my father were held
					throughout the land, but not with so much hilarity and bustle as usual in this
					city— A noon walk for exercise of an hour was my only excursion from the house.
					The day was showery and sultry M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"

					gratitude to the giver of all good for all the numberless blessings of his
					bounty thoughout my life, with supplication for the continuance of his mercies,
					and deep humility at my own errors and sins— A solemn admonition of the frailty
					and precarious tenure of human life occurred this day in the sudden death of
						M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Julia Dickinson Tayloe, wife of Benjamin Ogle
					Tayloe of this city—in a fit while taking a shower bath— She was the only

				<p>I rose with resignation to the will of God a living ruin, with the power of vital

					There was no preaching at the Hall of the Representatives, the Chaplain of the

					Milburn the Chaplain of the house, no Account. I attended Church this morning at

					the service for the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity and preached
					from Psalm 38.18.—last clause of the verse— [“]I will be sorry for my sin”— At 5

					alone— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne read the evening service of the day, and
					preached from 1. Corinthians 9–26. last clause of the verse [“]so fight I not as
					one that beateth the air”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyne’s discourses are
					ingenious, argumentative, and well seasoned with the benevolence, if not with
					the morality of the Christian faith— His Christian must be sorry according to
					the rubric of the Church, and must expect his pardon through her Intercession—
					He fights not as one that beateth the air, and his Church is the church militant
					conquering and to conquer. In hoc signo vinces— He never for an instant loses
					sight of his church— I close the day as it had begun—with resignation—still
					longing for a bath and unable to collect my spirits for reading anything beyond
					the 3— chapters of the book of Job—25–27. with which I began the day— I made an
					attempt upon the philosophy of the plan of Salvation, but gave it up— Tried a

				<p>I rose this morning with the dawn, and drawn by an irresistible impulse walked
					over the lower Tiber bridge, to my old bathing spot on the margin of the
					Potowmac—and there under the shelter of the high bluff yet remaining I bathed
					and swam from 5 to 10 minutes, and came out, dressed myself and walked home—a
					tour of an hour and a half— The exercise, the washing, the sensation of personal
					cleanliness, were as of old time, but the nervous agitation throughout the day
					was not sensibly relieved, and the weariness of the evening threatened a
					restless Night— Francis Richmond was here with T. L. M’Kenney’s Memoirs about
					Indians 2 volumes in one, of which I took a copy and father Green with papers of
					W. Roberts which he wished me to deliver to Preston King chairman of the
					Committee on Revolutionary Pensions H.R.U.S. Hugh White, moves a Committee of

					Dromgoole moves a message to remind the Senate of 4 bills sent them from the
					house— Vote to suspend the rules 39 to 72. Sundry bills from the Senate were
					passed or referred— Harralson reported a bill for granting lands to the
					soldiers—numerous other reports of Committees. Sawyer moved to suspend the rules
					for a call for the correspondence on the Oregon Treaty—refused—no yeas and nays.
					Land graduation bill. Call of the House—173 answer. Cobb’s amendment M’Kay’s
					amendment were rejected 87 and 95—and 88–93— Motion to lay the bill on the table
					90 to 89. lost by the Speaker’s vote making a tie— Moved and lost again 91 to

				<p>IV— Second bath and swim in the Potowmack the weather still continuing at intense
					summer heat— My repose of the last Night was not impaired, but rather improved
					by the bath of yesterday. H.R.U.S. The race of reconsiderations was renewed at
					the first meeting of the house— The amendment moved by Cobb, and the amendment
					of that moved by M’Kay, after being both rejected had both been reconsidered—
					The previous question had been ordered, and M’Kay had moved to reconsider that—
					He now withdrew that motion and moved a call of the house which the Speaker
					pronounced not in order— Truman Smith moved to adjourn, and asked for the yeas
					and equivalent to a call of the house. 6 to 163. Schenk moved to reconsider the
					motion just rejected. The Speaker decided that a motion to adjourn could not be
					reconsidered— Schenk appealed, and stood alone in his glory— M’Kay’s substitute
					for Cobb’s amendment was then adopted 96 to 86— And M’Kay’s Bill substituted for
					that of the Senate was passed 92 to 90. Ewing of Pennsylvania remarked that C.
					J. Ingersoll did not vote— A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Sundry
					bills received from the Senate one for the relief of Elizabeth Hamilton. Hoge
					moves to lay it on the table 69 to 81— Referred— Bill for the improvement of
					Ohio, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas inland Seas— Rejected 120 to 48.
					Treasury Note and loan bill. Garrett Davis discusses the Mexican War and offers
					an amendment to the Bill; Tilden, Giddings, Thurman of Ohio and Douglas of
					Illinois racketed the lie that the War began by an act of Mexico Tibbatts took
					the floor and the Committee Samuel Gordon chairman rose— M’Kay moved a
					Resolution to close the debate at Noon tomorrow— Adjourned without taking the
					question.</p>

				<p>Third bath and swim in the Potowmack, at 5 O’Clock this morning: still with a
					clear sky and a bright rising Sun; but with a fall of ten degrees Fahrenheit
					from 84 to 74, and a brisk breeze ruffling the surface of the river so that I
					shivered while dressing at my old rock when I came out, but warmed in walking
					home, and suffer no after-inconvenience. Nathaniel Chick was again here this
					morning, 86. feeble—tottering at the gate of death— I took his papers to the
					Commissioner of Pensions and intreated him to re-examine them and reconsider his
					decision. He returned them this Evening with a Letter saying that he has no
					confidence in them and sees no evidence that Chick is entitled to a pension for
					service either in the war of the Revolution, or in the last War with England—
					H.R.U.S. M’Kays motion to close the debate on the Treasury Note and loan bill at
					Noon this day was carried— Garrett Davis, Stanton of Tennessee, Graham of North
					Carolina moved amendments which were rejected as was an additional section moved
					by Andrew Stewart. Joseph R. Ingersoll, moved an appropriation of 50000 dollars
					to pay certain old Treasury notes, once paid but stolen and reissued at

				<p>Fourth bath and swim in the Potowmack. Water and atmosphere cold, but smooth,

					which I agreed— H.R.U.S. The day began by an explanation of Tibbatts against

				<p>Fifth bath and swim in the Potowmack—and this day Thomas Dumphy went with me.
					Weather cool and cloudy. Water smooth and cold— Time of tide at 5 A.M. beginning
					to serve— Returned along the strand and the border of the Tiber— Nathaniel Chick
					came again, but still wished to postpone going with me to the pension office— He
					said he had written to the Governor of Pennsylvania for a certificate of
					character and wished to wait for his answer— I see he is unwilling to be
					confronted with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards— I took him with me to his
					lodgings at Donovan’s next to the Railway depot. Kavasales here— Still in
					suspense— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings went yesterday on a tour to Boston and
					Portland. H.R.U.S— The whole day was devoted to the private calendars— Sundry

					make a quorum adopted and superseded—with motions to adjourn reported and
					rejected 49 private bills were passed and sent to the Senate for concurrence—
					The vote to lay the Bill for the relief of William Poole on the table was
					reconsidered but when the question on the passage of the bill came there was no
					quorum voting and the house adjourned, about 3. I commenced my walk homeward and
					met judge Burnet with a young man named I think Derring an artist (Painter) who
					he said was going to Europe for improvement in his progression and for whom he
					requested from me Letters of introduction to any of my friends— I met the

				<p>IV.15— There was rain in the Night and this Morning was cloudy and cold— I
					concluded therefore reluctantly to intermit for some days my river baths. I have
					received an invitation to attend at the Commencement of Georgetown College on
					Tuesday the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> instant at half past nine O’Clock A.M. At
					the house sundry bills were received from the Senate and referred to Committees.
					The consideration of private bills occupied the remainder of time Till the

					Butler King Chairman, and then in the house— Among the Bills taken up was that
					for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton—an appropriation of 76300 dollars
					to be paid them in full of his <unclear>demands</unclear> Reported by Robert C. Schenk from the
					Committee on Naval affairs— When the bill came up, Schenk the reporter was not
					in the house, and several attempts were made, to pass over the bill to defeat
					it— Connell was in the passageway to the house in great distress and
					consternation. Hungerford moved to strike out 76300 and insert 16300. lost.
					Gordon moved 20000 which the chairman announced not in order, but the committee
					reversed this decision— Gordon then modified to 40000 Joseph J M’Dowell cited a
					speech of Silas Wright in the Senate which I answered— Rathbun moved to report
					the bill with recommendation to reject it—lost. I moved to rise, and report the
					Bill— Carried— Passed to a third reading by yeas and nays—90 to 67. and passed
					and reconsideration refused— It has yet to go through the ordeal of the Senate—

				<p>The Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> E. Yulee of Woodward College, Cincinnati a Minister
					of the New Jerusalem Church, performed the service of public worship in the Hall
					of the house of Representatives this morning— I suppose him to be an Israelite,
					converted to Swedenborg Christianity— He read some passages from the Bible—made
					a short and frigid prayer—gave out by two lines at a time to be sung the hymns
					With one consent let all the Earth, To God their cheerful voices raise— Read the
						53<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> chapter of Isaiah, and delivered a cold address of
					half an hour, upon the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse of that chapter.— “Surely,
					he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him
					stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.” Upon this text he engrafted the
					doctrine of correspondences so as to make it more unintelligible than it is by
					Swedenborg himself— There were I think not fifty persons in the hall, but among
					them was the Senator from Florida, the quondam David Levy—with his wife— He
					spoke to his namesake the preacher after the Service. I have received a pamphlet
					on this correspondence of natural things to spiritual by T. H. Perry professor
					of Mathematics in U.S. Navy— At 5 this afternoon I went to S<hi rend="superscript"
						>t.</hi> John’s Church, but found all the doors closed— There was no evening
					service there— I read the first of the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Daniel Baker’s
					revival Sermons—on the excellency of the Christian Religion; but the argument of
					the discourse is rather upon the evidence than the excellence of Christianity—
						M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker complains of the unreasonable calls of
					unbelievers for evidence— It is strange that all professed arguments upon the
					Evidences, result in exciting and multiplying questions in my mind— We must

				<p>The time for morning bath in the Potowmack now suits exactly, but I am
					discouraged by a drooping state of health, and symptoms admonitory which I dare
					not disregard— I met at the Capitol M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healey the painter,
					and went with him to Plumbe’s gallery where they took two Daguerrotype full
					lengths likenesses of me, both very indifferent— He wanted it to introduce me as
					a spectator into the historical picture of Daniel Webster answering Robert Y.
					Hayne in the debate in the U.S. Senate on Foote’s Resolutions in 1831—which he
					is to paint for certain Boston Whigs to be suspended in Faneuil Hall— I told
						M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Healey that I must decline being introduced into that
					picture, not having been a member of the Senate at that time, nor present at the
					scene— I was residing in this City in private life, from 3. March 1829. until
					December 1831. when I took my seat as a member of the House of Representatives
					Healey told me that he was engaged also to paint a historical picture of John C.
					Calhoun in some oratorical attitude, as a counterpart to this illustration of
					Daniel Webster, to be hung up somewhere at Charleston S.C— and that these two
					works would be the great labour of his life— He said he should leave this city
					next Thursday and after stopping at Philadelphia to paint a copy of Inman’s
					portrait of Chief Justice Marshall should proceed to Boston and embark in the
					Steamer of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August to return to France and after
					thus accomplishing his Commission from king Louis Philippe he intends to come
					back here, to accomplish his two great historical pictures— On my return to the

				<p>Recovering from the total prostration of my faculties of body, and almost as
					total of the energies of mind I endeavour once more to resume some useful
					occupation—in vain. The house confined itself almost entirely to the
					consideration of private bills—taking up first the bills from the Senate
					reported yesterday from the committee of the whole— Among these was the bill for
					the relief of Amos Kendall, upon which there have been repeated decisions
					against him, and on which he was for years within prison bounds. The last
					decision was in his favour, and uncle Sam pays the piper— There was also a bill
					granting a small sum to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pike, widow of Zebulon

					of Claims opposed it tooth and nail— So did Atkinson of Virginia, and Houston of
					Alabama, who moved to lay it on the table. But it was supported by Gordon and
					Culver, and passed 88 to 64— This day closed with a bill for the settlement of
					the accounts of John Garnett an Indian agent, which was read a third time, but
					on the question of its passage no quorum voted, and after an ineffectual motion

					to reduce the import duties and repeal the Tariff of 1842. The hall was crowded
					and he has the faculty of claiming the attention of his auditory—but his

				<p>The Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Flanders a Universalist from Saint Louis Missouri
					preached this morning in the Hall of the House of Representatives— His forms of
					worship are those of the Congregational church, but his mode of prayer seemed to
					me not quite sufficiently devotional. He gave out two hymns, from the collection
					used by the unitarian Society, in the city and they were sung by persons of the
					auditory present, which was not large— The text of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					Flanders was Genesis 1.28. [“]And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be
					fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it”— The preacher
					probably did not know, that this was precisely the passage cited by me on the
						2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of January last as the primitive foundation of our
					title to the Oregon Territory— The Doctrine deduced from it by M<hi rend="superscript"
						>r</hi> Flanders was that Man was by the Constitution of his Nature was
					created a laborious animal— That the condition of his existence in the Garden of
					Eden, before the fall was labour He gave notice that the Rev<hi rend="superscript"
						>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Yulee would preach at the Unitarian Church
					this afternoon at 4 O’Clock, and he himself this Evening at 8— There was no
					evening service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s. I wished to attend in the
					afternoon at 4 at the Unitarian Church, but was forbidden owing to the intense
					heat of the weather I did attend at 8 in the evening, and heard M<hi rend="superscript"
						>r</hi> Flanders, from John 8.32. [“]And ye shall know the truth and the
					truth shall make you free”— But what is truth? The Sermon was a very earnest
					discourse to prove the universal salvation of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
					mankind— As in Adam <hi rend="italic">all</hi> died, so in Christ shall <hi
						rend="italic">all</hi> be made alive— I hope so, and still find some
					consolation in attendance upon public worship— I am encouraged with continued
					symptoms of convalescence</p>

				<p>V.— Fahrenheit 82—the temperature of the Night Life seems returning to me, and
					with it the longing for the Potowmac bath and swim— But I have not the command
					of my own limbs and cannot go— Nor can I yet keep along with the current of my
					correspondence, or <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi> the public business with
					which I am concerned— I answered three Letters from a man named Sizer, enquiring
					concerning a petition presented originally by Osmyn Baker, and against which the
					Committee of claims reported last March— I have received also a Letter from J.
					Bigelow agent for the heirs of Francois Cazaux, in whose favour there is a bill
					before the house—and a report from the judiciary Committee— Also a printed
					Circular from Wiley and Putnam 26. July 1846. New York, enclosing another to the
					Secretary of State of the several States proposing to purchase public documents
					and books for the Managers of the British Museum— At the House the Speaker
					announced the Warehousing bill as the special order of the day but it was
					postponed till next Wednesday, and a Resolution was adopted to close the debate
					on the fortification bill at Noon this day— The Bill was immediately taken up in
					Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Orville Hungerford Chairman
					and Ashmun made an hour speech against the President for the War with Mexico.
					M’Kay took no notice of it but talked about the fortifications— Burt wasted some
					ten minutes and 12. O’Clock came. Numerous additional amendments were proposed
					and rejected— That offered by Joseph R. Ingersoll authorising the President to
					settle for the Pea patch Island was adopted and the Bill passed— The Postage
					bill was next taken up and debated till for lack of a quorum the Committee rose
					and the house adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber and heard M<hi

						<p>IV:30— The remnant of my life is a long disease— A succession of
							complaints disable me for all active exertion of mind or of body and I
							no sooner seem to recover from one, than I am stricken down by another—
							I am especially deprived of that continuity of application to particular
							subjects indispensable for the transaction of business public or
							private. The course of Legislation carried on by the present
							administration of the Government is vicious and pernicious, but it is
							sustained by the will or the acquiescence of the People— The Nation is
							plunged into an unjust and wicked War—and not only submits to it, but
							wages it as if it were a War of self defence: I still receive numerous
							applications from individuals to assist them in the prosecution of their
							claims but am often unable to follow them up with that unintermitting
							attention without which it is impossible to carry them through— At the
							house, Strong and Culver moved Resolutions concerning the distribution
							of document books to the new members which failed for lack of two thirds
							majorities to suspend the rules— The Postage bill was taken up in Union
							Committee David S. Reid 3. North Carolina—with a long rigmarole episode,
							about the resignation of W. H. Haywood a Senator from that State.
							Briggs, Barringer, Dobbin Dockery discoursed about it and about it—all
							a-propos of the Post office bill, till soon after 2. the Committee rose,
							and the house adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber where John M.
							Niles Senator from Connecticut was blowing the last blast against the
							Tariff bill—in vain— The engrossment of the bill had been carried by the
							casting vote of the Vice-President George M. Dallas, and the bill passed
							28 to 27.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Connell here this Eve.</p>

						<p>I received 26. Letters, printed, all of one tenor but signed by different
							individuals, from Nantucket, invoking my influence in support of the
							bill to indemnify the sufferers by French spoliations before 1800. The
							appeal to my feelings is most impressive—but the day of my strength is
							past, and an atmosphere at 90 degrees of Fahrenheit annihilating. A
							Scotchman by the name of Stewart was here— A benevolent undertaker to
							promote the migration of his poor Countrymen to the United States, and
							soliciting money for himself which I declined to give— At the House the
							new tariff bill was received from the Senate with an amendment striking
							out the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section— The special order of the day,
							the Warehouse bill was postponed till to-morrow. Call of the house 211
							answered 10 absent 4 vacancies— The question to suspend the special
							order and take up the Message from the Senate was carried 108 to 100.
							Winthrop claimed that it could be carried only by a two thirds vote— The
							Speaker said it was too late to raise the objection— Winthrop appealed
							and the appeal was laid on the table. 102 to 98. Stewart moved to lay
							the bill with the Senate’s amendment on the table, lost 96 to 113.— A
							second motion to lay the bill on the table was rejected 99 to 113—and
							the concurrence with the amendment of the Senate was carried 115 to 92—
							And thus perishes the Tariff of 1842. Carried by a majority of one John
							White then Speaker of the House, and now repeated by the casting vote of
							George M Dallas Vice President of the United States and President of the
							Senate— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Post
							Office Bill, debated till of the 210 who had voted on the Tariff bill
							there was not a quorum of 113 left, and after some convulsive throes,
							the Committee rose, and the house adjourned.</p>

							Congressional District of Massachusetts, put into my hands a Letter to

							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrett encloses a Letter of 3 June 1846 to

							Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union David S. Reid 3. North

							consideration of the bill Rathbun moved to lay Owen’s motion of

						<p>I received a Letter from Rufus W. Griswold dated yesterday at
							Philadelphia enclosing a printed notice of 3. octavo pages headed John
							Quincy Adams—and asking copies of my Oration at Cincinnati, and my
							speech against the admission of Texas— At the house instead of resuming
							the consideration of the French spoliation bill, they went into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Warehousing
							system bill, which was the special order of the day. M’Kay moved a Call
							of the house and 165 answered to their names— Hilliard of Alabama opened
							the debate, by moving to strike out the first section, except the
							enacting clause, and he spoke an hour against the bill, and about the
							Tariff of 1842 and its repeal just consummated, for which he voted
							though he had many objections to the new bill— Truman Smith of
							Connecticut followed with a heavy and bitter invective against the
							repeal of the Tariff of 1842.— Thomas H. Bayly and W. W. Payne of
							Alabama consumed two successive hours in railing not in good fat terms,
							but in hectoring commonplace against the tariff of 1842. Andrew Stewart
							of Pennsylvania replied to them both in a tone somewhat like their own
							though much more spirited— John G. Chapman 3. Maryland took the floor—
							The Committee rose and the house adjourned— William H. Haywood jun<hi
