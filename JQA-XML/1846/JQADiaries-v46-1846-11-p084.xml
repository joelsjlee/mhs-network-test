						<p>He answered me and said, This present life is not the end where much
							glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for the weak. 43. But the
							day of doom shall be the end of this time, and the beginning of the
							immortality for to come, wherein corruption is past 2. Esdras
							7.42–43.</p>
						<p>This passage of the second Apocryphal book of Esdras carries with it
							internal evidence of its composition since the advent of Christ.</p>
						<p>The influenza, better denominated in the French language La grippe has
							recently become epidemic in this neigbourhood—and has severely exercised
							several members of my family— It has the last three days been gradually
							creeping upon me, and at 10 last night I went to bed with a hoarse
							voice, and a burning sore throat— About one this morning it had become
							so intense that I was compelled to request <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> to rise and get for
							me some hot balm tea which she did and sat up with me the whole night,
							to the imminent danger of her own health. The severity of the stricture
							upon the throat passed off before morning day-light, and I rose at half
							past five I rose much relieved but still hoarse, and with the paretytic
							shaking of the hands totally disabled for writing— I can yet read, and
							did read four chapters of the second book of Esdras, and took comfort
							from the verse which I have made out to extract from it at the top of
							this page— The hope of a future life is the only solace for the
							infirmities of age, and for all the ills that flesh is heir to, as I am
							to the condition of an aspen leaf—</p>
						<p>I attended meeting as usual morning and afternoon at the Temple. <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							preached in the forenoon from Galatians 5.6 [“]For in Jesus Christ
							neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith
							which worketh by love”— The whole sum of the Christian Religion is
							contained in this text— Circumcision was a religious painful and bloody
							operation upon the body of every male child first instituted by <persRef
								ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> under the express command of God,
							for himself and all his descendants but for which no reason was
							assigned, except that of distinguish them from all the rest of mankind—
							It was emblematic of nothing but submission against the cry of physical
							nature itself to the will of God— It is practiced by the posterity of
							Abraham to the present day— It was abolished not by express command of
							Jesus Christ, but by the substitution of the rite of baptism in its
							place, an emblem, of purification from the pollution of nature, and of
							washing away every impurity from a body born in the image of God, and
							bound in sympathy to all mankind and to hold a Faith working by love— In
							the afternoon the <persRef ref="capen-lemuel">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

							that made her 2. Esdras 11.46.</p>
						<p>There is a marked difference between the canonical books of the Bible and
							the Apocryphal writings in this— I have never met with any difficulty in
							selecting from four chapters of the old Testament every morning one
							verse to be copied for the lesson of the day. In these books of Esdras,
							a sentiment worthy to be imprinted upon the memory and the heart is not
							always to be found in the compass of four chapters—unless as in the
							above passage connected with other verbiage which takes away all the
							point of sententiousness—</p>

						<p>I thought myself all day yesterday wholly relieved from the grippe upon
							my throat—but after going to bed last night, a return in mitigated form
							of the threatened visit from quinsy—disturbed though it did not entirely
							destroy my repose— I had sleep but not quiet— Once in the middle of the
							Night, <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> rose from
							bed to give me a second cup of warm balm tea, and I
								<unclear>dined</unclear> rise for the day till the entry Clock
							struck six— The hoarseness had again very much subsided and the sore
							throat wholly disappeared— My regular course of occupation is broken up,
							and idleness is the doom of my remaining days by the refusal of my hands
							to perform the task of recording my daily thoughts and deeds— We had a
							visit from <persRef ref="tufts-susannah">Miss Susan Tufts</persRef> of
							Weymouth this afternoon, and I had a professional visit from <persRef
								ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef>— He prescribed for me a warm foot bath before
							going to bed this evening—and a tea spoonful of the syrup of Tolu, to be
							repeated in the course of the Night— He directed me also to wash my legs
							every morning with a mixture of New-England rum and water— Among my
							symptoms of decay, is a constant heat and irritation in the outer side
							of my legs below the calf which I have suffered for the last eighteen
							months with a discolouring of the parts and feverish heat portending
							ulceration, and a swelling round the ancles at night whenever I walked
							in the course of the day. The swelling and the heat generally subsiding
							in the course of the Night Throughout last winter they were washed with
							milk and water every night before going to bed, but as the Summer came
							on the complaint subsided and the fomentation was omitted— With the
							reapproach of cold weather the complaint has now returned and I am to
							resort to rum instead of milk to mingle with water for the wash— I
							received a Letter from <persRef ref="cutter-georgiana">Georgiana
								Cutter</persRef> of Quincy Illinois 16. October 1846. asking for an
							answer and a piece of poetry— <persRef ref="sumner-charles2">M<hi

								Woodward’s</persRef> warm foot bath, and his two teaspoon fulls of
							Syrup of Tolu were succeeded by a quiet night, and sleep till near six
							this morning when I rose— Besides my usual frictions and ablutions, I
							washed my legs with New England rum and water, mixed about half and
							half— The teazing titillation with which they are unceasingly tormented
							was less annoying through the day than it has been for months, but I may
							not hope for a long respite from this remedy. The mildness of the
							weather doubtless contributed to my momentary relief— My sore throat is
							gone— The hoarseness of my voice much mollified—but the shaking hand
							cannot be made steady and my efforts to write are vain— We had a morning
							visit from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Ex President
							Quincy</persRef>—who has removed to Boston for the Winter, but still
							lingers about the Quincy hive— And I received a letter from his Son
								<persRef ref="quincy-edmund4">Edmund Quincy</persRef>—Dedham 2.
								Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1846. informing me that the Norfolk
							County Anti-Slavery Society will hold a quarterly meeting in the Town

							inviting my attendance at the Meeting. I took to the Post Office this

								ref="hodgson-william">William B. Hodgson</persRef>— It consists of

								Habersham</persRef> of Savannah of the most important fossil bones
							and shells in his possession, discovered in 1842 on the Island of

							of the remains of several distinct animals of enormous
							dimensions—Megatherium—Megatonyx—Mastodon—Horse—Hog-hippopotamos,
							Elephant and bos. These are all considered by the author as the enduring
							records of the antiquity of the globe— As the medals and the vestiges of
							creation, by which its pre human history is read, and which attest the
							rise and fall of kingdoms animal, before the existence of Man— This is a
							hasty and unwarranted conclusion— The existence of a race of Giants is
							expressly recognized in holy writ—but not before the creation of
							man—</p>

						<p>Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is
							profitable— <persRef ref="tobit">Tobit</persRef> 4.18.</p>
						<p>This is good advice— The two books of <persRef ref="ezra"
								>Esdras</persRef> are not either in my French or my German Bible—
							They were not admitted into the Canon of Scripture at the Council of
							Trent, and are not considered as Canonical by the Church of Rome. The
							books canonized by the Council of Trent are Tobit, <persRef ref="judith"
								>Judith</persRef>, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and first and second
							Maccabes—and Baruch, annexing it to <persRef ref="jeremiah"
								>Jeremiah</persRef>— The sixth of the 39 Articles of the Church of
							England after declaring canonical 38 books of the old Testament, says
							“and the other books (as <persRef ref="stjerome">Hierome</persRef>
							saith) the Church doth read for example of life, and instruction of
							manners; but yet doth it not apply there to establish any doctrine:
							these are the first and second, called the third and fourth Books of
							Esdras, Tobias, Judith, the rest of the Book of <persRef ref="esther"
								>Hester</persRef>, Wisdom, Jesus the son of <persRef
								ref="sirach-joshua">Sirach</persRef>, <persRef ref="baruch"
								>Baruch</persRef> the prophet, The Song of the three children, The
							story of <persRef ref="susanna">Susanna</persRef>, Of Bel and the
							Dragon, The Prayer of Manassas, and the first and second book of
							Maccabees[”]— The Protestant churches in general, save the church of
							England deny all authority whatever to all the apocryphal books, and
							they are never read in any of the congregational churches of New
							England— I once heard <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> however, take a
							text from one of them—auxiliary to another text from the New Testament—
							I read them in company with the true Bible, but with a different feeling
							for their -structions than for those of the canonical books The Book of
							Jesus the Son of Sirach, Ecclesiasticus; is the only one of the
							collection upon which I set much value, and that is inestimable— The
								<persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count de Maistre</persRef> at Saint
							Petersbourg spoke to me in rapturous terms of the Wisdom of <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, and I have often heard it highly
							prized by others— There are in it many good sentiments in it but I do
							not concur in the judgment which dignifies it with the name of Solomon.
							The books of the Maccabees, are readable only as historical narratives,
							and as such are exceedingly confused— This book of Tobit is a sort of
							fairy tale, remarkable chiefly as an interesting picture of domestic
							life and of the family affections among the Jews, and of their
							attachment to their religion during the Assyrian captivity.</p>

							forgot the invitation of <persRef ref="quincy-edmund4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edmund Quincy</persRef> to the meeting
							of the Norfolk County Anti-Slavery Society held at the Town-Hall— It was

							Society, and they have disclaimed all confidence in me: but I sympathize
							with all their aversion to Slavery—</p>

						<p>Prayer is good, with fasting, and alms, and righteousness— A little with
							righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to
							give alms than to lay up gold— Tobit 12.8.</p>
						<p>Prayer, fasting, alms—righteousness—constitute the moral code of the
							Apocryphal books— <persRef ref="tobit">Tobit</persRef> and his family
							were of the tribe of Naphthali, one of the ten, and consequently of the
							Assyrian Captivity. He lived at Ninive, and his family and tribe fell
							into idolatry, and sacrificed unto the heifer <persRef ref="baal"
								>Baal</persRef>—but Tobit himself adhered to the exclusive worship
							at Jerusalem— The marriage of his son Tobias with <persRef ref="sarah"
								>Sara</persRef>, daughter of <persRef ref="reuel">Raguel</persRef>
							who dwelt at Ecbatana, a city of Media, was contracted conformably to
							the Levitical law, like that of <persRef ref="boaz">Boaz</persRef> with
								<persRef ref="ruth">Ruth</persRef>, as the nearest of kin— And Tobit
							had committed ten Talents in deposit to Gabael, in Rages, another city
							of Media. By a marvelous accident he had become blind and Sara was
							bewitched by an evil Spirit named <persRef ref="asmodeus"
								>Asmodeus</persRef> who had fallen in love with her, and had killed
							seven husbands to whom she had been successively been betrothed on their
							respective wedding nights— So Tobit prays at Ninive for restoration of
							his sight, and Sara prays at Ecbatana, for deliverance from the witchery
							of Asmodeus—and <persRef ref="raphael">Raphael</persRef> was sent to
							heal them both—to scale away the whiteness of Tobit’s eyes, and to give
							Sara for a wife to Tobias and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit—all which
							he performs— Tobit lives after all this nearly a hundred years at
							Ninive— Towards the close of his life he called his son Tobias and
							strictly enjoined upon him and his six Sons to remove from Ninive to
							Ecbatana in Media, because the prophesy of <persRef ref="Jonas"
								>Jonas</persRef> against Ninive should surely come to pass and
							Ninive should be destroyed— Tobit seems not to have known that when
							Jonah did prophesy the destruction of Ninive, it was to be consummated
							within 40 days; but that the people of Ninive repented of their Sins,
							and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto
							them: and he did it not the prophesy was never fulfilled; to the great
							affliction and indignation of the prophet himself—</p>

						<p>In the book of <persRef ref="jonah">Jonah</persRef>, God says there were
							in the City of Ninive six score thousand persons who knew not their
							right hand from their left, importing a population of a million—besides
							much cattle— He says this in answer to the reproach of Jonah, for his
							forbearance to execute the threat of destruction which Jonah by his
							command had announced to the inhabitants of that city— The multitude of
							human beings who must suffer by the destruction of such a city besides
							other living animals is presented as a motive for the Lord to revoke his
							own decree against the devoted victim of his anger, and shews in bold
							relief the absurd inconsistency of the prophet who had bowels of
							compassion for a withering vegetable, and none for the city of Ninive—
							Here the book of Jonah closes, and leaves a delightful sentiment for the

						<p>And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of the first month,
							there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians,
							that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth.</p>
						<p>Judith 2.1.</p>
						<p>This Nabuchodonosor, called in the Hebrew Bible <persRef
								ref="nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</persRef>, and Nebuchadrezzar,
							is not known by that name in prophane history—nor is the person named
							Nabuchodonosor in this book of Judith the same with the one who put out
							the eyes of <persRef ref="zedekiah">Zedekiah</persRef> and extinguished
							the kingdom of Judah by the Babylonian captivity— The heathen name of
							this Nabuchodonosor was Saosduchinus—his Capitol was Niniveh, and what
							or where this Bethulia was, which his General <persRef ref="holofernes"
								>Holofernes</persRef> was besieging when <persRef ref="judith"
								>Judith</persRef> delivered her country and the world from him in
							this wonderful manner no one knows— The name of the dreamer
							Nabuchodonosor whose dreams <persRef ref="daniel">Daniel</persRef>
							discovered and expounded was <persRef ref="nabopolassar"
								>Nabopolassar</persRef>, and he was the father of Nebuchadnezzar the
							great— I cannot disentangle the snarl.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							preached this morning at the Temple, from Acts 1.8. the last clause of
							the verse—“and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in
							all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” He
							omitted the first clause—“But ye shall receive power, after that the
							Holy Ghost is come upon you.” These were the last words spoken by Jesus
							to his apostles, after his passion, on mount Olivet— They consist first
							of the promise of power, by the outpouring of the holy Ghost—and 2. of
							the instruction to go and preach as his witnesses, throughout the earth—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did not remark upon the grant of
							power nor upon the promise of the holy Ghost; but confined his discourse
							to the character of witnesses, which was conferred upon the apostles—
							The greek word is martyrs—ye shall be martyrs unto me.— The occurrence,
							and the last words of Jesus are related somewhat differently, in the
							last three verses of the gospel of <persRef ref="matthew"
								>Matthew</persRef>—but the drift of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s discourse was upon the import of the word witnesses applicable
							only to <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>— His argument was that the truth of
							the Christian Religion depended not upon the nature of its doctrine, nor
							upon the faith or belief of its followers, but upon the facts of its
							history of which the apostles could be preachers to the world, efficient
							only so far as they were faithful witnesses to facts— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from James
							1.19—[“]Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear,
							slow to speak, slow to wrath” an admirable lesson of practical morality;
							from which he took occasion to bear testimony against Slavery, and to
							express the hope that no Slaveholder would ever hereafter be elected
								<unclear>the</unclear> chief magistracy of this Union— This doctrine
							is not yet sufficiently palatable even for this climate— <persRef

						<p>It is passing strange that there should be no trace of this War of the

							against the kingdom of Israel, in which <persRef ref="holofernes"

						<p>One hundred years after this, the reigns of <persRef ref="hezekiah"

						<p>And if a man love righteousness, her labours are virtues; for she

						<p>Wisdom of Solomon 8.7.</p>
						<p>Here is another admirable sentiment, but which did not originate with
								<persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>— It comes from the moral
							philosophy of the Grecian Schools— I wasted hours this day in searching
							to trace it to its source, with no better success than to find them
							named in <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Treatise de
							Inventione 2.53. I believe the word Virtue is not once used in the Old
							Testament— In the new Testament it is used in two very different
							senses—1. Mark 5.30 and Luke 6.19. where the diseased were healed by
							touching the hem of the garment of Jesus, and it is said virtue went out
							of him; but in both these instances the word in the Greek Testament is
							δύναμις—power—and 2.2. Peter 1.3 and 5 where the word in the Greek
							Testament is ἀρετῆ— The word virtus in Latin, and by its derivation
							means manhood, because, as Cicero says Fortitude is one of the
							properties of man and being the chief Virtues is taken to include them
							all under the name of virtus—manhood— In <persRef ref="johnson-samuel"
								>Johnson’s</persRef> dictionary there are ten different
							significations affixed to the word virtue— Its general meaning is a
							compound of all that is commendable in man— But this general excellence
							consists of many distinct properties some of them conflicting with
							others—hence the four cardinal virtues of the Greeks and Romans—and they
							are here called the labours of righteousness But when S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Peter exhorts the disciples of Christ to
							add to their faith virtue; and to their virtue knowledge and to their
							knowledge five other good moral qualities the sense of the word virtue
							is not well defined; for if virtue is added to faith and knowledge an

						<p>Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things

							that hath not deserved to be punished.</p>
						<p>Wisdom of Solomon 12.15.</p>
						<p>There is in this passage a good principle of moral instruction for the
							rulers of men, but it is not altogether correct as applied to the
							dispensations of Providence— For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
							scourgeth every son whom he receiveth— Hebrews 12.6.</p>

							preached at the Temple, in the forenoon from Luke 5.16—[“]And he with
							drew himself into the wilderness and prayed” The discourse was upon the
							duty of prayer, and the example of Jesus was urged in this case as the
							more impressive, in as much as his retirement into the wilderness to
							pray was immediately after the miraculous draught of fishes, and
							precisely at the time when he cured a man of leprosy, by merely touching
							him and saying I will, be thou clean, in answer to the leper, who fell
							on his face and besought him saying Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make
							me clean— This example seems to be a special recommendation of solitary
							prayer, as that which is commonly called the Lord’s prayer is in form
							and substance a social prayer.— What he prayed for in the wilderness the
							book does not say— The Lord’s prayer is a form of daily supplication
							suited to the whole human race, as children to their common parent, and
							after uttering the aspiration of the Soul that the kingdom of God may
							come and his will be done on Earth as in heaven, prays first for a daily
							food, and next for conditional forgiveness of sins. But this is not the
							prayer, to offer which Jesus withdrew into the wilderness, what was it?
							If he was himself a person of the triune God, to whom did he pray? and
							if he had power to heal leprosy with a word and to forgive sins, for
							what did he pray?— After the morning service M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt read the proclamation of <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Governor George N. Briggs</persRef> for the annual thanksgiving on
							Thursday The 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month—and he gave
							notice that in the afternoon there would be a special service on
							occasion of closing the Sunday school for the Season— It consisted of
							the singing of three occasional hymns on a printed page, distributed in
							the pews—the children of the school being present to the number of near
							150, and joining in the song— The sermon was from Ecclesiastes 11.6. “In
							the morning sow thy seed.” and was in the nature of an Address specially
							to the children— There was in this discourse, and also in the Governors
							proclamation for Thanksgiving a slap at Slavery—</p>

							Washington at the beginning of the next Month— That on arriving there I

							had purloined a Letter from the Post-Office, and 10 dollars for the

							man named Pratt— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White what could
							possibly be the motive of Kingsbury for such conduct. He said he did not
							know and could not imagine— That he and Kingsbury were both practising
							lawyers, and Kingsbury had begun with him by professions of friendship
							and mutual good offices but had first played him a shabby trick in
							business, and now for the last three years had been a continual
							annoyance to him by these offensive anonymous letters and infamous
							imputations— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clapp was here about two
