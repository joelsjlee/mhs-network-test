							the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king</persRef>. At a few

								<persRef ref="vonfinckenstein-karl">Count Finkenstein</persRef>,
							with the two other Ministers to be presented; <persRef
								ref="vonzinzendorf-friedrich">Count Zinzendorff</persRef> the Saxon
							Minister upon receiving his new credentials, and a Minister sent from
							Hanover to compliment the new king. They were both introduced before me,
							for which the Count formally gave me last night as a reason, that both
							of them had credentials to present and I had not.— The old Gentleman’s
							head is full of forms and precedencies and titles, and all the trash of
							diplomatic ceremony. The audience of the two other Ministers, was of
							about five minutes each. My turn then came. From the antichamber, the
							Count just entered with me into the king’s apartment, made his bow and
							withdrew I then told the king of my arrival with credentials to <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-ii">his father</persRef>, and a full power to
							renew the Treaty of Commerce; of the circumstances which prevented my
							delivering that Letter, and of my persuasion that the Government of the
							United States, immediately upon being informed of his Majesty’s
							accession would immediately send new credentials addressed to him He
							answered me that he should be very happy to maintain and renew the
							friendly and commercial connection with the United States; and that the
							commercial interests of the two Countries being the same, such a
							connection might be mutually advantageous: with regard to the renewal of
							the Treaty; in due time and place all proper attention should be paid to
							the subject. And he added some of the usual complimentary expressions of
							interest and regard for the United States.— After which he enquired how
							long <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> has been President,
							and whether <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> had
							entirely abandoned all connection with the administration of our
							affairs.— I then withdrew.— Dined at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Schickler’s</persRef> with a company
							of 25 or 30 Gentlemen, not one of whom I knew. In the afternoon I went
							round to pay my visits by cards, to the Ministers &amp;c.— Upon
							returning home between 5 and 6. found that the <persRef
								ref="frederica-louise2">Queen dowager</persRef> had sent here twice
							this afternoon notice that she would give me an Audience immediately. I
							went therefore as soon as possible. She said she was happy to see me;
							hoped I should stay here some time, and si le bon dieu le permet she
							should be glad to shew me any civility. Enquired whether I had been
							before in mission elsewhere, and upon my answering yes, in England and
							in Holland, she asked if I had known her daughter at the Hague; the
							<persRef ref="friederike-luise">Hereditary Princess of Orange</persRef>. I
							said I had seen her once, as I had arrived there only a few days before
							her departure. Ah! yes. said she. That was another very unfortunate
							thing for them; particularly at such a terrible season. She looks like a
							very good woman, and has the reputation of being really so.— The
							appearance of the king has a great degree of simplicity; a plain uniform
							and boots.— His person tall, and thin— His countenance grave approaching
							even to severity; but often lighting up with a very pleasing smile. He
							speaks rather quick.— <persRef ref="riqueti-honore">Mirabeau</persRef>
							has drawn a character of him highly advantageous in his libellous
							Letters; but he was then only sixteen years old. There are some
							promising circumstances at the commencement of his reign— Some that are
							less so.</p>

							much of the epidemic fever which has again been raging in Philadelphia

						<p><date>8. </date>At noon, went by appointment and was introduced by the
								<persRef ref="munchhausen-karl">Baron de Münchhausen</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="frederickhenrylouis">Prince Henry</persRef>. He
							usually resides at Rheinsberg, and is now here only upon the occasion of
							the <persRef ref="frederick-william-ii">king’s</persRef> death; after
							the funeral solemnity he will return. His conversation discovered more
							knowledge of America, and a mind more turned to speculation than any of

							rising while Europe was a declining part of the world, and that in the
							course of two or three centuries the seat of arts and sciences and
							Empire would be with us, and Europe would lose them all. Their progress
							had been westward, beginning in Asia, and it was natural that America
							should have her turn. But he asked whether we should have a center of
							union sufficiently strong to keep us together, and to stand the trials
							of the inconveniences incident to republican, and especially to
							federative Governments.— He enquired after <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>, of whom he
							spoke in terms of great respect— Mentioned <persRef
								ref="franklin-benjamin">Franklin</persRef>, whose bust he said he
							kept, and made some enquiries respecting <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>. He enquired also after young <persRef
								ref="marshall-louis">Marshall</persRef>, who he said had been here;
							whom he had seen, and who was quite a joli garçon.— He told me the
							circumstance upon which Marshall came here, and which related to the
							liberation of <persRef ref="lafayette">M. de la Fayette</persRef>.— This
							Prince is turned of 70. His name is very well known both in Europe and

							distinguished that of his yet <hi rend="italic">greater</hi>
							<pb n="202" type="ms"/>greater <persRef ref="frederick-ii"
								>brother</persRef>.— I believe that <persRef ref="riqueti-honore"

							Madame the <persRef ref="philippine">dowager Landgrave</persRef>, who is
							a fine woman; a sister of the <persRef ref="louiseofbrandenburg"

								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Catherine, instituted by the late
								<persRef ref="catherinethegreat">Empress of Russia</persRef>.—
							Stayed to dinner, as I had been invited. The company consisted of the

								ref="vonompteda-ludwig">Baron d’Ompteda</persRef>— The <persRef

							is all that such an occasion affords— The dinner was perfectly elegant

							Baron Riedesel talked with me much about America, and enquired
							particularly after <persRef ref="schuyler-philip2">General
								Schuyler</persRef> of whose treatment to him at the time when he was

							About two hours at table.— Home before five. Half an hour after, went as
							appointed and was introduced to the hereditary <persRef ref="friederike-luise"

							apartments. I saw her once before at the Hague; she looks now as if she
