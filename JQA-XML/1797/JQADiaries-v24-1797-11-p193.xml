							which appeared to be of the catholic persuasion— Saw a baptism— Heard a
							trumpet from the tower of the Church.— A common usage, to employ such
							persons for the amusement of the public. It belongs to their musical

							jarring. Their tones are most unmusical; but all must have and all must
							blow the horn.— There is a colossal pedestrian stone Statue of a warrior
							in complete armour, and an old rusty iron sabre in his hand, standing
							before the Church door, but with no legible inscription excepting the
							year of its date. 1546.— At Kletzke, a miserable village, where we could

						<p><date>10. </date>At 11 this morning, the <persRef

							Minister in the department of foreign affairs. He told me the same thing
							with the <persRef ref="vonfinckenstein-karl">Count

							civility. His manners have an apparent openness, approaching to
							bluntness, but far from unpleasing. This is what <persRef

								rend="italic">fruit du terroir</hi>. He mentioned his having known
							my father, and <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>.— Said he had seen here too another American who
							had passed through here once or twice—a man with a wooden leg—his
								name—“<persRef ref="morris-gouverneur">Morris</persRef>[”] said I.—
							The same— Pray has he any mission from the United States— None said I.—
							He had a mission in France but was recalled— What is he then? for to
							speak plainly we have thought his conduct here improper.— I know not
							what his business here has been, but I saw if I recollect in some
							newspaper, that he was charged with some commission by the British
							Government— Why to be plain (again) I suppose him to be <hi
								rend="italic">un volontaire en politique</hi>, dont la mission est
							de lui même— I made no reply, but recollected what the french
							representative <persRef ref="alquier-charles">Alquier</persRef> said of
							Morris to me, nearly three years ago.— M. d’Alvensleben further told me
							that he had known my father at the Hague, where he was about 9 months
							Prussian Minister, as he afterwards was at London.— He arrived in
							England just at the time when the <persRef ref="george-iii"
								>king</persRef> went mad, and was from November till May, without
							being able to deliver his credentials, in the same case as mine at
							present.— He enquired also how long it would be to receive Answers to
							dispatches between this and America.— A sufficient intimation of what he
							felt no doubt a scruple to say: that I must wait for new credentials. At
							five in the <pb n="196" type="ms"/>afternoon, I called upon the <persRef
								ref="haugwitz-christian">Count de Haugwitz</persRef> the third
							Minister of the department; the office of which is at his house, and he
							is said to be the real efficient Minister. He repeated with regard to
							the mission the civilities and the regret expressed before by both his
							colleagues.— Said he was yesterday at Potsdam, and mentioning my arrival
							to the king, witnessed his regret at being deprived by his extreme
							illness, of the pleasure with which he would have received my
							credentials.— He observed further that the present was an embarrassing
							and painful moment to the king’s Ministers; as the public business
							suffered much from his illness; and the hopes with which they had long
							flattered themselves of his recovery had been altogether disappointed—
							He then expatiated upon the excellence of the king’s personal character,
							and said he was beloved extremely by all his subjects.— I took my
							leave.— Upon my return home found <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> very unwell.— I have
							had constantly great apprehensions for her through the voyage and
							Journey; but she bore them both so well, that I hoped all danger was
