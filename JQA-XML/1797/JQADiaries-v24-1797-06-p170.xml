								ref="cutting-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cutting</persRef>;
							out at the Haerlem gate, and went round the canal beyond the walls, the

							Vancouver’s <persRef ref="vancouver-george">brother</persRef> has made

								Jefferson’s</persRef> instructions to the traveller <persRef
								ref="ledyard-john">Ledyard</persRef>, when he intended to try the
							passage across from Kamschatka. He was to carry nothing with him; no
							instruments, no books: nothing that could possibly tempt the avidity of
							a Savage. But he was to keep the Journal of his travels by pricking it
							with thorns upon his skin. He had a scale of a foot marked out with
							indian ink in inches and lines, upon his arm, between the elbow and the
							wrist. If he met any remarkable mountain or other object of which he
							wished to know the Latitude, he was to cut him a stick of three feet
							long, and in the same spot, mark the length of its shadow by the rising
							and setting sun, and then by the point of intersection drawn from the
							extremity of the two shadows, he would find the length of the shadow at
							noon, whence the Latitude might be collected. If he came across a river
							and wished to measure its width, he was to plant a stick at some station
							upon the bank, then with another stick horizontally level his eye at the
							opposite bank: after which turning round his stick, and preserving it at
							the same angle, take a sight with it at some object on the bank where he
							stood, and measure the distance, which would of course give him that
							across the river.— Cutting was in extasies while he told all this.— Poor
							Ledyard was stopped in his travels at Tobolsk, and afterwards died at
							Grand Cairo, on another Journey into Abyssinia. But had he pursued his
							north west road, whatever benefit his success might have procured to
							mankind, his journal upon his skin would not I think have been worth
							much.</p>

									>r:</hi> Lee</persRef> and myself to visit the little towns of
							Saardam and Broek, in North-Holland. We crossed the river Y, in a
							sailboat and on the other side took <hi rend="strikethrough">a</hi>
							carriages which carried us in two hours to Broek. This village is
							distinguished for its extreme cleanliness. It consists of about 200
							families most of which are very wealthy. You would imagine the whole
							village covered by a single roof. The Houses are all low, very neatly
							painted. There is a small yard or garden encircled by a fence before
							their front doors, which are all placed to high from the ground as to
							require three or four steps of descent. There are however no steps from
							them. The doors themselves are all never opened except upon two
							occasions when there is a death or a marriage in the family.— We saw the
							People coming from church, their dresses were all alike, all black and
							the customary habiliments of the Dutch Peasants. The women had a little
							square plate of silver, about the size of the reflecting glass in a
							mariners quadrant, fastened at each of their temples. The streets are
							not wide enough for the passage of any carriage drawn by horses or oxen.
							They are paved throughout with flat bricks, sanded and swept in angles
							like a floor. In the church, there was nothing remarkable. In the poor
							house, which we entered we found every thing neat in proportion to the
							Streets. From thence we went to Saardam, in two hours and an half. There
							we stopped and dined. This place I had seen before. It is a large town
							where the principal ship-building is carried on. It would be remarkably
							neat to any one, not <pb n="173" type="ms"/>coming from Broek. But that
							renders the judgment very fastidious. This is the place where the czar
								<persRef ref="peter-the-great">Peter</persRef>, called the Great,
							worked as a common ship-carpenter. They shew the house in which he
							worked.— We went to the Church where we found the Minister preaching to
							a large and decent auditory. We saw the picture of the woman thrown up
							by a bull, and delivered of a child in the air, an accident which is
							said to have happened in this place and has thus been commemorated.—
							After dinner we returned to Amsterdam, as we came. Evening principally
							in M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Marshall’s apartment.</p>
