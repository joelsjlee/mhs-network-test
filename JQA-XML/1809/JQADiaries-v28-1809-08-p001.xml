						<dateline>Saturday 5. August 1809.</dateline>
						<p>At noon this day, I left my house, at the Corner of Boylston and Nassau
							Streets in Boston, accompanied by <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>my wife</persRef>, my youngest child, <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles-Francis</persRef>, My wife’s Sister, <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine Johnson</persRef>, My nephew
							and private Secretary <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">William
								Steuben Smith</persRef>, <persRef ref="godfrey-martha">Martha
								Godfrey</persRef>, who attends my wife as her chambermaid, and a
							black man-servant named <persRef ref="nelson">Nelson</persRef>, to
							embark on a voyage to Russia, charged with a Commission as Minister
							Plenipotentiary from the United States of America to that Court. We went
							in a Carriage, over Charles river Bridge, to <persRef ref="gray-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> William Gray’s</persRef> wharf
							at Charlestown; we there went on board his Ship Horace, <persRef
								ref="bickford-benjamin">Captain Bickford</persRef>, fitted out on a
							voyage to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg direct— We found
							already on board the ship, <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander H. Everett</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Francis
								S. Gray</persRef>, who are going with me, as Secretaries attached to
							the Legation, but at their own expence. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							and <persRef ref="gray-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Gray</persRef> were also at the vessel, with two of their other
							sons— There were also a number of Gentlemen there who took leave of us
							at the wharf— We left it precisely as the Boston and Charlestown Bells
							were ringing One O’Clock.— <persRef ref="welsh-thomas">Doctor
								Welsh</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>
							went with us, down the harbour, and some short distance without the
							light-house— We received on our passage Salutes at the Navy-Yard in
							Charlestown, at Fort-Independence on Castle-Island, the Garrison of
							which was paraded as we pass’d; from the Revenue Cutter, Massachusetts,
								<persRef ref="williams-john6">Captain Williams</persRef>, and from
							the Chesapeake Frigate, <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Captain
							Hull</persRef>, which lay anchored about two miles without the light;
							and from which Captain Hull, sent an Officer on board with his
							compliments, and wishing us a pleasant passage. We returned the Salutes,
							and the compliments as well as we could— We had a fair wind, and a
							tolerably fresh breeze— About 4 in the afternoon my brother and D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Welsh took leave of us, and went on board
							the revenue Cutter, to return to Boston; we then stood out with a light
							breeze, and fair weather, which continued all the Evening, and had
							almost lost sight of the land, before the darkness of Night intercepted
							the shores from our view.</p>
						<p>At this Commencement of an Enterprize, perhaps the most important of any
							that I have ever in the course of my life, been engaged in, it becomes
							me to close the day by imploring the blessing of Providence upon it—
							That its result may prove beneficial to my Country, prosperous to my
							family and myself; and advantageous to all who are concerned in the
							voyage.</p>

						<p><date>6. </date><hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>.— On rising this morning we
							found ourselves out of sight of land— Weather cool and foggy— Winds
							light, and rather scant— About South; with some East— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson;godfrey-martha"
								>All the Ladies</persRef>—<persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>—and <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Everett</persRef> who has never

									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray</persRef>, who likewise is a new
							Sailor, has not yet been so— <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> and myself scarcely
							perceive that we are at sea.</p>
						<p>This is the fourth time that in the course of my life, I have embarked
							from Boston for Europe— The first was 11. Feb<hi rend="superscript"
								>y:</hi> 1778. in the Boston Frigate, <persRef ref="tucker-samuel"
								>Captain Tucker</persRef>— The second 14. November 1779. in the
							Sensible, French Frigate, <persRef ref="chavagnes-bide">Captain
								Chavagnes</persRef>. The third 17. September 1794. In the Alfred,
							merchant-ship, <persRef ref="macey-stephen">Captain Macey</persRef>— On
							the first and second of these voyages, I accompanied <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, who was going abroad upon
							public missions— On the third, I went in a similar character myself, and
							was accompanied by <persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>— The
							separation from my family and friends has always been painful; but never
							to the degree, which I feel it now— The age of my Parents, weakens both
							in them and me the hopes of our meeting again; and I now leave <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2">two of my own infant
								children</persRef> behind— My father and <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">Mother</persRef> are also deeply affected by my
							departure, and I received yesterday from my Mother a letter which would
							have melted the heart of a Stone.— The ties which bind me to my Country
							have multiplied with the increase of my years, and the difficulties and
							dangers of every kind, which present themselves in anticipation upon
							this occasion, exceed those of any former time— Excepting however the
							dangers of War to which on my two first voyages I was exposed; and which
							do not threaten us now— My Motives for accepting this Commission are
							various— That of serving my Country, in the Station which its regular
							organs have chosen to assign me, stands foremost of them all; and though
							it neither suits my own inclination, nor my own private judgment, I deem
							it a duty to sacrifice them both to the public sense, express’d by the
							Constitutional authority.</p>
						<p>I had yesterday previous to my embarking, completed my preparatory
							arrangements, as far as they could be completed. I leave my brother my
							Agent, for the transaction of all my business in America— I had settled
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray, and paid him for our passage;
							and after we came on board, I gave my brother a check for the balance
							due me at the U.S. Bank—Boston. I called in the forenoon at <persRef
								ref="smith-william3">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> William
								Smith’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Welsh’s</persRef>— And took leave of
							their families— Of the rest of my friends I took no particular leave—
							Heaven bless them all!— My brother had come into Boston the Evening
							before last—to be with us at the time of our departure— He had a
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas2">son</persRef> born in the morning;
							before he came from Quincy.</p>
						<p>The weather and the winds are among the most interesting objects to
							navigators upon the Ocean— We had a thick fog, the greatest part of this
							day. The wind fair, but scanty and not strong— We saw at a distance two
							schooners, but spoke neither of them— Our course has been about East
							&amp; by South— Latitude by Observation this day 42:34. The variation at
							Boston is about 8 degrees— About 4 this afternoon we came to the
							Northern extremity of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> George’s Bank, 42
							leagues from Boston.— I employed part of the morning in writing, and
							arranging my papers— And it being Sunday, I read the second and third
							Sermons of <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> Carême—
							The one, on the motives for Conversion, and the other on the truth of
							Religion— There is too much sameness in the method of these Sermons— In
							the former there is a very eloquent passage of invective upon the vices
							of the time; with a fine example of repetition from Psalm 101.20.
							[“]Prospexit de excelso sancto suo.”— And there are frequent melancholy
							allusions to the misfortunes of France at that period—the close of the
							reign of Louis 14.— The political views of these Sermons should be
							compared with those of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin’s</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="tillotson-john">Tillotson’s</persRef>, on the same
							occasions, to see how improper almost all Politicks are for the pulpit—
							There is also here a little controversy against the Protestants. He
							insists on the <hi rend="italic">antiquity</hi> of the Catholic Faith,
							as a proof of its Truth— He urges also the importance of the church’s
							precepts of abstinence, and complains that they are not sufficiently
							respected even by the true believers— His arguments on this head are
							chiefly from authority, of jewish examples— The strongest is the
							parallel, between the sin of <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef>, in
							eating an apple against the injunction of abstinence, and that of
								<persRef ref="cain">Cain</persRef> in killing <persRef ref="abel"
								>his brother</persRef>, in violation of the injunction against
							homicide.</p>

							Schooner from the Grand Bank; belonging and bound to Plymouth.— The fog
							was so thick that we did not see her untill within speaking distance,

								>Plutarch’s</persRef> life of <persRef ref="lycurgus"
								>Lycurgus</persRef>, and made some minutes from it— In the afternoon
							also, I read two Sermons of <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon</persRef>— On the forgiveness of injuries, and on the
							word of God— The first of these is the best of this author’s Sermons
							that I have yet read— The subject is indeed most interesting and
							copious— And the manner in which he treats it is adapted peculiarly to
							his auditory—to men of the world and courtiers— The divisions of the
							subject, are still too technical— The injustice of our enmities, and the
							insincerity of our reconciliations are the two parts— The first,
							subdivided into three—Taste—Interest—Vanity, which are the causes of our
							taking offence— The second also into three— The motives, process, and
							consequences of pretended reconciliation— There is some censure in this
							discourse upon the practice of dueling— There is argument, satire,
							indignation, tenderness, a keen search of every good corner in the
							heart, and every sound cellar of the brain. In the second Sermon, on
							preaching there is more ingenuity but less pathos— The division is
							founded on the dispositions with which believers ought to attend on
							preaching, and on those with which they should hear it— In this Sermon
							there is a passage very much to my purpose, in the Lecture which
							endeavours to trace the source of difference, between Catholic and
							Protestant preaching. It is page 170—and names <hi rend="italic"
								>docility</hi> as one of the dispositions with which preaching is to
							be heard— There is an anecdote told of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis
								14</persRef>. that he said to Massillon after hearing one of his
							Sermons—Father, I have heard and admired many other preachers, but you
							always make me dissatisfied with myself— If Louis said so, he had taken
							the idea from Massillon in this Sermon— He says that many hearers come
							to seek vain ornaments which amuse the patient without healing him,
							which make the preacher pleasing to the sinner, but not the sinner
							displeasing to himself.— I observe in this Sermon many instances of a
							very peculiar manner of applying passages of Scripture figuratively— No
							observation of the Sun this day— Lat. 43:44— Water at 70. morning and
							Noon— Air about the same.</p>
