								Saabye</persRef> called upon me this morning about nine O’Clock, and
							I had an hour’s conversation with him, upon the cases of Americans
							captured and detained here— He assured me that he had made every
							possible representation in their favour, and that this Government was
							certainly well disposed to do them Justice— He also told me that
								<persRef ref="bernstorff-christian">Count Bernstorf</persRef> was
							now at his Country seat, about three miles out of the City, and not far
							out of the way to Elseneur— That I could see him if I called there at
							any time before three O’Clock in the afternoon— I ordered a Carriage and
							horses to leave the City at half past one, and finished the letter to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Saabye— The Americans all came in, and
							detained me untill near one. The Russian Minister had appointed 12 at
							Noon to see me at his house, and invited me to dine with him to-morrow.
							When I called at his house I found he had been about five minutes gone
							out. I could not wait for his return, <pb n="21" type="ms"/>and wrote
							him an apology, which I left to be sent after our departure— The letter
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Saabye I left in like manner, and wrote a
							short note to Count Bernstorf, requesting an immediate conference with
							him intending to send it in at his house— Just after two we got into the
							Carriage, and went out first to Count Bernstorf’s house— There I found
							that he was not at home, and would not return untill late at Night— The
							wind has been all this day as fair as it could blow, for us to proceed
							upon our voyage— I could not justify to myself a longer delay, for
							business not within my Province, and upon which there was so little
							prospect of my being able to render the service which I desired. I gave
							up therefore the hope of seeing Count Bernstorf, and continued my
							Journey to Elseneur, where we arrived safe, about 9. O’Clock in the
							Evening.— We have seen upon our Journey scarcely any-thing but soldiers—
							Of which there are nearly fifty thousand upon this little Island of
							Zealand.— <persRef ref="schmetzer-johan">Schmetzer</persRef> the keeper
							of the house where we lodged told us there were soldiers enough, now
							they were not wanted; but none at all when they were— He also told us
							that seven bombs had fallen upon that single house, at the time of the
							English bombardment, and one woman killed standing at the gate— There is
							in the Streets of Copenhagen a great appearance of stagnation in all
							business and solitude— There is also the reality; for the English
							blockade, operates as a total obstruction to commerce, which was the
							principal subsistence of Copenhagen.</p>

						<p><date>5. </date>About 8 O’Clock this morning, the wind being fair though
							very light, we got under weigh, without being molested by the British
							Two decker which had anchored so near us— We sailed close under the
							Danish shore the whole day; <pb n="22" type="ms"/>which being very mild
							and pleasant, and the prospects on the shore very variegated and
							beautiful, I pass’d almost the whole day upon deck— The island of Hveen
							lies nearly midway between the Swedish and Danish shores, and between
							Elseneur and Copenhagen— It is about nine English Miles round— The
							principal objects which presented themselves as we pass’d between it on
							the left hand and the island of Zeeland on the right; are a solitary
							church, on the highest eminence of the land. The owner’s house, bosom’d
							high in tufted trees towards the Southern extremity of the island;
							several scattered farm houses, and on the very beach a few houses of
							fishermen— The owner is a Swedish nobleman, a <persRef ref="u">Count
								Tausen</persRef>.— Our Baltic Pilot tells me there are about five
							hundred inhabitants on the island. Just after passing by its Southern
							extremity we say beyond it on the Swedish shore Carlscrona, which is a
							considerable town— On the Danish side we successively pass’d Sletten
							village— Sophienberg, formerly a royal palace, but now the property of
							an individual— Wähback a place of Paper Mills, and where the principal
							part of the English troops landed at the bombardment of Copenhagen—
							Scotsport a village, the abode of Tanners and Tărbäck—with
							Charlottenlund, a royal summer-house sometimes called the hermitage— All
							these places afford a beautiful variety of romantic situations— And it
							was equally pleasing to see that the palaces had no magnificence, nor
							the villages no wretchedness in their appearance— We had also a view of
							the palace of Fredericsburg, about four miles out of Copenhagen. This
							City opened some of its steeples upon us before we had entirely pass’d
							the island of Hveen; but being situated on very low land, it makes not
							much figure as you pass it— We went without annoyance by the three crown
							battery, but opposite the centre of the City, there is another battery
							upon three sunken seventy-four gun ships; it is in the narrowest part of
							the channel; at what is called the middle ground— As we came up there, a
							gun was fired to bring us to—which was quite unexpected to the <persRef
								ref="bickford-benjamin">Captain</persRef> and both the pilots— They
							thought it was a demand for the usual salute of striking the
							top-gallant-sail; which was done— But immediately after a second gun was
							fired, loaded with a ball, which struck a little a-head of our ship— The
							channel was too-narrow to admit of the ship’s coming-to; so that we were
							obliged to come to anchor in the midst of the passage— An Officer came
							on board; examined the Captain’s Papers, and informed him he might
							proceed— This business delayed us upwards of an hour, and before we got
							over the grounds we had in succession three more visits from gun-boats
							and floating batteries— Two of the boats however on information who we
							were forebore coming on board— One of them took off our Pilot for the
							grounds, just at dusk of the Evening, and before we had entirely got
							over them. The grounds are shallows, between the islands of Amager and
							Saltholm just opposite Copenhagen; and the passage is so narrow, that
							they cannot be cross’d in the Night.— Amager island is joined by a
							bridge to the City of Copenhagen; and is inhabited principally by Dutch
							settlers, who supply the city with vegetables. At the Southern extremity
							of this island is a small town called Dragöe, and here terminates the
							passage over the grounds— About an hour afterwards we opened the
							light-house of Falsterbo on the Swedish shore, and ran insight of it
							untill Midnight— We spent the Evening at Cards.</p>

						<p><date>6. </date>This morning we had the island of Moen astern, almost out
							of sight, and the wind being unfavourable we were obliged to stretch
							over to the Coast of Swedish Pomerania, upon which we soon made the
							island of Rügen, nearly opposite to the mouths of the Oder river. We had
							very fine weather the whole day, and running close upon the wind we made
							before Night the island of Bornholm— The last of the Danish Islands—
								<persRef ref="bickford-benjamin">Our Captain</persRef> and Pilot
							preferring the passage North of this island, between it and the Swedish
							Coast, we were obliged to lay as close to the wind as possible, and this
							Evening to beat between the island and the main land— I was confined all
							this day by a bruise on one of my legs, which has been spreading an
							inflammation down to my ancle these ten days, <pb n="23" type="ms"
							/>almost without notice— I am now compell’d to treat it with more
							respect, and had it several times this day bathed with vinegar and salt,
							warmed— It has kept me close to the cabin; as the cold weather has done
							with most of the other passengers.— There are seven Islands which
							constitute the kingdom of Denmark— Zeeland— Fünen—or more properly Fÿen—
							Langeland, Laaland, Falster, Moen, and Bornholm, which is separated far
							from all the others, and which by its position would seem rather to be
							an appendage of Sweden than of Denmark— At the Eastern extremity of
							Bornholm, there is another small island, called Christiansöe <hi
								rend="strikethrough">and joined to it by a Bridge of Boats</hi>
							distant from it about three leagues— In this Kingdom of Denmark, neither
							Norway, Holstein nor Jutland are included— They constitute separate
							Governments under the same Sovereign— This island of Bornholm is one of
							the dangers of the Baltic— It has no harbour— There is however a good
							harbour at Christiansöe, between it and the other island of Friedrichs
							Holm; adjoining to it and connected with it by a bridge of Boats.— There
							are two other still smaller islands in the vicinity Graes Holmen &amp;
							Tar.— We have on board an excellent special Chart of this island,
							published from the Royal Danish Marine Archives in 1805. with a page of
							Directions in the English Language.— We saw several vessels this day;
							and at Night were in the midst of a convoy.</p>

							in the afternoon; the boat came again on board, with the supply of
							provisions which had been desired, and with it came another naval
							Officer, named <persRef ref="u">Smid</persRef>, who we had been told in
							the morning was Commandant at the village of Hassley, abreast of where

							repeated the invitation from the Governor to me to come on shore
							to-morrow, and said the Governor himself had come from Rönne the capital
							of the island, where he resided to Hassley, to meet me there, if I
							should go on shore— Rönne is distant from Hassley one Danish Mile, 15.
							to a degree— At Rönne is a road where large vessels may lay in perfect
							safety at Anchor; and the Officer very obligingly urged us to go and
							anchor there. He had brought with him a pilot for the place— Our Captain
							however having lost one cable and anchor, was afraid of anchoring in an
							open road, and preferr’d standing out and in for the Night as we had
							done all day— He finally concluded however to bear away, before the wind
							for Kiel; with the determination still, if a change of wind should take
							place, or the weather moderate, to come about again and take the last
							chance of a possibility to go up the Baltic this Season. To this I
							consented— We accordingly bore away at 8 this Evening— <persRef ref="poland-nathan"

						<p><date>20. </date>Our wind continued fresh and fair all Night, and all
							this day; but with rain, and fog, and an atmosphere so obscured that we
							could see no land in any direction— About eight this morning we spoke
							again to <persRef ref="richards-benjamin">Captain Richards</persRef>— He
							supposed Dagerort to be distant six leagues, and that we should see it
							within two hours— We sailed all day within speaking distance of each
								other—<persRef ref="fellom-cai">our Pilot’s</persRef> anxiety at
							missing sight both of Gotland and Dago, was extreme; and his impatience
							approached to distraction. Soon after noon however we saw under the lee
							a small Dutch built schooner beating down against the wind; and altered
							our course to speak with her— When she came to a suitable distance, both
							ships hove to; but the Ocean only succeeded in speaking— From Captain
							Richards, the intelligence he had obtained was repeated to us— It was,
							that we should shortly make the Odersholm light, which the schooner had
							seen since noon, on standing out from the land— This agreed very well
							with our Pilot’s reckoning—for he had supposed both by that, and by the
							colour and smoothness of the water, remarkably different from that which
							we had experienced for several days, that we were already entered the
							Gulf of Finland— We now stood on in our course with a fair wind, blowing
							very strong, and within two hours saw the Odersholm light, and after it
							successively in the course of the Evening the Ragerwick and Revel
							lights, each distant from the other about 20 miles. <pb n="27" type="ms"
							/>The Evening was variable; sometimes with a bright moon-shine, and
							promising a continuance of moderate weather, with a favorable breeze—
							According to its variations, the Resolution of our Pilot also changed—
							At one time, he ordered the ship to be put under short sail; intending
							to lay to for the Night before reaching Revel— But finally having seen
							the island of Hargo, and the moon shining out in a more promising
							manner, he called up the <persRef ref="bickford-benjamin"
								>Captain</persRef> from his birth, and made full sail— The place
							which he was afraid of passing in the Night was Revelsten, a reef of
							rocks East of Revel, which forms one of the dangerous passages of the
							gulf— What contributed much to his determination and that of the Captain
							to proceed, was the idea of the other ship’s proceeding while we should
							stop short— He was very desirous of speaking to the other ship, and
							asking what she meant to do— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Louder</persRef>, the Mate who had the watch however would not
							comply with this request— But at the last—Pilot would not go on, untill
							the Captain himself came upon deck. The Captain as well as the Pilot had
							some scruples about passing Revel, and probably concluded to stand on,
							because the Ocean would have stood on without us— I was on deck late
							this Night, and untill 1. in the Morning.</p>

						<p><date>22. </date>We had a light and favourable breeze the whole Night,

							light-house about six miles below Cronstadt; and soon came up with it.—
							At 1. Afternoon we came in to Cronstadt Road, where we found a number of
							Russian Men of War— An Officer came on board from the first of two
							guard-ships stationed there; and sent his boat on board the second
							Guardship for a Pilot to conduct us into the Mole— We also made a signal
							at the foremast head for a Pilot from the shore— But none could be

							board, when it was too late to work the ship into the Mole— The
							Lieutenant from the guard ship offered us however his boat to go on
							shore; which offer I finally though with much reluctance accepted— My
							object was merely to land, and get a lodging for the Night at an Inn;
							but I was apprehensive of some obstruction in landing; though the
							lieutenant gave us the most positive assurances that there would be
							none. At length, I concluded to go—taking nothing with us of our

							barge <pb n="28" type="ms"/>rowing out from the shore, with three
							Officers in it, who spoke to our boatmen, and ordered them, first to
							turn back, and afterwards to follow them— Our interpreter the Pilot
							understood no more Russian than ourselves— So we followed the barge to a

							German, very politely invited me to go with him to the <persRef ref="kolokoltsov-ivan"
								>Admiral Kolokoltzof</persRef>, before whom all strangers arriving

							together; walking nearly a mile to the Admiral’s House— In passing
							through his antichamber we found there a number of Americans waiting for
							examination, and among the rest <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi

							himself soon appeared, but speaks only Russian— When informed who we
							were, he shewed us every possible civility; and immediately sent an
							Officer on board the ship to bring her into the Mole this Night—to which
							however, I knew the Captain would not consent— The Admiral sent
							immediately for <persRef ref="sparrow-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							American Consul at Petersburg, he had engaged chambers for us, at the

							however we declined— The Carriages which they ordered to take us to the
							inn we however accepted. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Sparrow accompanied us
							to the inn; but on arriving there we found that the chambers which he
							had bespoken for us, had this day been taken by Company from Petersburg,
							and there was not a room in the house disengaged— It was now

								Krehmer</persRef> paid me a visit this Morning in company with
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef>. I went with the latter of these Gentlemen to look
							at a house, the accommodations of which however did not please me— We
							met there the <persRef ref="schladen-friedrich">Baron de
								Schladen</persRef> the Prussian Minister, who was in pursuit of the
							same object, and to whom M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris introduced me—
							At four O’Clock <pb n="30" type="ms"/>I went with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Harris and dined at the Chancellor <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>— I had in the
							year 1781. dined at the same house; much in the same style, with the
								<persRef ref="saintgeorge-charles">Marquis de Vérac</persRef>; then
							the french Minister at this Court— This was a diplomatic dinner, in the
							style of the highest Splendour; about forty-five persons at table— The
							French Ambassador, Duc de Vicence, <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">M.
								de Colaincourt</persRef> was the principal personage at table.— The
								<persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Baron de Stedingk</persRef>, who has
							been here many years, as Swedish Minister, and who was one of the
							negotiators of the late Treaty of Peace between Sweden and Russia, was
							also there— <persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Six</persRef>, whom I had formerly met at the <persRef
								ref="araujo-antonio">Chevalier d’Araujo’s</persRef> at the Hague,
							now Minister here, from the <persRef ref="louis-i">King of
								Holland</persRef>— I sat next to the <persRef ref="bray-francois"
								>Chevalier de Bray</persRef>, Minister from the king of Bavaria,
							whom I once saw in the year 1800 at Berlin— The <persRef
								ref="navarro-rodrigo">Chevalier de Navarro</persRef>, Portuguese
							Chargé d’Affaires, I had also known as a Secretary to the <persRef
								ref="danadia-joao">Vicomte d’Anadia</persRef> at Berlin— The rest of
							the Company were Strangers to me— But they are all covered with Stars
							and Ribbons; beyond any thing that I had ever seen— The dinner did not
							last more than two hours— It was magnificent in every particular— The
							Chancellor, shewed me at table, and afterwards many pointed and formal
							civilities— He exhibited two superb large Vases of Seve China, and
							splendid Editions of <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="racine-jean">Racine</persRef>— Presents which he had received
							from the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>;
							bestowed in a very gracious manner, which the Count related, with much
							apparent satisfaction— The house—the Company— The exhibitions—the
							recollection of the Marquis de Vérac and his magnificence which I had
							witness’d on the same Spot, led my mind so forcibly to the mutability of
							human Fortunes, that it shared but little in the gorgeous Scene around
							me— I was also very unwell; being severely under the operation of the
							Neva waters, which affect all foreigners on their first arrival— We
							returned home, about 7. in the Evening— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris
							pass’d the Evening, with our family— But I was obliged to leave them and
							retire immediately to bed— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> is also extremely unwell
							from the same cause— Our child <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, is scarcely less affected in the same manner—
							None of us have been entirely exempt from this indisposition— We heard
							this day that the Peace, between France and Austria was concluded; and
							that Te Deum was to be sung to-morrow in the French Ambassador’s chapel,
							on this occasion.</p>

							I have been so unwell that I could neither write nor read much— Nor have
							we got through the irksome tumult of a first arrival— The <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Chancellor</persRef> yesterday told me that
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> was still
							confined—which would yet delay my reception for some days— But he
							repeated that the mission was agreeable to him— And he said he had been
							much gratified with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Daschkoff’s dispatches,
							which I had called and left the day before yesterday at his house—
								<persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef>, he said was highly pleased, as well with his
							reception by the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef>, as

							inhabitants of Philadelphia, and of the other places where he had
							been.</p>

							Commerce; the second volume of which has accidentally fallen into my
