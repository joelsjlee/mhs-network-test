							That he had left M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hunt’s house in Anger,

						<p><date>4. </date><persRef key="adams-john">My father</persRef> arrived in

								<persRef ref="gore-christopher">Governor</persRef> and Council, with
							the Selectmen of the Town, and a numerous company, went to the Old South

							gave me several letters, one of which was from the <persRef

							by the Governor and Council returned to the State-house, and partook of

									>r:</hi> Lovell</persRef>, who told me that he and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hunt</persRef> were
							perfectly satisfied that the suspicions he had mentioned respecting
								<persRef ref="nelson">Nelson</persRef>, were all groundless— The

							and walked with <persRef ref="blake-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> G. Blake</persRef>— The procession, with various
							emblems of Agriculture, Commerce and Manufactures, and consisting of
							about five hundred persons, including three militia-companies went
							through the town, over Charles river Bridge, to Bunker’s Hill, where a
							dinner was prepared under an arbour, covered with a tent and four rows
							of tables for the Company.— <persRef ref="u">Deacon Tilden</persRef> was
							the President. <persRef ref="white-wc">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								W. C. White</persRef> who at 9 in the morning had delivered an

							occasions— <persRef ref="austin-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Jon<hi rend="superscript">n:</hi> L. Austin</persRef>
							came and told me that he had <persRef ref="austin-james">a

							Bunker-Hill, with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Blake, and <hi
								rend="strikethrough">we</hi> went with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Blake to pay a visit to the young Republicans assembled at
							the Exchange-Hotel; to make which visit I had received a special

							Mall, I met <persRef ref="gardner-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								John Gardner</persRef>, and walked sometime with him— I asked him
							why I had not seen him for so many days, and he told me that he had been
							unwell, and out of town. We walked some time together, and witness’d the
							fire-works, which were exhibited on the Common— About ten at Night I
							returned home, and found that my father was gone, on his return to
							Quincy, and that <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

							principally from the gun-house, and the rockets sent up, came down in
							blazing paper and burning sticks upon the house itself and several of
							the neighbouring houses and yards, including mine—in a manner which I
							thought dangerous— No accident of fire however ensued. I found at home a
							letter from <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>5. </date>This morning early <persRef ref="howard-john2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> John C. Howard</persRef> called at my
							house, and told me that he came to talk with me about our old friend
								<persRef ref="gardner-john">John Gardner</persRef>; he asked me if I
							was acquainted with his condition— I said I had very lately been
							informed that his misfortunes had depress’d him to that degree, that he
							had unfortunately fallen into a habit of intemperance, and that still
							more recently I had perceived symptoms of it in reality; at which I was
							excessively concerned and shocked— He said that his character was so
							totally broken down and degraded that he could not appear in the Streets
							in open day, and that <hi rend="italic">he dared not meet the eyes of
								his friends</hi>. That nothing could save him from destruction, but
							going abroad somewhere; and under these Circumstances the D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> asked me if I could not take him with me
							as my Secretary— I answered that my affection for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner would induce me to do any thing
							for him in my power consistent with my duties to others— But that the
							very Circumstances stated by D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Howard
							himself must operate as a total prohibition to me to take him with me—
							That if I should with open eyes, voluntarily connect with an important
							public trust, a man in such a situation, I should be as unable
							afterwards to meet the eyes of my friends, as he of his— That if any
							manner of redeeming him from his condition could be devised, to which I
							could contribute my aid, it should cheerfully be given— But to take him
							to a foreign Country, in a situation where the interest and character of
							our own might <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
							<pb n="410" type="ms"/>in some sort be staked upon his conduct, was
							utterly impossible— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Howard admitted the
							force of the principle, but seemed not altogether satisfied as to the
							effect— Soon after breakfast young <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Aspinwall</persRef> called upon me,
							and proposed himself to me for the same office as my Secretary. I gave
							him the same answer as to the others since I received <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">William S. Smith’s</persRef> letter
								(D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Howard excepted.) I answered the
								<persRef ref="smith-robert">Secretary of State’s</persRef> letter
							enclosing the commission, and accepted the office. It is with a deep
							sense of the stormy and dangerous career upon which I enter; of the
							heavy responsibility that will press upon it, and of the unpromising
							prospect which it presents in perspective. My personal motives for
							staying at home are of the strongest kind;—the age of my Parents, and
							the infancy of my children both urge to the same result— My connection
							with the College, is another strong tie which I break with great
							reluctance; and by refusing the Office I should promote my personal
							popularity more than by accepting it— In my own opinion also, I could do
							more public service here in a private Station, than abroad upon this
							mission— To oppose all this, I have the duty of a Citizen to obey the
							call of his Country, signified by the regular Constitutional authority;
							the Satisfaction of being removed at least for a time, and with honour
							from a situation, where the deepest retirement has not sheltered me from
							the most virulent and unrelenting Persecution, and the vague <hi
								rend="italic">hope</hi> of rendering to my Country some important
							service, as intended by the mission—finally the desire to justify the
							confidence reposed by <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison</persRef> in me, by assuming
							the Station which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has chosen to assign to me,
							and by devoting all my powers to the support of his administration, so
							far as it shall aim, as I am perfectly convinced it does and will aim,
							at the welfare of this whole Union— These are my motives— And I implore
							the blessing of Almighty God, upon this my undertaking— That all its
							critical moments may find me in possession of myself—in possession of
							the virtues, which contribute all that human power can contribute to
							success—and prepared alike for whatever Event his Providence destines
							for its termination— Finally with the profoundest sense of Gratitude,
							for that goodness, which has so far rescued from its perils my beloved
							Country, and from perils not less menacing my own person and reputation,
							with the people of America, I humbly ask for perfecting goodness; for
							the entire extrication of my Country from her difficulties and dangers,
							and for myself the continued consciousness of purity in my motives, and
							so far as it has been or may be deserved, the approbation of my
							Countrymen.</p>
						<p>I answered my young friend <persRef ref="everett-alexander"
								>Everett</persRef>, like the rest—that the appointment of my
							Secretary had been engaged from the time I had received W. S. Smith’s
							letter, which was the first application— He was extremely disappointed,
							but acquiesced in the determination— In the course of the day I received
							a letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. Gardner, proposing to
							me, <hi rend="italic">at the suggestion of a friend</hi> this morning to
							go with me, and desiring to converse with me on the subject— In the
							Evening I attended club at <persRef ref="eliot-john2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Eliot’s</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Quincy</persRef> was there, just returned from Congress— I spoke
							again to D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Howard, as we were returning
							home this Evening, about M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner— I told
							him, that independent of the objection I had mentioned to him this
							morning, there was another, that I had previously engaged the place—
							That this would be my answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner
							himself, as it was a difficulty equally insuperable with the other.</p>

							named <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor</persRef>, as being
							extremely well qualified for the place, and desirous of going— But he
							said he was aware the same answer must apply to him— I was a short time
							this day at the District Court.— <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge
								Davis</persRef> spoke to me about <persRef ref="dexter-andrew"
								>Dexter’s</persRef> argument on the unconstitutionality of the
							Embargo Laws; about which he said he had this day given an explanation—
							I received this day a letter from <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi

								Smith</persRef> of Baltimore, urging me to take his son <persRef
								ref="smith-john2">John</persRef> with me as my Secretary; but he to
							be entirely at his own expence of living &amp;c— In the Evening walking
							in the Mall I saw a man walking up the gravel-walk, apparently in much
							agitation, talking aloud to himself, with considerable gesticulation—
							After walking some time in a line parallel to him I perceived it was
								<persRef ref="gardner-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gardner</persRef>— I accosted him, and from that moment he appeared
							altogether rational and walked with me perhaps an hour or more. I left
							him about 10 O’Clock. On going home I found M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> A. H. Everett at my house; he stay’d and supp’d with us;
							and untill midnight— <persRef ref="foster-william">M<hi

								Whitcomb</persRef>— That M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gardner
							lodged there— That he was occasionally raving, when alone; and
