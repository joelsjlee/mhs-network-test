								London King Pitt</persRef>— The prayers were read strictly according
							to the Book of Common Prayer, including the prayers for <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king George</persRef>, and that he might be
							victorious over all his enemies— Which considering that He and Russia
							are now at War; appears to be not a little presuming on the indulgence
							of this Government— In the prayers however for the king, and royal
							family of England, the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> and
							Imperial Family were added, for participation of the blessings invoked—
							There was a long occasional prayer introduced, which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Pitt read from a written paper, and which seemed to be of
							his own composition— It deprecated the bitter cup of the present times,
							and prayed for an union of Counsels between Britain and Russia— The
							Sermon; from Jeremiah VI.16. was on the propensity of mankind to change—
							A common place topic, handled in a common place manner— After Church I
							walked over to the Wasily-Ostrof, and measured by pacing the building
							belonging to the Imperial Academy of Sciences— It is 164 paces in front
							and 145 deep—that is 450 by 382 feet— My paces are of 33 inches— On
							coming home I found <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							He has cultivated a taste for the fine Arts, and possesses one of the
							choicest collections of pictures in Europe— This was his jour de fête,

							shewed us himself many of his finest pictures, and other master-pieces
							of art, among which was a costly vase of Malachite a production of
							Copper Mines, which he says is found only in Siberia— The Duke de Serra
							Capriola was many years Minister from the king of the two Sicilies at

							<persRef ref="vyazemskaya-elena">Princess Waezemsky</persRef>; but since the

								Harris</persRef> who considers it as unbecoming to go into a Russian
							Merchants house, dissuaded us from attending the funeral, and told me
							that as to the dinner, it was not usually expected that the persons
							invited should attend it—as two or three hundred persons were invited,
							and preparations made only for thirty or forty— Not partaking of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris’s aversion to Russian Merchants, and
							intending to return the civility of attendance for the civility of
							invitation, I concluded to attend the funeral, but to decline the
							dinner; which I now regret, as it appears there was ample preparation
							made for all the Company invited, and as I perceived that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Glukoff the son was hurt at my declining the
							invitation to dinner which he personally repeated to me at the
							Monastery— At 9 in the Morning we went to the house, and were introduced
							to a large hall, which was darkened, and hung entirely round with black
							cloth— Here the corpse of the deceased was laying in State, on a bed in
							a large Coffin, the upper lid of which was in the form of a box-cover,
							and was fixed over the lower, or cradle part when the procession moved.
							At the top and bottom and on the two sides of the Coffin were large
							Candlesticks four or five feet high, covered with black crape, and
							having in them wax-tapers of a proportionable size— About two feet
							distant at the foot of the Coffin stood a Pope or Priest, with a stand
							before him on which was a book, chanting in a very low, solemn and
							plaintive tone in the Russian Language, something which I could not
							understand— On one side of the Hall, sat a row of perhaps twenty women
							in mourning attire— On the other, were seated several Priests,
							apparently by their dress of higher rank than the officiating Pope; two
							of whom wore the decoration of the red ribbon— There were also several
							empty chairs, in one of which I seated myself by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Glukoff’s invitation— The Hall was nearly full of other company
							standing— The Priest continued his low chant, nearly half an hour— Then
							appeared the <persRef ref="podobedov-amvrosy">Metropolitan</persRef>,
							who took his stand at the same spot, and delivered to each of the other
							Priests a lighted taper to hold, and each of them kiss’d his hand on
							receiving it from him— They then ranged themselves round the Coffin;
							lighted tapers were given to every person in company, and the
							Metropolitan made what I took to be a short prayer— This concluded the
							Ceremonies at the house— The upper cover was then fixed over the Coffin,
							after the sons and daughters had gone up, and kiss’d the cheek of the
							deceased, and the domestics his hand—the Coffin was carried out; all the
							Priests followed, and the Company afterwards— The Corpse was followed by
							the men of the family, and some of the Priests with lighted tapers, on
							foot— The rest followed in Carriages, and the procession went from the
							Wasily Ostrof, across the bridge, and through the great perspective to
							the Monastery of <persRef ref="nevsky-alexander">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Alexander Nefsky</persRef>— Here in the small chapel near the
							entrance, we found the corpse again laid in state, and a ceremony
							commenced which lasted nearly two hours— The Metropolitan, all the
							Priests, and a choir of singers officiated at this, which I presume was
							the celebration of a solemn Mass.— At the close of this a Carpet was
							laid, and two benches with Cushions <pb n="54" type="ms"/>placed on it,
							back of the head of the Coffin— The Metropolitan, and another of the
							titled Priests came and sat down on the benches— The other Priests
							ranged themselves in rows at the sides of the Coffin— The Metropolitan
							again distributed lighted tapers to each of them, and they kiss’d his
							hand; lighted tapers were also given to every person attending, and
							after some further singing a Paper was given to the Metropolitan which
							he read, and which was then put into the Coffin with the corpse— It is
							said to be a recommendation of the deceased to the keeper of Heaven’s
							Gates— A Passport to be presented to <persRef ref="peter">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Peter</persRef>— A few drops of some liquor,
							perhaps consecrated oil, were also poured into the Coffin— The relations
							and dependents again went up and kiss’d the cheek or the hand of the

							all the company— The dresses of the Priests were different, I suppose

							the national Russian dress— His sons and their families dress in the
							common European costume.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Anderson</persRef>, an Englishman, with

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Raimbert— At 7. in the Evening I came home, and
							went to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>— I
							found <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron de Blome</persRef> the Danish
							Minister with him— He left the Count’s Cabinet, as I went into it— I
							told the Count that I came at the request of a number of my Countrymen,
							whose property had been arrested in a very extraordinary manner, by an
							order of the Danish Government in the Ports of Holstein— That as to the
							dispositions of the <persRef ref="frederick-vi">king of
								Denmark</persRef> with regard to English merchandize or property,
							that was no concern of mine; but that a great amount of property
							unquestionably neutral; direct from America, and after having pass’d
							through every examination required by the Laws of Denmark had now been
							arrested under this order— That purchases to a large amount of the
							productions of this Country, had been made here and at Riga, on the
							credit of this property, and the regular payment of which depended upon
							its speedy liberation— That as the subject therefore in some sort became
							interesting to the Government of this Empire, I had requested this
							interview with him to state the Circumstances to him, and to ask,
							whether the interposition of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> good offices, with the Danish Government, might
							not be used, in any manner, whether officially or otherwise in such
							manner, as to levy this sequester upon American property as speedily <pb
								n="56" type="ms"/>as possible— That being aware it was a subject
							upon which in my character as accredited to this Court, I could make no
							formal application, I had not thought proper to address to him an
							official note concerning it— But relying upon the Emperor’s good-will
							towards my Country which he had often manifested, and on the Count’s own
							dispositions, which were equally friendly I had flattered myself that by
							the exertion of his Imperial Majesty’s influence with the Danish
							Government, something might be done to obtain the release of this
							American property and to relieve my Countrymen the owners of it from
							their distress— He said that in regard to the Emperor’s dispositions
							towards the United States, and as far as he could speak of his own,
							though infinitely distant from his Imperial Majesty, by his place, they
							were as friendly as I could believe them to be; and that he personally
							lamented greatly the distress under which Commerce in general, and with
							it that of the United States was labouring— That nothing short of a
							general Peace, could probably put an end to these embarrassments, and
							that this general Peace, depended upon England alone— That he knew not
							why this general Peace should not be made— That nothing would be asked
							of England—but on the contrary that she would be left in possession of
							what she had acquired— That untill she could be reduced to reasonable
							terms of Peace, it was impossible that Commerce should be free from
							rigorous restrictions, because it was by operating upon her Commerce,
							that she must be made to feel her interest in making Peace— That as to
							this particular measure of Denmark, it was far from being agreeable to
							him; and he intimated that it was the subject upon which he had just
							been conversing with the Baron de Blome— That he knew, by dispatches
							from <persRef ref="lizakevich-vasily">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Lizakewitz</persRef> the Russian Minister at Copenhagen, that the
							measure had given great dissatisfaction to the Danes themselves— That
							there was no occasion to disguise the fact; it was not a voluntary act
							on the part of the Danish Government—it had been exacted by France,
							whose force at their gates, was such as Denmark had no means of
							resisting; and who considered it as a measure merely of severity against
							English commerce— That France had suspected Denmark of conniving at the
							commerce with England: at least he knew that <persRef
								ref="champagny-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Champagny</persRef>,
							had reproached them with it in very severe terms— And that in fact, the
							whole or nearly the whole of that trade, must substantially be viewed as
							English commerce, since there were now none but English Colonies which
							produced the articles which went under the denomination of Colonial
							merchandize— I assured him, that with the exception perhaps of Coffee,
							all the articles of colonial trade were produced within the United
							States— And that with respect to Coffee, as well as the rest there were
							all the Spanish islands which produced them in great quantities, besides
							the English possessions— But, said he, is not the produce of the United
							States in these Articles, of inferior quality— Cotton, for instance— I
							told him the United States produced the best of Cotton, and in immense
							quantities— That in all the Southern States, as well as in Louisiana the
							cultivation of this article within the last twenty years had flourished
							beyond imagination, and that of all the Cotton brought by those American
							vessels, whose Cargoes had been thus arrested in Holstein, I was
							persuaded the nine tenths at least was the genuine produce of the United
							States themselves— That considerable quantities of sugar were also
							produced in Louisiana, and in Georgia; which doubtless constituted a
							great proportion of those Cargoes, and that the rest was probably the
							produce of the Spanish islands— Certainly very little if any came from
							the British Colonies— As to the Spanish Islands, he said they could now
							not easily be distinguished from the British, as they had declared
							themselves for the party of the Junta, <pb n="57" type="ms"/>which in a
							very extraordinary manner had formally declared War against Denmark— I
							remarked that if in consequence of this Declaration of War, the Danish
							Government thought proper to prohibit the importation for the future of
							articles, the produce of the Spanish Colonies it was a measure of
							expediency which they were free to take, but that it could never warrant
							the seizure of goods already imported under the sanction of the Danish
							laws; which had pass’d through every examination required by them, and
							had received the pledge of protection due from the government of every
							civilized nation to private property— That if this was a <hi
								rend="italic">French</hi> measure, of which the Government of
							Denmark was only the passive instrument, I trusted that the influence of
							a Sovereign so powerful, as the Emperor of Russia, and in relations of
							friendship so close with France, would not be exerted without effect at
							Paris, and it would be immaterial to us where the means should be used,
							if they produced the result of doing Justice to us, and restoring to my
							countrymen their property— The conduct of England towards my Country had
							been such as certainly not to inspire me with any partiality in her
							favour, and I believed the principle of what was called the continental
							system, which was to bring England to dispositions for Peace, by
							distressing her Commerce a very good one; but I was surprized that it
							was not at this day perceived that measures which destroyed the commerce
							of all other Nations, instead of reducing, turned altogether to the
							profit of that of England— That the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Emperor Napoleon’s</persRef> experiment had now been three years in
							operation; and that in the midst of the most wasteful expences, the
							grossest internal mismanagement, the most unfortunate expeditions, and
							in short every thing that could exasperate the People of England against
							their own Government, and raise the clamour for Peace; no such clamour
							was heard; and the commerce of the Country, far from being diminished,
							was flourishing beyond all example— As a proof of which I referred him
							to the address from the Corporation of London, to the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king</persRef>, on the late Jubilee, and to the
							king’s answer— The Count laughed, and said that as to addresses to
							kings, and their answers, he believed the best rule was to take all such
							boastings in an inverted sense—for, said he, you know when a father of a
							family, and his family are talking together before the world, they
							naturally will not speak of their distresses— I replied that in such a
							case as this, I believed the conclusion would be more consistent with
							the fact, by taking the words in their plain and direct sense— That the
							flourishing or distress’d state of commerce was a state of things too
							notorious by its simplicity, too certain by the practice of reducing it
							all to precise figures by official returns, to admit of direct
							falsehoods thus asserted in the face of the world— That London was a
							city almost entirely commercial—that the numerous classes of people
							subsisting upon commerce, were not accustomed to boast of profit, while
							they were actually suffering distress; nor even of suffering without
							loud complaint— That if at this time any other king in Europe was to
							receive an address from the principal traders of his kingdom, they would
							not boast of the flourishing State of their Commerce; nor would the
							Corporation of London have dared to do so, if the fact had been
							strikingly the reverse— It was not however upon this address alone that
							I relied as evidence of the fact— Other indications of the same kind,
							were numerous and decisive— How indeed could it be otherwise?— The
							active commerce of all other Nations, thanks to France, was annihilated—
							France herself, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, <pb n="58" type="ms"/>had
							nothing that could bear the name of Commerce left, in their own ships—
							The United States had scarcely any— Their intercourse with almost all
							Europe was suspended— Here alone they were still freely admitted, and
							into those Ports of Holstein, where this violent measure must now break
							it up again to the foundation— That the portion of commerce carried on
							by American vessels in the Russian Ports was small— The number of the
							vessels was ascertained, and His Excellency as Minister of Commerce,
							knew to what it could amount. He also knew how much of the trade was
							transacted in Russian vessels; and yet, it was not for me to tell him
							that between England and this Country, the commerce actually carried on
							was little less than in time of Peace— That all articles of English
							growth and manufacture were to be had here, as if the intercourse was
							unobstructed, and that every article of Russian produce for which
							England has occasion goes as plentifully to England as ever— He said the
							price of these articles in England had recently risen—from which, I told
							him a further proof of my position might be derived; for that the rise
							of prices in England had followed as a consequence upon the rise of
							prices here, which had been very considerable— The inference from this
							last fact was irresistible: for if the trade with England was actually
							suspended the prices of Russian produce here must have fallen from the
							accumulation which would have been unavoidable— The Commerce therefore
							was carried on— And by whom?— it was not to be disguised, principally by
							the English; who by means, which I should not undertake to account for,
							did contrive to evade every ordinance and regulation, and the more
							surely evaded them in proportion as they were more severe— That I had
							personally had an opportunity to observe this on my voyage hither— For
							in the Danish dominions the trade with England was forbidden upon pain
							of Death; and yet on going into a port of Norway, I had seen vessels
							which pass’d through the British Squadrons as in time of profound Peace,
							and was informed from unquestionable authority that there were then
							seven ships, notoriously English, in the port of Bergen, loading with
							timber for England, upon English account. He said that he agreed with me
							in the reasoning, but not in the conclusion— That all Commerce was to be
							considered as a benefit to both parties— That he had no faith in the
							doctrine of balances of trade, or that any commerce could long exist,
							unless it was profitable on both sides— That if Commerce therefore
							suffered, as in the present State of Europe there could be no doubt it
							did, the greatest commercial nation in the end, must suffer the most—
							That although this crisis had already continued longer than was to be
							wished yet it could not be considered as a time sufficient for effecting
							the intended result— That it would be better that the whole commerce of
							the World, should cease to exist for ten years than to abandon it
							forever to the controul of England; that the effect of the restrictive
							system would eventually press hardest upon England; and that <persRef
								ref="pitt-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pitt</persRef>, whose
							Talents as a Minister must be acknowledged to have been great, was
							compelled by the clamours of the English Nation, arising from the
							distress upon their Commerce to make Peace— That, I admitted was true;
							but was imputable to a system of measures in relation to commerce
							directly opposite to the present— A system, which encouraged and
							favoured the trade of the Nations which were the rivals of England, so
							that the English could not support a competition with them— And although
							the English Commerce, might partially suffer in the general mass with
							the rest, it was much more than indemnified by the part which it had
							acquired, <pb n="59" type="ms"/>from the ruins of all the other
							commercial Nations— The Count asked me if I had read a late publication
							of <persRef ref="divernois-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								d’Ivernois</persRef> on this subject— I had heard of the Book, but
							not seen it— He said its representations corresponded much with the
							ideas I had expressed; but that he had only taken the State of Ireland,
							to prove his position— This was not very conclusive; for the commerce of
							Ireland formed a very small part of that of the United Kingdom; and the
							great stress laid upon the alledged prosperity of this particular branch
							of the trade, raised a strong presumption that the actual state of the
							whole was distress’d— He concluded by saying that on the subject of my
							request he would take the orders of the Emperor, and inform me of the
							result, but that as this was a measure emanating from the personal
							disposition of the Emperor of France, he was apprehensive there existed
							no influence in the world of sufficient efficacy to shake his
							determination— The general impression upon my mind was that the Count
							himself was fully persuaded of the truth of my representations, and that
							he really disapproved of these measures; but that Russia would not
							interfere in the case— He told me that immediately after the return of
							the Emperor, <persRef ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Count
								Pahlen’s</persRef> Secretary would be dispatched to Paris, with his
							final instructions, and orders that he should immediately proceed to
							America— He supposed he would have no difficulty in finding an
							opportunity to go—of which however, in the present State of our
							Commerce, I intimated some doubts— He said he would send me word, before
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ivanoff</persRef> should
							go, that if we pleased we might take the opportunity to write by him— I
							left the Count about 9. in the Evening, and pass’d the remainder of it
							at home— <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Galloway</persRef> was
							here to see <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef>,
							who is very unwell, and confined to her chamber.</p>

								>We</persRef> had all invitations from the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef>, to the
							Ice-hills, at his Country-Seat, at the Kammenoi-Ostrow— The Company were
							to meet at noon, and pass the day and Evening there— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Adams</persRef> and Catherine being unwell, could not go— Just as I
							was on the point of setting out, I received a note from <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, requesting me to
							call upon him at 2. O’Clock, I was therefore obliged to postpone my ride
							to the Ice-hills, untill three. <pb n="60" type="ms"/>At two O’Clock I
							called upon Count Romanzoff, who told me, that yesterday, being the
							first day since the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							return, that he had transacted business with him, he had reported to his
							Majesty, my application to him, requesting the interposition of his good
							offices, with the Danish Government, for the restoration as speedily as
							possible of the property of Americans sequestered in the Ports of
							Holstein— That he had informed His Majesty of the answer, which in his
							official character he had thought it his duty to give me, and to lead me
							to expect; leaving the decision free to him, conformably to his own
							inclinations— That the Emperor had judged differently upon the subject
							from him— He had ordered him immediately to represent to the Danish
							Government his wish that the examination might be expedited and the
							American property restored as soon as possible; which order he had
							already executed— He had sent this morning for the <persRef
								ref="vonblome-otto">Baron de Blome</persRef>, and had requested him
							to transmit to his Court these sentiments of the Emperor, with the
							assurance that His Majesty took great interest in obtaining a compliance
							with them— That the Emperor was gratified at this opportunity of proving
							his friendly dispositions towards the United States; perhaps the
							interest of his own subjects might justify his interference on the
							occasion; this was what he had not thought it necessary to examine; it
							was sufficient for him that it would manifest his regard for the
							interests of the United States— I assured the Count that I should inform
							my Government of this fresh instance of the Emperor’s benevolence, and
							that I could answer before hand for the grateful acknowledgments which
							it would produce.— That I was the more agreeably surprized at this
							determination, as from the last conversation I had had with his
							Excellency, I had been apprehensive of a different result— That on
							leaving him before, I had felt obliged to him for the frank and candid
							manner in which he had spoken in relation to the object of my
							application, which I preferred infinitely to a more flattering manner,
							which might have led to hopes that would be disappointed— But that
							having entertained little or no hopes of success, from his manner of
							considering the subject, at that time, I was now the more delighted at
							finding that my countrymen would have the benefit of his Majesty’s
							powerful intercession— The Count said that he wished by this course of
							proceeding to deserve my Confidence— I observed to him, that for this
							purpose it was unnecessary, as my confidence in his Dispositions was
							already as strong as possible— He desired me to mention to Baron Blome,
							when I should have the opportunity to see him, that he had told me this
							determination of the Emperor, and of the Count’s interview with him
							respecting it— He said that Baron Blome, had repeated to him, what he
							had said to me, that it was a measure to which Denmark had been impelled
							by France, and which she had taken with reluctance— I enquired how the
							Emperor found his health since his tour to Moscow— He said well—and that
							he had been delighted with the marks of attachment which he had received
							from the People there— That he would probably repeat his visits there
							occasionally; for he had said to him yesterday it was an excellent idea,
							he had had of establishing his Sister <persRef ref="catherinepavlovna"
								>Catherine</persRef> at Twer; for when I have a mind to go to
							Moscow, I have only to take her in my pocket, and can go there without
							any of the expense and parade of an Imperial Journey; as might be
							necessary said the Count, for a journey with the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef>, or <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress mother</persRef>— He said the Emperor
							had charmed the People of Moscow, by riding in an open sleigh, according
							to the custom of the Country; and by going round and observing all the
							quarters of the City which he knew as if he had been bred <pb n="61"
								type="ms"/>there—and that the People had received him with more
							proofs of joy, and attachment to his person than they had given at his
							coronation— I left the Count after an interview of about half an hour,
							and then went with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith to the French
							Ambassador’s Ice-Hills at Kammenoi-ostrow— We got there about half an
							hour before dinner; just in time to see a little of the sliding down the
							hills, and taking part in the amusement— There was a company of about
							fifty persons, the Ambassador’s usual company— Most of them specially
							equip’d for the purpose— The men with fur-lined Spencer’s and caps,
							pantaloons over boots, fur-caps, and thick leather mittens— The ladies
							with fur lined riding-habits— About 4. O’Clock, dinner was served, and
							lasted about an hour— In the Evening the ice-hills were lighted with
							lamps and torches, and some of the company went out again; but did not
							stay long— The cold which had been all day very severe, towards Evening
							increased to 15 degrees below <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef> 0. it moderated however
							before midnight— In the house cards, dice, and dancing employed those
							who delight in such Sports— I came home with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Smith before 9 at Night, to spare the Servants the severity of the
							weather— <persRef ref="nelson">Nelson</persRef> however got his toes
							frozen— I saw Baron Blome at the Ice-hills, and had a long conversation
							with him on the detention of the American property, in Holstein— He told
							me again that it was a measure to which they had been goaded by France—
							That it was more injurious to themselves than to us—that this little
							trade in American vessels, which had given them an opportunity of laying
							a transit duty, was the only source of revenue left them— But that in
							Hamburg they had been jealous of it, and had written to Paris that the
							Danes were carrying on a contraband trade with the English— Upon this
							France had loaded them with bitter reproaches, which were altogether
							unmerited— For Denmark had excluded more rigorously the English trade
							than any body— Excepting the outskirts of the kingdom in Norway, over
							which it was impossible for the government to have an effectual
							controul; the exclusion of English trade, had been complete— Denmark had
							sacrificed herself for the common Cause, and instead of acknowledgment,
							this was the return she received— I took this opportunity to repeat to
							Baron Blome the ideas which I had suggested the other day to Count
							Romanzoff, respecting the Continental system, and the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon’s</persRef> idea of
							carrying it into effect— I told him that it was impossible for a human
							heart to feel a stronger abhorrence, than I had of the proceedings of
							the British Government towards Denmark— That I knew and felt for the
							situation of Denmark— That in point of principle, and of real interests,
							those of Denmark and of the United States were precisely the same— That
							I hoped the day would soon come, when they might freely pursue those
							interests, without reproach from any quarter— That if the present course
							of measures was merely personal to the Emperor Napoleon, he must soon
							perceive, as blindness itself could not but now perceive, that Britain
							was profiting by the commercial losses of all his friends— That his
							measures had now been three years in operation— That all other commerce
							was ruined; while in England it was more prosperous than ever— That the
							duties on imports had exceeded nearly by two millions those of any
							preceding year— That no clamours, no Petitions for Peace, were heard of
							among the English People— That if on the field of Battle, the Emperor
							Napoleon, should see his army on the brink of destruction, and <pb
								n="62" type="ms"/>his enemy almost in possession of the victory, by
							an error which it was still in his power to repair, and to secure the
							day, he was too good a general to sacrifice himself and his troops, to a
							proud perseverance in mistaken measures— That as a Statesman, to persist
							obstinately, or from the petty vanity of never acknowledging error, in a
							course, which in its effects was altogether advantageous to his enemy,
							and to resist the evidence of demonstration itself, argued a weakness of
							character, which I hoped he would dread more than to retract a false
							step— That in the estimation of effects, he as well as others must
							calculate the extent of human power, and that with such a surface as the
							Continent of Europe, under the stimulous of mutual superfluities and
							wants, commerce could not be destroyed— That in the condition of Spain,
							the very idea of excluding British Commerce from the Continent, by <hi
								rend="italic">prohibitions</hi>, was like an attempt to exclude the
							air from a bottle, by sealing up hermetically the mouth, while there was
							a great hole in the side— The Baron expressed himself perfectly
							convinced of the accuracy of these remarks, and wished that the Emperor
							of France, might soon open his eyes to conviction— He appeared to take
							in good part what I said, and promised to transmit to his government the
							claim of <persRef ref="williams-cumberland">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Williams</persRef>, which I mentioned to him—though he said they
							considered all vessels under British convoy as fair prize—</p>
