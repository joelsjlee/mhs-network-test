							Midnight however a light breeze again sprung up, about South-East—still
							nearly a-head to us.— The vessel we had just discovered last Evening,

							Confession— He repeatedly expresses at least a doubt whether the
							Institution does not produce more evil than good in the Church, and a
							Protestant might turn the whole of the Bishop’s Artillery against the

						<p><date>17. </date>The breeze and squalls continued all Night, driving us 8

							expectation of making the land of Norway before Night— We had not seen a
							vessel since passing by Fair Island untill about 5. O’Clock this

							hour’s time she came within hailing distance, before which she fired a
							gun to lee-ward, upon which we hoisted our colours— She did not shew
							hers; but came to Windward of us; then fired a gun to windward and
							hailed us— Whence from?— From Boston— Whither bound?— To Russia— Let
							down your <pb n="11" type="ms"/>boat and come on board— Which not being
							heard distinctly, was repeated— The Captain answered that his boat was
							so small that it would not be safe to go out with it, in this weather—
							The same order was again repeated, and a musket with ball fired ranging
							along-side of our ship— It was the dusk of the Evening; the wind blowing

							however let down the boat, and went into it, with <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							from the ship, and attempted to row to the brig, but drifted so in the
							course of ten minutes, that instead of getting to the brig it was with
							the utmost difficulty that they reached the ship again, having the boat
							half full of water, and all the time in the most imminent danger both of
							over-setting, and of being sunk by an overwhelming wave— The Captain
							then hailed the brig again, and told them that his boat would not live
							in such a Sea and weather, upon which without making any answer, the
							brig shot a-head of us to such a distance, that on the moon’s setting,
							she was out of sight— Then after laying to untill about 11. at Night,

						<p><date>19. </date>We had a calm and quiet Night, and this morning about 6.
							the <persRef ref="bickford-benjamin">Captain</persRef> called me, and
							told me there was a cruizer close on board of us— I rose immediately,
							and within a quarter of an hour, a brig with English colours lay
							along-side of us— Without speaking she sent a boat with an Officer, and
							four men to us— The Officer came on board, and after examining the
							Captain’s papers, left us, saying I suppose you may proceed— He told me
							it was fortunate we had not met him last Night; for he might have fired
							into us; having been yesterday all day in pursuit of two Danish men of
							War, which they chaced into Christiansand— This was a brig of eighteen
							guns— He gave the Captain some news—as that the French had defeated the
							Austrians in a battle, and there was now an armistice between them— That
							the English in Portugal had also been defeated, and Lord Wellesley
							obliged to make good his retreat— About 7. in the morning we parted from
							this vessel, and within two hours came in sight of another brig under
							Danish Colours— She soon fired a gun to bring us to: upon which we
							waited for her about half an hour— She then passed close under our
							stern, hailed us and enquired from whence we came and where we were
							bound—on receiving the answer, she hauled down her Danish Colours,
							hoisted the English flag, and sent an Officer on board of us, with four
							men— It seems they had not heard distinctly our answers to their
							hailing; for on being told that we were from Boston, bound to
							Petersburg, the Officer told his men, to go on board their own vessel;
							and tell the Captain we were from Boston bound to Petersburg— He
							remained himself on board, and examined the Captain’s papers, telling
							him that as we were going to Elseneur, and they were at War with Denmark
							he did not <pb n="12" type="ms"/>know whether we could proceed or not.
							The boat however soon returned with the men, and the Officer then left
							us— The name of the first brig from which we were boarded was the Rover,
								<persRef ref="mcvicar-alex">Captain M’Vicar</persRef>, the name of
							the second our Captain enquired of the Officer but does not recollect
							his answer.— The weather all the morning had looked threatening, and the
							wind directly a-head— The equinoctial being close at hand, our Captain
							concluded to go into a harbour on the Coast of Norway, which was full in
							view. So we stood in for the land, and made a signal for a Pilot— A boat
							very soon came up to us with a pilot, belonging to Ronge sound, about 2
							leagues above Christiansand— While the Captain was consulting him
							whether to go in there or into Christiansand,—a small two-mast boat,
							with about fifteen armed men, and a swivel, under danish Colours, came
							and fired a gun to bring us to— A Danish Lieutenant of the Marine, by
							the name of <persRef ref="u">Kraff</persRef> then came on board from
							her, and told the Captain he must go in to Christiansand— The Captain at
							this took the alarm, declared he would not go into harbour at-all, and
							put the ship about to stand out to sea— The Lieutenant made a signal to
							the men in his boat laying along side of us to come on board, which the
							Captain ordered our crew to resist— We had in half a minute a dozen or
							fifteen men with pikes, axes and swords on the quarter deck, and the men
							from the boat pressing forward to her forecastle to attempt boarding us—
							The lieutenant however made a signal to them to withdraw— He and the
							Pilot were then very much afraid that we should carry them off and
							wanted to get to their boats— The Captain asked me whether he had not
							better now stand off at all Events; I told him I saw no reason for
							changing his first determination, and he concluded to go into the
							Harbour of Fleckeroe, about four miles distant from Christiansand.— The
							lieutenant by his invitation went in with us, and landed. The Captain
							landed to shew his Papers to the commanding Officer here, and afterwards
							went up to Christiansand <hi rend="strikethrough">for</hi> with his
							Papers there— <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Everett</persRef> and <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Gray</persRef> went with him— The Officer at land being
							informed of my character, desired to see my Passport, and having nothing
							but my Commission, I landed and shewed it to him. In the Evening an
							Officer came from the <persRef ref="u">Commodore</persRef> of all the
							gun-boats on the Coast of Norway, on board with his Compliments and
							offers of service to me— About Midnight the Captain with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Everett and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray returned; but the
							papers were to undergo an examination to-morrow— They found the Captains
							of nearly thirty American vessels, which have been brought in to
							Christiansand, since last May, by privateers, and are detained for
							adjudication— The number brought in from May to August is thirty-eight,
							sixteen of which have been condemned and appealed to the higher Court,
							and twelve acquitted, against which the Captors have also appealed,
							detaining the vessels still here— Our Government having no Agent here,
							the Captains have appointed a <persRef ref="isaacson-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Isaackson</persRef> an inhabitant of the
							place, who has interested himself much in their behalf, as their agent—
							The Captain brought me his compliments and invitation to dinner

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Appleby</persRef>— He was

							invitation to dinner, and regretted that the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>ladies</persRef> had not come with us to town— He accompanied me to
							visit the Admiral of the naval force in Norway <persRef
								ref="fischer-olfert">Fischer</persRef>—the Governor of the City
							Tobiesen, and the Commandant of the garrison<space/>The two first of these
							Gentlemen were not at home—the last received us— He is an old officer
							far advanced in years, and speaking only the Danish language, I could
							have but little conversation with him— On my return to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Isaackson’s, a number of the American Captains brought me
							papers containing the translation of their Sentences of condemnation—
							They also delivered me, a memorial which some of them transmitted to the
								<persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef> of the United
							States, some months since, and a triplicate of a letter written some
							time since to me, one copy of which they had forwarded to Petersburg,
							and another to Copenhagen, with the expectation that it would meet me
							there; requesting my interference in their behalf.— They gave me also
							the minutes of all their proceedings since they have acted in company,
							which I read. We dined between two and three O’Clock; there were upwards
							of twenty of the American captured Gentlemen, at table, and several
							others came in after dinner— The Admiral of the gun-boats Fischer, and
							the Governor Tobieszen also came and returned my visit. The Admiral is a
							man apparently between 60 and 70; who told me he had seen <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef> at Paris in 1779. when he was
							there with <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Franklin</persRef> and <persRef ref="lee-arthur">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Lee</persRef>—and that he had been in America during

							Boston <persRef ref="hancock-john">Governor Hancock</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="cooper-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Cooper</persRef>, who gave him a copy of his Sermon at the
							organization of the Government of Massachusetts under the present
							Constitution of the State— He was also acquainted with <persRef
								ref="collins-john">Governor Collins</persRef> of Rhode-Island.— He
							made me a very formal apology, for the misconduct of the Officer who
							boarded our ship, and said he should have been au desespair if any thing
							like violence had been offered to a ship bearing a public minister— The
							Governor of the City was very polite also in his demeanour; but some of
							our Captains say he was interested in the privateers which took them.
							Another Gentleman also came, and invited me to his house to-morrow— His
							name was not mentioned to me, but he told me he had been well acquainted
							with <persRef ref="murray-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Murray</persRef> at the Hague— In the Evening I returned to the ship
							in one of the boats belonging to an American ship; M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Isaackson accompanied me, and also two boats more full of
							those Gentlemen, who intended it as a compliment to me— They spent about
							an hour on board the ship, and then took their leave— The Captain came
							in his own boat, about 11. at Night—with <persRef ref="leech-william"
								>Captain Leech</persRef>, master of one of the captured vessels,
							belonging to <persRef ref="thorndike-israel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Thorndike</persRef> of Beverly— He having by accident miss’d his own
							boat, lodges on board our ship this Night— Our Captain’s papers were
							this day returned without Examination; and with an order from the
							Commission of Examination; that the ship, having a public Minister on
							board, should be suffered to proceed, without any interruption
							whatsoever.— The sight of so many of my Country men, in circumstances so
							distressing is very painful; and each of them has a story to tell, of
							the peculiar aggravations of ill-treatment which he has received— The
							desire of contributing to their relief, is so strong in me, that I shall
							without waiting for express authority from the Government of the United
							States, use every effort in my power in their behalf, to however little
							purpose it may be as to its success.— While we were at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Isaackson’s at table, he received a letter containing a
							Proclamation, announcing that the island of Iceland, which about a year
							since was taken by the English, is now declared independent of all
							European Governments— It was but under a sort of nominal dependence upon
							Denmark.</p>

							no charts of the Belt, and no Pilot— He then took out his own ships
							charts shewed them to the Captain, and said he would have given him one

							then stated to him that I bore a Commission as a Publick Minister from
							the United States of America, to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								of Russia</persRef>; that this ship was fitted out for the express
							purpose of conveying me to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg; that I
							had my family on board, and that by the usages of Nations I had
							understood that it was not the practice to stop the passage of persons
							in such Situations— He asked me if I did not know that the Ports in the
							Island of Zealand were all blockaded; I told him I did not— But that if
							I had, as our only object was passage, I should still have relied on the
							usages of Nations, that I should not be obstructed— He asked my name,
							which I gave him— “And you say, Sir, you have your family on board”—
							Yes, Sir, <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
								<persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">her sister</persRef>, and an
							infant <persRef key="adams-charles2">child</persRef>— He then said, that
							to be sure, by the custom of Nations, the passage of a Public Minister,
							ought not to be obstructed, and if I would give him my word of honour,
							that the ship would not commit a <pb n="16" type="ms"/>a violation of
							the blockade, by going into Copenhagen or any Port of the island of
							Zealand, he would consider this as a case of exception from his
							Instructions, and allow us to pass— I told him that as an Evidence of
							the character which I assumed, I could if he desired exhibit my
							Commission from the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef> of
							the United States; he said that by way of justification for him, he
							should be glad to see it, I accordingly shewed it to him— He then said
							we might pass—but that we should meet with another difficulty— That the
							Danes would take us, and he feared condemn the ship and Cargo, for
							having had any communication with him— This was in reply to the promise
							I had made him, as far as depended on me, and the Captain on his part
							joined in the engagement, not to commit a breach of the blockade, by
							going <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> into any port of the island of
							Zealand— But we had told him we could not engage that we should not be
							taken in— After stating this new difficulty, which appeared to have much
							weight in his mind, he asked me what my determination would be— I told
							him, that I should proceed; and if the Danes should take us, I should
							rely upon the Danish Government’s shewing the same respect to the usage
							of Nations to pay respect to the character of Public Ministers, as was
							now manifested by him— That I had often had occasion to appeal to this
							general practice, and had never found it to fail— Nor should I expect it
							would fail on the part of the Danish Government. He said that
							undoubtedly it was a just expectation that every liberal Nation would
							respect the character of Ambassadors. That the Danes had been such a
							Nation; but he was afraid I should not find it so now— However, as I was
							willing to take the risk, we might pass— We then took our leave and
							returned on board our own ship.— In the course of our conversation, he
							observed that he had been stationed here many Months; but that having
							been obliged to leave the Station for a few days, twelve or fourteen
							American vessels had <hi rend="italic">taken advantage</hi> of his
							absence and passed through— I enquired of the Officers on the deck,
							whether admiral Bertie was a relation of the <persRef
								ref="bertie-brownlow">Duke of Ancaster</persRef>— They said he had
							married a <persRef ref="bertie-catherine">relation</persRef> of that
							family, and taken the name— On this transaction I had occasion to remark
							a circumstance which was characteristic of English manners— Admiral
							Bertie paid all due respect to the laws of Nations— In substance, he
							complied will all we could require of him— He said nothing uncivil or
							offensive; but during the whole time we were with him, he never offered
							us a seat— His conduct was correct in principle, and as to the
							substance— He indicated indeed some sense of benevolence and of feeling—
							For the mention which I made that I had <hi rend="italic">my family</hi>
							on board manifestly made an impression upon him; and the fears he
							expressed that we should be taken by the Danes, appeared to arise partly
							from a disposition not unfriendly to us— But the most ordinary of
							civilities, he either neglected or purposely omitted— On our return in
							their boat the lieutenant left us; but so much time had been consumed,
							that the wind freshening to a strong breeze, directly a-head, we could
							not get up to Elseneur this Night. Just at dark we came to anchor under
							the Danish shore, and about 3 miles distant from the Admiral’s ship—
							Towards Midnight the weather cleared away, and the wind came round to
							the Northwest.</p>

						<p><date>26. </date>I went to bed last Night between 11. and 12. O’Clock—
							But with some uneasiness upon my mind; on finding that the <persRef
								ref="bickford-benjamin">Captain</persRef> supposed our engagement
							not to break the blockade included a promise not to stop at Elseneur to
							pay the usual Sound duties, unless we should be taken and carried in— I
							had understood only that we should not go in to any port of Zealand for
							purposes of trade; but only pass in the customary manner.— I went to
							sleep, but waked again in less than half an hour, with a weight and
							restlessness which would not leave me quiet for repose— I got up; went
							and waked the Captain, and had more than an hour’s conversation with
							him, the result of which left me still in much anxiety— I knew that my
							intention was not to engage any thing in violation of Danish Laws, but
							only no violation of the blockade— Nor could I suppose it possible that
							the <persRef ref="bertie-thomas">Admiral</persRef> meant to ask any
							thing more of us— But as the Captain seemed to think at least that we
								<hi rend="italic">must attempt</hi> to <pb n="17" type="ms"/>pass
							the Castle of Cronenburg, unless a gun should be fired to bring us to, I
							felt under much concern, that we might get into some difficulty by his
							misunderstanding of our engagement— I was desirous that he should go on
							board the Admiral’s ship again and ask an explanation; and if it should
							be so that the Admiral meant to allow us to pass only on the condition
							of our violating the laws of the territory, within which we were to
							pass, I would still not accept the permission, but turn back at all
							hazards and go round through the belt— After this conversation, and
							refering untill the morning, whether the Captain should go to ask this
							explanation, I was again about retiring to bed, when the Captain went
							upon deck, and found that the ship was adrift, bearing down direct upon
							the Man of War, and within a mile of her. The wind at the same time
							blowing very fresh— A second Anchor, a small one was then cast which but
							partially arrested the drifting of the ship— This continued untill about
							9. O’Clock in the Morning; when she stop’d— The wind blew fresh all day,
							with frequent and heavy squalls— It was fair for our progress, but we
							could not weigh anchor, from the danger of drifting ashore. About 3. in
							the afternoon she began to drift again; when we threw out the third and
							last anchor, a very heavy one. We had drifted within the ship’s length
							of a large brig, whose bowsprit threatened our cabin windows all the
							afternoon and Evening; and we were within a quarter of a mile of the
							shore, and a reef of rocks— At the approach of Night I was anxious for a
							boat from the shore to send the ladies and child on shore, for which
							purpose a signal was made at the main-masthead; but no boat came out—
							Shortly before Sunset, a boat from the British Man of War came on board,
							with a lieutenant, who gave some advice to our Captain— He told him,
							that one good anchor would hold better than three, and recommended to
							him in case the wind should change to cut his cables, and go out.— He
							returned on board his ship— The Night came on with a prospect of foul
							weather, which however cleared off about Midnight— The wind then
							changed; and continued freshening untill the morning.</p>

						<p><date>27. </date>All this morning was employed in weighing the anchors;
							two of which the largest and smallest were successfully got on board— At
							this work, all hands were engaged, and the passengers part of the time
							with the rest— An American vessel came in this morning, was brought to
							by the British <persRef ref="bertie-thomas">Admiral</persRef> and turn’d
							back— The Captain came on board our ship. About Noon our ship began to
							drift again; upon which the <persRef ref="bickford-benjamin"
								>Captain</persRef> ordered the cable of the third anchor to be cut
							away, and we stretch’d out beyond Koll Point, expecting upon the other
							tack to reach Elseneur this Night— But from the moment we got under
							sail, the wind drew continually more ahead, and freshened untill by four
							in the afternoon it blew a gale— Three times the attempt was made to put
							the ship round, but she would not come in stays; that is come round
							against the wind. At the third time, just as she was coming round, the
							fore-yard broke short in two, near the middle, and at the same time the
							gale increased to a storm— The Captain lash’d down the helm; put the
							ship under close-reef’d mainsail, main and fore-stay-sails; got down the
							broken fore-yard, and a spare main-yard up in its stead— Before this
							time it was dark Evening— From 5 in the afternoon untill one in the
							morning blew one of the heaviest gales that I ever witness’d; which the
							ship out-rode better than I ever knew a vessel in such a situation to
							do— She ship’d not one Sea, and scarcely took in any Water— By the
							blessing of Heaven, we had sufficient room for drifting, and no
							lee-shore; and with the land so near us on both sides, the Sea did not
							run so high, as it must have done in the open ocean— There was no
							darkness, and no severe cold to aggravate our danger, and the sufferings
							of the crew— Just before dark, and after we had broken our fore-yard, we
							spoke an American, the Mary from Newbury-Port, going back to Gottenburg,
							turn’d away by Admiral Bertie— They thought it very odd that we were
							steering a North-East course and bound to Petersburg.</p>

						<p><date>28. </date>During the furious tempest of last
							Night, in the continual succession of squalls increasing upon each other
							in violence a very little rain fell, in scattered drops—seldom enough at
							once to wet the deck— Between Midnight and one in the Morning came on
							the severest of them all, in the midst of which I rose from bed, to
							which I had shortly before retired; and going to light a candle from the
							lamp in the binnacle, met in the gang-way <persRef ref="poland-nathan">M<hi

							coming for a light into the cabin—that in the binnacle having gone out—
							There was now none in the ship— I soon struck one with my tinder-box,
							and that of the binnacle was again lighted up— During great part of the
							tempest there was no-body upon deck. About 2. I retired again to-bed,
							and in half an hour after the storm suddenly abated; a copious shower of
							rain fell, and the wind came round to the north-west; very moderate. We
							soon got under easy sail in our course, and at day break found ourselves
							again in sight of Koll Point— We had drifted in the Night about six
							leagues backwards— We soon came up with and pass’d <persRef
								ref="bertie-thomas">admiral Bertie’s</persRef> ship, and proceeding
							in the narrow passage between Sweden and Denmark, about noon were within
							a mile of the Castle of Cronburg at the narrowest point of the sound— A
							Danish boat bearing two swivels, and fifteen men, brought us to by
							firing a shot, and immediately after boarded us, and took us into
							Elseneur-Roads— The <persRef ref="bickford-benjamin">Captain</persRef>
							sent word on shore that I was on board, and my character; upon which the
							Port Physician came soon on board, and gave us permission to go on

							<persRef ref="balfour-alexander">Balfour</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="ellah-james">Ellah</persRef> and <persRef ref="rainals-o"

							<persRef key="smith-william-steuben">Smith</persRef>, <persRef

							went with us to the Commandant’s lodgings in the Castle, where I again

							with which he appeared to be entirely satisfied— He also took the names
							of the gentlemen who accompanied me, and the account of <persRef

							returned to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ellah’s— I had intended to go to
							Copenhagen, with the view to make a representation to the Danish

							was now informed that the <persRef ref="frederick-vi">king</persRef>,
							and the Minister <persRef ref="bernstorff-christian">Count

								Ellah</persRef> had invited me and my family to dine with him this

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ellah’s with his family— <persRef ref="u">His
								Lady</persRef>, Sister, children and a <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Goode</persRef>— And a Danish Gentleman—a civil officer called a

							french abbé, named <persRef ref="u">Tellier</persRef>, a man of pleasing
							manners and conversation— <pb n="19" type="ms"/>The afternoon, and
							Evening, were so stormy, that the ladies could not go on board ship
							again, and I took lodgings for the Night, at a house next door to M<hi

								>Morrel</persRef> an Englishman— A House formerly much frequented
							and reputed; but in the present state of War, and annihilation of
							Commerce fallen into decay and almost ruin. We finished the day at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ellah’s and supped there— The french abbe was the
							first man I have met in Europe, who appeared to have much information of
							the state of public affairs, and the first who spoke of them without
							extreme reserve— He told us many circumstances relating to the
							confinement of the late <persRef ref="gustav-iv">king of
								Sweden</persRef>, and the embarrassment of the present government to
							determine what they should do with him— He had asked permission to
							retire to a Society of the Moravian fraternity, which he formerly
							visited in Holstein; which was refused— A proposition had been made that
							he should be allowed to reside in Switzerland; but the consent of the
							Swiss could not be obtained— The present Swedish Administration had
							applied to the Opposition party in England, to propose that he might
							have an asylum in England— But the opposition had refused— He was now on
							a small island; under no other confinement, and has his family with him—
							The <persRef ref="charles-xiii">Duke of Sudermania</persRef> is king,
							and the <persRef ref="charles-august">Prince of Holstein and
								Norway</persRef>, to whom the succession to the Crown has been
							offered, has accepted it, to take effect after Peace concluded between
							Sweden and Denmark— That between Russia and Sweden is already concluded,
							of which a hand-bill from Copenhagen gave us information— Russia to keep
							Finland, and Sweden to join the continental system— While at table M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ellah received the newspapers by the Mail— The
							Hamburg papers contain an account of our sailing from Boston; and the
								<persRef ref="madison-james">President’s</persRef> Proclamation of
							9. August, renewing the Non-Intercourse with Great-Britain— The abbe
							told us of a curious mode of warfare practiced here last Winter against
							Sweden— For about thirty days successively one or two balloons were sent
							up every day from the Castle of Cronburg, to descend upon the Swedish
							Coast, and loaded with copies of a printed inflammatory address to the
							Swedish Nation, instigating them to revolt against their then Sovereign,
							and urgently recommending to them the extraordinary virtues of the
								<persRef ref="frederick-vi">king of Denmark</persRef>. They produced
							however as he says no effect, having immediately excited the attention
							of the Swedish police, which easily procured and suppressed all the
							papers that came to land.</p>

							and leave with him a Representation to be presented to the Danish

							Copenhagen— A Danish Gentleman, who told us he had himself engaged the
							Carriage this morning, asked, if we had any objection to his taking a

							miles of 15 to a degree, or about 28 English Statute Miles— We rode it
							in five hours, and landed at what is called the English Hotel, in the
							great square at Copenhagen—kept by <persRef ref="rau-gottfried"
								>Rau</persRef> and <persRef ref="schmetzer-johan"
								>Schmetzer</persRef>—about 6. in the Evening— Our Danish companion
							here left us— He told us he was a student in the University of
							Copenhagen; and at the same time a lawyer— That in this University there
							are about six hundred students—in the three learned professions, but
							chiefly the law— He informed us of the names of the several places
							through which we passed— Amsterdam— Hirsholm and Lÿng-bÿe— And pointed
							to us in the Sound the island of <hi rend="italic">Hveen</hi>, where he
							says <persRef ref="brahe-tycho">Tycho Brahe</persRef> resided, and made
							his observations from a tower, the ruins of which are still extant— The
							island now belongs to Sweden— The Country from <hi rend="italic"
								>Helsingöer</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Kiöbenhavn</hi>, (these are
							the Danish names of Elseneur and Copenhagen,[)] is very
							beautiful—resembling much the County of Kent from Dover to London in
							England— The road is a <pb n="20" type="ms"/>turnpike, and although
							somewhat broken up by the autumnal rains, is yet very good— These rains
							have continued every day for several weeks, and while on our way this
							day we had several showers— Part of the Country is covered with
							beautiful Oaks, and other forest trees— Part consists of turf grounds,
							many heaps of which we saw exposed to be dried. There is some pasturing
							land, and some where grain has been standing— The proprietary
							separations of the lands, are partly slow-hedge and ditch after the
							English fashion, and partly stone-walls about three feet high back’d
							with a mound of earth and sod up level with the top of the wall— We met
							a great number of Peasant’s Carts coming from Copenhagen, with one, two
							or four horses— Waggons, on four wheels—the body made of boards in the
							shape of a bread-trough— The travelling carriages are mostly made in the
							same shape— Sometimes of wicker-work instead of boards—usually three
							benches crossing them, with or without arms as chairs; and sometimes in
							the centre the body of a chaise, with a boot— The body of these
							Carriages rests only upon the axle trees and a transverse beam extending
							length-ways— But the benches and the Chaise in the most convenient of
							them are suspended upon Springs within the waggon— These are almost
							their only travelling carriages— We met only one Coach like our own on
							the way.— Immediately on my arrival I sent for <persRef
								ref="adgate-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adgate</persRef> the
							supercargo of the ship Helvetius, the first signer of the letter which
							requested me to come, and who lodged in the house where we stop’d— He
							came and pass’d a couple of hours with me— He told me his own situation,
							and that of the other Americans here; which though unpleasant is far
							less so than that of Christiansand— Of those detained here two have not
							yet been tried, and two have been condemned—the rest are all cleared in
							the inferior prize Court, and expect the decision of the Court of
							Admiralty very shortly— The cases of condemnation are in both instances
							for misconduct in the Captains— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith went with
