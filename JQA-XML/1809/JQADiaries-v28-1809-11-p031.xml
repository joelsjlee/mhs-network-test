							to arrange with me the ceremonial of my presentation. I named to him
							seven O’Clock this Evening— He came about 8.— The formalities of these

							so important in the eyes of Princes and Courtiers, that they are much
							more embarrassing to an American than business of real importance. It is
							not safe or prudent to despise them; nor practicable for a person of

						<p><date>5. </date>At ten minutes past one according to the appointment of
								<persRef ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								de Maisonneuve</persRef> I went to the Imperial Palace; and at about
							two was conducted by him to the entrance of the Emperor’s cabinet, the
							door of which was opened, and at which he stop’d— I entered, and found
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> alone— As I step’d
							forward he advanced to me near to the door, and said in French Monsieur,
							je suis charmé d’avoir le plaisir de vous voir ici— I then presented to
							him my credential letter; and addressing him in French said that in
							delivering it, I was charged to add that the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> of the United States hoped
							his Imperial Majesty would consider this mission as a proof of the
							President’s respect for his Majesty’s person and character, of his
							desire to multiply and to strengthen the relations of friendship and
							Commerce between his Majesty’s Provinces and the United States, and of
							grateful acknowledgment for the frequent testimonials of good-will which
							his Majesty on many occasions had given towards the United States— He
							replied by desiring me to assure the President of the United States,
							that this new addition to the relations between the two Countries, gave
							him great pleasure— That in every thing that depended upon him, he
							should be happy to contribute towards increasing the friendly
							intercourse between them— That with regard to the political relations of
							Europe, and those unhappy disturbances which agitated its different
							States, the system of the United States was wise and just; and they
							might rely upon it, he would do nothing to withdraw them from it. That
							the Continent of Europe was now in a manner pacified; and that the only
							obstacle to a general pacification was the obstinate adherence of
							England to a system of maritime pretensions which was neither liberal
							nor just— That the only object now to be obtained by the War, was to
							bring England to reasonable terms on this subject— And that she could no
							longer flatter herself with any support for her system upon the
							Continent— That Austria after abandoning herself to inconsiderate
							councils, and disregarding the advice which <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
							had given her (qu’on lui avait donné) had now been obliged to make
							peace, and to sacrifice several of her provinces— That Austria was thus
							not in a condition to renew the contest— That the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">king</persRef> of Prussia, was in a
							situation to make peace equally necessary to him— That <pb n="33"
								type="ms"/>he, himself was convinced that the good of his Empire and
							of Europe, was best promoted by a state of Peace and Friendship between
							Russia and France; whose views, he believed, from the assurance of that
							Government, were not at all directed to the Conquest of England, but
							merely to make her recognize the only fair and equitable principles of
							neutral Navigation in time of War— That the only danger to England from
							the establishment of these principles would be that France might be
							enabled in consequence of them to form and maintain again a large Navy;
							but this could be no justification for England’s maintaining a system
							oppressive and destructive to the fair and lawful commerce of other
							Nations— That the Establishment of this just system of maritime rights,
							was the purpose of France; and as for me I shall adhere invariably to
							those which I have declared— I am sensible that it subjects us to
							inconvenience— That the People suffer privations and some distress under
							the present state of things— But the English maxims are much more
							intolerable and if submitted to would be permanent— In declaring his
							determination to abide by his declared principles, his tone and attitude
							assumed a firmness and dignity, which he had not taken before, and which
							immediately after slided again into that easy and familiar manner with
							which he had first accosted me— In the midst of this conversation, he
							had taken me by the arm, and walked from near the door, to a window
							opening upon the river; a movement seemingly intended to avoid being
							overheard— I occasionally answered his remarks; by observing to him,
							that as the political duty of the United States towards the powers of
							Europe, was to forbear interference in their dissensions, it would be
							highly grateful to the President to learn that their system in this
							respect met the approbation of his Imperial Majesty— That being at once
							a great commercial and a pacific Nation they were deeply interested in
							the establishment of a system which should give security to the fair
							commerce of Nations in time of War— That the United States, and the
							world of Mankind expected that this blessing to humanity would be
							accomplished by his Imperial Majesty, himself, and that the United
							States by all the means in their power, consistent with their Peace, and
							their separation from the political system of Europe would contribute to
							the support of the liberal principles to which his Majesty had express’d
							so strong and so just an attachment— He said that as between Russia and
							the United States, there could be no interference of Interests and no
							causes for dissension; but that by means of Commerce the two States
							might be greatly useful to each other, and his desire was to give the
							greatest extension and facility to these means of mutual benefit.— After
							this he pass’d from topics of general politics, to conversation more
							particularly concerning myself and my Country— He enquired how long we
							had been upon our voyage, and how we had borne the inconveniences and
							fatigues of the sea— Whether I had ever been in Russia before— What were
							our principal Cities in America—the numbers of their inhabitants, and
							the manner in which they were built— I told him that I had been in
							Russia formerly, and had pass’d a winter at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg during the reign of the <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Empress Catherine</persRef>— That I had then
							admired the City, as the most magnificent I had ever seen; but that I
							scarcely knew it again now— That the two principal Cities in population,
							of my Country, were New-York and Philadelphia, the latter of which had
							been founded by the celebrated Quaker <persRef ref="penn-william"
								>Penn</persRef>, of whom his Majesty had certainly heard— That the
							inhabitants in each of these two Cities were now about one hundred
							thousand— That they were both elegant Cities, with handsome buildings,
							three and four Stories high for the most part, and <pb n="34" type="ms"
							/>and forming handsome and convenient dwelling houses, suitable to the
							Citizens of a Republic, but which in point of splendor and magnificence,
							could not vie with the buildings of Petersburg, which to the eye of a
							stranger appeared like a City of Princes— He said that was nothing— That
							a Republican Government whose principles and conduct were just and wise
							was as respectable as any other— I said, assuredly— But that in regard
							to the buildings, no person could know better than his Majesty that
							Petersburg was the most magnificent City of Europe, or of the world— He
							said he had not been at Vienna or at Paris— But he had been at Dresden
							and at Berlin— That Dresden was small; but Berlin, was a beautiful City,
							as to all the part of it which could be called modern, and to which
								<persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederic the second</persRef> had been
							specially attentive— That the antient part of Berlin was not so
							handsome— That Petersburg had the advantage of being a City entirely
							modern, and built upon a plan—on which I remarked that this was not its
							only advantage; that this plan, was that of a man such as very seldom
							appeared on the face of this globe, and that it bore the marks of his
							sublime genius— That it had the further advantage of all the improvement
							which a succession of Sovereigns could give it, who had entered into the
							ideas of that great <persRef ref="peter-the-great">Prince</persRef>, and
							had taken a pride in contributing to their full execution— He asked me
							to which of the United States I belonged, and upon being told
							Massachusetts, he asked me what was its climate. I told him that it was
							in the Northern part of the Union and had the climate the most nearly
							resembling that of this Residence of any in the United States— He asked
							how long our winter commonly was— I said between five and six months—
							Then said he, we have two months more here— We have eight months of
							Winter—September, October, November, December, January, February, March,
							and April.— And sometimes its lasts till June— But said he—you have good
							sleighing then in your Country— I said we had; but that the snow seldom
							lasted long upon the ground at a time— We cannot complain of that said
							he— When it once comes, it is sure to last long enough— I then said that
							there was an advantage in that; inasmuch as it facilitated <hi
								rend="strikethrough">by</hi> the Communications by the roads— It
							was, he said a very great advantage; for it made roads in the winter,
							better than any that could be made by human art— That all the gravel,
							stone, or iron in the world could not make such a road as a few hours of
							snow and frost— And that the advantage of this was immense, to an Empire
							so extensive as this— So extensive that its size was one of its greatest
							evils; that it was very difficult to hold together so great a body as
							this Empire— I was on the point of saying that great as this evil was,
							his Majesty had recently increased it; referring to the Treaty of Peace
							with Sweden, and the acquisition of Finland; but reflecting that the
							remark might be taken in ill part, or at least thought too familiar and
							smart for such an occasion, I suppress’d it, and made no reply— After a
							short pause the Emperor dismiss’d me by renewing the assurance of his
							pleasure, at receiving a Minister from the United States, and with the
							obliging addition that he was well pleased that the choice of the
							American Government had fallen upon me— That he should be happy to
							promote the relations between the two Countries through this medium, and
							that he hoped I should find my residence agreeable here. Upon which I
							took my leave in the usual form, and went again with M. de Maisonneuve
							to the Apartment of the <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna"
								>Empress</persRef>— Here he entered with me and stood near the door,
							while I advanced up to her Imperial Majesty, who was about the middle of
							the Room, standing alone, with a Lady, whether of Honour or a waiting
							woman, I did not ascertain, standing behind her Majesty, near the stove
							in the corner of the chamber— The Empress who was dress’d in a gown of
							lace; without a hoop—with a necklace of rubies, and a chain of the like
							precious stones round her <pb n="35" type="ms"/>head, connecting the
							utmost simplicity with the most costly ornament, address’d me by saying
							she was happy to see me here; and enquiring how I had found the roads— I
							told her that I had come the whole way by water— Upon which she made
							enquiries, about the length of our voyage and others of the same kind.
							From this she pass’d to remarks upon the climate; the bad weather—the
							cold season which was approaching and the City of Petersburg— Upon all
							this my answers and observations were of the common place kind.— Her
							Majesty then said that two or three years since they had had the
							pleasure of seeing here two of my Countrymen, <persRef
								ref="smith-joseph6">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef>, whose manners had been calculated to inspire
							great esteem personally to themselves, and to their Country, and asked
							me whether I had seen them since their return— I said that I had heard
							that two of my Countrymen, had been favoured with the honour of
							admission to her imperial Majesty’s presence, and that I knew they
							recollected with great pleasure the reception they had met here— That I
							had not the pleasure of being acquainted with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Poinsett, but I had seen M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Smith at Washington upon his return from Europe, about two years since,
							and knew how much he prized the manner of his treatment at this Court—
							On taking leave of her Majesty, immediately after this conversation,
							conformably to the established usage I kiss’d her hand, a ceremony which
							M. de Maisonneuve told me many persons forgot to perform; which the
							Empress herself never took in ill part; being the most amiable princess
							in the world— But that the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress
								dowager</persRef> was more apt to be displeased at such an omission.
							Having thus finished the ceremonies of presentation to the Emperor and
							Empress, I went in person to the house of the French Ambassador—the
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de Vicence</persRef>, who
							not being at home, I left a card there— He had sent two cards yesterday
							one for <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> and one for me— A circumstance for
							which I know not how to account— He send two return cards this Evening—
							I pass’d the remainder of the day at home. <persRef ref="krehmer-anna"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Krehmer</persRef> called upon

									>r:</hi> Harris</persRef> answered my note this morning, and
							called upon me just before eleven O’Clock— I went with him to the Palace
							and attended the celebration of the Mass, and the Te Deum— Just as we
							were going out from the house I received a note from <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> superscribed très
							pressée, informing me that Her Majesty, the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress-Mother</persRef>, had changed the hour
							for the presentation of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef>, to 1/2 past 2
							O’Clock— I gave notice accordingly to M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Adams. On arriving at the Palace we were introduced first to the
							Antichamber, where all the foreign Ministers were <pb n="37" type="ms"
							/>assembled; and I was soon called out to have a private Audience of the
							Empress-Mother— She is said to be very much attached to the punctilio of
							etiquette, which the reigning <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna"
								>Empress</persRef> is not; but her Imperial Majesty, is all
							condescension and affability— Full of Conversation and upon a variety of
							topics— She spoke about America, which she said was un pays bien sage— I
							told her that we were much obliged to Her Majesty, for the good opinion
							she entertained of us— She asked whether there were not great numbers of
							emigrants arriving there from Europe— I told her, not many of late
							years— How so, said she— I thought there were in these times more than
							ever— I said that the Ports of Holland and other Countries from which
							they were wont to embark, had been closed against our Commerce, and they
							could not find opportunities to go— That our Commerce was shut out, from
							almost all Europe.— But said she, it is freely admitted here— I said
							yes; it was an advantage which we still enjoyed, and very much
							cherished— That from the friendly dispositions, which his Majesty the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, was pleased to
							manifest towards the United States, I hoped we should continue in the
							enjoyment of this advantage, which was important to the interests of
							both Countries— She said there were many very excellent articles of
							Commerce, brought here from America— And said I, many sent from this
							Country equally important to us— So that it is a commerce extremely
							beneficial to both parties— This, she said was the best kind of
							commerce— She enquired after <persRef ref="smith-joseph6">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef>, who were presented here, two or three years
							since, and of whom she spoke in very favourable terms— She asked me
							about our voyage— Said she had heard I had been at Berlin— Had I ever
							before been in Russia?— I said I had— At a time when her Majesty was
							absent, travelling on the Continent— She said it must then have been in
							the year 1781—and 1782—which I said it was— On taking my leave, she said
							she was happy to see me; and hoped I should find my residence at
							Petersburg agreeable— That she would have the pleasure of making the
							acquaintance of my Lady this day— I then returned into the Hall of the
							foreign Ministers, where I had some conversation with several of them—
							The French Ambassador—whose name is <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>Colaincourt</persRef>, and whose Style is Duc de Vicence, Grand
							Ecuyer de France, Ambassadeur Extraordinaire, près S. M. l’Empereur de
							toutes les Russies, and whom I informed that I had called to see him at
							his Hôtel in person, told me that he was sorry not to have been at home
							when I called, and that he also had called upon me, and had not found me
							at home— This, I believe, was a mistake— <persRef ref="stedingk-kurt"
								>General Baron de Stedingk</persRef> has been formerly Swedish
							Ambassador at this Court, and was the first Swedish Plenipotentiary, at
							the late Treaty of Peace, between Russia and Sweden— But he is here
							without any regular Diplomatic character at present— He told me, that he
							had been an Officer in the French Army, during our War, and was wounded
							at the Battle of Savannah— He said he had received the order of the
							Cincinnati Society; but did not wear it because he had not the
							permission of <persRef ref="charles-xiii">his king</persRef> so to do— I
							made many enquiries of him concerning my old Swedish acquaintance, and
							received some information from him concerning some of them— <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> de Wiggers</persRef> Agent
							of the Hanseatic Cities was introduced to me, and spoke with much
							pleasure of his friendship for <unclear><hi rend="strikethrough"
									>Eliot</hi></unclear>. Harris— About 12 O’Clock, we were
							informed that the Mass was about to begin, and went into the chapel— The
							Emperor, Empress, Empress Mother, <persRef ref="annapavlovna">Grand
								Duchess Ann</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="katharine-amalie"
								>Princess Amelia of Baden</persRef> the Empress’s Sister, and the
							Grand-Duke and Czarovitz <persRef ref="constantine3"
								>Constantine</persRef>, with the <persRef ref="ludwig">Prince of
								Wurtemberg</persRef>, brother to the Empress Mother, came in
							immediately after— A railing of massive silver separates the chapel from
							the place of the hearers— The Mass is heard standing; except at one
							particular moment, when every body kneeled— At the close of the Te-Deum,
							The Metropolitan presented to the Emperor, who then went within the <pb
								n="38" type="ms"/>railing a large crucifix, which he kiss’d, the
								<persRef ref="podobedov-amvrosy">Archbishop</persRef> at the same
							time kissing the Emperor’s hand— The same ceremony was performed to the
							two Empress’s; and all the Priests who had performed in the ceremonies
							kiss’d the hands of both Empresses and of the Grand Duchesses— The Te
							Deum was a separate and extraordinary performance for this day. At the
							moment of its beginning a salute of Cannon was fired from the Admiralty,
							near the Palace. The Ceremonies were performed in the Russian Language—
							The Music altogether vocal— No instrumental Music being allowed in the
							rites of this Church— The voices were admirable— During the performance
							of this Mass, two Messengers, belonging to the Department of Ceremonies,
							were successively sent to M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams to
							inform her that she must come, first at two O’Clock, and then at 1/2
							past one; by different arrangements ordered by the Empresses. She came
							in seasonable time, and was presented, first to the Empress, with whom
							the Emperor was at the same time; then to the Empress-Mother, and
							finally, immediately after me, to the Grand Duchess Ann; a young lady of
							fourteen or fifteen, sister to the Emperor, whose Audience was short,
							and who spoke to me of our voyage, of the weather, and of the City of
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg— There were several
							gentlemen, foreigners presented to the Empresses and Grand Duchess,
							besides us; which occasioned the disorder and confusion in the time—
							About 3. in the afternoon it was all finished, and we came home to our
							lodgings— I shortly after, received a Note from the Chancellor,
							enclosing a Passport in favour of one <persRef ref="graham-archibald"
								>Graham</persRef>, purporting to be from the Mayor of New-York;
							enquiring as to its authenticity, which was suspected— A <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Plessig</persRef> had sent
							me some days ago this Passport, with his own warranty that Graham was a
							native American, and a request that I would authenticate the Passport— I
							had sent it back, on the information of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris that the Passport was probably a forgery, and the bearer Graham
							no native American Citizen, but an English Officer, who had never been
							in America— I now wrote a note in Answer to that of Count Romanzoff, and
							in the Evening called upon M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris to
							shew it to him— He was in Company at his neighbour <persRef
								ref="severin-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Severin’s</persRef>, where I sent for him, requesting to see him for
							a few minutes— He came home, and I pass’d a couple of hours with him,
							and took his advice respecting my answer— <persRef ref="fisher-miers"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Fisher</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Graham came in for about half an hour

								ref="schenck-hans">Count Schenk de Castel-Dischingen</persRef> were

							and the Saxon Minister <persRef ref="einsiedel-george">Count

							General Pardo, upon the situation of affairs in his Country; with which
							he is apparently very much dissatisfied, and upon which though
							representing here, <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">king
							Joseph</persRef>, he speaks with great freedom— With M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six upon commercial affairs—the policy of
							France and England, upon literature and political economy; and upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six’s lands in America, where he has
							large possessions— With Count Einsiedel, upon the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus-i">king of Saxony</persRef>, who was formerly
							Elector, and at whose Court I was presented in the year 1799—and upon
							the gallery of Pictures at Dresden, with which the Count is well
							acquainted being himself a Connoisseur in Paintings— And finally with
							the Duke de Mondragone, upon the cold climate of Petersburg, and the
							warm one of Naples; upon house-hiring, lodgings and furniture.— We came
							home at about 4. o’clock, and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris
							dined with us— Between 8 and 9 in the Evening we went to a splendid
							Ball, given by <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef> to the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna"
								>Empress-Mother</persRef>, and at which were also present the

								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="constantine3">Grand Duke Constantine</persRef>, and the
								<persRef ref="annapavlovna">Grand-Duchess Ann</persRef>, with a
							Court, of about 250 persons— As almost total Strangers, we found this
							Ball somewhat tedious. But it resembled in every respect the parties of
							a similar kind, which we often attended at Berlin, where the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">king</persRef> and royal-family of
							Prussia were present— At this however the dresses were more splendid,
							and the profusion of diamonds and other precious stones, worn both by
							the men and the women, as well as of ribbands blue and red was greater
							than I ever witnessed any where. There was a fine supper, served at ten
							or fifteen tables, covering the second Story of the House, besides the
							Emperor’s table below; which I did not see; but which is said to have
							been very highly ornamented— The crowd in the dancing rooms was very
							great— The principal dancing was in what they call Polish dances,
							consisting simply in a number of couples walking up and down the rooms
							as in a procession— The Emperor, and Empress Mother spoke I believe to
							all the foreign Ministers— He asked me some questions about my former
							visit to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg— I told him that I
							had then been well acquainted with the House in which we now were; which
							was then the residence of the French Minister, the <persRef

							supposed I had been here upon private affairs of my own— I told him that
							I had been attached to a Legation from the United States, which was not
							received here; it being in the time of the American War— He said that
							must have been a very interesting period of our history.— The
							Empress-Mother spoke about the climate and the weather— M<hi

								Baron de Stedingk</persRef>, formerly Ambassador from Sweden at this
							Court, is now here without any regular diplomatic character— He expects
							to be here about nine months, and spoke of it as uncertain whether he
							should not afterwards be fixed here again, in his former capacity— He
							appears mortified and dejected at the situation of his Country— He spoke
							of the late <persRef ref="gustav-iv">king</persRef>, much as he is
							characterized in a recent Speech of the present <persRef
								ref="charles-xiii">king</persRef>, as a man qui n’a jamais calculé
							la possibilité d’une chose— He says that during the whole of the late
							War, Sweden paid for a hundred and twenty thousand troops, and never had
							more than four thousand engaged in any action— Never more than ten
							thousand acting at once against the Russians, who <pb n="40" type="ms"
							/>amounted in Finland to one hundred thousand men— Because he had taken
							it into his head that one Swede, was a match for ten Russians; and
							nothing could convince him to the contrary— This trait of character is
							enough to account for all his misfortunes, and the present condition of
							his kingdom— The General spoke of <persRef ref="champagny-jean">M.
								Champagny’s</persRef> late letter to <persRef ref="armstrong-john"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Armstrong</persRef>, and
							express’d some surprize that he had asserted in it des choses qui ne
							sont pas— He spoke in high terms of the <persRef ref="constantine3"
								>Grand-Duke Constantine</persRef>; who he said was frank and
							honourable in his character— <hi rend="italic">Celui-la</hi>, on peut se
							fier à ce qu’il dit. Our next visit was to the <persRef
								ref="demaistre-joseph">Comte de Maistre</persRef>, Minister of the
								<persRef ref="victoremmanuel">king of Sardinia</persRef>— His
							Master, who has been strip’d of all his dominions, excepting the island
							of Sardinia, from which he derived his title, now receives a pension
							from the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, and his
							Minister here, lives upon a part of it— He is a Piedmontese, by birth—a
							Frenchman by character, a man of sense and vivacity in conversation, and
							as a victim of the French Revolution keenly smarting under the present
							order of things. He says he shall die here; and he has in fact neither
							home nor Country of which he can return— We next visited the <persRef
								ref="navarro-rodrigo">Chevalier Navarro d’Andrade</persRef>, Chargé
							d’Affaires from Portugal. I had known him as Secretary of the Portuguese
							Legation at Berlin— His Country too has been overrun by the French, and
							he is without Communication with his Government— He was unwell— Having
							been obliged last Evening to leave the Ball at <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>— At his
							lodgings we met a <persRef ref="sablukov-nikolai">General
								Sabloukoff</persRef>— We lastly called upon <persRef ref="u"
								>Monsieur de Wieggers</persRef>, Agent from the Hanseatic Towns—the
							Remnant of which, Hamburg, Bremen, Lubeck and Dantzick, have all been
							swallowed up by the French— He spoke of the Ball last Evening, and
							wondered that General, Baron Stedingk was not invited to play cards with
							the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress-Mother</persRef>, for though
							he had not now the official character of an Ambassador, he was one of
							the most distinguished persons of his own Country. He then told us of
							the slights and contemptuous treatment which Baron Stedingk received
							from the <persRef ref="paul-i">Emperor Paul</persRef>—and of the prudent
							and pleasant manner in which he got over it— From this he pass’d to the
							excessive tediousness and insupportable vexations of the attendance upon
							Paul’s Court; which indeed by his description was much worse than any
							thing at the present time— We completed this tour of visits about half
							past one O’Clock— At 2. I went to Count Romanzoff’s; by appointment— He
							received me in his private Cabinet, apologizing for it, as intending by
							it an invitation to call upon him whenever it might be agreeable to me—
							I told him the Circumstances of the information which I had received
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris, respecting the questionable
							Passport and its bearer <persRef ref="graham-archibald"
							>Graham</persRef>— He express’d himself much obliged to me for the
							notice, of which he said he would make such use as might be proper,
							without any improper exercise of authority, which might affect the
							possible rights of the individual— He entered also into much general
							conversation; He assured me of his great attachment to the system of
							friendly intercourse with the United States, and his conviction of long
							standing, that the Interests of Russia, perfectly harmonized with
							theirs— He said je dois vous prévenir que nous sommes ici de Grands
							Anglomanes— That the prejudices in favour of England were founded upon
							old habits and a long established commercial intercourse— But that the
							English exclusive maritime pretensions, and views of usurpation upon the
							rights of other Nations, made it essential to them, and especially to
							Russia, that some great commercial State should be supported as their
							rival— That the United States of America were such a State, and the
							highest interest of Russia was to support and favour them, as by their
							relative situation the two powers could never be in any manner dangerous
							to each other— That he had been many years inculcating this doctrine, at
							this Court; that the Emperor had always manifested a favourable opinion
							of it; and he had had the satisfaction of perceiving the sentiments of
							his Imperial Majesty, daily becoming more strongly confirmed in this
							system— He said if there was any thing in which I could contribute to
							the purposes of this object; any views of the American Government that I
							could suggest, without wishing to penetrate into their secrets, he
							should only say that he should cheerfully lend his aid to any thing that
							I might propose— That in drawing up the Instructions of the <persRef
								ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Comte de Pahlen</persRef>, the Minister
							who is going from the Emperor to the Unites States, he intended to
							consult me, and <pb n="41" type="ms"/>would insert any thing which I
							should think might be useful to the great end of drawing closer the
							relations between the two Countries. His object appeared to me to be to
							ascertain whether I had powers to conclude a Treaty with Russia, and to
							lead directly to propositions for that purpose from me— I answered him
							in general terms which I endeavoured to make such as corresponded for
							politeness with his own— I told him how much gratified I knew the
								<persRef ref="madison-james">President of the United
								States</persRef> would be on receiving information of these
							Sentiments, and of those, so conformable to them, which the Emperor had
							express’d to me, in the private audience which he had granted me— That
							the United States who found themselves and their Commerce at once under
							the pressure of injustice by both the great rival powers, France and
							England, would still find great satisfaction and support in the
							knowledge that a Sovereign so powerful and so enlightened as the Emperor
							of Russia was devoted to neither, but like themselves favoured a course
							equally independent of both— He said he should make no scruple to say to
							me that he did not approve the present system of France in relation to
							Commerce— That he had seen and conversed much with the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>— That he had
							found him in general of a sound judgment and quick perception— But that
							en fait de Commerce ce n’est qu’un Etourdi— At the same time he said he
							hoped I should not think he meant to give him a mauvaise reputation. But
							he wished to know whether in the application of this system there was
							any thing which could accommodate the views of the United States, and if
							there was, requested that I would suggest it— I told him that the great
							and only object desirable to the United States, was that to which they
							were entitled by right— Freedom to their Commerce— Freedom of admission
							and departure for ships— Freedom of purchase and sale for goods— The
							more completely they could obtain this the better— That in the
							restrictions upon them I thought the proceedings both of England and
							France unjust and impolitic; and was persuaded that the more liberal
							system established under his auspices by Russia, was not only of great
							advantage to both Countries, but would very much increase the commerce
							already existing between them.— He told me also among other things that
								<persRef ref="burr-aaron">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Burr</persRef>, now at Gottenburg, had applied for a Passport to
							come to Petersburg; which had been refused him, unless it should be
							regularly applied for under the sanction of the representative of his
							Country at this Court— He spoke of the British Ministry, and asked my
							opinion of the persons composing it— I told him that he must be
							infinitely better acquainted with them than I was—which however he did
							not admit—alledging that he had but lately entered upon the department
							of foreign affairs; and before that time had purposely avoided any
							particular attention to the composition of foreign Governments— I told
							him I had heard <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>
							was appointed the Secretary of State, for the foreign Department in the
							room of <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Canning</persRef>— Who was Lord Bathurst— I said I had heard very
							little of him— The Count said it was the same with him— Mais ce n’est
							pas un homme neuf— I have seen his name said he, in some ministerial
							list before— And I have little hopes, said he, from any man in England,
							who is already known— They are all equally intractible— England must be
							brought to give up some of her inveterate prejudices, and I do not
							expect she will, untill the Circumstances bring forward new men; who can
							without inconsistency accede to a new system— Do you know said he, of
							any distinguished men in England, who would be more likely to come to
							terms of a general pacification, than the late Ministers— I told him of
							the principal personages of the present opposition— Such as <persRef
								ref="grenville-william">Lord Grenville</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="grey-charles">Lord Howick</persRef>— As for them said he, I do
							not expect any thing better from them than from the others— None of
							them, said he, has yet brought his mind to the conviction of the
							necessity which <pb n="42" type="ms"/>will compel England to follow the
							current of affairs which is setting in a certain direction among
							mankind. There was, he said something epidemical in the course of human
							Events, which made it necessary as well among Nations as individuals for
							one to pursue a course governed in a great measure by the course of
							others; and this was what English Statesmen would not perceive— I told
							him that it was indeed true that Lord Grenville had always been a
							strenuous asserter of the English pretensions, and had particularly
							distinguished himself by his opposition to the Treaty with Russia in
							1801. when England had conceded something— (the Count spoke very
							slightingly of the concessions in this Treaty, which he thought amounted
							to nothing at all; upon which I observed that the explanatory Article
							had indeed appeared to take back, most of what the Treaty had conceded,
							and that it was probably Lord Grenville’s opposition which had
							occasioned the explanatory Article)— But I said that in my opinion the
							foolish obstinacy of England, which was leading that Nation so rapidly
							to ruin, was dependent upon a single man— Who was that? said the Count?—
							The <persRef ref="george-iii">King</persRef>?— No— It was the <persRef
								ref="jenkinson-robert">Earl of Liverpool</persRef>— A Man who for
							many years had possessed a great ascendancy over the king’s mind, and
							who I perceived since the resignation of <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Canning, had been charged with the duties
							of both their Offices, besides his own— The Count appeared not to have
							been acquainted with the character and history of Lord Liverpool; of
							which I gave him a short account— After having pass’d about an hour with
							the Count I took my leave and returned home. At 5. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris called on me again, and we went
							together and dined with the Dutch Minister <persRef ref="six-willem"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six</persRef>— The French

						<p><date>27. </date>Called upon <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef> this morning; and
							found him again confined to his room with a cough— He has made to me
							since I arrived here a number of presents, some of which were of
							sufficient value to make me hesitate about accepting them. And to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef> a Turkish Shawl
							each, still more expensive— Disapproving of the practice of receiving
							presents of value, while in public office, I have always refused those
							which have been offered to me; and in now yielding to an exception in
							consideration of the situation of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris
							and myself here, I have determined to make it very limited in its
							extent; and to return equivalents in point of cost; that at least I may
							derive no profit from the <hi rend="italic">inter-change</hi>— I gave
							him this morning my Seal, with the device, which I had engraved at
							London in 1796, and which by a curious coincidence has his name upon it—
							The engraver, <persRef ref="harris-george">Harris</persRef>, having put
							it there as a memorial of his work— This goes but a small part of the
							way towards fulfilling my intention— <persRef ref="raimbert-francois"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rimbert</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montréal</persRef>
							called this morning upon me— I had an invitation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams and her Sister to dine at the
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador’s</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">Sans cérémonie</hi>, at half past three— We went at
							about 4. and were the last there; excepting the <persRef ref="u">Duke de
								Mondragone</persRef>— The Dinner was of forty persons; the Corps
							Diplomatique of French Connections— <persRef ref="vyazemskaya-elena"
								>Princess Wäzemsky</persRef>— <persRef ref="vlodek-alexandra">Madame
								de Vlodek</persRef> and her Sisters; and two or three other
							persons.— <persRef ref="ouvarov-fedor">General Ouvaroff</persRef>, and
							his brother were of the party— After being about two hours at dinner the
							company returned to the Hall; where <persRef ref="u">Mademoiselle
								Bourgoin</persRef>, a french actress, who is performing at the
							theatre here declaimed Scenes from Phédre—from Zaïre, from L’Ecole des
							Maris, and from La Florentin— <persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien">M. de
								Rayneval</persRef> the premier Sécrétaire de l’Ambassade, reading
							the alternate parts of the Dialogue— Immediately after this, a band of
							Music struck up, and a Polonaise was walked round the Hall— Then the
							Company was conducted through the suit of apartments, and dining Hall,
							to a small Theatre, where another actor of the French troop of Comedians
							performed a number of slight of hand tricks— Thence we returned to the
							Hall, and danced two or three hours; after which was a supper, and
							between one and 2 in the morning we came home.— I endeavoured to amuse
							some of the tediousness of the day, by conversation with some Gentlemen
							of the Company— But there are very few topics of conversation upon which
							I can talk with them— <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef>, the Spanish Minister has understanding, literature,
							and taste; and withal is perfectly accomplished in the Science of
							Cookery— He told me that he had offered at Paris for <persRef
								ref="charles-iv">Charles the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi></persRef> king of Spain 350,000 livres for a Death of
							Adonis by <persRef ref="giorgione">Giorgione</persRef>, the Master of
								<persRef ref="titian">Titian</persRef>; and could not get it— But
							that he did purchase, for 110,000 livres an original picture of <persRef
								ref="columbus-christopher">Christopher Columbus</persRef>, taken
							from the life, by the same Giorgione— He also promised me a pamphlet
							which he has written, and published, on the pictures in the National
							Museum at Paris— The <persRef ref="schladen-friedrich">Baron de
								Schladen</persRef> the Prussian Minister, gave me some information
							respecting many of my old acquaintances at Berlin— They are scattered,
							like the Prussian Monarchy itself, to all the winds of Heaven— On
							returning home I found a packet from <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>, containing the Courier’s Pass, and a
							sealed order for Post-Horses, for <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Waters</persRef>, with a letter for
								<persRef ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Count de Pahlen</persRef>, the
							Russian Minister, who is going to America, and who is now at Paris.</p>

								<persRef ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef>, in
							France— I went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef>, to look at a house;
							lately occupied by a <persRef ref="u">General Toutoulmin</persRef>, and
							belonging to the <persRef ref="saintpriest-francois">Count de S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Priest</persRef>— It is a very good
							house; and handsomely furnished—in part— But the Rent is 8000 Roubles a
							year— I dined at <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff’s</persRef>— A great diplomatic dinner; of forty persons—
							Given to the newly arrived Austrian <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann"
								>Count de S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien</persRef>— I sat at
							table, between <persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Six</persRef> and <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef>;—and had some conversation with both of them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six says that his expenses the first year
							he came here were 55000 Roubles, and every year since, between 45 and
							50000— That those of the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French
								Ambassador</persRef> amount at least to 400,000 Roubles a year. That
							the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>
							encourages great expence here upon a principle of Policy, and also among
							his Officers— Not liking to have men too independent, about him— That
							like <persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederick the second</persRef>, he
							confines his rewards to very few persons, but heaps them in profusion.
							There was at table a Prussian General <persRef ref="pfuhl-karl"
								>Pfuhl</persRef>, who M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Six said was
							one of the ablest men in the world, who had lately published in German
							some remarks upon the system of conscription; though he did not
							acknowledge himself as the author— He said he would send it to me
							to-morrow— He was very much afraid that this conscription system would
							be introduced into Holland— General Pardo told me that there were lineal
							descendants of <persRef ref="columbus-christopher">Columbus</persRef>,
							of <persRef ref="cortes-hernan">Cortez</persRef> and of the Mexican
							Emperor <persRef ref="montezuma-ii">Montezuma</persRef>, living in
							Spain.— The <persRef ref="colon-mariano">Duke de Veraguas</persRef> was
							descended in direct line from Columbus— And the title of his eldest Son,
							was <persRef ref="u">Marquis of Jamaica</persRef>— The family of
							Montezuma had been always remarkable for their devotion, and even
							superstition— The Great Grandfather of the present Duke, who was the
							Great-Grand son of <persRef ref="guatimozen">Guatimozin</persRef> (there
							must have been a greater number of descents) was about a century since
							Vice-Roy of Mexico. And after an administration of five years, which was
							so excellent that it is remembered with gratitude, by the People of the
							Country to this day; he returned quietly to Spain— The General said that
							the Government must have been very confident of its own Strength to
							trust such a man, with such a place— I came home about seven O’Clock—
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wiggers</persRef>
							paid us a visit. M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams and <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef> were both unwell—
							The French Ambassador made me an apology, for having invited us
							yesterday to so unceremonious a party as that of yesterday; and told me
							it would give him pleasure if at any time I would come about five
							O’Clock, and take a dinner with him, without waiting for an
							invitation.</p>
