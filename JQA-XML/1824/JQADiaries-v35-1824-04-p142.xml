								Newton</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Commerce— <persRef
								ref="vannness-john">General Van-Ness</persRef> came, and I had
							further explanations with him, upon the demand of <persRef
								ref="kerr-alexander">Kerr</persRef> against me. He said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr’s feelings were prodigiously hurt at
							the imputations of fraud that I had cast upon him; and that <persRef
								ref="thomas-george">Thomas</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mcintyre-alexander">M’Intyre</persRef>, who were present on the
								20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March, both concurred with him
							Van Ness that I did more than once use the term fraud— I said if I had
							used it, my meaning referred to that which had been practised upon me— I
							had not meant to charge fraud personally upon Kerr— I had charged him
							with unfairness, in taking advantage of my interposition to save a
							perishing family <pb type="ms" n="143"/>from a Distress for 125 dollars
							to make me charge myself for a further payment of half as much more—
							This combined with what I believed to be the woman’s misrepresentations,
							had produced on me the effect of fraud— But I had distinctly told Kerr,
							that having had no direct intercourse in the transaction, either with
							him, or with <persRef ref="moulton-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Moulton</persRef>, I did not know that he had practised deception in
							the case— Van Ness told me of several proposals that he had made to
							Kerr, none of which he agreed to short of that of my paying the whole
							Note. But he said Kerr offered to give me an order for the Rent, so that
							I might distrain for it as he had done, and even to give me an order for
							a quarter subsequent to the date of the Note— He commenced an argument
							to me, that perhaps the note might be recoverable at Law or in a Court
							of Equity, though drawn by a married woman, and reminded me of the usual
							maxim that a man must consider before he signs his name, what the
							consequences may be— I told him I had no doubt, Lawyers might make a
							seven years question of it in judicial Courts in which each of the
							parties might spend seven times the amount of the Note, and finally
							leave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr where he was at the beginning—
							I was convinced he could not recover the Note, either at Law or in
							equity— But my name was upon the note, and therefore I would pay it, and
							take care to have no possibly avoidable transaction with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr thereafter. I would consider of his
							last proposal, and take measures to obtain such security as might be
							practicable from Moulton; not however by <hi rend="italic"
							>distress</hi>; and would then let him know the result— He endeavoured
							to throw all the blame of the transaction upon M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Moulton, who he said had found upon enquiry to be a woman
							of bad character, and was implicated in some of the transactions of an
							Attorney named <persRef ref="burr-levi">Levi Burr</persRef>, suspended

						<p><date>2. VII.</date><persRef ref="plumer-william2">W. Plumer</persRef>
							this morning brought me a pamphlet sent me by its author <persRef
								ref="moore-jacob">Jacob B. Moore</persRef>— Annals of the town of
							Concord in New Hampshire— Plumer spoke also of a recent conversation
							between him and <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Van Buren</persRef>, who was sounding him with a view to
							bring him over to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

							Buren acknowledged himself under personal obligations to me, but said he
							had supported Crawford as the Republican candidate. That enquiries had
							been made last Summer in the Albany Argus, whether I was willing to be
							considered as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Republican Candidate; and
							answered not satisfactorily in the New-York American— While Plumer was
							there <persRef ref="conway-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Conway</persRef> of Arkansas came and introduced <persRef
								ref="rector-william">General Rector</persRef>, of Missouri— A
								<persRef ref="walker-david2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walker</persRef> of Pennsylvania, appointed Consul at Glasgow in the

							his Commission, and for a Letter of advice to Strong informing him of
							his removal— I walked with Plumer to the Capitol, to hear the close of
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster’s</persRef> speech upon the Tariff, which I did. He spoke
							about an hour, but the principal part of his Speech was delivered
							yesterday. It was universally admitted to be an able and powerful
							speech. Many of the members came and spoke to me while I was in the
							house. <persRef ref="tomlinson-gideon">Tomlinson</persRef> of
							Connecticut, and <persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">Van
								Rensselaer</persRef> of New-York (Albany) spoke of Accounts received
							by them from their respective States, containing manifestations of
							opinion against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford who is now
							denominated the Caucus Candidate— <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W.
								Taylor</persRef> told me that <persRef ref="dix-john">J. A.
								Dix</persRef> had been with him this morning from <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> who was extremely anxious
							himself to see Taylor. The object was to state to Taylor, that it was
							the desire of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> to be supported for the Office of Vice President—
							That there was every prospect of a certainty that there would be a
							majority of the Legislature of New-York for me: that the wish of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s friends was to fall in with this
							prospect, and they wished that this arrangement might be further
							recommended from this place. Taylor said he believed the best way would
							be to let the thing take its course— I said that my friends would do as
							they should think proper— Personally, and on purely public grounds, I
							should prefer to see the Vice-Presidency conferred upon <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>— I believed—the
							public sentiment among those really my friends was decidedly, perhaps
							unalterably the same. The only possible reason for hesitation was
							Jackson’s being a Candidate for the first Office. And for that reason I
							thought the course of New-York should be left to itself— I had no
							objection to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Calhoun’s obtaining the
							Vice-President— <persRef ref="foote-charles">C. A. Foote</persRef> gave
								<pb type="ms" n="145"/>me a small coloured drawing directed to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, sent as he said by his eldest Sister,
							a widow <persRef ref="brian-unknown">Brian</persRef>; an emblem of
							Friendship— He said his Sister and <persRef ref="foote-ebenezer">his
								father</persRef> were both great Adamsites, though he himself was a
							Caucus man— I told him laughing that his Sister was a wiser politician
							than he; which he said was very possible— <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef>, after Webster
							had finished his speech, had some conversation with him in his seat, and
							immediately afterwards came to me and enquired if I had expressed an
							opinion in favour of the present Tariff-Bill—I said no—not as it stood—
							The double duty upon Molasses was to me an insuperable objection against
							it— He said, he had just been talking with Webster, and asked him, how
							came on with him Presidential Affairs; to which he answered he did not
							know, and to tell him the truth did not care— Why so?—Why it seemed to
							him, nothing was to be got with one more than with another— There was
							this damn’d Tariff—and our friend J. Q. is as bad upon it as any of the
							rest— No, said Crowninshield; I have understood he was not in favour of
							this Bill— “I had it (said Webster) from his own lips”— While
							Crowninshield was telling me this, Webster came out from his seat, and
							was passing by us— I called to him, and he sat down by me. I asked him,
							if he had said I had told him I was in favour of this Tariff-bill as it
							now stood— He said no— I had had no Conversation with him on the
							subject— But he had been told last week, that upon some enquiry made of
							me, I had answered I was in favour of the Bill— Crowninshield had not
							expected I should so immediately call upon Webster, for explanation; and
							Webster expected it as little— They were both embarrassed— Crowninshield
							said he had understood Webster to have said he had my opinion directly
							from myself, which Webster again explicitly disavowed— When he was gone,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crowninshield told me that Webster
							had expressly said in words what he had repeated to me— It was
							impossible that he should have misunderstood him, and added he had not a
							doubt that Webster had positively engaged to support Calhoun for the
							Presidency; and was now ready to support any one else.— At all Events
							this incident completes the demonstration of Webster’s political
							feelings towards me— Calhoun and Crawford have both taken hold of his
							Ambition, and he has fallen into their toils— While I was at the House
								<persRef ref="maul-william">my Messenger</persRef> came there and
							summoned me to the <persRef key="monroe-james">Presidents</persRef>,
							where I found a cabinet-meeting assembled— They had already been two
							hours or more in Session, and all the members but myself were present—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford for the first time since
							last Summer— The meeting had been suddenly called, and the subject was a
							claim of the State of Virginia, for <hi rend="italic">Interest</hi>,
							which she had paid upon monies, borrowed during the late War, to pay for
							the defence of the State— Militia Services—for which the United States
							have already paid the claim of the State; but this was for Interest, on
							monies borrowed by the State at the time— The question had been much
							discussed before I came in—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							earnestly in favour of making the allowance—<persRef ref="wirt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> warmly pressing
							for it—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, very faintly opposing it,
							and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> silent. The president read several Letters from
							him as Secretary of War, to the <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor of
								Virginia</persRef> in August &amp; September <pb type="ms" n="146"
							/>of the year 1814. warning him to be ready to repel an attack of the
							Enemy upon Norfolk, or Richmond— This was the authority upon which the
							Militia had been called out, and the expenses incurred— I enquired for a
							Law by which they were authorised, but was referred only to that of 10.
							April 1812. which gave no such authority— It was observed that the claim
							for payment of the militia had already been allowed and paid; but I
							observed the authority for the expenditure was questionable as much upon
							a demand for interest, as for principal— Every precedent and rule for
							the Settlement of Accounts at the War and Treasury Departments was
							against this allowance and its admission would have absorbed about a
							Million of public money at once; besides establishing a precedent which
							would swallow hundreds of Millions in future— There were two cases of
							interest allowed upon payments of this description made by States. They
							were Pennsylvania and New-Jersey; but in both it was in fulfilment of
							express previous engagements— I thought the general rule and established
							practice at the Treasury of not allowing interest wise and just; and if
							it should once be broken in upon in favour of a State, I could discern
							no principle upon which it could be denied to individuals— The rule was
							just because the demand for interest always rested upon grounds distinct
							from that of the debt upon which it was claimed— The right to interest
							was impaired by numberless contingencies, which did not affect the
							principal— It was so considered by all Nations. It had been so
							considered in our Relations, both foreign and Domestic, besides being
							the foundation of the established Treasury rule. And I instanced the
							withholding of interest during the period of the revolutionary War, upon
							British debts recovered in this Country after the War— A Subject which
							had been long in controversy between the two Nations, and was ultimately
							settled by a compromise. Also our own funding system, in which all the
							arrears of Interest had been funded at an interest of 3. per Cent, and
							now constituted the Stock of that denomination, while all the capital of
							the debt had been funded at 6 per Cent interest, though upon one third
							of it the payment of interest was deferred for ten years. Crawford
							denied that the 3. per Cent Stock had been constituted from arrears of
							Interest— He had once at a former meeting made the same denial and I had
							suffered it to pass without reply— I now merely read the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Section of the Act of 4. August 1790.
							making provision for the debt of the United States.— I said if any thing
							was to be done upon this claim of Virginia, by the Executive, I thought
							it should only be to refer it to Congress, and that without any
							recommendation of it— I should prefer <pb type="ms" n="147"/>leaving it
							to the Representation from Virginia to bring it into Congress
							themselves— Crawford said if it was not allowed by the Executive he
							should also prefer leaving it to Congress themselves; for if they should
							make the allowance he was <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> they would
							extend it also to individuals, to which he was not disposed to assent—
							Calhoun and Southard now spoke decidedly against the allowance, and it
							was concluded that the answer should be accordingly— It was remarked
							that Governor Barbour had already brought the subject before the Senate,
							where it had been rejected or strongly discountenanced— Southard said
							this was an additional reason for the Executive to decline making the
							allowance, which Crawford admitted, saying he did not know it had been
							before the Senate— In this discussion, the only ground alledged by
							Calhoun was the established rule, and the dissatisfaction which would be
							given by departing from it— Precedent and Popularity— This is the bent
							of his mind. The primary principles involved in any public question are
							the last that occur to him— What <hi rend="italic">has been done</hi>,
							and what <hi rend="italic">will be said</hi> are the Jachin and Boaz of
							his argument— Crawford talks more, and often of moral obligation; but
							his ethics are neither sound nor deep— He applies his principles with
							obliquity, and in most cases as in this, would have one rule for a
							State, and another for individuals, upon claims in which the ingredient
							of moral obligation was precisely the same. After the decision, Wirt
							said joking, well—if it goes to Congress, Virginia, may whistle for her
							interest— And why should not she, said I, when you make Massachusetts
							whistle for her principal— Because, said Wirt, Massachusetts is the Land
							of Song— As we came away Calhoun and Southard told me, that before I
							came in the discussion had been warm and even angry— Southard said he
							had given offence to Crawford, and Calhoun said he had been afraid he
							should be outvoted— That there had been an argument of their strongest
							man, <persRef ref="johnson-chapman">Chapman Johnson</persRef>, read, in
							favour of the claim, and Crawford very pertinacious for it— After the
							Meeting, I went for half an hour to my Office— Evening at the Theatre.
							The Honey Moon, and High Life below Stairs— The House was well filled;
							partly with Ladies of our Society— <persRef ref="adams-john2">My Son
								John</persRef> and <persRef ref="munroe-columbus">Columbus
								Munroe</persRef> had made it up as a party, and the company was of
							the first respectability— The Comedy was well performed— The farce is a
							picture of other manners than ours, and perhaps of other times in
							England.</p>

							Staughton appears to affect originality if not singularity in the choice
							of his texts— He was upwards of an hour upon the character of Jabez, of
							whom nothing is said in the Bible, except in these two verses— After the

						<p><date>5. V:30—</date> Rose early with a view to industrious writing—
							Found my room occupied by chimney sweepers, and other occupations
							awaiting me for two hours— Missed my time of writing till near
							breakfast, hour, and could not afterwards recover it— <persRef
								ref="little-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>
							came to ask a document for correcting the Press, of the Commercial
							Supplementary document compiled by him for a Report to Congress— Also to
							ask aid to obtain employment of writing in the Land-Office. <persRef
								ref="sullivan-george">G. Sullivan</persRef> brought me a copy of a
							Letter from <persRef ref="eustis-william">W. Eustis</persRef>, when
							Secretary of War, to <persRef ref="king-william">W. King</persRef> in
							July 1812. calling upon him to muster two Regiments of Volunteers; and
							this he states to be the foundation of the allowance in 1820. of pay to
							King for ten Months, as a Major-General of the Militia of Massachusetts,
							in the service of the United States. Sullivan appears to be extremely
							anxious to distinguish this case from that of the remainder of the
							Militia claim of Massachusetts— For as this was paid by order of the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> seven years after
							the transaction occurred, if the President was authorized so to allow,
							was he not alike authorized to sanction the payment of the whole claim?
							He was unable to point out any such distinction. He said his <pb
								type="ms" n="150"/>Colleague <persRef ref="pearce-dutee"
								>Pearce</persRef> had obtained more than a month since copies of
							these papers, he supposed, by information of their existence from King
							himself, or at the suggestion of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

								ref="livermore-arthur">Arthur Livermore</persRef> came to speak of
							the appointment of District Judge in New Hampshire, in the event of
								<persRef ref="sherburne-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sherburne’s</persRef> resignation; and <persRef ref="plumer-william"
								>W. Plumer</persRef> followed soon after— Plumer had declined
							signing a written recommendation of Livermore, but spoke of him as well
							qualified for the Office— Plumer named also <persRef ref="bell-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, the Senator,
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Levi Woodbury</persRef>, the present
							Governor, and <persRef ref="mason-jeremiah">Jeremiah Mason</persRef> of
							Portsmouth as persons who might be recommended, and all well worthy of
							the Station. He spoke too of the Presidential Election—the present
							prospects in New York, the anxious efforts of <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							and his friends, now to obtain the support of mine, for his election to
							the Vice-Presidency— The solicitations of <persRef ref="rogers-thomas"
								>Rogers</persRef> and <persRef ref="hamilton-james3"
								>Hamilton</persRef> in his behalf, and Calhoun’s unfitness for the
							place. The uncertainty whether <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> and his friends wish that he may be supported for
							the Vice-Presidency or not, and the overture from <persRef
								ref="burton-hutchins">Burton</persRef>, of the wish that my friends
							would support <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">Nathanael Macon</persRef>
							for Vice-President. I requested Plumer to converse with <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef>, and with <persRef
								ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seymour</persRef> of Vermont, and consult them as to the expediency
							of ascertaining the dispositions of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Jackson’s friends— <persRef ref="burleigh-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burleigh</persRef>, member from Maine
							was here to make enquiry about an order for the release of a person from
							prison in that State— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burton came with a
								<persRef ref="bradford-unknown">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradford</persRef> and <persRef ref="pendleton-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pendleton</persRef>, both of Virginia—
							While they were here <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Hay</persRef> came in, and they immediately went
							away— Hay spoke of Bradford and Pendleton, as of persons both well known
							to him— And he told me that with regard to the agency before the
							Slave-indemnity Commission he had concluded to give it up altogether— He
							said that in conversing with <persRef ref="roane-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Roane</persRef>, now here, he had
							spoken of young <persRef ref="pleasants-john">Pleasants</persRef> the
							son of <persRef ref="pleasants-james">the Governor of
							Virginia</persRef>, and now Editor of the Constitutional Whig, a
							Newspaper at Richmond, as of an unprincipled man, and in reality no
							friend of mine; and Hay asked me, if I would permit him to communicate
							to Roane, what had passed between Pleasants and me here last Winter— I
							said no— Reminding him that his own knowledge of the whole
							correspondence had arisen from peculiar Circumstances which occurred at
							the time. That however unjustifiable Pleasants’s conduct to me had been,
							he had begun by reposing Confidence in me. He had finished by
							apologising to me for his wrongs, and I could not feel myself justified
							in exposing him— Hay said this was sufficient and he should say nothing
							more to <pb type="ms" n="151"/>Roane, upon the subject. <persRef
								ref="frye-nathnaiel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							was twice here—first to say that he wished to send the Deeds exhibiting
							the titles of <persRef ref="johnson-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Johnson’s</persRef> heirs to the Lands in Georgia, to
								<persRef ref="ringgold-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ringgold</persRef> at Augusta; and secondly to tell me, that
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> had spoken severely against me at table at his
							Lodgings last Saturday, censuring something I had said at the Cabinet
							Meeting the day before— And that <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crowninshield</persRef> was
							present. I told Frye there was certainly a mistake—as there had been no
							disagreement of opinion between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard
							and me at the Cabinet Meeting on Friday, and no misunderstanding between
							us, at any other time— Frye said his authority was <persRef
								ref="parker-daniel">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> D.
								Parker</persRef>, who had his information from <persRef
								ref="dehart-unknown">De Hart</persRef>, a young Jerseyman lodging at
								<persRef ref="wilson-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Wilson’s</persRef>, and who was at the table— <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt</persRef> was at my house, and afterwards
							at the Office. He wanted information concerning my Mission in Russia,
							and is going next Friday for New-York— At the Office <persRef
								ref="savage-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage</persRef>
							repeated his solicitation for the appointment of Consul General at
							Guatimala, with a temporary Salary— I again dissuaded him from expecting
							it, and told him I would give him a definitive answer from the President
							to-morrow. At the President’s— I had received a note from <persRef
								ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silvestre
								Rebello</persRef>, announcing himself as Charge d’Affaires from his
							Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, and asking an interview in that capacity—
							Enclosing at the same time, a Letter to me from the <persRef
								ref="carvelho-luis">Brazilian Secretary of State for Foreign
								Affairs</persRef>. The Empire of Brazil has not yet been recognized,
							and the question is whether it shall now be recognized by the reception
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello. The President directed a
							Cabinet Meeting to be called at one to-morrow. I suggested also to the
							President of appointing <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, upon a special
							mission to Great-Britain, to be joined in the Negotiations now confided
							to <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> alone, and with a Commission to take the place of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush on his return home—which he has
							announced his intention of effecting the next autumn— The President said
							that he did not expect any thing would be effected by the present
							Negotiations of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush upon any one point;
							not even upon the Slave-trade— That his intention had been to leave the
							appointment of the successor to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush in
							the English Mission to his own Successor— I said that probably before
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s return some decided opinion
							might be formed as to who would be the successor to the Presidency, and
							the appointment might be made with his concurrence— That my own wish
							would be in favour of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and partly
							to relieve him from an aukward situation in which he had been placed,
							doubtless with his own consent, but with no present appearance of
							success by his Caucus nomination for the Vice-Presidency— I considered
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, by his Talents, and his
							services peculiarly fitted for, and entitled to the Mission to
							Great-Britain, and I should be sorry to see him entirely discarded from
							the service of this Country— The President said he was confident no
							person other than a native of the United States would be chosen
							Vice-President, <pb type="ms" n="152"/>nor would the People of this
							Union ever forget M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s having
							quitted the Treasury Department at its utmost need in 1813. But he
							concurred entirely with me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							was eminently fitted for the Mission to Great Britain, and wished with
							me that he might receive no mark of disrespect from the Nation— Of the
							proposal to appoint him the successor to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush, he would consider further— I dined with Sullivan, and a small
								party—Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs. </hi><persRef

							Presidential canvasser for <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="johnson-george">George Johnson</persRef> came to tell me the
							state of affairs concerning the Mill— Their actual condition is no
							better than heretofore, but their prospects are a little improved— Still
							extremely precarious. At one, I attended the Cabinet Meeting. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
								>Southard</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>
							were present— The question was presented by the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, whether <persRef
								ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silvestre
								Rebello</persRef> should be received as Chargè d’Affaires from His
							Majesty the <persRef ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of Brazil</persRef>, and the
							Independence of that Country be thereby acknowledged— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt questioned the expediency of this
							measure, principally on the ground that the revolutionary Government
							established there was monarchical, and not Republican. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun was warmly in favour of the
							recognition; distinguishing between the question of Independence, and
							that of internal Government. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt thought
							that an immediate recognition of the Brazilian Empire, would be
							represented as favouring the views of the Holy Alliance, and a
							partiality for Monarchies—and alluded to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson’s</persRef> refusal of the Mission to Mexico, when
								<persRef ref="iturbide-augustin">Yturbide</persRef> was Emperor, and
							to the publication of his Letter assigning as his reason for the refusal
							that he would give no countenance to that Usurpation— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun said that the established policy
							of this Country in relation to South-America, had been to look only to
							the question of Independence, and invariably to recognize the
							Governments defacto. That we had thus recognized the imperial Government
							of Yturbide, and received a minister from him. That to decline the
							recognition of the Empire of Brazil, because it was monarchical would be
							a departure from the policy hitherto observed, and would introduce a new
							principle of interference in the internal Government of foreign Nations—
							That the acknowledgment of the <pb type="ms" n="153"/>Independence of
							Brazil was highly important, our trade thither being already very
							considerable, and promising to be more valuable than with all the rest
							of South-America— The President observed that the recognition of Brazil,
							as an Empire, would lessen the offensiveness to the Holy Alliance, of
							all the acknowledgments, as it would shew that we did not make a
							difference, with regard to the forms of Government. I said there were
							reasons for the recognition of Brazil, yet stronger than those which had
							operated in the case of Spanish America, in as much as the <persRef
								ref="john-vi">King of Portugal</persRef> himself while he resided in
							Brazil had proclaimed it an Independent kingdom, and abolished the
							Colonial system of Government altogether— But of the revolutionary
							changes since the return of the old king to Portugal, we had not been
							authentically notified— I proposed therefore, that I should be
							authorised to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello, and call upon
							him for a statement of facts, authenticated by Documents, shewing the
							independent condition of Brazil de facto; and that the recognition
							should be founded thereon— Which was accordingly determined— The
							President then said he had been strongly urged to send a Message to
							Congress, referring to them the claim of Virginia for the payment of
							interest which had been declined as an allowance by Executive authority;
							and he read the draft which he had prepared of such a message— Some
							slight alteration of one of the paragraphs was proposed, but no
							objection was made to the sending of the Message itself. The President
							further intimated his intention of nominating <persRef
								ref="watts-beaufort">B. Watts</persRef> of South-Carolina, as
							Secretary of Legation to Colombia, and sending <persRef
								ref="mann-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, as special agent to Guatimala: and he mentioned that he
							had at length nominated <persRef ref="bates-barnabas">B. Bates</persRef>
							for re-appointment as Collector of the port of Bristol, Rhode-Island—
							There was heavy rain, the greater part of this day, and the weather
							cleared off with a Gale this Evening. <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams’s</persRef> party was in consequence very thinly attended—
							About 70 persons— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello came with
								<persRef ref="torrens-jose">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Torrens</persRef>, and I desired him to call at two to-morrow at the

							had said any thing hostile to me in his presence last Saturday. He said
							no— He might have said something by way of joke; but was as friendly to

							to exasperate Crawford against him, and that <persRef
								ref="miller-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Miller</persRef> had charged him with unfair and ungenerous conduct
							to Crawford in his illness; altogether without cause— Southard spoke

							Appropriation Bill; which had by mistake been given over to <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">M’Lane</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of
							Ways and Means of the House; who had asked Lloyd, whether he might read

							returned it to Southard. He said they were for making a dead set at him,
							but would get nothing by it. M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams was

								Mello</persRef>, Minister of Foreign Affairs to the <persRef
								ref="john-vi">Emperor of Brazil</persRef>, announcing him in the

							authenticated and official documents announcing the changes in their
							Governments; but none such had been received from the Brazilian
							Government— I invited him therefore to send me a written statement of
							the facts, accompanied by document vouchers, with translations, as it
							was probable they would all be communicated to Congress and to the
							Public. <pb type="ms" n="155"/>He said he would prepare and send me such
							an exposition of facts; and accompanied by the documents— That the
								<persRef ref="pedro-iv">king of Portugal</persRef> himself had in
							the year 1817 (it was in 1815) proclaimed Brazil an Independent Kingdom,
							and as such it had been recognized by the European Powers.— That after
							his return to Portugal, the Brazilian Nation had exercised its own
							right, and had constituted itself an Empire— This was a mere word— It
							implied an extensive territory, which could not be applicable to
							Portugal; but was eminently so to Brazil— Its meaning however was only
							that Brazil was an independent Nation— And its Government was in
							principle Republican— The Emperor himself, being more inclined to
							Republicanism than the People of the Country. That the Documents were
							all public, and if the Government of the United States had not received
							them it was the fault of their Agent, in omitting to forward them— I
							said we were possessed of the documents; but it was necessary that we
							should have them officially authenticated— He said he would send
							translations, but enquired if it was not matter of right for him to make
							his communications in his own language— I answered certainly; but that
							we had no person here sufficiently versed in the Portuguese language to
							make the translations so correctly as I should wish to have them, of
							these papers— And I remarked that all the Portuguese public Agents in
							this Country hitherto had written in English or in French— He said he
							would make me the communication as soon as possible and took leave—

							General called this morning at my house; and enquired, if I had heard
							lately from <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript"

							New-Orleans; but the applications for the place were so numerous, and it
							was so unpleasant to select between them, that he wished M<hi

								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean a Letter from <persRef

							the U.S. District Attorney at Providence, Rhode-Island, recommending the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage</persRef> called for his

								>President</persRef> I was not able to give him, this day— I called
							at the President’s with the Note received from <persRef
								ref="addington-henry">Addington</persRef>, complaining of the

							Savage, as Consul at any Port in Guatimala— I told him the substance of
							the Conversation I had had with <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello</persRef>, and observed that
							in the Event of his recognition and reception, it would be necessary to
							nominate <persRef ref="raguet-condy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Raguet</persRef>, or some other person, as Charge d’Affaires at Rio
							de Janeiro, as the informal agency of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Raguet would become afterwards questionable in a Constitutional point of
							view— The President thought the appointment of a Charge d’Affaires to
							Brazil, might still be postponed, and asked if the nomination of Raguet
							would be supported by the Senators from Pennsylvania— I proposed to
							enquire of them, and said I had no reason to doubt of it; unless perhaps
								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowry</persRef> should object to Raguet for some taint of
							federalism. This led the President to speak of <pb type="ms" n="159"
							/>Lowry’s late publication in the American Sentinel of Philadelphia,
							recently republished in the National Intelligencer. (See ante. 27.
								Feb<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi>) On the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of March Lowry wrote a second Letter to the President,
							stating explicitly that he P.U.S. had read to him and <persRef
								ref="findlay-william">Findlay</persRef>, a Letter from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> to him, recommending to him to form his Cabinet of
							distinguished individuals of both the great political parties— Then
							adverting to the recent denials in the Newspapers, which he says have
							given rise to imputations upon his character, and to reproachful Letters
							from persons, whose confidence he had heretofore enjoyed— Lowry
							therefore demands of the President that he would publish Jackson’s
							Letter to him— Some days after this, <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">A.
								Stevenson</persRef> called upon the President at Lowry’s request,
							and asked if he had received Lowry’s Letter of 15. March, and if an
							answer to it might be expected. The President told Stevenson that he had
							received that, and a preceding Letter from Lowry— That the first of them
							was in an adversary attitude, announcing himself to be in possession of
							a Letter, written by him the President, and that he had not determined
							what to do with it— He had received this Letter, under a blank cover
							from Richmond; but it had come from a person who had no right to it, and
							there was a breach of trust or dishonesty somewhere in the process of
							its coming to his possession— The second Letter did not alter the
							attitude, and while that continued, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lowrie must take his own course— After this Stevenson called again upon
							the President, and declared on Lowry’s part, that he had not in writing
							the first Letter the most distant intention of menacing, or assuming a
							hostile position; and requesting to withdraw that Letter; but the
							President declined returning it— Lowry then, on the first of this Month
							wrote to the Editors of the Sentinel at Philadelphia, requesting them to
							publish his Letter to the President of 15. March, preceded, by an
							Article from the Democratic Press of 20. Jan<hi rend="superscript"
								>y.</hi> introducing <persRef ref="kremer-george">Kremer’s</persRef>
							Letter of 17. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>—and by an Article from
							the Franklin Gazette of 30. January, declaring an explicit denial of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Findlay that the President had ever
							read to him, such a Letter from Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Jackson— In his Letter to the Editors of the Sentinel, Lowry says he
							hopes no after event will compel him to publish the incontrovertible
							evidence that he possesses; meaning doubtless thereby his surreptitious
							prize, the President’s answer to Jackson— The President said that he
							supposed General Jackson would some day publish his Letter; but would
							chuse his own time for it— Throughout the whole transaction, the
							President said he saw nothing to regret, excepting the misplaced
							confidence that he had bestowed, by alluding to the contents of
							Jackson’s Letter, to persons who had proved unworthy of the trust— But
							he said he was confident he had not read <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
							Letter of Jackson’s to Lowry and Findlay— And Findlay’s recollection
							concurred with his— Findlay himself had declared to him; that he, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had never read to him and Lowry;
							any Letter from Jackson, whatsoever— <pb type="ms" n="160"/>The
							President then adverted to another subject of which he had never before
							spoken to me; but which for years has given him trouble. On the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1817. there was appropriated
							20000 dollars, and on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of April
							1818. 30000 dollars, for furnishing the President’s house; to be
							expended under his direction. He charged <persRef ref="lane-samuel"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane</persRef>, Commissioner
							of the Public Buildings chiefly with it. Lane died about a year and a
							half ago, a defaulter for several thousand dollars, and rumours have
							since been in obscure circulation, that the President himself had used
							large sums of the money and thereby occasioned the defalcation— At the
							last Session of Congress <persRef ref="cocke-john">John Cocke</persRef>,
							Member of the House from Tennessee, instituted in the House an enquiry
							concerning the state of Lane’s Accounts after his decease; and finding
							upon examination indications that the President had received a part of
							the money, sent him a message to enquire if he would appear before the
							Committee, to answer interrogatories, or give explanations concerning
							these expenditures— He desired the person who brought him the Message to
							tell Cocke that he was a scoundrel, and that that was the only answer he
							would give him— Cocke had then intended to make a Report, but the
							Committee which had been raised at his instance would not agree to it—
							At the present Session of Congress Cocke had again raised a Committee on
							the subject, and is pushing the investigation to a Report— In the
							meantime charges have been raised against Cocke himself, of having
							embezzled monies received by him as an agent for certain Pensioners. He
							has been attacked about it, in the Washington Republican; and the attack
							upon the President in last Tuesday’s Gazette was by way of retaliation,
							and written by <persRef ref="colvin-john">Colvin</persRef>. It was for
							this paper, that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford withdrew from
							the Gazette the Patronage of the Treasury Department; upon the
							admonition as <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> told <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="catlett-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Catlet</persRef> of Alexandria,—a warm friend both of the President,
							and of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— The President now read
							me the draft of a Message, prepared to send in to Congress, requesting
							the appointment of a Committee to investigate his Accounts, and his
							management of public monies entrusted to him during the whole time that
							he has been in the public Service—since his first Mission to France in
							1794. And with this he put into my hands two Memoirs, one upon his
							claims for further allowances, upon his Missions to Europe, and the
							other upon his transactions with Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane
							respecting the two Appropriations for furnishing the President’s house.
							He spoke of his forbearance to dismiss Colvin from the Department of
							State;—of Colvin’s treachery to <persRef ref="smith-robert">Robert
								Smith</persRef>, who had placed him in the Department— Said Colvin
							had afterwards offered to write for him in the Newspapers, which he had
							declined. He had always kept him <pb type="ms" n="161"/>employed on
							service not confidential— When <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s</persRef> Administration
							drew to a close, and he M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe was before
							the Nation as a Candidate for the Presidency, Colvin wrote in the
							newspapers against him; and after the election in his favour— I told the
							President that Colvin had treated me much in the same manner— At first
							with flattery that I had nauseated; then by neglect of duty, and
							groveling vices, till I had been compelled to dismiss him from Office;
							and by lampooning me from that day to this in the City Gazette. He had
							rung all the possible charges of falsehood against me, from the barest
							lie to the most insidious misrepresentations. But he could alledge at
							least against me that I had taken from him his place, which was his
							bread— For his baseness to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe he had
							no provocation. On returning to the Office I found <persRef

								ref="adams-john2">Son John</persRef> at <persRef key="clay-henry"

						<p><date>11. VII:15.</date> Heard at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi

								<persRef ref="finlay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Finlay</persRef> of Baltimore; from Philippians 1.9.10. “And this I
							pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all
							judgment;—That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be
							sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.” and this afternoon
							from Ezekiel 33.11. “Say unto them, As I live saith the Lord God, I have
							no pleasure in the Death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from
							his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for, why will ye
							die, O house of Israel?” This preacher has great volubility, and great
							vehemence— He will therefore pass for eloquent; but the substance of his
							discourses is common place. In the evening, I attended at <persRef
								ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little’s</persRef>. He preached from 1. Corin: 1.22. and two
							following verses—“For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after
							wisdom: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block,
							and unto the Greeks foolishness; But unto them which are called, both
							Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” The
							comment on the text was mingled with the usual dose of the Unitarian
							doctrines— After returning home, I wrote, journalizing for a couple of
							hours.— <persRef ref="sullivan-george">G. Sullivan</persRef> came this
							day and mentioned to me, that he had received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">Governor Eustis</persRef>, who he said would
							not listen at-all to his resignation of the Agency for the claim, but
							insisted upon his retaining it. He manifests however no disposition to
							give up or recall <persRef ref="pearce-unknown">Peirce</persRef>; and I
							told Sullivan that if Peirce’s intention was such as he apprehended I
							thought <pb type="ms" n="162"/>he ought to insist either upon Peirce’s
							recall, or upon resigning himself, or upon Peirce’s being instructed by
							the Governor to desist from his intention of opposing before the
							Committee the course of Sullivan’s argument to them— I observed that I
							had not seen his recent Correspondence with Peirce; upon which he went
							home, and brought it over. It was different from what I had expected—
							Evasive on the part of Peirce; and rather complaining that documents
							unnecessary had been improperly transmitted to Congress, than avowing
							the intention of exhibiting others. Sullivan insists that Peirce is
							acting entirely under the influence and dictation of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>; and that <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">Fuller</persRef> is also governed by him. I
							urged strongly upon Sullivan the necessity of having the Message on the
							Claim referred to a Committee of the House, and of obtaining a
							favourable Report upon it at this Session. He said he would take this
							into Consideration; but he is averse to having it committed at-all, at
							this Session— I read this day the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> Memoir upon the transactions relating to the
							appropriations for furnishing the President’s House. It enters into
							details of a very humiliating character, and which ought never to have
							been or to be required of him.— The principal difficulty appears to have
							sprung from his having used his own furniture, until that provided for
							by the Appropriations could be procured, and having received for it 6000
							dollars to be repaid, upon the redelivery of his furniture to him— This
							produced an intermingling of Lane’s public and private accounts with
							him, which by Lane’s sickness and death remained unsettled at his
							decease— There arises from all this an exposure of domestic and
							household concerns, almost as incongruous to the station of a President
							of the United States, as it would be to a blooming virgin, to exhibit
							herself naked before a multitude. The malignity of political opposition
							has no feeling of delicacy— There appears to be nothing really
							censurable in all these transactions, but Lane was an unfortunate
							selection of an Agent, and his final insolvency has produced all these
							aukward consequences.</p>

									>r</hi> Spence</persRef>, a member of the House from Maryland,
							came and introduced a <persRef ref="dennis-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dennis</persRef>— They spoke of this
							Slave-indemnity Commission, and of their adjournment till June:
							enquiring whether the sufferers might expect their indemnity soon— I
							could give them no promising hopes; the purpose of the <persRef
								ref="jackson-george">British Commissioner</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mctavish-john">arbitrator</persRef>; being evidently to
							procrastinate and defeat the object of the Commission. <persRef
								ref="todd-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles S.
								Todd</persRef> recently returned from the Republic of Colombia came;
							having arrived this morning from Charleston South-Carolina. He declined
							accepting the appointment of Secretary of Legation, to <persRef
								ref="anderson-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef>, and soon after his arrival at Bogota, left that
							Country. He was some weeks detained by sickness at Charleston. He speaks
							of the political state of the Country in the Republic of Colombia, as
							very precarious— At the Office <persRef ref="savage-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage</persRef> came, and I told him
							the President would nominate him as Consul at the City of Guatimala— He
							was entering into a long detail of his projects and intentions, and how
							it would affect his personal Affairs; which I interrupted, by telling
							him that his personal affairs were his own, and the Government had
							nothing to do with them— The appointments of the Government were made
							upon public considerations, and it was for every individual to consider
							whether the appointment offered him would suit him or not— He then said
							he would take time to determine whether to accept the appointment or
							not. This man has worn down my Patience, till I had none left— <persRef
								ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef> came to tell me, that
								<persRef ref="pickering-timothy">Timothy Pickering’s</persRef> book
							against <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> in answer to the
								<persRef ref="cunningham-william">Cunningham</persRef> pamphlet, was
							in the Press, and would be immediately published— <persRef
								ref="slacumb-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Slacum</persRef> came for an answer to his solicitation for the
							appointment of Consul at Buenos-Ayres; but the President had not yet
							determined upon it. Wyer came on his daily visit— <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef> called on me this
							Evening, and said <persRef ref="plumer-william">Plumer</persRef> had
							spoken to him of the expediency of applying <pb type="ms" n="164"/>to
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> or some of
							his friends to ascertain whether it would be agreeable to him to be
							supported for the Vice-Presidency, by my friends— That he had casually
							put the question to <persRef ref="isacks-jacob">judge Isacks</persRef>
							of Tennessee, who intimated that it would be pleasing to him; but said
							he would speak with Taylor, of it, again.— I said that since the meeting
							in New-York, the prospect of a powerful effort in that State, to support
							Jackson for the Presidency was so great that I thought it best to let
							the thing take its own course, and make no application to him or his
							friends, with reference to the Vice-Presidency— Taylor said his belief
							was that <persRef ref="tallmadge-james">Tallmadge</persRef> was
							endeavouring to get up a party for Jackson and that the project of the
							Convention at Utica, was formed with that intention. Though <persRef
								ref="marvin-dudley">Marvin</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hayden-moses">Hayden</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="martindale-henry">Martindale</persRef>; he said were of a
							different opinion— I said I had never expected any thing from the
							project of a Convention, and that if the popular voice should not be
							really in Jackson’s favour it would easily be seen by calling Meetings
							to express different opinions— Taylor thinks that the assumption by the
							Albany Caucus of <persRef ref="young-samuel">Young</persRef>, for their
							Candidate as Governor, was the result of a bargain, and that its object
							was to prevent the opposite party from setting up Young in opposition to
								<persRef ref="yates-joseph">Yates</persRef>— And he thought it
							probable, that all this mining and countermining, might ultimately
							compel my friends, to fall in and support Young and Crawford, to keep
							out Jackson— The result of all is that New-York has been and will be
							bargained away. Taylor said that since he had spoken to me at the House,
							he had seen <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>, who had
							told him that <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun’s</persRef> friends wished him to be in the next
							Administration, in a more active situation than that of Vice-President;
							but he himself inclined to the Vice-Presidency—probable for the sake of
							a certainty of not being entirely thrown out of place— And he asked
							Taylor what he thought would be my views, in this respect. Taylor said
							he did not know; but had no reason to suppose that I would remove
							Calhoun from his present Office. <persRef ref="dix-john">Dix</persRef>
							afterwards hinted to Taylor that Calhoun’s friends wished him to be
							Secretary of the Treasury; a place which it was supposed might be
							vacant— I told Taylor the time had certainly not yet come if it ever
							should, for me to think of these arrangements; I had no hesitation in
							saying; that I should have no disposition to <hi rend="italic"
								>remove</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun.— Nor had I any
							reason for concluding that in the Event of my election the Department of
							the Treasury would be vacant. I suppose that the principal object of
							General Brown’s Soundings was to ascertain whether I would dismiss
							Crawford, and appoint Calhoun in his place— On parting from me, Taylor
							concluded—To take no further step at present, but to wait for the
							progress of Events— He says that General Jackson admits that he wrote to
							the President a Letter somewhat resembling that which <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef> asserts that the President read
							to him and <persRef ref="findlay-john">Findlay</persRef>; but that too
							much consequence has been attached to it— And Lowrie, he says feels
							quite easy since his publication.</p>

							favour— And after all the question will remain whether Congress can
							expect to gain anything by a change. An establishment which should

								<persRef ref="fuller-timothy">Fuller</persRef> was here to converse

							could not name any day with a certainty of being able herself to attend.
							But observed that as he had obligingly sent me a ticket for his

							should give them— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> called to
							tell me that the Protest at the Metropolis Bank of the Note with my

							supposed to be a political contrivance of <persRef ref="vanness-john"
								>General Van Ness</persRef> the President of the Bank, to injure me.
								<persRef ref="sullivan-george">G. Sullivan</persRef> came in and
							interrupted Wyer’s Story— Sullivan shewed me two Letters, which he had
							received yesterday from <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

							earnestness in behalf of the Massachusetts claim— This is a sudden
							movement of Webster immediately on the ascertainment that <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">W. Eustis</persRef> has been re-elected
							Governor of Massachusetts— The federal party having failed in an
							agonizing effort to recover their ascendency— Sullivan spoke of his own
							desire to be elected a member of the Massachusetts Legislature, and
							seemed to solicit the aid of my influence to accomplish his election.—
							He told me too that <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef>,
							the Chairman of the Military Committee of the House of Representatives
							in Congress to whom the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> Message relating to the claim has been

							upon it, during the present Session— I thought it very important that
							the Report should be made, particularly as there was reason to expect it
							would be favourable— If it should pass over to the next Session there
							was no certainty that the Committee would be the same— An attempt had
							been made already, insidiously instigated by <persRef key="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef> the Speaker, to refer it to the Committee of Claims;
							which would in all probability have reported against it— At the next
							Session he might have it in his power to give it a direction as he
							pleased; which would certainly be against it. We had a further desultory
							Conversation upon political topics, which are now universally involved
							in the Presidential Election. Sullivan’s anticipations are sangwine—
							Mine are not— My great concern is to be prepared to meet with the proper
							temper of mind, the Event, and to comport myself with equanimity under

							the present year— His vineyard near Georgetown increases from year to
							year, but his grapes of the last year did not ripen so well as
							heretofore, and his wine is not so good, as that of last Summer. He is
							obliged to put both sugar and Brandy into all his wines; he says because
							his vines are not yet old enough to produce grapes, with saccharine
							matter and Spirit enough in them, for the preservation of their liquor—
							I advised him to change the names of his wines, and particularly to
							avoid giving them the names of such choice foreign Wines as Tokay and
							Champagne— He planted his first vines in the fall of 1818. and has now
							four acres under cultivation from which he has made the last Season 800
							Gallons of wine, reduced by the failure of part of the vintage to 600
							Gallons. He will call at my house in a few days, and I propose to visit

							for <persRef ref="caldwell-joseph">Joseph Caldwell</persRef>, President
							of the University of North-Carolina, who is going to Europe, to purchase
							a library and apparatus for that Institution— I promised them— I called
							at <persRef ref="newton-thomas">T. Newton’s</persRef> lodgings but he
							was out, and shortly afterwards came to my house— I asked him to
							transfer to <persRef ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lloyd</persRef>, Senator from Massachusetts, my Letter, and the
							documents relating to the duties on rolled and hammered iron, which he
							said he would do— But he thought the removal of the discriminations
							would not be assented to by Congress. I told him the material object for
							me would be to obtain a decision, which would enable me to answer the
							demands of the British Government. At the Office, <persRef
								ref="tracy-albert">Albert H. Tracy</persRef> came and had a
							conversation with me of nearly two hours; chiefly on the prospects of
							the Presidential Election. He said there was a great and powerful party
							getting up, for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>,
							as President in New-York— That it could not possibly succeed, but that
							its probable effect would be to secure the electoral vote of the State
							to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>. He said that the Legislature having retained the
							choice of the electoral ticket to themselves and thereby incurred some
							unpopularity, would be careful <pb type="ms" n="171"/>to chuse a ticket,
							the vote of which would be decisive of the election, and thereby
							endeavour to justify themselves before the People. Tracy has more than
							once expressed to me the opinion that among the people, as well as in
							the Legislature of New-York, the political impulse to action was founded
							upon the doctrine of equivalents— I took to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">Presidents</persRef> a despatch with enclosures,
							received from <persRef ref="anderson-richard">R. C. Anderson</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="todd-charles">C. S. Todd’s</persRef> Accounts— I
							advised him to make the most liberal allowance to him, in consideration
							of his having been displaced by the Mission of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Anderson; of his having now to seek a new employment; and
							because the discretion of the President being exercised upon the
							peculiar circumstances of the case, the allowance would be no basis for
							an inconvenient precedent— The President spoke to me of the appointment
							in Missouri, and was undetermined whether to nominate <persRef
								ref="bates-edward">E. Bates</persRef>, or <persRef
								ref="cook-unknown2">Cook</persRef>. <persRef ref="rector-william"
								>Rector</persRef> has been here this fortnight, but has not yet
							cleared up the charges against him. <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">N.
								Biddle</persRef>, dined with us— And <persRef ref="taylor-john">John
								W. Taylor</persRef>, member from New-York called in the Evening. He
							said that <persRef ref="dix-john">J. A. Dix</persRef> had been with him
							this morning, and assured him that the opinion in circulation that
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>, was desirous of supporting <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> for the Presidency
							was unfounded— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s personal
							dispositions were in favour of me; but that he did not see how he could
							use any influence in my favour— Taylor said he had also had a recent
							conversation with <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>,
							who was decidedly and anxiously now friendly to me; and convinced that
							the movement in favour of Jackson, will if persisted in give the vote of
							the State ultimately to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— He
							spoke also of a <persRef ref="moore-unknown4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Moore</persRef>, who has been several weeks here, and
							for some time was very actively canvassing for General Jackson, and
							endeavouring to spread the opinion that the vote of New-York would be
							for him— But lately he has changed his views, and is now, as he told
							Taylor, convinced that unless I am supported, the vote of New-York must
							go to Crawford. Taylor said Moore’s real object was the promotion of
								<persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">DeWitt Clinton</persRef>, and it was
							to his interest that all Moore’s present movements were directed— That
							he, Taylor had told him it was in vain to set up General Jackson in
							opposition to Crawford in New-York— That he could not succeed, and if
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton and his friends should
							support him, they could only aggravate their own discomfiture, and
							achieve the triumph of Crawford and <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren</persRef>. That General Jackson and his friends ought to know
							this, and should leave no doubt remaining whether he and they were
							willing that he should be supported as Vice-President, by those who
							would vote for me as President— That Moore had since seen and conversed
							with Jackson, and Taylor himself had conversed with <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton</persRef>, the
							other Senator from Tennessee, and the confidential friend of Jackson—
							That the General had declared he had no wish to withdraw from me the
							support of New-York, and Eaton had said, the General’s friends would be
							gratified, if mine should support him for the Vice-Presidency— Moore
							told Taylor also that he meant to <pb type="ms" n="172"/>call upon and
							converse with me— Taylor said Moore’s object would be to ascertain my
							sentiments with regard to Clinton— That <persRef ref="tallmadge-james"
								>Tallmadge</persRef> was endeavouring to get up the party for Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson, under the self-delusion that he
							himself would be nominated at the Convention, to be supported for
							Governor, in opposition to <persRef ref="young-samuel">Young</persRef>—
							I told Taylor that I should speak to him in perfect confidence, and as I
							should to my own heart— But I should certainly not cast away all reserve
							in communicating with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore; I mentioned
							to him the project disclosed to me by a Virginian early in December of a
							Coalition between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton and me; and his intention to see
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton, and propose it to him; on
							the idea of my being chosen President, with Clinton Secretary of State,
							and Calhoun Secretary of the Treasury— I mentioned my having explicitly
							forbidden to let M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton know, if he
							should see him that I had any knowledge of this intention, or to give
							him the most distant idea of countenance to it from me— That I was not
							disposed to sell the skin, before the animal was taken, and while my own
							election was a bare possibility, I should not even deliberate in my own
							mind, much less could I announce to others how my cabinet might be
							composed if I should be chosen. I could say without hesitation to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore, that I felt no personal hostility
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton— I had a high opinion of his
							talents and of his capacity for serving the public in important trusts.
							It was said that the movement now making in New-York, for General
							Jackson was with the purpose and expectation of his appointing M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton, and in the Event of General
							Jackson’s Election, he could make no disposition of the Office, which
							would be more satisfactory to me. For myself I would add, as Evidence of
							my sentiments concerning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton, that I
							had more than once named him to the President, for nomination to
							important Missions abroad— There was no Mission for which I did not
							consider him well qualified; and independent of the deference which with
							regard to all important Offices it was indispensable to shew, for
							prevailing public sentiment, there was not a person in the Union, whose
							aid in the Office that I now hold, would be more acceptable to me than
							that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton. But if I should be
							elected, the support of the State of New-York to my Administration would
							be so vitally necessary to me, that my course must necessarily be shaped
							to that Consideration as combined with the paramount interest, the good
							of the whole— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton’s political
							fortunes and power were so changeful, that he might one day be as sure
							to lose for an Administration of which he should be a member, the
							support of New-York, as the preceding or the following day he might
							obtain it— Taylor fully concurred in all these Sentiments, and said that
							an answer in terms altogether general to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Moore would be most advisable— And that on his return home he could
							himself see and converse either with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clinton, or with <persRef ref="colden-cadwallader">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Colden</persRef> his <pb type="ms"
								n="173"/>confidential friend at New-York; to which I assented.
							Taylor still believes that the Convention project is Tallmadge’s, and
							that it cannot succeed.</p>

						<p><date>18. VII.</date> Easter day. I attended the morning service at the
							Capitol, and heard <persRef ref="brown-obadiah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Obadiah Brown</persRef> the Baptist Clergyman, preach
							from 1. Thessalonians 4:14. “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose

							celebrated by other sects than the Baptists; but the sermon was upon the

								<persRef ref="queen-nicholas">Queen’s</persRef> Hotel, and saw
								<persRef ref="jennings-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jennings</persRef> of Indiana, who is ill in bed, with a rhumatic
							fever— I found <persRef ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript"

							the recommendatory Letters in the case of the last appointment of the
							District Attorney in Indiana; which having been sent to a Committee of

							and are now upon their files; the <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel"
								>Vice-President</persRef> declining to give an order for sending

							the Senate— Jennings wishes for copies of these papers, and I promised
							to write and ask for their return from the Senate. I called at <persRef
								ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Lloyd’s</persRef> lodgings to see him, but he was abroad. In the
							afternoon we attended at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi

							Ezekiel 9.4 “And the Lord said unto him, go through the midst of the
							City, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads
							of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done
							in the midst thereof.” The preacher indulged himself in invectives,

							he said to any individual. Between the Services <persRef

							who were disposed to support me at the ensuing election, but that
							prejudices were entertained there against me on account of the part I
							had taken in the case of <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Burr’s</persRef> expedition and
							trial— Dwight did not know what it referred to— I told him it was
							certainly to the Report and proceedings in the case of <persRef
								ref="smith-john6">John Smith</persRef> of Ohio; the whole history of
							which I related to him— Adding that the prejudices to which he referred,
							were such as it would certainly not be in my power to remove— They must
							have been taken up, at the time of those Events, now sixteen years gone
							by— They were at that Time shared by great numbers of persons; and in
							truth by almost the whole federal party— The Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> spoke to me of <persRef ref="storrs-henry">H.
								Storrs</persRef> one of the members from the State of New-York, a
							fellow lodger with him, and who is now unwell— Storrs has been
							heretofore very unfriendly to me; but Dwight says he is now quite
							otherwise— I asked him how Storrs would be to-morrow?— Yet he is one of
							the ablest men in the house, and a man of pleasant manners and
							conversation— <persRef ref="garnett-robert">R. S. Garnett</persRef>

							and here— He asked my advice, whether to call a meeting of the

							which he might if he pleased give explanations— One was incurring
							unauthorized, and unusual expenditures— The other was the
							misunderstanding between him and <persRef ref="gual-pedro">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual</persRef>, the Minister of
							Foreign Relations in Colombia— And his Deportment subsequent to it—
							These explanations were not required—there was no complaint against him,

								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual, asserting that much injustice
							had been done him by the imputation of his being unfriendly to the
							United States, and otherwise objecting to Todd’s conduct at Bogota. He
							said that as to the expenditures, if they were not approved they might
							be disallowed— That concerning D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual and
							his objections he would be glad after recurring to minutes and documents
							in his possession to have a couple of hours of time to make his
							explanations to me— I appointed to morrow at two O’Clock to see him for

							Addington spoke also of the Tariff Bill’s having passed the House of

							upon rolled and hammered <pb type="ms" n="175"/>iron— I told him
								<persRef ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lloyd</persRef> of Massachusetts had promised to take up the subject
							in the Senate, but I could not say how it would finally be decided. He
							mentioned again the South-Carolina Law, the papers concerning which are
							before the President, and the transactions relating to the admission of
							Consuls in the West-India Colonies— I read to him the correspondence
							between <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, and <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Canning</persRef> on that

							the determinations of his Government concerning it. That we should
							however on our part do nothing with precipitation— We largely discussed
							also the new transient tax imposed by the Legislature of the Island of
							Jamaica; which he contended did not necessarily import discriminating
							charges against our traders to the Island, but admitted that it would
							have against them all the effects of discrimination— <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> called at the Office. <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> came down from
							Rockville. Solitary walk after dinner, and then wrote the remainder of

								ref="lowrie-walter">Walter Lowrie</persRef> a Senator from
							Pennsylvania, publishes in the National Intelligencer this morning a

							which he now says was written by <persRef ref="hay-george">George
								Hay</persRef>— Lowrie answers several questions put him in that

							February; and the anonymous Letter to him, from Richmond, which covered
							the President’s answer to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> Letter— The whole of this transaction belongs to
							the small trade of electioneering—and displays more of the narrow
							prejudices of political rancour than of anything else— It proves to me
							the great impropriety of private interviews between members of Congress
							and the President, in relation to nominations for Office— The tendency
							to misrepresentation, in all statements infected with the venom of
							party; the extreme difficulty even for men in the highest Stations to
							preserve entire propriety of conduct in delicate situations, and the
							malignant aspect which a want of candour and explicitness gives to
							incidents trivial or insignificant of themselves. But a much graver
							affair has this day broken out afresh in the House of Representatives—
							An Address to the House was read from <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">N.

							Minister to Mexico, defensive of himself against a charge contained in a
							Report to the House, made by <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> since Edwards left
							this place, that Edwards had made false Statements against Crawford
							before a Committee of the House at the last Session— Edwards retaliates
							by six direct allegations of official misconduct in Crawford, closing
							with a broad insinuation against him of perjury— This paper came upon
							the house by surprize, and they shewed some titubation as to what they
							should do with it— They finally referred it to a select Committee with
							power to send for persons and papers— Edwards avows himself the author
							of the A. B. papers of last winter, and challenges, a charge against
							himself, of having <pb type="ms" n="176"/>falsely inculpated M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford; admitting that if he has, it is
							a misdemeanor which renders him unworthy of the Office that he holds— In
							this affair Edwards is under great disadvantages by his absence, by the
							want of any person here, daring enough to sustain his cause against the
							brow-beating temper of Crawford’s partizans and by the dastardly Spirit
							of the rest. Crawford will be sustained against demonstration itself—
							But they will only substitute invective against Edwards for
							impeachment.</p>

							measure of the Committee ought to be to send for Edwards, and it is
							certain that no thorough investigation can be made, unless he should be
							here— But as the subject is before the House, in the aspect of
							impeachment, either against Crawford or Edwards, that the Executive
							ought not in any respect to interfere, until called upon by some
							incident in the regular discharge of his duties. And so it was <pb

							the House should discharge its duty to the Nation, without coming to
							some expression of strong censure, upon one or the other of the parties—
							Calhoun said it was politically a question of life and death to them
							both— I observed that I should however not be surprized, if the House
							should endeavour to throw it off, without coming to any decision upon
							it. The President directed that the opinion of the <persRef

							Edwards’s Memorial— I told him I thought it indispensable that Edwards
							should be summoned to attend the Committee; but he doubted whether there
							would be time to send for him without protracting the Session of

							are equally anxious for a speedy decision— A postponement to the next

							spoke of applying to be excused from being of the Committee— It will be
							a troublesome and perilous service.</p>

							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, and also give notice of it to
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard at his house at 10. this Morning— <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> is
							at Baltimore— Perceiving by these Notes that some external influence had
							been operating on the mind of the President since the deliberate
							decision of the day before yesterday; and thinking the course now
							proposed by him ill advised, I went to his House before ten— He had his
							Message all ready to sign, announcing that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had
							ordered N. Edwards to come here and attend the orders of <hi
								rend="italic">the House</hi>— I told him there were two objections
							to this—one a question of his authority to give such an order to
							Edwards— The other that it was a direct interference with the
							Constitutional powers and proceedings of the House— At first he seemed
							inflexibly determined, and although he said he was sure my advice
							proceeded from the purest motives, he insisted that he must abide by the
							conclusions of his <pb type="ms" n="179"/>own judgment, to which I
							assented— He was highly exasperated by the course Edwards has taken in
							this affair, as implicating <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in the suspicion
							of being leagued with him against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford as a Candidate for the Presidency. He was exceedingly galled by
							the gross imputations of this kind thrown out by <persRef
								ref="floyd-john">Floyd</persRef> and <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Forsyth</persRef> in the debates, against him, and seemed to think
							that by sending this Order to Edwards and a Message to the House
							announcing it, before he received any information from the House, that
							they had the subject before them, he should put it out of the power of
							those worthies to repeat any such charges— I observed that such an order
							from him to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards sent by express would
							import expense, both in the sending, and to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Edwards if he obeyed the command; which he would charge to
							the Public. How was this to be paid?— He said he would pay it himself—
							Southard now came in, and upon discussion concurred entirely with me
							against the Message. But suggested that an order might immediately be
							despatched to Edwards, not to proceed on his Mission, but to await the
							orders of the Committee, or the House.— I added that it could not fail,
							but in the course of the day the President would receive from the House
							information that they had ordered the attendance of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, and in the answer to this
							Communication the House might be informed of this previous Executive
							order— The President assented to the immediate despatching of the order,
							and I went to the Office of the Department, wrote the order to Edwards,
							and took it back to the President for his approbation— As I was
							returning I met M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, who said the
							President was still determined to send a Message to the House, and read
							me an amendment which he had drawn to the one proposed by the President,
							to which he asked me, if I could not assent— I said I could not change
							my opinion; but I would acquiesce in the President’s decision— We
							returned to the President’s together— He approved of the order to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards as I had drafted it. As to the
							Message, I told the President, that his earnestness for sending it,
							being upon considerations personal to himself, it was with extreme
							reluctance that I advised him against it— All the proceedings in this
							case were novel, and they led to a developement for the first time of
							many Constitutional principles. Every step taken by the Executive would
							be a precedent for futurity, and I was therefore above all anxious that
							nothing should be done with precipitation. If he persisted in sending
							the Message, as modified by the proposed alteration of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard,—I should say no more against it;
							but if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards should come here, and
							arrive after the close of the Session of Congress, what would he do with
							him? The President said he would institute an enquiry into the whole
							Affair— I asked him where he would find throughout the Union men
							competent to such an enquiry; willing to undertake and perform it; and
							impartial between the parties? This he did not answer— He postponed the
							determination upon the sending the Message; I went back to my Office to
							despatch the Order, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><pb type="ms"
								n="180"/>Southard went over to Georgetown, to consult M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun who was detained at home by
								<persRef ref="calhoun-floride">his wife’s</persRef> confinement— I
							sent two copies of the Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards
							to the <persRef ref="mclean-john">Postmaster General</persRef>, by
								<persRef ref="thruston-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thruston</persRef>, requesting him to forward one of them to
							Edwardsville, and the other in such direction as that it might reach him
							as soon as possible— In about an hour Southard returned from Calhoun’s,
							while he was there with Calhoun, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Calhoun
							had <persRef ref="calhoun-martha">a daughter</persRef> born— Calhoun
							agreed entirely in opinion with Southard and me. <persRef
								ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Hay</persRef>
							soon came in and brought a Communication from the House of
							Representatives to the President, of the minutes of the proceedings of
							the Committee, among which is a vote, ordering the attendance of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards before them. I returned again and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard also to the President’s.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards’s Memorial, as presented to
							the House, with the accompanying documents was there— The Clerk of the
							House having brought them to be taken back to-morrow Morning, and
							printed; for which there is an order of the House— We read the memorial
							through, and the documents specially referred to by numbers— It was
							impossible for me after reading them not to reflect on the bias which
							the bullying temper and management of Crawford’s partizans, unresisted
							by the rest of the House have already given to this affair— The artifice
							of representing Edwards as having fled from his own accusation has been
							used to divert the public attention from the merits of his allegations,
							as yet with entire success. A prodigious stir is made, about catching
							him, and bringing him here, and preventing his escape; all which is to
							excite odium against him as an accuser, and to prepare for a
							whitewashing of Crawford— The truth is that for supporting all the
							allegations of Edwards in his Memorial, his presence is in no wise
							necessary— He refers for proofs to public documents which sustain him to
							the utmost extent, and nothing is necessary to establish them, but to
							recur to the documents themselves. The blindness of the House to this
							affords no favourable augury to the justice or impartiality of the final
							decision. It was past five when we finished the reading of the Memorial,
							and the President directed us to attend again to-morrow at ten O’Clock;
							when he intends to send a Message to the House in answer to theirs— I
							then returned again to my Office, whence I found all the Clerks were
							gone. I made a triplicate copy of the Instruction to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, and sent it under cover to
								<persRef ref="clarke-matthew">Matthew S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Clair Clarke</persRef>, the Clerk of the House of
							Representatives, requesting him to forward it by the Messenger appointed
							to carry to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards the summons of the
							House— I received late this Evening an answer from Clarke saying that
							the order would be forwarded accordingly— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Moore came at 7 O’Clock this Evening according to his appointment. He
							announced himself as the most intimate friend but one to <pb type="ms"
								n="181"/><persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> DeWitt Clinton</persRef> that he had in the world— He
							wished that my friends and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton’s
							friends should harmonize— For the Clintonians would certainly turn the
							scale in New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton was against
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford for President, and wished
							for an honest Man in that office— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clinton’s friends until very lately had thought they could bring him
							forward with prospects of success; but they had now given it up as
							hopeless— That I was very strong in New-York, and the attempt to set up
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> would only terminate in giving the vote to
							Crawford— His wish was that I should be chosen President, and Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson Vice-President— But he wished to
							know what were my Sentiments with regard to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clinton— I told him that whether the People of New-York
							would vote for me or not, I should leave entirely to themselves— That my
							feelings towards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton were altogether
							friendly— I had but a very slight personal acquaintance with him— There
							had been some things in his public career that I had not approved, and
							very probably some in mine that he had disapproved— But I entertained a
							high opinion of his talents, his services, and his public Spirit; and
							was ashamed for my Country at the recent act of the Legislature of
							New-York in removing him from the Office of Canal Commissioner— With
							this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore professed to be entirely
							satisfied, and took leave— <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">T.
								Fuller</persRef>, member from Massachusetts called late in the
							Evening— He asked if I had seen a piece in the New-York Patriot, signed
							Mercury— I had— It asserts that while my friends are boasting of my
							purity and exemption from intrigue, and pretending that I rejected with
							indignation; a proposal from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s
							friends to support me for the Vice-Presidency, I had been guilty of the
							same corruption— For that Fuller more than a year since had stated that
							I had authorised him to offer the Vice-Presidency to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clay</persRef>—
							Fuller was excessively incensed at this paltry electioneering squib, and
							said he would compel the <persRef ref="gardner-charles">publisher of the
								Patriot</persRef> to give up the author of it, or would prosecute
							him for a libel— He said it was not only false, but there never had been
							any thing which could give rise to it— That I had never said one word to
							him about supporting Clay for the Vice-Presidency—nor he to any human
							being. I advised him to be cool. To cause to be published an explicit
							contradiction of the falsehood; and if upon demand, the author would not
							avow himself, that would be enough; but that political prosecutions for
							any thing published in the Newspapers against a public man were in this
							Country desperate remedies— The juries always favoured the slanderer—
							Fuller said this was a charge of <hi rend="italic">corruption</hi>. That
							I said, if he prosecuted would be explained away— It would be said to
							have been used only with reference to my supposed fastidious purity. It
							would be said the fact charged, if true was no Evidence of Corruption.
							That if I had authorised him to propose to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay’s friends to support him for the Vice- Presidency,
							there would have been no corruption in it, and that therefore there was
							no libel in the charge although the matter stated as fact was not true.
							I further said, that although I never had authorized any man to make
							such a proposal to Clay, yet friends of mine, and friends of Clay too
							had often <pb type="ms" n="182"/>suggested it to me as desirable; nor is
							there any thing in it, unconstitutional, illegal or dishonourable. The
							friends of every one of the Candidates have sought to gain strength for
							their favourite by Coalition with the friends of others, and to deny
							very indignantly an imputation of that which is not wrong in itself, is
							giving the adversary the advantage of fastening upon you a consciousness
							of wrong where there is none— Fuller seemed still to think he could get
							the author or publisher of the piece indicted; but I suppose he will not
							attempt it— He told me he should be obliged to go home about the first
							of next Month, and <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abby Adams</persRef>
							proposes to take the opportunity for going home at the same time— He
							said little of the affair of Edwards and Crawford, except to remark the
							efforts of Crawford’s partizans to intimidate and to divert attention
							from the accusation to the accuser.</p>

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>; but that just
							before the question had been taken <persRef ref="dewolf-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D’Wolfe</persRef> had risen and stated
							in his place, two things, of his own knowledge—one, that Bates had given
							for a toast at a 4<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of July dinner—“A
							Statue of gold to <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Aaron Burr</persRef>, for
							having killed <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander
								Hamilton</persRef>.”— The other that when Bates was Postmaster he
							had broken open Letters and taken money from them— Bates said neither of
							these Statements was true. He knew of nothing that could have given rise
							to them— That he had never given a toast at a 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th. </hi>of July dinner in his life— Never a political toast at any
							dinner— Never a toast at a public dinner at any time, except once a
							Masonic toast at a Masonic dinner— He believed several of the Senators
							had voted against him on these Allegations; and he was assured <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus King</persRef>
							had told the President that the toast was what had determined him. Bates
							said he could bear the loss of his place, but not that of his character—
							He had written two days since to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D’Wolfe
							to enquire if he had made those statements, but had received no answer
							from him—and he asked me if there was no remedy for him— I said I
							believed the President had not sent to the Senate a new <pb type="ms"
								n="183"/>nomination, and until that should be done, the Senate might
							reconsider their vote; on the motion of a member of the majority— If any
							member were now satisfied that he had voted upon erroneous impressions,
							I supposed he would be willing and even anxious to do him justice— I
							advised him to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King, and endeavour to
							prevail upon him to make the motion— I was thus detained until near 11.
							when I received a message from the President requiring my attendance at
							his house: and just then old <persRef ref="hatch-israel">Israel
								Hatch</persRef> of Attleborough came and told me he was deputed by
							the towns of Bristol and Warren, to pray that a <persRef
								ref="randall-unknown3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Randall</persRef> should be appointed to this Collector’s Office.— I
							asked him to call again to-morrow Morning, at <unclear>. . .</unclear>.
							I attended at the President’s— Found <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
								>Southard</persRef> there— The President had the draft of a short
							Message prepared, announcing to the House of Representatives that he had
							received their communication of their proceedings on the Memorial of N.
							Edwards, and had already in anticipation Sent him an order not to
							proceed on his Mission, but to await the orders of the House— Two or
							three slight alterations in the draft were made, and it was sent— I then
							observed that it was my opinion, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards
							ought immediately upon receiving the Summons of the House, to resign his
							office as Minister to Mexico, and attend solely to the Affair before the
							House, till that should be entirely cleared up. I wished him to have the
							opportunity of taking this step of his own accord— But if he should not
							I wished the President deliberately to consider the propriety of
							informally giving to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, an
							intimation that the President expects he will resign; and if he does not
							that the President would decide to remove him— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun warmly objected to this, and said that if Edwards
							should resign, it would be universally considered that he was conscious
							of being guilty, and the decision of the house, and of the Nation would
							be against him— I answered that I believed the effect of his resignation
							would be directly the reverse— That the sacrifice of his own interest
							would be the strongest demonstration of his public Spirit. That his
							cause would be decided by the House and by the Nation, upon its own
							merits, and not by his proceedings in relation to his Mission abroad.
							That my principal reason for thinking he ought to resign was because he
							could not discharge the duties of the Office—he could not proceed upon
							the Mission— He was arrested in consequence of his own Acts. I meant not
							to pronounce censure upon those Acts— On the contrary, so far as I knew
							the facts, I should have done precisely the same— But they had put it
							out of his power to proceed upon his Mission, and therefore he ought to
							resign to give the President the power of sending another person in his
							place. Calhoun replied that the final decision upon the questions before
							the House, would depend very much upon the incidents which would occur
							during the investigation— That by resigning Edwards would be universally
							thought to sink under the consciousness of his own wrong. That there was
							no particular occasion of urgency for the immediate departure of a
							Minister to Mexico <pb type="ms" n="184"/>That a year had been suffered
							to elapse between the first appointment to that Mission and the second—
							That at all Events M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards ought to be
							allowed the credit of making his own option to resign— That on his
							arriving here it would immediately be known whether his detention here
							would be long or not— If it should continue over till the next Session
							of Congress it might then be proper for him to resign— If on arriving
							here he could not sustain his charges, he must resign or be removed; if
							he could, there was no reason why he should not afterwards proceed upon
							his Mission— The President said it was his opinion that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards ought immediately on receiving the
							summons of the house to resign. That he would thereby entirely disengage
							himself and the Executive from the imputation of a concert together. He
							would leave the Government free to make another appointment, which ought
							not long to be delayed. The despatching of the mission having already
							postponed more than comported with the public interest— That if he
							should resign, and upon his arrival here, he should be detained upon the
							summons of the house only a short time, and sustain his own character,
							he might be reappointed. But it would be best to leave him to act upon
							his own sense of propriety; and as he must be expected here sooner than
							a Letter could now reach him, and his answer be received, the
							determination whether he should be removed or an intimation should be
							given him, to resign might be deferred. The President said that what
							passed in the Cabinet Meetings on this subject was of the most
							confidential character— To which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							confirmatively assented— Southard said he had at first thought Edwards
							wrong for not having returned here to make his charges, but upon
							examination of the facts, and further reflection he thought otherwise.
							Calhoun said that the statement in <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford’s</persRef> Report, was
							equivalent to a charge of perjury upon Edwards, as it certainly is; and
							made as it was, no man having any regard for his character could have
							endured it, without reply and resentment. But Calhoun thought that if
							Edwards was bound to resign he ought to have done so immediately upon
							receiving notice of Crawford’s Report; but it does not appear whether
							Edwards received the notice before he left the City or after— His
							memorial is dated Wheeling 6. April, and a passage in it seems to
							indicate information which he must have received after leaving the City—
							I said Edwards was under <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> to proceed to
							Mexico, with his view of things he might suspect that this imputation
							upon him was an artifice, for the purpose of compelling him to resign—
							He was not certain that the House would act upon his memorial at-all—
							The first effort of <persRef ref="floyd-john">Floyd</persRef> was to
							have it laid on the table. Edwards’s allegations against Crawford, are
							all incidental to the defence of himself— He makes no formal charge
							against Crawford— Suppose the House should have decided <pb type="ms"
								n="185"/>that they would not act upon the memorial— Edwards would
							have lost his place, and his character would still have stood only upon
							the strength of his own allegations— I cannot therefore disapprove the
							course he then took, but still think he ought to resign upon receiving
							the summons of the House. The Meeting ended about one O’Clock; on
							returning to the Office, I wrote an answer to <persRef
								ref="breck-samuel">S. Breck</persRef>, a member of the House from
							Pennsylvania, concerning an old affair of <persRef
								ref="kingston-stephen">Stephen Kingston’s</persRef>— Walk after

								ref="king-william">William King</persRef> has been tampering these
							two years, has been here during the present Session of Congress, and was
							introduced by King to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— Since his
							return to Salem he has become active in his favour, and it is understood
							that <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> is in concert with
							him— Their great effort will be to obtain the Presidential choice of
							Electors in Massachusetts by Districts, and not by general ticket—hoping
							to gain the votes of two or three Districts for Crawford— <persRef
								ref="garnett-robert">R. S. Garnett</persRef> came in while
							Crowninshield was here, to enquire of the means of sending two copies of
								<persRef ref="lee-henry">H. Lee’s</persRef> Book to England one for
							the <persRef ref="rawdon-francis">Marquis of Hastings</persRef>, and one
							for <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="plumer-william2">W. Plumer jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef> came to enquire if the Commission of <persRef
								ref="cogswell-pearson">Pearson Cogswell</persRef> as Marshal of
							New-Hampshire had been forwarded to him— It has— Plumer spoke of this
							affair of <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef> and Crawford,
							and said the impression was that a majority of the Committee were
							disposed to screen him from this exposure— Among the rest that was
							understood to be the disposition of Webster— And he said Webster’s
							conversation had much of that complexion— He had said yesterday, that
							undoubtedly there had been deposits in the Western Bank, contrary to
							Law, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford stated that they had
							been made upon great advisement, by direction of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and that the omission to
							report them had been a mere inadvertency— Plumer said that <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>, was very desirous of
							having the whole subject referred to the President, which is the very
							worst way in which it could be disposed of. M’Duffie had been with the
							President on the Morning of the day before yesterday, and had alarmed
							him into the sudden determination of sending a Message to the House
							informing them that<hi rend="italic">he </hi>had sent to order Edwards
							to come here, to attend before the House. The President told me that he
							had been advised by M’Duffie, and I told him that M’Duffie’s motive, was
							to throw off the whole subject, from the House upon the President.
							Plumer said he thought there was not a man in the House, who would have
							the spirit to probe the affair to the bottom, and expose it in its true
							colours. The most conclusive evidence of this is that the proof of all
							the allegations of Edwards has been before Congress more than a year,
							and no notice has been taken of it— <persRef ref="maul-william"
								>Maul</persRef> the Ex-Messenger of the Department of State came to
							me again with an exposition of his Wants. <persRef ref="hatch-israel"
								>Israel Hatch</persRef> came again, <pb type="ms" n="186"/>to talk
							on the subject of his Mission; which was to obtain two appointments for
							friends of his—one of Postmaster at Providence, and the other of
							Collector at Bristol Rhode-Island— But he had been this morning with the
							President, and was now despairing of success— He told me also of his own
							mischance in a sentence against him for selling liquors without licence,
							which he attributed to the avidity or malice of <persRef
								ref="morton-unknown3">Ephraim Morton</persRef>, the father of
								<persRef ref="morton-marcus">Marcus Morton</persRef>, now chosen
								Lieuten<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Governor of Massachusetts— The
							father was one of the Collectors of the internal Revenue; and Hatch says
							failed of giving him due notice of the expiration of his licence—
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> was here, and said that
							the denunciation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards was producing very great
							excitement; and the general Sentiment was against Edwards— The secret of
							this lies not deep; nor in one of the fairest regions of human nature—
							Crawford has hold of many hopes and many fears. Edwards has no controul
							over either— One has a tremendous influence over the <hi rend="italic"
								>interests</hi> of his judges, the other has none— At the Office,
								<persRef ref="sullivan-george">G. Sullivan</persRef> came and
							introduced to me a young man by the name of <persRef
								ref="coolidge-thomas">Coolidge</persRef>, a son of <persRef
								ref="coolidge-joseph3">Joseph Coolidge</persRef> of Boston. I took
							to the President’s several despatches received this Morning from
								<persRef ref="nelson-hugh">H. Nelson</persRef>, representations from
							New-York State, relating to the Jurisdiction over Bernhart’s Island in
							the river S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Lawrence; and a new
							remonstrance against the South-Carolina Law, prohibiting coloured people
							from coming into the State— I urged upon the President the necessity of
							doing something in this case— I said I saw nothing that could be done,
							except to lay the subject before Congress, but as a last resource for
							avoiding that appeal, I left the Letter with him to see if <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef> or the South-Carolina Delegation could devise any
							other way of getting rid of that Law— I left also the Letters of
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>, late
							one of the land Commissioners at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Augustine, who resigned and protested against the proceedings of the two
							other Commissioners; apparently with reason. One of Hamilton’s Letters
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, was sent to me some days
							since, to read and return to the Treasury, or to send to the Secretary
							of War, to be laid finally before the Committee of the House on the
							Public Lands.— I read and forwarded it as directed by the President’s
							endorsement; but yesterday M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford sent
							to me for it, to lay before the Committee— Upon enquiry, it was not to
							be found either at the War or Treasury Department and is missing. I told
							the President I thought Hamilton ought to be sent for to attend the
							Committee in person— Solitary walk after dinner— In the Evening, I had a

							Little’s Sermons, much historical comment upon his text, and a full
							proportion of his Unitatian doctrines— I had met <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fuller</persRef>, on going to Church, and he went there with me— After I
							returned home, I began writing, but <persRef ref="sullivan-george">G.

							He talked upon all the topics now in agitation before the Public— Said
							he had a long conversation with the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> yesterday concerning the affair with <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef> and he thinks the position of
							the President a painful one— To extricate him from it, he considers it
							necessary that <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>
							should publish his Letter which led to the controversy; but Jackson, or
							rather <persRef ref="eaton-john">Eaton</persRef> who rules him, and whom
							Sullivan considers as a cold blooded heartless man, will not consent to
							the publication of the Letter; fearing that it will blow up Jackson in
							Pennsylvania, and Sullivan thinks it will— I told him my opinion was
							that when the whole affair should come out, rational men would judge
							that there had been on all sides, and by all the parties, much
							children’s play; but that it would not change five votes in
							Pennsylvania— Sullivan said that a few days since he was walking with
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, and said to him—Well,
							I suppose when the whole of this Lowrie transaction shall be disclosed,
							Jackson will be entirely prostrated in Pennsylvania. Oh! certainly, said
							Forsyth; and when we have done with him, we shall take your friend Adams
							in hand— Upon which Sullivan replied that they would find nothing in me,
							inconsistent with honour and integrity; to which he says Forsyth
							declared his unqualified assent.— This he remarked was in Forsyth
							blowing hot and cold with the same breath— Sullivan is now very anxious
							that my friends in New-England should support <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> for the Vice-Presidency,
							because he says Calhoun earnestly desires it, and because since he
							Sullivan told him that all New-England would vote for Jackson as
							Vice-President, Calhoun has become cold as an Icicle to the
							Massachusetts claim— So that the claim is to purchase the
							Vice-Presidency— To all this I answered nothing. <pb type="ms" n="188"
							/>He said also that Forsyth had complained of the Committee appointed
							upon <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards’s</persRef> Memorial: and
							particularly of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, who he
							said was unfriendly to Crawford— Forsyth knows better, but there is
							policy in giving this out. Of the claim M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sullivan now spoke doubtingly, but he is to meet the Committee on
							Tuesday— He hopes for a favourable Report this Session— As to the
							communication to the Massachusetts Legislature of his Correspondence
							with <persRef ref="eustis-william">Governor Eustis</persRef>, in defence
							of himself against <persRef ref="king-william">W. King</persRef>, he has
							so much cooled down, that I am convinced he has had a hint from the

							written application for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Espy, and a
							recommendation of him, to be filed in the Department, and to be called

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Espy was not a democrat, for he had voted
							for <persRef ref="hiester-joseph">Hiester</persRef>, and lost a place in

								<pb type="ms" n="189"/>a ticklish affair in Pennsylvania, just at

							a man’s politics, whether he voted for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hiester or not. Whether he should receive an appointment however,
							political objections existing against him, must be determined elsewhere;
							and at this time at least that seemed to be a very critical question in

							Officer, who has been many Months here soliciting an appointment; and
							who told me he had at last received one as Military Store keeper at

								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> at the Hotel du Roi,
							Place du Carrousel, Paris in 1783. which was that <persRef
								ref="paxton-charles">Charles Paxton</persRef>, a Custom House

								ref="grenville-george">George Grenville</persRef> or to <persRef
								ref="townsend-charles">Charles Townsend</persRef>, then a young man
							upon his travels, and first suggested to him the project of taxing the

							mentioned this— I had not. He also mentioned to me several particulars
							concerning the family of <persRef ref="barclay-thomas2">Thomas

							At the Office, <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron

							young man from New-York, by the name of <persRef ref="jackson-unknown4"
								>Jackson</persRef> came with recommendations, applying for a

							received this morning from <persRef ref="dearborn-henry">H.

								>Condy Raguet</persRef> at Rio de Janeiro— I found <persRef

							make his decision whether to receive <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello</persRef>, as Charge
							d’Affaires from the Emperor of Brazil or not. The Letter from C. Raguet

							defacto. The President said he would read and send me back Raguet’s
							Letter, and directed me to sent it, and the other papers round to the
							members of the Administration, previous to a Meeting for consideration
							of the question— I spoke also of the permissions to Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dearborn and to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> to come home— The President
							said he wished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush would remain in
							England till the close of the present Administration; for that he felt
							great delicacy about proposing to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> to go to England— I
							said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush might perhaps also have
							his particular views in wishing to return to the United States during
							the present year; and that I hoped there would be no interval between
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s mission, and that of his
							Successor— He said he doubted whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin would accept the appointment to England; and had thoughts of
							writing him a private and confidential Letter to enquire— I advised him
							to take some further time to consider of it— He authorised me to write a

								>Richard M. Johnson</persRef>, Senator from Kentucky, called to
							renew recommendations of a person named <persRef ref="steele-william"
								>Steele</persRef> as Consul at Acapulco in Mexico— He talked also
							upon general politics, and told me as an illustration of the extent to
							which the system of espionage of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford’s</persRef> partizans is now carried, that he had lately
							been to Philadelphia, where he passed two or three days— While there he
							occasionally conversed with persons whom he met on the prospects of the
							Presidential Election— Yesterday <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Van-Buren</persRef> accosted him with—so!—you have been
							electioneering at Philadelphia—and upon being asked what he meant, took
							out a Letter and gave it him to read, folding down the page so that he
							could not see the name of the writer—and this Letter, spoke of and gave
							a false colouring to his Conversations at Philadelphia— Johnson spoke of
							the two controversies now before the Nation, between <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef> and Crawford, and between W.
								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hay-george">G. Hay</persRef>. In the National Intelligencer of
							yesterday there is a Letter to the Editors, in reply to the last
							publication of Lowrie; signed by Hay, and couched in language of extreme
							bitterness and severity. Johnson said he did not know what Lowrie could
							say to it, as he was not a fighting man— But he had looked very blue
							upon it yesterday. As to the affair of Edwards, he said there was no
							doubt on his mind that Crawford had mismanaged the public funds, and
							lost nearly a Million of dollars, to the public, by loose indulgences to
							the Western Banks; but that as to the particular continuance of the
							deposits in the Edwardsville Bank it was very much desired and promoted
							by Edwards himself— At the Office, <persRef ref="catlett-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Catlett</persRef> of Alexandria came
							to speak of drawing Bills upon England to be taken for remittances by
							the Department; and also to repeat with urgency his recommendation of
							young <persRef ref="cottringer-william">Cottringer</persRef> for a
							Clerkship— <persRef ref="addington-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addington</persRef> the British Chargè d’Affaires came twice, and
							brought the second time a certified copy of the Convention for the
							suppression of the Slave-trade signed by <persRef key="rush-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="huskisson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huskisson</persRef> and <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stratford Canning</persRef>, on the
								13<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of March— I received this morning
							a despatch from Rush, dated the 20<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of
							March, a week after the conclusion of the Convention, and alluding to
							it; but not the Convention itself; for which I know not how to account—
							Addington was greatly disappointed on learning that he had not received
							the Convention, and said he was instructed to urge its ratification with
							all possible despatch, so that it might be sent back, in time to be
							communicated to Parliament before the close of their Session. <pb
								type="ms" n="192"/>The copy was brought by the British Packet, which
							came direct to New-York for that purpose. She was to sail in eight days
							for Halifax; but if there was a prospect that the Ratification could be
							despatched hence by the 15<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>he would
							detain the Packet till that time, and send her back direct to England,
							without going to Halifax at-all— He read me several passages from a
							Letter of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. Canning to him; expressing
							earnestness that the ratified Convention might be sent back as soon as
							possible, as the Session of Parliament would be unusually short—
							Addington said he had also received a fresh and very urgent instruction,
							upon our discriminating duties between rolled and hammered iron; of
							which he would call and speak to me to-morrow— It threatens to lay
							heavier duties on our cotton because it is ginn’d; by considering it as
							a manufactured article— I said I thought that would dissolve the whole
							Convention of 1815. I took M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington’s
							copy of the Slave-trade Convention to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, and there read it to him— It varies in very
								<unclear>few</unclear> and quite unimportant particulars from that,
							of which I sent the draft to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, last
							Summer— I took also to the President three Letters received this Morning
							from <persRef ref="english-george">G. B. English</persRef>, who has
							arrived at Boston, returned from Constantinople.— He has not succeeded
							in the object of his Mission, nor done any thing that can be of much use

						<p><date>29. VII.</date><persRef ref="munro-isaac">Isaac Munro</persRef> the
							publisher of the Baltimore Patriot called upon me, going to visit his

									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson’s</persRef>
							conversations with him at Baltimore— <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Hay</persRef> came in while
							Munro was here. Munro said he came yesterday in the Stage with <persRef
								ref="jackson-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> the British Slave indemnity Commissioner, from
							Baltimore. That on the way Jackson borrowed a Newspaper containing G.
							Hay’s Letter against <persRef ref="lowrie-water">Lowrie</persRef>— That
							after he had read it, Munro asked him what he thought Lowrie would say
							to it; upon which Jackson answered—the question is not what he will say;
							but what he will do— Jackson said too that he did not concur with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay, in considering the Letter in Lowrie’s
							possession as the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>
							property. Hay came to tell me that he had been informed that an Article
							in a Paris newspaper contradicting a previous article which had
							mentioned me as likely to be chosen the next President, and asserting
							that <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> would certainly be chosen, with
							censorial comments upon me and <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, was <pb type="ms" n="193"/>written by <persRef
								ref="sheldon-daniel">Daniel Sheldon</persRef>. This Article has been
							republished in most of our newspapers— I mentioned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay my reasons for doubting whether
							Sheldon could be the author of the Article, and my disbelief that he
							was. I thought it compatible neither with Sheldon’s character, nor with
							his former relations with me— I said I should not readily believe it of
							him, and if proved upon him, it would change altogether my opinion of
							him. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Brent</persRef> called, and I gave him directions, for preparing the
							Copy of the Convention to be sent to the Senate— <persRef
								ref="bradley-william2">William C. Bradley</persRef> was here, and
							told me that he had received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="vanness-cornelius">Cornelius P. Van Ness</persRef>, Governor of
							Vermont, mentioning that he had been informed, <persRef
								ref="slade-william">W. Slade</persRef>, now a Clerk in the
							Department of State, had reported that he Van Ness was a partizan of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s for the Presidency— He was
							apprehensive that Slade might take occasion to impress the same upon me—
							He had therefore desired Bradley to see me and satisfy me that it was
							otherwise— Bradley said he had the most perfect reliance upon Van Ness—
							I told him that not a word upon political subjects had passed between
							Slade and me since he has been in the Department. That I had not heard
							from any one during that time, a doubt uttered with regard to Governor
							Van Ness’s dispositions— That earlier, I had heard he was favourable to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, and knowing that his
							brothers, the <persRef ref="vanness-william">judge at
							New-York</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="vanness-john"
								>General</persRef> here were Crawford men, I had supposed that the
							Governor agreed with them, until he Bradley had assured me of the
							contrary— Bradley said that having been placed in relations of the
							closest intimacy with him, and having observed for some time his caution
							in abstaining from the expression of his opinions on this subject; he
							had taken occasion more than a year since to write to him, enquiring
							into his views and had received from him a full and satisfactory answer—
							It assigned for the reason of his previous reserve that he had thought
							it useless and perhaps unwise to take a stand prematurely, upon a
							subject so peculiarly liable to be affected by the course of Events; but
							that his mind was made up very decisively, and that under the
							circumstances of the case he thought New-England could support no other
							Candidate before the Nation than her own, without degrading herself and
							her relative situation in it— Bradley spoke also of the prospects of the
							Presidential Election, and said he had some concern with regard to
							New-Hampshire— He distrusted <persRef ref="bartlett-ichabod"
								>Bartlett</persRef>, and had some apprehensions of the <persRef
								ref="bell-samuel">Senator Bell</persRef>, who he said was living
							with bad associates—<persRef ref="holmes-john">Holmes</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="chandler-john">Chandler</persRef> of Maine and
								<persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">Dickerson</persRef>— He had
							entertained suspicions of a plot in Ohio; which was that of getting up
							an Electoral ticket, with <persRef ref="harrison-william">W. H.
								Harrison</persRef> at its head; ostensibly for <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>; but really to vote for Crawford— He
							was now satisfied however that it was only a self-delusion of <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and Crawford’s friends here. The
							Ohio delegation here, to a man were for Clay, and <persRef
								ref="mcarthur-duncan">M’Arthur</persRef> had a leaning towards
							Crawford; but all the rest, if Clay be out of the question will go
							right. As to the <pb type="ms" n="194"/>affair of <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef>, Bradley said the friends of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford were taken perfectly by
							surprize, and in their agitation and confusion had pursued a course
							which they already regretted— When the memorial was read his first
							impulse was and he had communicated it to his neighbours, to let the
							Crawford men take their own course with it— <persRef ref="floyd-john"
								>Floyd’s</persRef> first attempt was to lay it on the table— That
							failing, his next movement was to get possession of it, by moving the
							reference of it to a Committee of which he would of course be Chairman—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><persRef ref="abbot-joel"
								>Abbot</persRef> was much against referring it to a Committee saying
							it had been referred to two Committees already— The Committee would be
							much embarrassed about making up their report; and it is apprehended
							that Edwards, a man of great resources, has many other things, which if
							hard pushed he will bring out— While Bradley was with me, <persRef
								ref="adlum-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adlum</persRef> came
							in, but I requested him to call in three or four days again— <persRef
								ref="knight-nehemiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knight</persRef>, a Senator from Rhode-Island, came and introduced a

								ref="plumer-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer</persRef>
							from Pennsylvania, came for papers—Herkimer for a Letter in German
							concerning a Wurtemberger named <persRef ref="meyer-unknown2"
								>Meyer</persRef>, which he had left with me, and which now could not
							be found— <persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Dwight</persRef> of Massachusetts came to look up documents relating
							to the <persRef ref="beaumarchais-pierre">Beaumarchais</persRef> claim,
							which is to be discussed in the House to-morrow, and <persRef
								ref="breck-samuel">S. Breck</persRef>, for certain Bills of
							Exchange, drawn by a dutch Consul in Barbary upon the Department of
							foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, and protested— The interposition of
							the Government for the American owner of the Bill is desired— I received
							the Convention for the Suppression of the Slave-trade, signed the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of last Month at London, with a despatch
							from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, giving an account of
							the Negotiation, and copies of the Protocols, and of the Counter projet
							presented by the British Plenipotentiaries.— I took them over to the
							Presidents, read to him the Letter, and left with him the Protocols, and
							the Counterproject. The Convention as concluded differs only in a very
							few unimportant particulars from the Draft which I sent to R. Rush last
							June— <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George Canning</persRef> in his Speech to Parliament on the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of March represented it, as a mutual
							concession of the Right of Search— This being republished in our
							Newspapers, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Hay came to the Office
							this morning to enquire if it could possibly be so— I told him it was so
							understood and represented by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning;
							but it was a right of search only as incidental to a right of capture
							for Piracy; a right which is necessarily involved in the right of
							capture for Piracy by the Law of Nations. The President asked me to
							draft a Message to send to the Senate with the Convention; and said he
							would send it in to-morrow— I took also to the President’s a new
							application from <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silvestre Rebello</persRef> to be
							received <pb type="ms" n="195"/>as Charge d’Affaires from the <persRef

							long Letter of 8 and 12 March from <persRef ref="raguet-condy">C.
								Raguet</persRef>, exhibiting a precarious and doubtful condition of
							things at Rio de Janeiro, particularly the prospect of a blockade of
							Pernambuco, with a French naval force the Commander of which furnishes
							aid to the Emperor of Brazil under the title of His Royal Highness the
							Prince of Brazil— The President directed me to send round these papers
							to the members of the Administration, and to call a meeting at his
							house, the day after to-morrow at noon— After returning to the Office I
							drew up the Message to be sent to the Senate with the Convention—
								<persRef ref="call-richard">General Call</persRef> came and made
							some enquiries concerning the appointment of a Land Commissioner at S<hi

							likewise concerning the charges against <persRef ref="steele-william">W.

							that Steele had sent on his defence, and his Enemies additional
							charges—all of which were before the President— But that Steele would
							not be now removed; it being ascertained that at least all the worst
							part of the accusations against him were malicious— Call declared
							himself as much surprized as I was at the Construction given to the

							terminated the crowd of visitors diminishes— My time is yet absorbed in

							with public affairs. It is with the utmost difficulty that I keep along
							in my Diary with the current of Events, and it engrosses all my
