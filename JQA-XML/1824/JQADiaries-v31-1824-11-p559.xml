								ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Sam<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> L.
								Southard</persRef> and J. Q. Adams— Subject of Consideration the
							Slave-trade Convention with G.B. I read the despatches N. 11. and 12. of
							the separate series from <persRef ref="rush-richard">R.
							Rush</persRef>—and my drafts of a public, and of a Secret and
							confidential despatch to him— Also a note from <persRef
								ref="addington-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addington</persRef>, the British Chargé d’Affaires, announcing his
							receipt of a full Power to conclude a new Convention, with the single
							addition of the words “of America” to that sanctioned by the Senate— The
							opinion was unanimous against acceding to the proposal for concluding a
							new Convention; at least for the present— Both my drafts were
							unanimously approved; the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, objecting slightly to the word
							“unseemliness”—and suggesting the use of <hi rend="italic"
								>impropriety</hi>, in its stead— I altered the draft
							accordingly—having used the term unseemliness, only with reference to
							its having been used by <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> himself, though
							afterwards withdrawn. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford told twice
							over the Story of <persRef ref="washington-george">President
								Washington’s</persRef> having at an early period of his
							Administration gone to the Senate, with a project of a Treaty to be
							negotiated, and been present at their deliberations upon it— They
							debated it, and proposed Alterations, so that when Washington left the
							Senate chamber, he said he would be damned if he ever went there again.
							And ever since that time, Treaties have been negotiated by the
							Executive, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> submitting them to the
							consideration of the Senate— The President said he had <unclear>. .
								.</unclear> in to the Senate about eighteen months after the first
							organization of the pre<unclear>. . .</unclear> Government; and then
							heard that something like this had occurred— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford <unclear>. . .</unclear> repeated the Story;
							varying the words so as to say that Washington <hi rend="italic"
								>swore</hi> he would never go to the Senate again— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun, both expressed them<unclear>. . .</unclear>
							strongly upon the absurdity of Canning’s two official notes the second
							of which reta<unclear>. . .</unclear> the argument, while it retracts as
							erroneous the allegation of facts upon which it <unclear>. . .</unclear>
							maintained in the first. Calhoun noticed the tone of both the original
							and substitut<unclear>. . .</unclear> Note of Canning, as offensive— In
							the original note, there were three gross blund<unclear>. . .</unclear>
							one of them remains in the substitute, besides the absurdity of an
							argument reta<unclear>. . .</unclear> the facts upon which it was
							founded withdrawn. Rush says, Canning had been ill <unclear>. .
								.</unclear> fever, and Southard observed he had not recovered from
							it when he wrote the Not<unclear>. . .</unclear> M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford now for the first time spoke against the concession
							of the right of sea<unclear>. . .</unclear><pb type="ms" n="560"/>said
							the very proposal of it was an insult, because it implied an admission
							that we were not competent, or not trustworthy to execute our own Laws—
							This reasoning is not sound, in its application to the Slave trade
							Convention— The object is to capture <hi rend="italic">Pirates</hi>—and
							without any distrust of our own Executive Officers, we may give our aid,
							and accept that of another for the more effectual execution of a Law
							common to both— But the remarkable fact in this case is the change of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s opinion— When I stood
							almost alone in resisting the concession of the right of Search, even
							before we had required as an indispensable preliminary, that Britain
							should make the Slave-trade piracy, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, with two successive Committees of the House of
							Representatives, was bearing down my resistance, and his partizans were
							using it, as evidence that I was a friend to the Slave-trade— And now,
							that his supporters in the Senate have taken ground against yielding the
							right of Search, even for Pirates, he joins in the cry with them, and
							discovers that the very proposal is an insult— To the argument in
							Addington’s note, urging that Great Britain upon the faith of our
							ratifying the Convention, had at our requisition passed an Act,
							declaring the Slave-trade piracy, he said they might if they pleased
							repeal their Act— This is true; but it is not of itself a sufficient
							answer to their argument— I must have stronger ground— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford enquired of the proceedings upon
							the Convention in Senate; and said <hi rend="italic">he had not seen
								them</hi>— It was observed that all the amendments adopted in the
							Senate, were moved by <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah S. Johnston</persRef>, a member
							from Louisiana— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun particularly
							noticed in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning’s notes a menace, that
							the British Government would henceforth negotiate with us nowhere, but
							at Washington— I said I supposed he would limit the expression of the
							Sentiment to this <unclear>. . .</unclear>cular negotiation; otherwise
							it would give us the material advantage of always treating <unclear>. .
								.</unclear>me— Calhoun said that might be the result; but the threat
							would not be the less offensive <unclear>. . .</unclear> This was the
							first Cabinet Meeting at which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							had attended since last April. <unclear>. . .</unclear> articulation is
							yet much affected, and his eye-sight impaired— But his understanding
							remains <unclear>. . .</unclear>cept with some deficiencies of memory,
							and ignorance of very notorious facts—probably because <unclear>. .
								.</unclear> was many months unable to read with his own eyes— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s advice to send a Frigate <unclear>.
								. .</unclear> the Columbia river, was mentioned by the President—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford thought a military post
								<unclear>. . .</unclear> would be proper and sufficient— He was not
							for sending a Colony or establishing a Territory <unclear>. .
								.</unclear>— He said he had last winter advised <persRef
								ref="floyd-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd</persRef> to
							change his plan from a Territory to a <unclear>. . .</unclear>ry post,
							and the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had told him he would. The
							President spoke of the information from <unclear>. . .</unclear>gis that
							an Establishment of a Post sixty or seventy Miles further North, would
							be prefe<unclear>. . . .</unclear> the mouth of Columbia river— I gave
							the President my draft of minutes for the parts <unclear>. . .
								.</unclear> message relating to foreign Affairs— He asked the other
							members of the Administration <hi rend="italic">for</hi><pb type="ms"
								n="561"/>for theirs. I left with the President papers relating to
							the affair of <persRef ref="ducoudray-holstein">Du Coudray
								Holstein</persRef>, of whom he had directed a Prosecution— And I
							questioned whether it was not barred by limitation. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard thought the limitation of two
							years applied—and looked to the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume
							of the Laws Article Crimes and Punishments, but the limitation Section
							is there omitted— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard spoke of
							several Naval Courts Martial, and particularly of the one to be ordered
							for the trial of <persRef ref="stewart-charles">Captain
								Stewart</persRef>— He was uncertain whether in the charges should be
							included that of violating the blockade declared by the Peruvian
							Government; inasmuch as we utterly deny the legality of that blockade in
							all its parts— I thought it desirable that the Court itself should
							explicitly decide its illegality; but as the judge Advocate must
							maintain its illegality there seems an inconsistency in his introducing
							the violation of it among the charges— Southard said it was remarkable
							that <persRef ref="barton-unknown2">Barton</persRef>, a man named by
								<persRef ref="prevost-john">Prevost</persRef> as a witness that arms
							were landed from the Canton, at Arica, under the protection of the
							Franklin’s guns, had remained in the Pacific and had purchased the
							bernviano, a small vessel, which Stewart had built, claimed and sold as
							his own property— On leaving with the President my minutes for a
							Message—I observed that as this would be his last Session Message,
							perhaps he would think some <hi rend="italic">general</hi> remarks upon
							the policy pursued towards foreign Nations during the whole period of
							his Administration would be expedient— He concurred with the idea— I
							told him I had said little upon the subject of the Greeks— But he must
							determine whether he would communicate to Congress the proposals of
							their Agents at London, through M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush,
							that the U.S. should take them under their protection— The President
							desired me to send him, his last year’s annual message— His Message on
							internal improvement, and the Report of the Committee of foreign
							Relations of the House of Representatives at the last Session of
							Congress on the Porto-Rico piracies— I sent them accordingly, and left
							with him also the despa<unclear>. . .</unclear> last received from
								<persRef ref="nelson-hugh">H. Nelson</persRef>, which includes a
							Note in a very spirited tone, to the Spanish Government.</p>

						<p><date>Saturday 13. November.</date> Cabinet Meeting. Present <persRef

								ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Samuel L. Southard</persRef> and J. Q. Adams.
							The question was whether the <persRef ref="tillotson-robert">District
								Attorney</persRef> at New-York should be instructed to commence a
							prosecution against <persRef ref="ducoudray-holstein">L. Villaume
								Ducoudray Holstein</persRef> for fitting out in Aug<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> 1822 an expedition against the Spanish
							Island of Porto-Rico. The opinion in favour of the prosecution was
							unanimous with the exception of mine— I was against it, first because I
							considered it barred by the Statute of Limitations— Secondly, because
								<hi rend="italic">the</hi><pb type="ms" n="562"/>the parties have
							already been prosecuted for the same thing, in the Island of Curacao,
							where they suffered eighteen Months Imprisonment; and were condemned to
							thirty years of the same punishment— This Sentence was reversed by the
								<persRef ref="william-i">king of the Netherlands</persRef>, who
							substituted for it, banishment from the Island— And thirdly because it
							was a mere undertaking—never carried into Execution— It was answered
							that whether the Statute of Limitations applied or not, was for the
							Court to determine— The President thought it would not— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard that it would— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford said
							that the Prosecution at Curacao was not for an Offence against <hi
								rend="italic">our</hi> Law; and that we had nothing to do with it
							and that although the expedition never landed at Porto Rico; the fitting
							out and preparing of it, in our Ports was a consummation of the Offence
							against our Law— Ducoudray himself, wrote last April to the President;
							soliciting his protection— And <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">Baptis
								Irvine</persRef>, later, through <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— There was a question
							whether these papers should be transmitted to the District Attorney as
							part of the Evidence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford thought
							they should be, and it was so determined— In his Letter to the
							President, Ducoudray says he was one of the persons who attempted to
							liberate <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>, from the Castle
							of Olmutz—and he has recently published a biographical Memoir of La
							Fayette— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun suggested that perhaps
							it would be well to postpone the prosecution till General La Fayette
							should return, and that he should be enquired of as to the facts of
							Ducoudray’s being concerned in the attempt to liberate him— I objected,
							that I had no doubt the fact was so— That La Fayette would of course be
							kindly disposed to him; and would advise if at all against the
							prosecution— But if the prosecution was proper; it ought not to be
							omitted on account of any service heretofore rendered by Ducoudray to La
							Fayette— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford concurred <unclear>. .
								. .</unclear> opinion; and it was determined that the District
							Attorney at New York should be <unclear>. . .</unclear>ediately directed
							to commence the prosecution, and that all the papers containing
								<unclear>. . .</unclear> Evidence, should be sent to him, including
							those furnished by Ducoudray and B. Irvine <unclear>. .
							.</unclear>emselves.— The President asked the other members of the
							Administration to furnish <unclear>. . .</unclear>m with their minutes
							for the message— I had already given him mine— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun <unclear>. . .</unclear> his would be shorted than
							they were last year—and a mere sequel to them. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard <unclear>. . .</unclear> his would be shorter
							still— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford how the revenue
							had turned out. He said <unclear>. . .</unclear> good—between 17. and 18
							Millions of impost; and about 1200,000 dollars for lands— Four Millions
							of 7 per Cents have been purchased, and there are 7. Millions in the
							Treasury.</p>

								>President</persRef>— His <unclear>. . .</unclear>d of writing it is
							upon loose Sheets of paper like Sibylline leaves— A separate Sheet,
								<unclear>. . . .</unclear> subject distinctly noticed in it. He
							receives minutes for it, from each of the Heads of <pb type="ms" n="563"
							/>of Departments; but that from the Treasury has not yet been furnished
							him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford intimated, that it was
							because M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had sent for his
							Estimates, back, to make some change in them, and that they had not been
							returned the same day that he had sent for them— The Message is very
							long— Southard said it had taken the President three quarters of an hour
							to read it. He has omitted the paragraph that he had prepared,
							concerning the reconciliation of Parties. I had told him that as it was
							written, I thought it would not be received as conciliatory. Its purport
							was, that there <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been a party, averse to our
							Republican Institutions; but that by experience they had become
							reconciled to them— I told him that the federal party to which he
							alluded, did not admit this; but on the contrary, complained of it as
							injustice that it had been imputed to them— That they had already
							complained of it, as noticed in his published correspondence with
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson</persRef>— It was his <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi>—That he
							had avowed; but if his object was conciliation, I thought it would
							better be promoted by omitting the paragraph he had written, than by
							inserting it— He referred to it this day merely to say that he should
							leave it out— After reading it once through; he read it again by
							paragraphs— <persRef ref="crawford-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Crawford</persRef> in the mean time called in the
							Carriage for her husband and he went away— He said he did not see that
							any alteration was necessary in the draft as first read— On the second
							reading however there was much retrenchment and some alteration— Calhoun
							and Southard said it was a good business-like Message; and spoke in
							commendation of its Style— As the <hi rend="italic">last </hi>Session
							Message that the President is to deliver, it contains more matter of a
							general character than any of the preceding, and a Summary review of the
							Policy of the Administration throughout its career— There was no
							discussion upon any of the <hi rend="italic">topics</hi> introduced into
							the Message, and no diversity of opinion with regard to any of the
							recommendations in it. There never has been a period of more tranquility
							at home and abroad, since our existence as a Nation, than that which now
							prevails— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun objected to one
							expression in the Message, which declared the agricultural,
							manufacturing, and commercial interests of the Country to be in a
							flourishing condition— He said all the Agriculture of the South was in a
							State of great depression—never greater. He wished the gratulatory term
							of the Message to be qualified— The President noticed one passage, as
							favouring by <hi rend="italic">implication</hi> the manufacturing
							interests; and said he was decidedly for the policy of favouring the
							manufactures— The paragraph respecting Greece and South-America, was
							less energetic and vivid than that of the last year, but in the same
							Spirit. That about <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>
							distinctly recommended that some provision should be made for him by
							Congress—</p>
