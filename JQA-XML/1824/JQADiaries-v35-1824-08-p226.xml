							with France, upon the claims of our Citizens; and whether he should be

							apprehension of a possible opposition to the Convention in the Senate;
							which he said after the sacrifices made by the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> in the way of conciliation would
							be extremely painful— I told him that I did not expect there would be

							Russia— He said he was aware of that; but that it would nevertheless,
							not fail to be felt— He read me an extract from a despatch upon the
							subject of the confidential communications between him and me of last
							winter— It expressed the satisfaction of the Emperor at the <hi
								rend="italic">conciliatory</hi> disposition manifested by them on
							our part, notwithstanding our explicit avowal of opposite principles—
							The Baron read to me also a despatch from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"

							a second time, and observing that I read it with much attention, he

							That my testimony had not been favourable to M<hi rend="superscript"

							terms, and states that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris in his
							conduct as a public agent of the United States had given entire
							satisfaction to the Russian Government— That he had been in part the
							founder of the relations between the two Countries, and that he had
							obtained special marks of confidence from the predecessor of the
							Minister of foreign affairs Count Nesselrode— The despatch states, that
							in the Law-suit between Harris and <persRef ref="lewis-william"
								>Lewis</persRef>, which had acquired a too deplorable celebrity,
							both parties had applied to the Russian Government for copies of
							official documents. That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris having
							arrived there had been treated with the attentions due to a person who
							had previously held a public office under a foreign Nation, and
							discharged it to the satisfaction of the Emperor— But that with regard
							to his lawsuit, and his possible prevarications in reference to his own
							Countrymen, the Russian Government could consider him only as a private
							individual, and felt its duty to be to observe an entire impartiality
							between the parties— That when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris had
							applied for copies of public documents he had been informed they could
							be furnished only upon the application of the Minister of the United
							States, and would upon the same application be furnished to the adverse
							party— That accordingly <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi

							copies of documents for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis which had
							been furnished— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris had been
							irritated at this, and whether from vanity or from personal animosity
							had not applied for his documents through M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Middleton; though if he had they would have been furnished him— But he
							had solicited the certificate of good conduct, which as relating to mere
							general considerations it had been thought proper to give him; and the
							Baron was apprized of all these Circumstances that he might use them as
							occasion should require if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris should
							seek to give a particular colouring to the refusal to furnish copies of
							Documents to him, in any other manner than as they were furnished to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis.— I told Baron Tuyll that

							through the distance, I had yesterday traversed in 50 minutes. This
							difference was owing to the different state of the tide, which was
							running this morning so much more rapidly than yesterday. Last summer

							tides— Five days before the New-Moon, the day of the New Moon, and four

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Yancey</persRef> called on me
							two or three times this morning. He had a lingering hope that the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would recommend him
							instead of <persRef ref="preston-james">General Preston</persRef> for
							the Post-Office at Richmond; upon discovering that it was less

									n="245"/>Bradley</persRef>, of the proceeds for the last three
							years, amounting to no more than between 7 and 800 dollars a year. He
							requested me to give this to the President, which I did, but his
							determination for the appointment of Preston was not shaken— <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> had left with me yesterday an electioneering
							paper which he had written, and proposed to send and have distributed as
							hand-bills, to the number of 1500 in the State of New-York. It was an
							argument against the Election of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> as President,
							founded upon the violent papers of the Georgia delegation, about the
							Cherokee Indians, at the last Session of Congress, and of the Governor
							of Georgia, <persRef ref="troup-george">Troup</persRef>; then and since.
							Thornton’s argument is from the character of these papers to the danger
							of choosing a Citizen of Georgia for President— I told the D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> that I wished he would not publish that
							paper; for it was within my knowledge, that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford had disapproved of those papers of the Georgia
							Delegation, and had endeavoured to prevail upon them to take them back—
							I could therefore not approve of the publication of any paper which
							would represent M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford as responsible
							for them— The D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> took away his paper, but
							brought it again this morning with an additional paragraph, stating that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford as the writer had been since
							preparing the paper had been informed, had disapproved of the Georgia
							Delegation remonstrances; and then proceeding with an argument that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s disapprobations had not been
							sincere— I told the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that this was worse
							than it had been before; and very strongly remonstrated against his
							making the publication at-all— <persRef ref="english-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> G. B. English</persRef> came again to
							urge the necessity of appointing him to go out immediately to Gibraltar;
							to negotiate with the <persRef ref="pasha-ibrahim">Capitan
								Pasha</persRef>; to save the American property at Smyrna, from
							seizure and confiscation by the Turks in consequence of the
							subscriptions from the United States, in aid of the Greeks. I referred
							him to the President— At one O’Clock I attended at the President’s, and
							met <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> there— The discussion was upon the propriety of
							making an immediate appointment of Ministers to Mexico and Buenos-Ayres
							and of an Agent to Guatemala; and concerning the appointment of a
							District Judge, and District Attorney in Maryland— The President himself
							strongly inclined, and has certainly been urged to make the appointments
							to South-America; but I thought it would be best to wait until October
							and perhaps even till the meeting of Congress before making any of them.
							I said the effort made at the last Session of Congress to reduce the
							Missions to South-America, would certainly be renewed at the next; and
								<pb type="ms" n="246"/>probably with success— If Ministers should be
							now appointed, it was highly probable the appropriations to continue
							them would be desired, and then it would assume the appearance of a
							reduction achieved as a victory over the Administration— The President
							said he had been ardently pressed to make immediately the appointment to
							Mexico—on the argument that a Minister from the United-States would
							ensure the failure of <persRef ref="iturbide-augustin"
								>Yturbide’s</persRef> new imperial expedition, which would otherwise
							succeed— In this I had no faith; and the President determined finally to
							postpone all the appointments to those Missions— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wirt was very desirous that <persRef ref="purviance-john2"
								>J. Purviance</persRef> should be appointed District Judge in
							Maryland, but if <persRef ref="glenn-elias">Glenn</persRef> must be
							appointed, that <persRef ref="johnson-reverdy">Reverdy Johnson</persRef>
							should be the District Attorney— He considers it as a question between
