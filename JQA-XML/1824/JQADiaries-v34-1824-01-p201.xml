							the adjustment of the differences, between the <persRef

							I told Baron Tuyll, that I should shortly send him a copy of the Act of

								Jackson</persRef>, at which about one thousand persons attended—
							General Jackson came about eight O’Clock, and retired after supper— The
							dancing continued till near one in the Morning. The crowd was great and
							the House could scarcely contain the company— But it all went off in
							good order, and without accident— the President this Morning excused
							himself from attending, as I had expected he would— He said that when

							from giving even seeming countenance to another.</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> at the President’s—
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> came in afterwards— The first subject referred by the
							President to the meeting, was his draft of an answer to the Resolution
							of the House of Representatives upon <persRef ref="mallary-rollin"
								>Mallary</persRef>’s Motion: which simply was, that there was no
							information upon the subject in his possession which could without
							inconvenience to the public service be communicated to the house— This
							was unanimously approved. The next was upon <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett</persRef>’s enquiries.
							As to his wish for permission to state in debate that the Executive was
							averse to the measure proposed by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, Calhoun and
							Southard thought the views of the Executive ought not to be communicated
							in that way— I did not discuss the question; knowing that Webster had
							consulted Calhoun and Southard, before he offered his Resolution, and
							had been told by them that the Executive had no objection to it— As for
							the disposition of the Committee to authorise the Executive to blockade
							Porto-Rico and Cuba, Calhoun came out in the most decisive manner
							against it, and questioned even the power of Congress, to give the
							Executive such authority—because he said it would be War— This was the
							first time Calhoun had ever started a question upon the power of
							Congress, in this particular, and it led to much discussion, in which
							all the debateable ground, of that part of the Constitution of the
							United States was gone over— Since the argument upon <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef>’s
							proclamation of Neutrality, this has always been difficult ground, and
							the different views of the question have led to many curious and absurd
							results— Calhoun’s argument led to the conclusion, that Congress could
							not authorize the Executive contingently, to commit <hi rend="italic"
								>any</hi> act, hostile in its nature, against a foreign Nation— I
							referred to his own order authorising <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef> to enter upon the Spanish Territory, in
							the Seminole War, to which he made no reply— Wirt thought blockading the
							Ports would be objectionable, because it would affect the rights not
							only of Spain, but of other Nations— I thought issuing Letters of Marque
							and reprizal, might be better— Calhoun thought <hi rend="italic"
								>any</hi> measure would be inexpedient, as tending to involve us in
							War upon a small point, just at the time when we had taken a bold stand,
							upon great, and general interests— He thought it best to make no other
							movement at present; but to look round us and wait for consequences— He
							said there had been no late captures, and there was no immediate danger—
							Wirt said <persRef ref="randall-thomas">Randall</persRef> had told him,
							all the property taken by the Porto-Rico privateers and pirates would be
							lost, unless we should take some measure of self-vindication; and added
							that our Constitution was lamentably defective, if Congress had no power
							to authorise such a measure— I had no doubt of the Power, nor of the
							expediency, and thought that some spirited measure would be entirely
							congenial to the general attitude which we had recently assumed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard was not decisive, and the
							President postponed his determination— He rather inclined against any
							measure himself, from an apprehension of offending England. Evening
							idle, from inability to use my eyes.</p>

							that it was quite immaterial what the modification of the Resolution
							might be—the objection to it under whatever form it might assume would
							be the same— It was the intermeddling of the Legislature, with the
							duties of the Executive— It was the adoption of <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> South-American system, seizing
							upon the popular feeling of the moment to perplex and embarrass the

								ref="edwards-ninian">N. Edwards’s</persRef> disappointment, and the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> reasons for not

								>Gales</persRef>, who has been sounding him to know if I would

							strongly as with any propriety I could. That as to M<hi

						<p><date>25. VII.</date> Rain Storm, the whole day— Heard <persRef
								ref="staughton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Staughton</persRef> at the Capitol— Rode there with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and sent the Carriage home.
							The Sermon had begun before we entered the Hall, and the D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> abridged the service, for the inclemency
							of the weather. I visited <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice-President
								Tompkins</persRef> who arrived in the City, and took the Chair of
							the Senate last Tuesday. He told me that he had recovered his health
							with the exception of sleepless Nights, and that he was relieved from
							all his embarrassments— That he had no intention of being a Candidate,
							either for election to the Presidency, or for re-election as
							Vice-President— All he wanted was justice— He <hi rend="italic"
								>could</hi> speak with a voice of <hi rend="italic">thunder</hi> to
							the Legislature of New-York; but he had determined to take no part in
							the approaching election, and wished for nothing hereafter but quiet and
							retirement— I next called on <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W.
								Taylor</persRef>, and had with him a Conversation of nearly three
							hours with him— He and <persRef ref="livermore-arthur">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Livermore</persRef> had called at my
							house last Evening— The Presidential Canvassing proceeds, with
							increasing heat— The prospects in the Legislature of New-York are at
							present highly favourable to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and his party; and
								<pb type="ms" n="214"/>the prospect that he will obtain the whole
							electoral vote of that State, has suggested to the friends of the other
							Candidates here the necessity of <hi rend="italic">concert</hi> among
							them, in opposing him; and the first measure upon which this concert was
							sought was in the opposition to a Congressional Caucus nomination— At
							the beginning of the last week, <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="rogers-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rogers</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>’s Pennsylvania
							friends, sought meetings with other members, and last Wednesday <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clay</persRef>
							observed to Taylor, that while there was persevering concert, in the
							movements of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s friends, if there
							should be none among his opponents, he would infallibly succeed against
							them all— There was therefore a second meeting on Friday Evening, where
							they agreed to hold another to-morrow Evening at a public house opposite
							to the Unitarian Church— Their first object is to ascertain individually
							the intention of every member, for or against a caucus nomination— On
							the other hand <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>,
							a warm Crawford man told Taylor yesterday that the Caucus would be held;
							but not until April— That in the mean time there will be manifestations
							of public sentiment ascertaining beyond all doubt that there will be a
							majority of the Electoral votes for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford; upon which his friends here will secure the co-operation of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s friends or of mine, by
							offering him and me alternately the Vice-Presidency; with the promise
							that by acceding to this arrangement now, the service to the party would
							lay up a fund of merit for promotion at a future election. And with
							reference to measures, Cambreleng said it was understood there was a
							greater coincidence between the opinions of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford and mine than between those of any two other
							Candidates— I said I believed that was true— But I asked Taylor what he
							thought of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng’s project with
							reference to political morality. Taylor said that when he had mentioned
							it to Livermore, they had both agreed it was a proposition which
							supposed the man to whom it should be made a fool— I told Taylor, I had
							been very sure that Crawford’s friends were at this game of playing off
							Clay and me against each other, but I should not have expected
							Cambreleng would have had the simplicity to disclose it— Taylor said he
							had been much surprized at hearing it from Cambreleng— I told Taylor
							that my mind was made up— I was satisfied there was at this time a
							majority of the whole People of the United States, and majority of the
							States, utterly averse to a nomination by Congressional Caucus—thinking
							it adverse to the Spirit of the Constitution, and tending to Corruption—
							I thought it so myself: and therefore would not now accept a
							Congressional Caucus nomination, even for the Presidency— And of course
							a nomination for the Vice-Presidency, in co-operation with one for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford as President,
								<unclear>co</unclear>uld have no charms for me— Not that I despised
							the Vice-Presidency, or wished peevishly to reject the second place
							because I could not obtain the first— But because the People disapproved
							of this mode of nomination, and I disapproved it myself. I added that in
							opposition to such nomination, I wished my friends to take any measures
							in concert with others opposed to it, as might be proper— In effecting
							this concert, I wished them to dispose of me; as they should think best
							for the public service— I was entirely prepared to consider the election
							by the people of another person to the Presidency, as an indication of
							their will that I should retire to private life— Taylor said he thought
							my determination perfectly correct as to the Vice-Presidency—But that I
							should reconsider that of retiring to private life— That the mere
							failure of an Election to the Presidency could not be considered as
							indicative of the Will of the People that I should retire from the place
							that I now hold— A multitude of causes and of motives contributed to the
							issue of a Presidential Election— Sectional feelings—party prejudices,
							political management, and many others— I might still without dishonour,
							retain my place <pb type="ms" n="215"/>under another administration— I
							said his observation was undoubtedly true in the abstract; and as his
							dinner bell was ringing, I would take another opportunity to explain to
							him my views on the subject—and in the meantime would come to no rash
							decision concerning it. I then called at <persRef ref="sewall-thomas"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sewall</persRef>’s and invited
							him, with <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> to dine with us— Then went to the Presbyterian
							Church and heard <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef> preach from Psalm 103.13. [“]Like as a
							father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.”
							The Storm continued, and there were only fifteen or sixteen persons at
							Church— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett, D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Sewall and <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi

							disposed to report that it should be referred to the Executive, for
							Negotiation with the French Government and he wished to know whether any

								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> told me yesterday that there had been, verbally

								<persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice President Tompkins</persRef>,

							the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this Month; and we signed it.
							The annual Meeting of the board, is to be next week on Wednesday— Our
							business now was immediately finished; and I went successively in to the
							Senate, and House of Representatives— I conversed with many of the
							members of both Houses. <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef> mentioned again to

							the rumour of a Coalition, between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford and me, and our mutual friends, to concur in a Congressional
							Caucus nomination of him as President and of me as Vice-President—a
							rumour which he said was circulating both here, and at New-York. I told
							him that such overtures had been made to me and I had rejected them: and
							I gave him my reasons; the same as I had assigned them to <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef><pb type="ms" n="216"/>on
							Sunday. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King said the course that I had
							taken was such as he should have expected from me, and he thought the
							only one worthy of me— He said he had had some conversation with
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>— From which he had learnt, that Clay, was for going
							to the Caucus, ostensibly for the purpose of voting it down, but to take
							his chance of the nomination if there should be a majority for it— He
							said his opinion was that Clay wanted to get into some public station,
								<hi rend="italic">out</hi> of his own State; feeling his ground
							there to be shaking under him—and that he will push here, for any thing
							that he can get. King is much dissatisfied with the indications from the
							State of New-York; and I think does not yet see them in all their
							bearings— I spoke to <persRef ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour</persRef> a Senator from
							Vermont, and asked him if he thought <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef> would accept of an
							appointment as a Clerk in the Department of State, at the Salary of 800
							dollars a year— I told him I was afraid there would be a vacancy in the
							Department, within a very few days—<persRef ref="maury-fontaine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef> being very dangerously
							ill, with an attack of gout, in the Stomach— Maury’s salary is 1400
							dollars a year, but I shall feel myself obliged to advance <persRef
								ref="smith-linnaeus">L. Smith</persRef> to that; and <persRef
								ref="baker-john">J. M. Baker</persRef> to 1000. which is now
							Smith’s—leaving only the Salary of 800 dollars vacant. Seymour thought
							Slade would accept it, though the standing he has held, and his

							of a Clerk, even at the highest Salary— I made the same proposition to
								<persRef ref="rich-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rich</persRef> in the house; but he had doubts whether Slade would
							accept. Seymour and Rich however are to confer together before they give

							Bill authorising Surveys for internal improvements, and <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane</persRef>
							of Delaware made a Speech in favour of it, but so many of the members
							came to speak with me on various subjects that I could not hear him— I

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd’s</persRef>, calling for

							the Mouth of Columbia River— Said I was at the President’s yesterday
							when the Resolution was brought to him, and hoped the measure would be
							adopted— That I had urged the President to recommend it in the Session
							Message; and had again pressed him upon it yesterday on occasion of
							receiving a Letter from <persRef ref="hogan-michael">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hogan</persRef> the Consul at
							Valparaiso, mentioning that an American vessel had met a British one

								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, upon his Greek Resolution: which was left

						<p><date>28. VII.</date><persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi

								ref="steele-william">Steele</persRef> as District Attorney there. He
							gave me a bundle of Letters against Steele.— But the Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> had <pb type="ms" n="217"/>other objects
							of conversation— He is the particular friend of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, as
							to the Presidential Election; and secondarily, a common friend of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							and myself— He has taken a strenuous part in opposition to the project
							of a Congressional Caucus Nomination, and is warmly engaged in the
							endeavour to harmonize the operations of the other Candidates and their
							friends— The Caucus is the forlorn hope of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>. His friends have hitherto been confident, that
							in a general meeting of the Republican members, they would outnumber the
							votes of any one competitor, and thus obtain a final majority in his
							favour. The other Candidates and their friends are averse to a Caucus on
							various grounds, and Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson has
							laboured much to unite them in opposition to the measure— He urges also
							the extension of this conciliatory concert to the formation of an
							administration— I told him that I would cordially contribute to this
							object, to the utmost of my power— That to this end I had authorized my
							friends in the pursuit of it, if they should think it expedient to set
							me altogether aside; and to concur in any arrangement necessary for the
							union of the Republican party, and the public interest. I reserved to
							myself only the discretion of retiring from the public service, in the
							event of the Election of any other Candidate— Johnson approved
							altogether of this course, and spoke of Clay, as being much exasperated
							against the friends of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— They
							have offered him the Vice-Presidency as they have to me; but they think
							he has not been quick enough to fall into their views, and some
							incidents have occurred tending to more than alienation between them and
							him— Johnson mentioned particularly the sharp altercation a few days
							since in the house, as an occurrence which had very much exasperated
							Clay. He spoke also of the quarrel between <persRef
								ref="bartlett-ichabod">Bartlett</persRef> and Clay; which I told him
							their friends ought to make up between them: which was just the easiest
							thing in the world; both of them having been intemperate in their
							expressions; and both having something to apologize for. He said it was
							very true; that Clay was the most imprudent man in the world; and had
							been altogether wrong, in daring the members of the House opposed to his
							opinions, on the Greek Question to go home and meet their constituents.

								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> to be Secretary of State
							and he himself Secretary of the Treasury— Not as a bargain or Coalition;

							secure a step of advancement to himself, and the total exclusion of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, even from

							from Virginia, after a Conversation with him, in which he had insisted,

							spoke of the state of Affairs in New-York— His own views are in some
							respects biassed by his situation— He has been heretofore himself a
							Candidate for the Presidency— He had at one time during the present
							Administration hopes of being the next in Succession— There is a spice
							of disappointment in all his opinions—and his grounds of preference now
							are too much sectional— There is something peculiar in the state of his
							mind; for it is transparent in his conduct and discourse that although
							strenuous for the Northern Man, he would in the event of his failure,
							not be without consolation— King is one of the wisest, and best men
							among us. But his ambition was inflamed by splendid success in early
							life; followed by vicissitudes of popular favour, and hopes deferred
							till he has arrived nearly at the close of his public career. He has one
							Session of Congress to sit in Senate, but talks even now of resigning.

								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							as a Candidate for the Presidency— They were the movers of the recent

							nominate Candidates for the Offices of President and Vice-President: and

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham having understood that I had

							friends of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun have for the last two

								ref="thompson-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> de

							call and see me again— He said that the recommendation of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas, had arisen from a previous one of
								<persRef ref="baldwin-henry">H. Baldwin</persRef> which had given
							dissatisfaction to the Republicans of Pennsylvania, and the President
							had promised to appoint a Pennsylvanian, if the delegation could agree
							in the recommendation— That they had not at first been earnest in the
							recommendation, but since it was made an attack upon Dallas had been
							concerted by <persRef ref="binns-john">Binns</persRef> an infamous man,
							with others in Philadelphia, and aided by <persRef ref="lowrie-walter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie</persRef>, the Senator at
							this place: who were also endeavouring to overthrow the Republican
							Members here who had signed the circular— It was therefore in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham’s view infinitely important to
							their retaining the republican ascendancy in Pennsylvania, that their
							recommendation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas should prevail,
							and that he should receive the appointment— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham, that the stand made by the
							Pennsylvania Members, in which they had already been sustained by their
							Legislature, had placed Pennsylvania substantially at the head of the
							Union— It exhibited her as the Protectress of the rights of the People,
							and of all the smaller States, against the imminent combination of New
							York and Virginia— My objections to the appointment of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas had been that he was not yet of the
							age and political standing suitable for that appointment, and could not
							be appointed to it without injustice to many others— That as to its
							bearing on the Presidential Election, I must be indifferent between
								<persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
