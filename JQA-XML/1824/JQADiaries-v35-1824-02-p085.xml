							Crawford: but from the facts every one would draw his conclusion—
								<persRef ref="foot-samuel">Foot</persRef> of Connecticut told him he

								ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>— Letter from <persRef
								ref="sharpe-peter">P. Sharpe</persRef> with enclosures from <persRef
								ref="ogilvy-john2">Ogilvie</persRef>. At the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>—in his bed-chamber; but had
							been below all the morning. He thought Ogilvie’s request could not be
							complied with— He claims the Earldom of Findlater in Scotland, with the
							Estate annexed to the title; and wished the President and Secretary of
							State and <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> to aid him in pursuit of the claim. The President
							said it would be ridiculous— He spoke to me of several Letters which had
							passed in 1817. between <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> and him; and read me two of them from Jackson to
							him, dated in January and 13. March of that year. This correspondence
							has recently given rise to incidents which he said had occasioned much
							uneasiness to him— Some weeks since, when General Jackson was becoming a
							formidable Candidate for the Presidency in Pennsylvania; there appeared
							a paragraph in the Democratic Press, asserting that he had in 1817
							written a Letter to the President, recommending to him to form his
							Cabinet of two distinguished federalists and two Republicans— This was
							denied in the Washington Republican as an infamous calumny— <persRef
								ref="kremer-george">Kreamer</persRef> a member of Congress from
							Pennsylvania, went to the President, and asked him how it was. The
							President told him he had received no such Letter from Jackson; but only
							a Letter recommending <persRef ref="drayton-william">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Drayton</persRef> of South Carolina,
							a federalist but who had served through the late War, for Secretary of
							War— Kreamer wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="binns-john"
							>Binns</persRef>, Editor of the Democratic Press, which was published in
							that paper, telling of this denial of the President. The charge that
							such a Letter had been written <pb type="ms" n="94"/>was repeated, and
							that the President had read it to a Senator of U.S. in 1816 and 1817.
							and the Press added, it was said he had read it to Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef ref="lowrie-walter"
								>Lowry</persRef> and <persRef ref="findlay-william"
								>Findlay</persRef>, now Senators U.S. from Pennsylvania. Findlay
							denied this, but Lowry remained silent— The President was then put upon
							looking up Jackson’s Letters to him; but could not until within these
							three days find the Letter in controversy— And has not to this day found
							the copy of his answer to it— Two days since he received a Note from
							Lowry, informing him that he had received under a blank cover from
							Richmond, a copy of this answer— The President said he had no doubt that
							the copy came from elsewhere, and had been first sent to Richmond to
							have the appearance of being transmitted from thence. I told him I
							thought it probably came from <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan"
								>Roberts</persRef> or <persRef ref="lacock-abner">Lacock</persRef>,
							and he said that was his own belief— He then told me the occasion of his
							great confidence in those two men during the late War— His
							misunderstandings with <persRef ref="armstrong-john"
							>Armstrong</persRef>, and their catastrophe— The wrangling two years
							ago, about the re-nomination of <persRef ref="irish-william"
								>Irish</persRef> as Marshal of the Western District of Pennsylvania—
							And that was the occasion upon which he spoke to Lourie, and Findlay of
							Jackson’s Letter to him, but did not read it— But how the Copy of his
							own answer was obtained, and by whom, he knew not. Nor what were Lowry’s
							intentions— But if he meant to bargain with him, he would be
							disappointed— He said it had been a great indiscretion in him to read to
							those persons Jackson’s Letter to him; but it was when he had not a
							conception that Jackson would be a Candidate for the Presidency, and
							Jackson now declared that he would be perfectly satisfied that every
							thing he had ever written him should be published— I told the President
							that <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">Judge Van Ness</persRef> claimed
							the Recommendations of him as judge of the Supreme Court, on the ground
							of his having delivered them himself to him— He said it was so of some
							of them. I thought this at variance with the Letter of his brother
								<persRef ref="vanness-john">General J. P. Van Ness</persRef>
							inclosing some of the recommendations; alledging that they were not
							known to the Judge, who declined such assistance as not necessary for
							him. The President said Judge Van Ness could not reconcile his mind to
							the disappointment of failing to obtain the appointment. That he the
							President had told him that though he himself had no suspicion of the
							judge’s being implicated in <persRef ref="rudd-tharon">Rudd’s</persRef>
							delinquency, he had suffered <pb type="ms" n="95"/>a prejudice to grow
							up against him, by not meeting insinuations of a Committee of Congress,
							by a formal demand of investigation— So that the nomination of him would
							have been endangered in Senate: While I was with the President, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
