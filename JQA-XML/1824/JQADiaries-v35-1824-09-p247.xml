							called the Fountain Inn— Found <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson

								ref="cary-unknown">Miss Carey</persRef>— A parting one; in unwilling
							submission to the prejudices of <persRef ref="carey-unknown2">her

							Johnson to view the Washington and Battle Monuments, and the Roman
							Catholic Cathedral. Returning, I met <persRef ref="munro-isaac">M<hi

								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> to stop, on his return to Washington— Judge

							increase the excitement which should rather be allayed— It might have

							claim upon the Government of the United States with great solicitude;
							and thinking it just, I told him I should give it all the aid in my
							power. He spoke also of the electoral ticket in this State— A ticket was
							nominated by the republican members of the Legislature last June,
							understood to be favourable to me— An opposition ticket has since been
							gotten up, at the head of which they have placed the names of Eustis,
							and of the late <persRef ref="brooks-john">Governor Brooks</persRef>— As
							this opposition has not been countenanced <pb type="ms" n="252"/>by

							publicly, and Eustis told me that they would— He said the only question
							was as to the time, and he believed that would be soon. His own opinion,
							he said had been made up and declared, two years ago; and it was well
							known not only here but at New-York and Albany— He would see Brooks, and
