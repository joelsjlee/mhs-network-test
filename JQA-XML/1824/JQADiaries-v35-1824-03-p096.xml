							Fuller read me a Letter from <persRef ref="munro-isaac">Munro</persRef>

								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> present— I was principally
							to read the Draft of a Message to both Houses of Congress, recommending
							the establishment of a military Post, high up the Missouri River; and
							another on the Pacific Ocean, at the Mouth of the Columbia river, or at
							the Straits of Juan de Fuca— But it was a strong argument against making
							any territorial Settlement on the Pacific, with a decided expression of
							an opinion that they would necessarily soon separate from this Union. I
							suggested doubts of the expediency or necessity of communicating such an
							opinion. Calhoun supported and enlarged upon my objections; and Southard
							concurred with us— The voice against the Message was unanimous, and the
							President concluded not to send it— Calhoun thought there would be no
							separation, should we make Settlements on the Pacific Ocean; and I
							inclined to the same opinion— He said the passion for aggrandizement was
							the Law paramount of man in Society, and that there was no example in
							History of the disruption of a Nation from itself—by voluntary
							separation. I contested <pb type="ms" n="106"/>this and cited the case
							of the tribes of Israel. He admitted this was an exception, but said it
							was the only one— The position was not correct. The Separation of
							Portugal from Spain, and of Sweden from Denmark and Norway might have
							been mentioned but I did not press the discussion— We agreed in the
							result— I thought a Government by federation would be found practicable
							upon a territory as extensive as this Continent, and that the tendency
							of our popular sentiments was increasingly towards Union— The President
							spoke also respecting the appointment of a fourth Auditor. Calhoun and
								<unclear>. . .</unclear> were against the abolition of the Office—
							The propriety of appointing a member of Congress was discussed— I
							thought a member should not be appointed— Calhoun and Southard thought a
							Rule should be established at the commencement of an Administration,
							against appointing members to subaltern Offices; but now to exclude
							members would seem invidious— The appointment of E. Bates as District
							Attorney in Missouri, was also mentioned. The President fears to
							nominate him, <persRef ref="scott-john">Scott</persRef> the
							Representative and <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef> the
							Senator being violent against him— The State is distracted with parties,
							and there have been three or four fatal duels, arising from charges of
							official malversation against a <persRef ref="rector-william">General
								Rector</persRef>, of the Land Office. Bates is one of Rectors
							accusers; and the President seeks some person not engaged in these
							controversies— He has talked with <persRef ref="mcnair-alexander"
								>Governor M’Nair</persRef> of Missouri now here: and says there is a
								<persRef ref="geyer-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Geyer</persRef> named to him as excellently well qualified, and a no
							party man— I said there was another view of the subject deserving
							Consideration— Bates had openly denounced Rector for gross official
							abuses— Rector instead of making a solid defence, was supported by the
							pistols of his friends— Was this a good objection to the appointment of
							Bates— Calhoun and Southard both supported my remarks, and the President
							said he believed the charges against Rector were well founded. He has
							long since been called upon for explanations and must soon give them or
							be dismissed— Calhoun said the propriety of appointing Bates would
							depend on the decision concerning Rector, and so it was left— Dined at

							Speaker of their House of Representatives, for the appointment of
							Marshal— Green himself will be here in a few days. I told them I thought

							motion of <persRef ref="forsyth-john">J. Forsyth’s</persRef> for
							reducing the sum estimated in the appropriation Bill now before the
							House of Representatives, for the diplomatic intercourse— He began with
							a general assault upon the whole estimate, proposing a discontinuance of
							the Plenipotentiary Missions in Spain and Portugal, as well as all those
							in South-America— But failing in this he has finished by proposing to
							strike out the item of Salary for a Minister to Lima. This may be spared
							without inconvenience, and I do not regret the appearance of this
							disposition in the house— At the Office— <persRef ref="cathcart-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cathcart</persRef> came with a

							than ten thousand Dollars within these four years, but he wants more.
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>, Secretary of the Navy, came to ask for a Letter
							from <persRef ref="stewart-charles">Commodore Stewart</persRef>, which
							he had sent me, and which I had just sent back to the Navy Department—
							Southard talked with me largely upon Election Prospects, and was
							apparently desirous of ascertaining my Sentiments concerning <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>—. I gave them to him without
							reserve— The Pennsylvania Convention at Harrisburg have nominated
							Jackson for President and Calhoun Vice-President. Southard thought the
							Vice-Presidency was not the place for Calhoun, but yet seemed inclined
							that he should be voted for to it— He asked who my friends <pb type="ms"
								n="109"/>would vote for— I told him, probably Jackson— He asked if
							that would not strengthen Jackson’s chance of success for the <hi
								rend="italic">Presidency</hi>. I had no doubt it would— But what
							then?— My friends would vote for him on correct principle— His fitness
							for the place— The fitness of the place for him, and the peculiar
							advantage of the geographical association— If by voting for him as
							Vice-President my friends should induce others to vote for him as
							President, they and I must abide by the issue. It is upon the whole the
							best course to be taken; and besides the impulse to that course in the
							popular feeling is given. It is too late to withstand or to controul it—
							Southard said he had seen a member of the Harrisburg Convention; who had
							given him a very detailed account of their proceedings— That the
							presence of <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">H. Baldwin</persRef>, though
							not a member, and considered as a Crawfordite under a Jackson mask, had
							occasioned much agitation— And that multitudes of Letters had been
							received from this place reporting a Coalition between <persRef

							written repeatedly to his <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">father in
								Law</persRef>, to urge upon Eustis the necessity that he should
							publish it; and if he should decline, it should still be published—of
							this I am yet a little incredulous; and I told Sullivan that under

							its publication. I said this, because <persRef ref="king-william">W.
								King</persRef> having made this Claim and all his conduct relating
							to it an electioneering Engine against me, I should distrust my own
							judgment in advising the publication which would expose King, as

							publication, or at least the disclosure of W. King’s projects necessary
							to Sullivan for his justification before the People of Maine and
							Massachusetts, to whom King has openly denounced him; but this is for
							Sullivan to see with his own eyes, and not by advice from me; and if he
							from prudential considerations applicable to himself, or to the benefit
							of the claim, refrains from the publication, it is not for me to urge it

								>Keller</persRef> came to me this morning, anxious to know what I
							had done with Keller’s petition for employment at the Patent Office. I
							had sent it to <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> M’Lane</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and
							Means— Received a Note from the <persRef key="monroe-james"

								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun,</persRef><persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> and me at his
							house, at ten O’Clock this Morning. We met there accordingly— The first
							subject of consultation was a Letter from M’Lane Chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, enquiring,
							whether in consequence of the decease of the fourth Auditor, any
							Appropriation for the Salary of that Officer would be necessary, and how
							the Appropriations of the year would be affected by that Event— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford who is yet unwell tho’
							convalescent had endorsed a reference of this Letter to the President,
							remarking that if the Office should be abolished, as the President had
							inclined to the opinion that it might the Appropriation for the Salary
							would be unnecessary— Calhoun and Southard now thought that the Office
							could not be abolished, without doubling the labours of the third
							Auditor <persRef ref="hagner-peter">Peter Hagner</persRef>, already
							overlaboured— It was proposed to call upon him to say whether he could
							do the additional duties of the fourth Auditor, but I suggested that to
							require of him a formal Report upon that question, would be placing him
							in a delicate and awkward position, which considering him as a most
							excellent Officer would be hardly dealing fairly with him. I proposed
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford should answer M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane’s Letter, by observing that the
							question upon the expediency of abolishing the Office, would require
							time and deliberation to decide; and that in the mean time if the
							appropriation should be made, it would remain unexpended in case the
							result of the examination should be to abolish the Office— It was
							determined accordingly— The next subject submitted for consideration by
							the President was more important— By a compact made between the U.
							States, and the State of Georgia in 1802. the United States stipulated
							to extinguish as soon as should be practicable peaceably and upon
							reasonable terms the Indian titles to lands within the State of Georgia—
							And since that time many Treaties have been made and many Millions of
							miles purchased in fulfilment of the Article— The State of Georgia
							continually pressing to obtain more. At last the Cherokees have come to
							the determination that they will on no consideration part with any more
							of their Lands, and their delegation now here have most explicitly so
							declared; in answer to a Letter from the Secretary of War, strongly
							urging upon <pb type="ms" n="111"/>them the necessity of a further
							cession. The answer of the Cherokees was communicated to the Georgia
							delegation here; and they have addressed to the President a Letter of
							remarks upon the correspondence between the Secretary of War and the
							Cherokees, which the President said was an insult. It is in terms of the
							most acrimonious reproach against the Government of the United States,
							whom it charges almost in terms, with fraud and hypocrisy, while it
							broadly insinuates, that the obstinacy of the Cherokees, is instigated
							by the Secretary of War himself— Calhoun remarked that it was in the
							hand-writing of <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">Cobb</persRef>, but it was
							signed by the two Senators <persRef ref="elliott-john">Elliott</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="ware-nicholas">Ware</persRef>, and by all the members
							of the house from the State, excepting <persRef ref="tattnall-edward"
								>Tattnall</persRef> who is not here. The question was how it should
							be treated— The conclusion was that the President should send a Message
							to Congress, with the Correspondence, and an exposition of what has been
							done by the Government of the United States in fulfilment of the
							compact— Calhoun thought that the message should communicate, but take
							no notice of the Letter of the Georgia delegation— I said as the charges
							of the Letter could not be overlooked, it was scarcely possible to avoid
							a direct allusion to it; and I thought it indispensable, that it should
							in substance be fully answered. The President said it should be
							answered, and in the tone of defiance best suited to it. Southard said
							Georgia would find very little support in Congress to such a paper as
							that. The President said he had never received such a paper— I said it
							was an issue tendered between Georgia and the Government of the United
							States— Calhoun dwelt upon its incorrectness with regard to the facts,
							and I observed it was a peremptory demand to do by force, and upon most
							unreasonable terms, that which had been stipulated only to be done
							peaceably, and upon reasonable terms— It was asked what could have
							kindled this raging fever for Indian Lands— Calhoun thought it was the
							State system of disposing of them by Lottery— A system which he said was
							immoral and corrupt. Instigating insatiable cupidity, for Lands; and
							alternately seized by the conflicting parties as Engines for the
							advancement of one upon the ruin of the other. I suspected this bursting
							forth of Georgia upon the Government of the United States was ominous of
							other Events— We were kept till past 3. at the Presidents. At the Office
								<persRef ref="macdonough-thomas">Captain M’Donogh</persRef> came,
							with his demand for furnishing Cabin Stores for <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef> and his family, when
							they went with him in the Frigate Guerriere to Russia— They cost 2000
							dollars— Campbell at first would have paid only 400. but finally paid
							800. M’Donogh, considered 600, as being a large proportion for himself,
							and made out an account for 600 against the United States— I had laid
							this account before the President, but there was no fund from which it
							could be paid. It could therefore not be allowed. <pb type="ms" n="112"
							/>There was a Ball this Evening at <persRef ref="henderson-archibald"

							and send them by his Secretary <persRef ref="mason-john4">John

							upon the personal concerns of the Mission. <persRef
								ref="herrick-ebenezer">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							called at the President’s with the despatches last received from
								<persRef ref="nelson-hugh">H. Nelson</persRef>, and from <persRef

							a wish that they might be induced to withdraw it— That the President
							told him they might withdraw it if they pleased; but it must be their
							own act, and not at his desire— He gave me also to read a Letter from
							the <persRef ref="troup-george">Governor of Georgia</persRef> to the
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary at War</persRef>, upon the
							same subject, which he said though in some respects exceptionable was in
							a different Spirit, from the Delegation Letter, and contained a
							refutation of their insinuations of duplicity on the part of the General
							Government— I dined at <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef>, with a company of about 25. Heads of
							Departments, Members of Congress, and Officers of the Army and Navy—
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and Calhoun were there;— It
							was the General’s birth-day, and apparently the occasion upon which he
							gave the dinner— Clay had been arguing in the Supreme Court this
							morning, the case of the Apollon, against the Government, and had taken
							the opportunity of being as he professed very severe upon me— At the
							dinner he became warm, vehement, and absurd upon the tariff, and
							persisted in discussing it, against two or three attempts of <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">Eaton</persRef> to change the subject of the
							Conversation— He is so ardent, dogmatical and overbearing that it is
							extremely difficult to preserve the temper of friendly society with him.
							I had some conversation with <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> who sat next me at
							table, on the Georgia Delegation Letter, which he thought would not be
							taken back— I thought it would—<hi rend="italic">at the intercession of
									M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</hi>; and had a
							suspicion that it was written and sent with that intention. Southard
							said this was to him a new view of the subject— Attended a large Evening

								King</persRef> one of the Senators from Alabama came, and
							representing that the Halcyon had been drop’d, recommended the

							at Greensborough, printed the Laws in it there under the Letter issued
							for printing them at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Stephens, and now

								Winthrop</persRef>, urging the publication of his late Letter to
								<persRef ref="eustis-william">Governor Eustis</persRef>; by a long
							argument, concerning which he asked my advice. I asked the motive for
							writing it— He said, that it might be read to Eustis— I said there were
							three points upon which the exposure of <persRef ref="king-william">W.
								King’s</persRef> designs would bear— 1. On Sullivan’s defence
							against King’s public denunciation— 2. On the prospects of the Claim. 3.
							On the Presidential Election. For the first I believed it necessary for
							Sullivan’s full justification. As to the second I was <pb type="ms"
								n="118"/>altogether doubtful, whether its operation upon the claim
							would be favourable or adverse— And could not advise as to the third—I
							had no doubt the effect would be favourable to me, but must set that
							consideration aside, and distrust my own judgment lest it should be
							improperly biassed by my own interest— Sullivan thought the effect must
							be favourable to the claim; by exasperating all <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford’s</persRef> friends against
							it, and thereby writing the friends of all the other Candidates in its
							support— I said I believed Governor Eustis for various reasons would be
							strenuously against the publication, and I advised Sullivan to give full
							consideration to the arguments he would urge against it— Sullivan said
							he intended to go into the House of Representatives of Massachusetts
							this year, and thought he should make a very good Speaker— And in the
							House he would take care that full Justice should be done to himself— I
							attended this Evening alone the Drawing-Room at the <persRef

							Bad weather. Heard of <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi

							the Supreme Court to <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> attack
							upon the Administration and upon me, on Monday, in the case of the
							Apollon. <persRef ref="hay-george">G. Hay</persRef> was in raptures at
							the scourging Clay received. Clay spoke of it to me himself; but in a
							very humble tone compared with that of Monday— Clay said he had wanted a
							half an hour for reply. I said he should have thought of that when he
							attacked me where he knew I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not reply— He
							said Wirt had made my Letter to <persRef ref="hyde-de-neuville-jean">De
								Neuville</persRef> a part of his argument— I hold him he had fine
							scope for assailing me where I was not present to defend myself; but in

							into better hands than my own. <persRef ref="bradley-william2"
								>Bradley</persRef> spoke to me of the proceedings of the House this

							because M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was joined in the

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane considers it as a vested

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, who had made the
							allowance to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, after taking the
							opinion of the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef>,
							and against mine— He thought he must make the claim— His second purpose
							was to solicit the appointment of Secretary of Legation to France, in
							the event of <persRef ref="sheldon-daniel">D. Sheldon’s</persRef> return
							home, this year; which he said was expected— I had no reason for such
							expectation, but promised to befriend him if Sheldon should return. I
							received a Note from the President asking me to return the Letter from
								<persRef ref="troup-george">Governor Troup</persRef> of Georgia, to
							the <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, which he had
							given me some days ago— I took the Letter over to the President’s House,
							and he being out, left it upon his table— He came afterwards to the
							Office, and spoke of the joint-Letter <pb type="ms" n="121"/>from the
							Georgia Delegation to him. He said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford in pursuance of the desire expressed by himself that they
							should withdraw the paper, had seen <persRef ref="elliott-john">M<hi

							had consulted with the rest of the Delegation; who thereupon determined
							not to withdraw the paper; nor to hold any consultation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford concerning it— Governor Barbour
							of Virginia told the President that the paper was written by <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> and copied by <persRef
								ref="cobb-thomas">Cobb</persRef>. The President is deeply affected
							by it. He thinks it proceeds from Forsyth and Cobb’s eagerness for
							popularity in Georgia stimulated by the passion of the People for lands
							which are distributed among them by <hi rend="italic">Lottery</hi> under
							the State Laws; and by party ambition to outdo the <persRef
								ref="clarke-john2">Clarke</persRef> faction in the State— He said
							there were three courses, either of which he might pursue with regard to
							the paper, one to send it back to the writers— Another to keep it
							without answering it. The third to send it to Congress— Of these, the
							last was the most advisable— I suggested to him the expediency of
							referring the paper to the Secretary of War for a Report, in this the
							errors both of fact and of principle might be fully exposed; and then
							both papers might be sent, by Message to Congress together— And I
							reminded him that this was the course adopted when <persRef

							Orleans, and there embark, to land with in a few Miles of Vera-Cruz— He
							also gave me an explanatory account of his own, conduct personally
							towards me for the last three years— It was apologetic, And excusatory—
							He had begun by volunteering as my friend, and then by his own account
							abandoned me for <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, because
							he thought there was no possible chance in my favour, and because his
							great object paramount to all others was to put down <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>— I told him with
							candour all that had rested upon my mind, in the variations of his
							dispositions and conduct towards me; assuring him that I retained no
							sentiment of animosity for it— He declared to me his conviction that it
							was the attack of <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan
								Russell</persRef> upon me, and its consequences which had brought me
							up as a candidate for the Presidency— But for that, he is persuaded I
							should have been out of the question— He says also that the Winter
							before that occurrence, when he and <persRef key="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef> boarded at <persRef ref="peyton-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peyton’s</persRef>, Clay intimated to
							him that he intended to operate against me with that Mississippi <pb

							then that Clay stimulated <persRef ref="floyd-john">Floyd</persRef>, who
							also then lodged at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peyton’s, to his
							movements of the succeeding Winter— He says nothing that Clay ever did
							in the whole course of his life, has hurt his character so much as his
							Parthian shaft at me and his subsequent flinching from the contest that
							he had challenged. <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General

								Bailey</persRef> called for a moment, but I was engaged with
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R.

							been the last two days in discussion before the Senate— He told me the

							by the combination of certain individual members from two of the Great
							States was establishing itself here at Washington to controul the
							Constitution itself— I suggested to him the wish that he would reduce to
							writing the purport of his observations, and publish them; to which he
							appeared disposed to assent— We spoke also of the approaching
							controversy between the Georgia Delegation, and the Executive Government
							of the United States— I told him the course that I had recommended to
							the President concerning it—he thought it the best that could be taken.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards called again at the Office to

								with<persRef ref="kerr-alexander"> A. Kerr</persRef>; concerning a
							note of <persRef ref="moulton-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary

								<persRef ref="vanness-john">President</persRef> and Directors of the
							Bank of the Metropolis, who have protested it, and caused notice to be
							given to me of the protest— I charged Kerr with the unfairness of his

							against M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Moulton for the remainder— He
							refused this as an unreasonable proposal, but offered a reference to
							impartial persons— This I accepted, but he then said the thing must take
							its regular course— I endorsed the note, to save the woman and her
							infant children from perishing, under a distress by Kerr, for Rent; and
							without due consideration I took the <pb type="ms" n="123"/>woman’s
							Note, and endorsed it; not reflecting that it was void; and therefore

								Holmes</persRef> of Maine. But he is to attend the Committee

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef> this morning,
							from Revelations 3.4. “Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have
							not defiled their Garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for

							from Virginia; and <persRef ref="garnett-robert">R. S. Garnett</persRef>

							he had related some weeks since at my house— That in the campaign of
							1781—Henry actually proposed in a secret Session of the Legislature of
							Virginia, that she should be the first to submit to Great Britain, in
							order that she might obtain the most favourable terms. Taylor was
							himself a member of the Legislature and heard him move to go in to
							secret Session; there make the proposition and support it by an eloquent
							speech— It met with such immediate, indignant and universal opposition,
							that when the debate closed, he had changed his side, and was among the
							most ardent and sangwine for perseverance in the War— Taylor thinks
							there is great exaggeration, in the panegyric upon Henry—by <persRef

							and intimated his intention to take further part in them— He told me
							that the alteration of the Constitution in 1803. of the mode of electing
							the President and Vice-President, had been determined upon in a Caucus,
							and the introduction of the amendment had been assigned to him— He had

								<persRef ref="rankin-christopher">Rankin</persRef> of Mississippi
							about a payment in advance of Salary to a Florida Land-title
							Commissioner, who never performed the duties of the Office— It was the

								ref="miller-james">General Miller</persRef> came to ask again
							whether some Office, which would allow of his residence at home in
							New-England, could not be given him instead of the Government of the

							Boston, neither of which is now vacant. But if this accommodation could
							not be allowed him; he wished a continued leave of absence, to return
							and pass the Summer in New-England, for the full restoration of his

							Commercial Agent to this Country could apply to obtain the place— I
							called at the President’s, and mentioned the applications of Governor

							Summer in New-England for the recovery of his Health; though I strongly
							reminded him of the objections of principle, to permitting the absence
							of a Governor of a Territory for such a length of time from his Post— He
							read to me a Message that he was about sending to Congress upon the
							Settlement of <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Governor
								Tompkins’s</persRef> accounts— In addition to the allowances already
							made, the President had determined to allow him a Commission of 5 per

							himself— I gave him many reasons for taking this course, concerning

								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef>. They made various
							enquiries respecting items of Appropriation, in the Bill that has passed
							the House of Representatives, with the view of reducing them. The items
							for the relief of destitute Seamen, for intercourse with the Barbary
							Powers, and for the Slave Indemnity Commission, were those which they
							most minutely scrutinized, particularly the last— They also manifested a
							disposition to discontinue the appropriation of 2000 dollars a year, for
							a commercial agent at Paris— And there was much conversation respecting
							the proposed allowance of a mechanic to preserve and repair the models
							at the Patent Office. I was with the Committee about two hours, and then
							went in to the House of Representatives, where they were debating upon
							the tariff-Bill. It has occupied the house several weeks, and is not
							nearly finished— Many of the members came and conversed with me.
								<persRef ref="plumer-william2">Plumer</persRef> told me that
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> had mentioned to him
							his having heard that I had made a Declaration of hostility to <persRef

							Crawford had since the commencement of the present Session of Congress,
							changed their views, favourably towards me. That they had come here,
							intending to combine the interests of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> with those of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, but that Clay had alienated them
							by his conduct, and now they were more amicable towards me— That Forsyth
							had spoken to Plumer confidentially, but with permission to him, to
							communicate what he said to me— I desired Plumer to tell Forsyth, that I
							had never made any declaration of hostility to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford, and felt none. But when told that I had made or
							agreed to a Coalition with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, to
							serve under him, I had denied it, and had said that if my friends should
							ultimately be compelled to vote for another man, I did not believe
							Crawford would be the man— <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W.
								Taylor</persRef> read to me part of two Letters he had received from
							Albany; one from <persRef ref="cramer-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cramer</persRef> the Senator, pressing the necessity of
							concentrating upon one man the opposition to Crawford— This is the

								>Forsyth</persRef> had spoken to <persRef ref="plumer-william2"
								>Plumer</persRef>— The rumour of a declaration of hostility by me,
							at the last Drawing Room, against <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef>. I told him I had made no declaration of
							hostility against Crawford, and felt none— I did not recollect having
							conversed with any one at the last Drawing-Room, upon the Subject; but I
							had said in answer to questions whether I had assented to a Coalition
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, in subordination to him,
							that no such coalition existed— That it was impossible that I should
							form a part of an Administration, under M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford—and that if my friends should ultimately vote for another, I
							did not believe M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford would be the
							man— Burton said that he felt very anxious for the Event of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s being withdrawn— That his
							health was exceedingly precarious. That his life was very uncertain, and
							he, Burton was very anxious that in the Event of Crawford’s failure, I
							should have the next support of his friends. He was especially afraid of
							Western Politics, and of <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>— I
							went over the ground again with Burton, and assigned to him the decisive
							objections to my serving under M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford.
							That I could not place myself in that relation to him, with the feelings
							essential to a zealous and heart prompted discharge of its duties;—nor
							without sacrificing not only my personal standing towards Crawford, as
							from man to man; but also that of my own section of the Country to his—
							So far as it would be a sacrifice of mere personal pride, I could make
							it; but as that of the relative consideration of my State and Section I
							could not— Burton said he had told Crawford of my remarks to the same
							effect heretofore; to which Crawford had answered, that there was great
							weight in them; but that he still thought his chance for election better
							than mine— That, I observed was to be determined <pb type="ms" n="128"
							/>by the event— Perhaps neither of us might prove to be the strongest. I
							told him further that intimations of a similar character to those that I
							had received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s friends, had
							since been made by partizans of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson</persRef>, and had received
							answers substantially the same— <persRef ref="woodward-augustus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> A. B. Woodward</persRef> came with
							several additional papers in vindication of his character to be laid
							before the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="ames-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ames</persRef>
							came to my house and afterwards to the Office with information that
								<persRef ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holmes</persRef>, a Senator from Maine intended to oppose his
							nomination as Marshal for the District of Maine— He says that a person
							named <persRef ref="green-peter">Peter Green</persRef> now here told
							him, not directly from Holmes but with intimation that he spoke
							advisedly, that if he Ames, would pledge himself to vote for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and support his Election, Holmes
							would then make no opposition— And Green told Ames, he had no doubt that
								<persRef ref="greene-benjamin">Benjamin Green</persRef>, Ames’s
							rival candidate for the Office of Marshal, had given Holmes this pledge.
							Now Benjamin Green of his own accord, after he knew that Ames had been
							nominated for Marshal, protested to me in the most explicit and earnest
							vows, that under every possible event he should exert all the influence
							that he possessed— Wherefore I do not believe that he gave Holmes any
							pledge to support Crawford— But to some politicians electioneering
							promises are like custom-house Oaths to some traders— Ames says that the
							whole amount of the charge against him is that during the late War he
							was part owner of a Schooner which went out with a double set of papers
							to elude capture by the British— That he could furnish proof that Holmes
							was at the same time concerned in vessels that furnished the British
							with provisions. He says that Holmes intends also to oppose the

								Crowninshield</persRef> called and left with me a Letter to him from

							Dearborn answers that this is impossible— That the impulse there is
							given for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> as

							Crowninshield could not wait, but said he would call upon me in a day or

								Taylor</persRef> of Caroline, the Senator from Virginia, had
							mentioned to him that there was a rumour circulated in that State, that
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> had made his Will,
							bequeathing his Estate to a public institution, or to his native town,
							and that from this it was inferred that I was labouring under his
							displeasure, and it was producing unfavourable political impressions
							concerning my personal character. He said Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Taylor had thoughts of writing to my father about it— I
							told Wyer that I should be glad if Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Taylor would write; that my father’s conduct to me had been that of a
							most affectionate father; and that he had not left it to the disposal of
							a Will to bestow upon me my portion of his Estate— He had conveyed it to
							me by deed, irrevocable by himself. I stated to him the various
							dispositions, advantageous to me already made by my father, and his
							undeviating kindness to me— This utterly groundless rumour, is a new
							ingredient in the electioneering cauldron—what next?— <persRef

							disavowal, which Sullivan had made of the Constitutional obstacles of

							their authority being joint would cease to exist— I suggested to him the
							alternative, of obtaining positive Instructions from <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">Governor Eustis</persRef>; but he said that
							Pearce would pay no regard to any Instructions— I think this hardly
							probable; but Pearce’s conduct has been quite extraordinary— Sullivan
							said that on resigning he should not immediately go home, but would
							remain here or go into Virginia for four or five weeks—which I conclude
							is with a view to await the Event of the Massachusetts Election— He
							spoke also of endeavouring to get the Message on the claim referred to a
							Committee of the whole House without sending it to any special
							Committee; but this would be a departure from the usual course; the

									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Van Ness</persRef> called, as I had

							had endorsed for <persRef ref="moulton-mary">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Moulton</persRef>— But that I had wished to see him Van

							secondly as he had been present when I had the falling out with Kerr at
							the Bank last Saturday; I wished to explain to him the circumstances of
							the case, and to say that I was ready to do everything that could justly
							be required of me for having endorsed my name upon the Note— I had since
							sending for him received his Letter informing me that the President and
							Directors of the Metropolis would pursue the affair no further,
							considering it altogether as a private concern of M<hi

							prove the unfairness of Kerr’s proceedings— He gave me his impressions
							upon the subject generally, and professed his disposition to bring the
							matter to an accommodation, to which I expressed my ready assent— I had
							received a note from the President, summoning a Cabinet Meeting at one—
							And found there Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs. </hi><persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef ref="southard-samuel"

								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> is yet Convalescent, and nearly well;
							but not sufficiently so to attend this day. The President had a Letter
							to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, from the Chairman of the Committee of
							Ways and Means, <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M’Lane</persRef>, requesting
							various statements respecting the transaction of business in the
							Auditor’s Offices, and his, the <pb type="ms" n="132"/>President’s <hi
								rend="italic">opinion</hi>, whether without public inconvenience the
							office of fourth Auditor may be suppressed— The same questions had
							already been presented in a Letter from M’Lane to the Secretary of the
							Treasury, upon the General Appropriation Bill— That was referred by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford to the President, and by him
							after a Cabinet Meeting back to the Treasury for a Report, which, owing
							probably to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s illness has not
							been made— The present application from the Chairman of a Committee,
							directly to the President was thought improper, and of dangerous
							tendency as a Precedent. The proper course to take with it, was to refer
							it to the Treasury Department for a Report, and that the President
							should request M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane to call upon him,
							and personally suggest to him the necessity of giving it that direction—
							Whether the President should write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’Lane, inviting him to call, or send him a message by <persRef
								ref="everett-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> his private Secretary was matter of doubt;
							Discussion, between the President, and Committees of either house of
							Congress, can never be proper, and are never sought but by Chairmen of
							Committees disaffected to the Executive— The President also read the
							draft of a Message that he had prepared to send to Congress, upon the
							recent Correspondence with the Cherokee Chiefs, and the remonstrance and
							protest of the Georgia Delegation. He will send them all as Documents,
							with a Report from the Secretary of War, containing statements of facts;
							but without noticing the Georgia Protest— The draft of the Message also
							referring to the positive demand of the Georgians, that the Cherokees
							should be removed from their State by force, recommending to Congress
							profoundly to weigh, the obligations of the Union to Georgia, and the
							rights of the Indians, concluded by saying that as the refusal of the
							Cherokees to remove was absolute and peremptory, Congress alone were
							competent to authorise the employment of force—to remove them. I
							observed that there was so much neutrality between the parties in this,
							that the message might be construed into a recommendation to Congress to
							authorize the use of force, and if this was not intended something
							should be said to shew, that Georgia had no right to claim it, and that
								<unclear>the</unclear> Indians had perfect right on their side, in
							refusing to remove— This remark was supported by Calhoun and Southard,
							and the President wrote a paragraph of that import, to be inserted in
							the Message. I expressed the opinion also, that the Report of the
							Secretary of War to the President, should directly notice, and answer
							the charges of the Georgia Remonstrance, against the Government of the
							United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard wished that this
							might be done; but that the Department of State should be charged with
							it. Calhoun was not <pb type="ms" n="133"/>inclined to undertake it, and
							said the Charges were of a nature which did not admit of being answered—
							They were charges of bad faith; of fraud and hypocrisy— The exertions of
							humanity, and the measures for promoting the Civilization of the
							Indians, were stigmatized as perfidy towards Georgia—how was it possible
							to answer this?— I thought it, by no means difficult to answer; but as
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun seemed unwilling to undertake
							it, I did not urge it— Perhaps silence is the best answer to imputations
							so gross and unfounded. I had taken to the President’s various papers,
							and among them some relating to the discharge from imprisonment of a man
							named <persRef ref="bulloch-archibald">Bulloch</persRef>, formerly
							Collector at Savannah, and to <persRef ref="morrell-john"
								>Morel</persRef> the Marshal, one of his bondsmen; both men, whose
							characters no honest word can express. I left the papers with the
							President— The Meeting continued till 5— Evening at the Theatre— Saw the
							Heir at Law, very wretchedly performed, and did not stay to see the
							Woodman’s Hut, again repeated. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

								ref="burton-hutchins">Burton</persRef>, that I could assent to no
							Coalition, to support M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford for the

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and his friends— Mallary said that
							he had no doubt the main force of Clay would go to Crawford; in which I
							entirely concurred. I was also fully convinced that the main force of
								<persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, and the
							stragglers of Calhoun will go over to Jackson— Seymour appeared anxious
							to ascertain; for whom it would be best to vote as Vice-President— I
							said I believed the popular feeling in New-England had already received
							such an impulse, that it was no longer controulable— Nor did I think it
							worth while, to attempt the controul of it— I was convinced it would
							give no dissatisfaction to General Jackson or his friends that he should
							be voted for as Vice-President, by those who should support me for the
							Presidency, and if others should carry him to the Presidency itself, we
							must as in every other Event of the same election acquiesce in the voice
							of the Nation as delivered through its constitutional organs— I told
							them I was very sure I had nothing to expect, and was not <pb type="ms"
								n="134"/>willing to have any thing to ask, in the way of support to
							me, from any other Candidate, or his friends— I desired to stand only
							upon my own ground, and would not crave assistance from any other
							quarter. I wished my friends to vote for Jackson as Vice-President,
							because I thought the place suited to him, and him suited to the place.
							The thing was fitting in itself, and perfectly well suited to the usual
							geographical distribution of the two Offices,—on public principles it
							was unexceptionable, and I would not look further for determining
							motives— <persRef ref="cheves-langdon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							upon the Slave-indemnity Commission, came to inform me of the present
							state of things in that board, and to advise with me concerning its
							future proceedings— The object of the <persRef ref="jackson-george"
								>British Commissioner</persRef> and <persRef ref="mctavish-john"
								>Arbitrator</persRef> is to protract and ultimately to disagree, and
							there is doubt whether in the disagreement itself they will make a
							question which the umpire will be able to decide— The evidence of the
							average value is now closed on the part of this Government; and the
							British Commissioner asks of ours to propose a specific sum; intending
							then to propose one on his part; and then support it by documentary
							evidence— And as the right of offering any evidence on their part is
							questioned he proposes to offer his documents not as Evidence, but as
							argument in support of his estimate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jackson it seems considers the question of the average value, not as a
							point to be decided upon his oath, but as a preliminary Negotiation—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves asked whether it would not be

							13.6.7.8.9. [“]He spake also this parable; a certain man had a fig-tree
							planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found
							none.— Then said he unto the dresser of the vineyard, Behold these three
							years I come seeking fruit on this figtree, and find none: cut it down,
							why cumbereth it the ground?— And he answering said unto him, Lord, let
							it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:— And if
							it bear fruit, <hi rend="italic">well</hi>: and if not, then after that
							thou shalt cut it down.”— The preacher appealed to the Consciences of
							all his hearers, about thirty, to say whether they were not barren fig
							trees, and with great solemnity warned them of the consequences— This
							Parable, like the rest of those spoken by Jesus, was addressed to his
							immediate hearers, and to the People of his own age: it inculcated
							righteousness, and called for the fruits of repentance— But it
							attributes so much to the power of cultivation, for making the fig tree
							bear, that it is not a sound Calvinistic text: the preacher was
							perplexed with it, and resorted to <persRef ref="scott-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott’s</persRef> commentary to
							explain it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker gave notice that unless

							respecting the publication of Sullivan’s Letters in justification of

							demand of the Governor, whether Eustis or <persRef ref="lathrop-samuel"

							this Agency of G. Hay’s— The Senate by a large Majority restored it— And
							the House after two days debate, this day again agreed 113 to 51. to
							insist upon its being struck out— I received last Evening a Letter from
								<persRef ref="roberts-frink">Frink Roberts</persRef> of Boston,
							announcing that he had just arrived, with a Letter from <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">William Eustis</persRef>, and asking time and

							wanted an Office, suitable for the support of nine Children— And
							introductions to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> whom he
							wished only to see— He wrote me towards Evening a Letter repeating this

							and mentioned various complaints against the District Attorney <persRef

							incompatible Offices and other like grievances— Also prosecuting and
							causing to be imprisoned for several Months an Indian. I told them if
							these complaints were made to obtain Roane’s removal, they must be
							preferred in writing, with reference to the proof supporting them, and
							so that he may have the opportunity of defending himself against them—
								<persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef> was here; and proposes leaving the City to go to

								Crawford</persRef> in 1813. when Minister in France. The claimant
							is<space/>and when Buck brought the papers before, a certificate of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford was wanted as a voucher— He had
							now got it, signed with initials W. H. C. scarce recognizable— Received
							a Note from the President calling a Cabinet Meeting at one, which I
							attended. <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> were there— Southard said he had
							been told that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had sent the
							President a Message to inform him that his health was now sufficiently
							restored to attend Administration Meetings, if he should call him to
							them— The President said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford might
							have said this to <persRef ref="everett-charles">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Everett</persRef>, but he had heard nothing of it. There
							were now two subjects for consultation— The re-nomination of <persRef
								ref="bates-barnabas">Bates</persRef>, as Collector at Bristol,
							Rhode-Island, and the Message on the compact with <pb type="ms" n="137"
							/>Georgia, and the Cherokee titles. There were specific written charges
							against Bates, by <persRef ref="dewolf-james">D’Wolfe</persRef>, the
							Senator from Rhode-Island, and two large bundles of papers for and
							against him— Owing to the illness of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford or to his unwillingness to decide on the case; nothing has been
							determined at the Treasury Department, and the President after having
							examined all the papers himself, had yet not made up his mind on the
							merits— There had been a reference to the first Comptroller, <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">Anderson</persRef>— The President now sent for
							him, and he came— He could not make an unfavourable Report, upon the
							part of the complaint submitted to him; but he was competent only to
							pronounce on the Accounts; and not on the employment of monies: And he
							flinched from all superfluous responsability— Bates’s term of service
							expires on the fifth of next Month, and a speedy nomination to the
							Office is necessary— After various expedients suggested and discarded,
							the President wrote a Note to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford,
							referring the papers to him for a Report, and suggesting that if the
							state of his health does not admit of his preparing it, he may charge
							his <persRef ref="brooke-samuel">Chief Clerk</persRef> with it— Southard
							asked me who had signed all Crawfords warrants throughout the Winter— I
							supposed himself— Southard said he had been for Months unable to write
							his name— On the Georgia compact and Indian Land rights, the President
							read a new draft of a Message, different from that of the last Meeting—
							In this, he very distinctly declared his opinion that the Indians cannot
							with Justice be removed from their Lands within the State of Georgia by
							force— But after setting forth all that has been done by the Government
							of the Union, in fulfilment of the compact; the positive refusal of the
							Cherokees, to cede any more of their lands upon any terms whatever, and
							the impossibility of devising any other means short of force to prevail
							upon them to go, there was a new and rather elaborate argument
							introduced, of the absolute necessity that the Indians should remove,
							West of the Mississippi. And after concluding that nothing further could
							be done by the Executive, there were distinct intimations that something
							should be done by Congress. I objected that this gave an appearance of
							incongruity to the message. For it was an issue between the National
							Executive and the Georgia Delegation; and after taking completely from
							under them the ground upon which they themselves stood, it gave them new
							ground to stand upon. It gave them the means of peremptorily claiming
							something further, and immediately from Congress. And if that was
							intended, I insisted, that the Executive ought to have some practicable
							project matured, and requiring nothing but the sanction of Congress to
							carry it into effect— The President said that no such project was
							prepared, nor had he any particular measure in view— Five or six years
							since about one third part of the Cherokee Nation were prevailed upon to
							surrender their Lands and remove beyond the Mississippi, and there is
							now in the City, a deputation from them also, complaining that they are
							as much <pb type="ms" n="138"/>disturbed and crowded upon by the whites,
							as they were before their removal— I asked if it could be supposed that
							the deputation from the old Georgia Cherokees now here, were ignorant of
							this, or that they would be encouraged to abandon their old
							establishments for promises of a new one such as their tribesmen had
							found West of the Mississippi— Calhoun and Southard, inclined to support
							my remarks. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt proposed the omission of
							certain passages directly recommending to Congress to decide upon some
							measure to be taken. But I thought the proposal of a measure necessarily
							followed from the purport of the argument, which I thought it would be
							best to omit altogether. The President said he would consider of it
							further— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun read the draft of his
							Report to the President upon the papers, which was a full statement of
							facts, shewing all that has been done in performance of the compact, but
							with scarcely an allusion to the paper signed by the Georgia delegation.
							The President spoke of the compact as a very unfavourable bargain to the
							United States, as it certainly was. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun thinks that the great difficulty arises from the progress of the
							Cherokees in civilization. They are now within the limits of Georgia
							about 15000 and increasing in equal proportion with the whites—all
							cultivators; with a representative Government; judicial Courts;
							Lancaster Schools, and permanent property— <persRef ref="ridge-major"
								>Ridge</persRef>, <persRef ref="hicks-charles">Hicks</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="lowry-george">Lowry</persRef> now here, are principal
							Chiefs, and <persRef ref="ross-john">Ross</persRef>. They write their
							own State papers, and reason as logically as most white diplomatists.
							Each of the Chiefs here named possesses from 50000 to 100000 dollars,
							property— One of the heaviest grievances of the Georgia Delegation is
							that in the Correspondence between the War Department and these Chiefs,
							there is a Letter from the Secretary of War to them; addressing them by
							the Style of “Gentlemen”— This was an inadvertency of a Clerk,
							overlooked by Calhoun in signing the paper, but in which the Georgians
							think there was deep design— The Cabinet Meeting continued till near 5—
							Evening at the Theatre— Clari or the Maid of Milan; an Opera by <persRef
								ref="payne-john">John H. Payne</persRef>. Tis <persRef
								ref="marmontel-jean">Marmontel’s</persRef> Tale of Laurette
							dramatised, with the interpolation of the Garden Play in Hamlet— The
							dialogue is vulgar and inelegant. Without point or humour, though with
							efforts at both— The songs flat, and vapid; and the moral common place.—
							The After-piece ’Tis all a Farce, was laughable— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> was up, all this day, but still confined to her

							member from Tennessee, and <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore
								Rodgers</persRef>— Also of Cocke’s interviews, with <persRef

							disadvantage of Cocke, and are in great circulation.</p>

							altogether on the side of the United States, and the French Government
