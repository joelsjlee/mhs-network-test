						<p><date>1824. Thursday 2. December.</date> Cabinet Meeting. Present J. Q.
							Adams, <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawford</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Sam<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> L.
								Southard</persRef>. The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> read draughts of two additional paragraphs for
							the Message. One relating to claims of our Citizens upon the European
							Governments of France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Naples, and
							the other concerning the Piracies still so annoying to our Commerce from
							the Island of Cuba. With regard to the claims, he said, as there had
							been a Resolution of the House of Representatives, at their last
							Session, concerning them, he thought it would be proper to notice them
							more particularly than he had done in his first draught— It was
							desirable especially to shew to France that however she might now refuse
							to negotiate upon the claims, we should not abandon them— If we once
							admitted her demand of connecting the negotiation for the claims with
							one upon her pretensions under the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Article of the Louisiana Treaty, we concede the principle that one is a
							set off for the other— The Cuba piracies, had in some respects changed
							their character— They were now committed in Boats, from the Shores,
							which no large vessel could pursue, and the Pirates had accomplices on
							shore in the Cities, to such an extent that <persRef ref="vives-don"
								>Governor Vives</persRef> although well disposed to suppress them,
							was overawed by their strength— <persRef ref="randall-thomas">Captain
								Randall</persRef> our Agent had just returned <hi
								rend="strikethrough">to</hi> from the Havanna, and urged the
							absolute necessity of some further measure for the Protection of our
							Commerce— The President said he had read to him the paragraph prepared
							and now offered for consideration, and he had doubted only whether it
							was strong enough— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford approved of
							the two new paragraphs. No objection was made to them by any other
							person present; but I observed if there was any necessity for such
							additions it might deserve Consideration whether they should not be
							rather more pointed.— That under the general terms of the Message as
							first draughted, Congress would take up the subjects noticed in it,
							according to their own views of them, and without special bias from the
							Executive— But if they were to be emphatically marked in the Message it
							might be expected that some specific measure should be recommended. I
							referred to the Report of the Committee of Foreign Relations of the
							House of Representatives at their last Session, relating to the
							Piracies, and Porto-Rico privateers, which; declared that their only
							motive for forbearing to recommend reprizals and blockade, was to give
							time for the Executive to call upon the Spanish Government; for
							reparation and remedy, and to the strong Note of <persRef
								ref="nelson-hugh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nelson</persRef>,
							to the Spanish Government founded upon that Report. And at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s request I read the concluding
							paragraph of the Committee’s Report— This led to some discussion; and I
							remarked that <persRef ref="porter-david">Commodore Porter</persRef> was
							already authorised by his Instructions, to <hi rend="italic">land</hi>
							in cases of necessity, in fresh pursuit <pb type="ms" n="565"/>pursuit
							of the Pirates— The President, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, all contested this fact
							upon recollection; as I persisted in mine, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard went to the Department; and brought the Volume of
							Instructions; upon reference to which, it was found as I had stated; the
							authority to land however, being limited to the unsettled parts of the
							Island— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun thought that the new
							paragraph for the message should <hi rend="italic">refer</hi> to the
							proceedings at the last Session; to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Nelson’s late remonstrance; and proceed as in pursuance of what has
							already been done. The President did not decide whether he would now
							modify the paragraph, or introduce it as it is— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard noticed that the Report of the Committee of foreign
							Relations in glancing at Reprisals and blockade, referred specially to
							the Porto Rico privateers, none of which are now out; and not to the
							Cuba piracies— But I replied, that the Report embraced references to <hi
								rend="italic">both</hi>; And that although the privateers were put
							down, the denial of reparation for their spoliations, was more signal on
							the part of Spain now, than it had been at the last Session. Instancing
							particularly the condemnation of the James Lawrence, at the Court of
							appeal in Cuba— This was the strongest case of depredation, that had
							occurred— The one upon which Captain Randall had been first sent out—
							Yet flagrant as it was, the vessel and Cargo, which had been cleared in
							the original Court, have both been condemned at the Court of appeal.
							There is yet an appeal to the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of
								Spain</persRef> and the Council of the Indias— And there it is, that
							measures of decision now recommended by the President and adopted by
							Congress would operate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford told the
							President that he would send him the Treasury Minutes for the Message
							to-morrow. In answer to a question from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun, he said the Revenue from impost would amount to 19
							Millions—from lands to less than one. He said he had not received the
							copy of the Convention with Russia; which was sent to him yesterday.</p>

						<p><pb type="ms" n="567"/><date>1824. Monday 6. December.</date><persRef
								ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron Tuyll</persRef> the Russian Minister
							wrote me a note requesting an immediate interview in consequence of
							Instructions received yesterday from his Court— He came, and after
							intimating that he was under some embarrassment in executing his
							Instructions, said, that the Russian American Company upon learning the
							purport of the Northwest Coast Convention, concluded last June by
								<persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef>, were extremely dissatisfied—(a jetté de haut
							cris) and by means of their influence had prevailed upon his Government
							to send him these Instructions upon two points—One was that he should
							deliver upon the exchange of the Ratifications of the Convention an
							explanatory note, purporting that the Russian Government did not
							understand that the Convention would give Liberty to the Citizens of the
							United States to trade on the Coast of Siberia, and the Aleutian
							Islands. The other was to propose a modification of the Convention, by
							which our vessels should be prohibited from trading on the Northwest
							coast North of Latitude 57— With regard to the former of these points he
							left with me a minute in writing— I told him that we should be disposed
							to do every thing to accommodate the views of his Government that was in
							our power—but that a modification of the Convention <hi rend="italic"
								>could</hi> be made no otherwise than by a new Convention; and that
							the Construction of the Convention as concluded belonged to other
							Departments of the Government, for which the Executive had no authority
							to stipulate— That if on the Exchange of the Ratifications he should
							deliver to me a note of the purport of that which he now informally gave
							me, I should give him an answer of that import: namely that the
							Construction of Treaties depending here upon the judiciary tribunals,
							the Executive Government even if disposed to acquiesce in that of the
							Russian Government as announced by him, could not be binding upon the
							Courts, nor upon this Nation— I added that the Convention would be
							submitted immediately to the Senate— That if any thing affecting its
							construction, or still more, modifying its meaning were to be presented
							on the part of the Russian Government before or at the exchange of the
							Ratifications, it must be laid before the Senate; and could have no
							other possible effect, than of starting doubts and perhaps hesitation in
							that body, and of favouring the views of those, if such there were, who
							might wish to defeat the ratification itself of the Convention— This was
							an object of great solicitude to both Governments; not only for the
							adjustment of a difficult question which had arisen between them; but
							for the promotion of that harmony which was so much in the policy of the
							two Countries which might emphatically be termed natural friends to each
							other. If therefore he would permit me to suggest to him what I thought
							would be his best course, it would be to wait for the exchange of the
							Ratifications, and make it purely and simply— That <hi rend="italic"
								>afterwards</hi>, <pb type="ms" n="568"/>afterwards, if the
							instructions of his Government were imperative, he might present the
							note, to which I now informed him would be in substance my answer. It
							necessarily could not be otherwise. But if his instructions left it
							discretionary with him, he would do still better to inform his
							Government of the state of things here, of the purport of our
							Conference, and of what my answer must be if he should present the note—
							I believed his Court would then deem it best that he should not present
							the note at all— Their apprehensions had been excited by an interest not
							very friendly to the good Understanding, between the United States and
							Russia— Our merchants would not go to trouble the Russians on the Coast
							of Siberia, or North of the 57<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> degree of
							Latitude: and it was wisest not to put such fancies into their heads. At
							least the Imperial Government might wait to see the operation of the
							Convention, before taking any further step, and I was confident they
							would hear no complaint resulting from it— If they should, then would be
							the time for adjusting the construction or negotiating a modification of
							the Convention, and whoever might be at the head of the Administration
							of the United States, he might be assured that every disposition would
							be cherished to remove all courses of dissatisfaction and to accommodate
							the wishes and the just policy of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef>— The Baron said that these ideas had occurred to
							himself— That he had made this application in pursuance of his
							instructions; but he was aware of the distribution of Powers in our
							Constitution, and of the incompetency of the Executive to adjust such
							questions— He would therefore wait for the exchange of the
							ratifications, without presenting his note, and reserve for future
							consideration whether to present it shortly afterwards, or to inform his
							Court of what he has done, and ask their further instructions upon what
							he shall definitively do on the subject— He therefore requested me to
							consider what had now passed between us as if it had not taken place
							(non-avenu) to which I readily assented; assuring him, as I had done
							heretofore that the President had the highest personal confidence in
							him, and in his exertions to foster the harmony between the two
							Countries— I reported immediately to the President the substance of this
							Conversation, and he concurred in the propriety of the Baron’s final
							determination.</p>
