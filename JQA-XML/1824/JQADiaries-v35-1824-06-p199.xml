								>P.U.S.</persRef> who at first thought it would be proper to send
							them— But <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> afterwards coming in,
							it had been thought on reflection that it would have the appearance of
							volunteering testimony— And that Edwards had lost himself, and would
							certainly sink under this affair, so that interference now might connect
							unnecessarily the administration with the Odium which would be attached
							to him— That the effort of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> agents now was to
							fix upon the President and other members of the Administration, a
							combination and concert with Edwards to attack Crawford; while the fact
							was directly the reverse, and Crawford’s career had been an
							uninterrupted series of Attacks upon the Administration always disavowed
							or disguised by himself— That in this state of things the cause of the
							Administration should be kept as distinct as possible from that of
							Edwards—and when the issue is made with Crawford, it should be on
							independent ground— To this Calhoun yielded, but brought the Letters to
							me, to consult me upon them— I said I should not oppose my opinion to
							those of the President, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt— But I believed it would
							ultimately be impossible to avoid the <pb type="ms" n="203"/>issue, and
							inclined to think it would be as well to take it now, as at any time— I
							had observed in the newspapers statements that Cook and Edwards had
							declined answering the question through whom the packet had been
							transmitted, and intimations that it had gone through the war Office—
							But there was another occasion on which his Calhoun’s name had been
							mentioned by <persRef ref="noble-james">Noble</persRef>; in relating his
							conversation with Edwards; and upon a call from Edwards to tell <hi
								rend="italic">all</hi> the Conversation, he had stated that Edwards
							told him he had long expected this Mexican Appointment— That the
							President was in his power through the means of <persRef
								ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane</persRef>;
							and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun—here the witness was
							stopped by <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Livingston</persRef>, and <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef> had agreed
							that it was not relevant— Now this stopping of the testimony would
							operate worse on the public mind, than if every thing had come out. And
							come out it all ultimately must— Calhoun said he believed so too; but
							that it should be by the Presidents acting directly upon Crawford— It
							was impossible for an Administration in this Country to get along with
							one of its Members in secret and perpetual hostility against it— This
							had been the case with Crawford from 1816 down to this day— And what had
							been for the last nine Months the situation of the Treasury— No
							Secretary but <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef>;
							scarcely any papers signed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford,
							and a facsimile, engraved, and <persRef ref="crawford-caroline">his
								daughters</persRef> hand, used even for most of these— I asked if
							these were <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>— They were <hi rend="italic"
								>said</hi> to be— Did the President <hi rend="italic">know</hi>,
							what the real management at the Treasury was—he believed not— Had the
							President <hi rend="italic">any</hi> distrust of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford? He believed he had <hi rend="italic">now</hi>—from
							what he had said this Morning— I said the President had never intimated
							to me the slightest distrust of Crawford— And I had never hinted a
							sentiment of distrust of him to the President— In the case of <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">L. Harris</persRef> had sworn to the thing that
							was not; but I attributed it altogether to an error of Memory. I had two
							years ago, but to the President certain questions in writing which he
							had promised me he would answer in writing; but had not yet done so— As
							the material fact was of the <hi rend="italic">day</hi>, when a thing
							was said, I was afraid that his own memory would not serve him to speak
							precisely— But he would not, for he could not sustain the assertion of
							Crawford— I had done every thing that man could honestly do, to keep on
							terms with him— But I expected it would ultimately not be possible— He
							asked if the President could not <hi rend="italic">now</hi> remove him—
							I said no— He could not, because though for years he had been giving
							ample cause for it, there was yet nothing new, upon which a case could
							be made out— Much more conversation to this effect— Southard came in—

							He says also that <persRef ref="oneal-william">O’Neal</persRef> had told
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> that a Clerk

							of Stephenson’s Letter, he took it to the person; who read it; and said
							that was the Letter— But he would upon no earthly consideration consent
							to be summoned to testify to the fact— And O’Neal was equally unwilling
							to be examined; and objected that it would implicate General Jackson—
							Upon which Cook said Edwards had concluded rather to lose the benefit of
							the testimony than to involve Jackson— He said there was nothing to
							affect Edwards’s credit except Noble’s testimony, and if the Committee
							should report against Edwards, he thought he would resign, and make his
							final appeal to Congress at their next Session.</p>

						<p><date>21. VI:45.</date> Note from <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>P.U.S.</persRef> Cabinet Meeting at 1/2 past nine. Report of the
							Committee of investigation, with all the documents, brought about Noon,
							by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew">Clarke</persRef> Clerk of H.R. to P.U.S.
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> present— Papers read— Report of
							the Committee— <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef>— Reply to
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford’s</persRef> answer—
							His argument on the Evidence— <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Forsyth’s</persRef> remarks— Depositions of <persRef
								ref="noble-james">Noble</persRef>, <persRef ref="mason-john">J.
								Mason</persRef>, <persRef ref="elkins-unknown4">Elkins</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="wharton-unknown">Wharton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">Dickins</persRef>— Much discussion upon what is
							to be done. P.U.S. read a draft of a notification to Edwards of the
							revocation of his Commission as Minister to Mexico. I questioned upon
							what assignable motive this step could be taken— The Committee have
							passed no censure upon him— But it is apprehended that Noble’s testimony
							of his having denied that he was the author of the A. B. publications,
							and pronounced a panegyric upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford,
							while the nomination to the Mexican Mission was before the Senate, will
							blast his character before the Nation, and the President thinks that if
							he does not remove him, his own character will be blasted too. Calhoun
							said that every one of Edwards’s charges against M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford was substantiated; but still thought that he must
							be removed, unless he should resign— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard <pb type="ms" n="205"
							/>concurred in this opinion— Mine was that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Edwards for his own sake, and in justice to his own
							character ought to resign, but that this act ought to be entirely
							voluntary on his part, and if he should not resign, there was nothing in
							the report of the Committee, or in the proceedings of the House, or in
							the Documents, which would justify the President in removing him— Much
							warm and animated discussion upon this point. In supporting with the
							most consciencious earnestness my own sentiment, I avowed the
							determination to acquiesce in the decision of the President— It was
							thought advisable to ascertain what were M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Edwards’s own intentions, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt as his
							particular and intimate friend was requested to see and converse with
								<persRef ref="cook-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cook</persRef> to this end— I was earnestly desirous that this
							consultation should be confined merely to the enquiry what M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards proposed to do, without intimating
							to him even a wish on the part of the Executive that he would resign—
							The subject assumed a range of discussion involving the whole conduct of
							the Administration, from its commencement— The invaried hostile position
							of all M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s partizans to the
							Administration, and his own ambiguous conduct, always disavowing, yet
							never controuling the opposition of his friends, were freely noticed—
							The President read parts of a Letter from Crawford to him of 4. July
							1822. of his answer, written in August, and of a reply from Crawford in
							September or October all originating in a Letter from <persRef
								ref="scott-alexander">A. Scott</persRef> then at Pensacola to
							Crawford, mentioning a rumour there, that <hi rend="italic">he was to be
								removed</hi>. This correspondence was a partial clearing up of
							clouds and suspicions—and terminated in the expression of the
							President’s wish that Crawford should continue in the Administration— He
							disavowed any intentional opposition, explained some oppositions of
							opinion; and intimated suspicions that from two quarters prejudices
							against him had been excited in the President’s mind; which the
							President in reply pointedly denies— As the President omitted the
							reading of most of those parts of the Letter, I asked him if I was one
							of the persons alluded to; which he declined answering— The state of the
							Treasury for the last nine Months was adverted to; and the question
							asked whether the President knew what it was— He knew only generally
							from the Reports of the <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller
								Anderson</persRef>, that all was correctly transacted; but rumours
							are in circulation, concerning which the President declared his
							determination to enquire further— The meeting lasted till near 7. in the
							Evening, and was adjourned till 8 to-morrow Morning. After dinner, I
							called to see <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef>, who
							goes early to-morrow for home. He mentioned to me many particulars of
							the proceedings of the Committee. <persRef ref="floyd-john"
								>Floyd</persRef> the Chairman offered a Resolution declaring the
							charges of Edwards <pb type="ms" n="206"/>frivolous and malicious— This
							no other member of the Committee supported, but Webster unceasingly
							laboured to get a sentiment inserted into the Report to the same effect.
							This was resisted by Taylor who was supported by Livingston, and
							resulted in a compromise greatly moderating the proposed panegyric of
							Webster upon the management of the Treasury by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford, and forbearing all expression of Sentiment against
							Edwards— From Webster’s conduct in the Committee, Taylor has no doubt
							that he is a thorough-going political partizan of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, and he connects with it his late
							visit to <persRef ref="buchanan-james">Buchanan</persRef> in
							Pennsylvania— His persuading Noble who had already reached Pennsylvania
							on his way home to come back and testify against Edwards, and other
							movements in concert with other persons— Taylor had seen <persRef
								ref="mclean-john">M’Lean</persRef>, who he said was alarmed at this
							new and extensive <hi rend="italic">federal</hi> organization for
							Crawford; and told him he had information that the Electoral Law, would
							not pass in New-York. He referred also to a Letter in the Richmond
							Enquirer, composing in substance an Administration for Crawford of
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>, Forsyth, Webster
							and M’Lane; and a corresponding article in praise of Buchanan in
								<persRef ref="binns-john">Binns’s</persRef> paper at Philadelphia—
							M’Lean’s conclusion was of the absolute necessity, that Jackson should
							be given up all who mean to oppose the election of Crawford— Taylor told
							me he might probably see <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Clinton</persRef>
							at New-York, and asked if he should converse with him as had been
							heretofore proposed— I said yes; but advised him to say nothing that
							would either import reliance upon Clinton, or expectation of support
							from him—with this he fully concurred.</p>

						<p><date>22. VI:15.</date> Cabinet Meeting from 8. A.M. till 1/2 past nine
							in the Evening; with the interval of about an hour to dine, which we did
							at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>. Present,
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt mentioned that he had seen and conversed last Evening and this
							morning with <persRef ref="cook-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cook</persRef>; that in the course of the day, <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edwards</persRef> would send in his resignation, or give notice that
							he should expect an intimation from the President to that effect. I then
							observed that I remained of the same opinion that I had entertained from
							the beginning of this Affair— That for his own sake, for the support of
							his own character, and to take away all colour of surmise that the
							President, or any member of his Administration was in concert with him
							in his controversy with <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, he ought to resign
							his Office— But that if he should not perform this act voluntarily, I
							was of opinion, not only that he ought not to be removed; but that no
							Intimation should be given him of a wish on the part of the Executive
							that he should resign— That he should be ordered to proceed immediately
							to Mexico; with a reservation that if at the next Session of Congress,
							the House, should <pb type="ms" n="207"/>adopt any measure requiring his
							presence, he should be prepared to expect his recall, and to return at
							the shortest notice to the United States so as to be here in the course
							of the Session— I assigned at large my reasons for this opinion, which
							was that there was nothing in the course of proceedings; either of the
							House or of the Committee that would warrant his removal. So far as the
							report of the Committee went to palliate, to excuse and to justify M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, I had no objection to make to
							it— That there was in the Committee partiality to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford was certain, and the motives for
							it were easily seen— A prevailing popular clamour against Edwards, and
							personal impulses of interest and ambition in the breast of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, to catch the prospect of advancement in the Event
							of Crawford’s election. Yet with all this partiality the Committee had
							not expressed a sentiment of the slightest censure upon Edwards— Though
							Webster had caused a secret and most improper intimation to be given to
							the President that the Committee would censure Edwards; though he had
							caused most improperly the same thing to be published in the Richmond
							Enquirer, he had not been able to prevail upon the Committee to express
							any such censure. What foundation of Justice therefore was there for the
							Executive, to inflict upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards the
							whole punishment that he could if the most pointed vote of censure had
							been passed upon him, by the Committee?— Nay if he had been convicted
							upon impeachment, the whole extent of the power of the President, would
							have been to remove him— And what purpose could that now answer but to
							give M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford a triumph, not merely of
							justification but of revenge?— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said
							that the course which I proposed would he believed be that which would
							in after times appear to have been the most just and honourable— But
							that he could not help being affected by the prevailing popular
							prejudice—the universal reprobation of Edwards in the public mind—first
							excited by his apparent running away from his own accusation; and next
							by the general impression that upon his recent examination he had
							entirely sunk and lost himself before the Committee; and finally by the
							testimony of <persRef ref="noble-james">Noble</persRef>; fixing upon him
							the solemn denial while his nomination was before the Senate that he was
							the author of the A B publications which he so shortly afterwards
							avowed; and a high panegyrick upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford whom he so shortly afterwards accused— These things so affected
							his moral reputation, that it seemed scarcely possible to send him as a
							Minister in a foreign Country, without the Government itself’s catching
							the infection with which his name is tainted— About this stage of the
							discussion, came in a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards
							to the President; resigning his Commission, enclosed in a Note,
							requesting that he would keep it a few days, before filing it in the
							Department of State, that he might determine, whether he should assign
							his reasons for his resignation— This immediately changed the topic of
							deliberation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said that if there was
							no sufficient reason <pb type="ms" n="208"/>for removing Edwards, there
							was in his Wirts opinion, no reason for his resigning; and as his
							resignation had probably been sent in consequence of the Conversations
							between him, Wirt, and D. P. Cook, if the President’s opinion was that
							Edwards ought not to be removed, he ought to have the option of
							withdrawing his resignation— There was then a proposal that Cook should
							again be seen or written to by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, to
							warn Edwards to keep the tender of his resignation secret, and that if
							he pleased he might withdraw it— To this I objected; wishing that no
							unsteadiness or wavering might appear in the proceedings of the
							Executive; but I urged that the President should come to a decision, in
							the Event of Edwards’s withdrawing his Resignation; whether he would
							revoke the Commission or not— The discussion continued till Calhoun
							declared that he came over to my opinion, and Wirt said his mind was so
							divided that he was for both sides of the question— Southard was little
							less perplexed, and the President finally declined deciding till
							tomorrow— I then observed that previous to a decision it would be proper
							to complete the reading of the papers; and they were read— Calhoun,
							Southard and Wirt all expressed the opinion that Edwards was a deeply
							injured man; and Calhoun repeatedly said that all his charges against
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford were made good. They
							remarked much upon the composition of the Committee, and Calhoun said
							that one different individual in the place of Webster would have given
							an entirely a different aspect to the whole affair— Shortly after
							dinner, and while the papers were reading, the Washington Republican of
							the Evening was brought in— The resignation of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Edwards was announced in it— The reading of the papers was
							nevertheless completed; and about eight in the Evening, <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark</persRef>,
							the Clerk of the House of Representatives came and took them away for
							publication. About 5. O’Clock I went over to my Office, and looked over
							the Letters received by the Mail of the day— On returning, I found them
							at dinner. <persRef ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Monroe</persRef> and <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay</persRef> were at Table— At the
							same time with this Affair, that of <persRef ref="rector-william"
								>William Rector</persRef>, Surveyor General in Illinois, Missouri
							and Arkansas was drawing to a close— The attorney General gave in to the
							President a Report of 70 pages, against him, upon charges made by
								<persRef ref="barton-david">David Barton</persRef>, Senator from
							Missouri— <persRef ref="graham-george">G. Graham</persRef>, Commissioner
							of the Land Office, was at the President’s in the course of the day,
							upon that subject— The President postponed reading this Report till
							tomorrow. Among the observations made by the President during the day,
							he intimated that he should appoint <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
								>Poinsett</persRef> to go to Mexico; and that he intended fully to
							ascertain the real state of the management of the Treasury <pb type="ms"
								n="209"/>Department for the last nine Months— And said that if
							necessary he should appoint according to Law, a person to act, during
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s intended absence: and
							should charge me with that trust, if I would undertake it— I said I had
							no doubt he would find upon examination that the business of the
							Treasury Department had been transacted with as much accuracy and
							fidelity as was compatible with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s indisposition; and if no material inconvenience to the public
							service had occurred, or was likely to occur, I thought it would be best
							not to make the temporary appointment— The use of a fac simile of his
							signature is the only fact of questionable legality and propriety that
							has been mentioned; the fact itself was said to be established, but I
							suppose the fac simile has been kept at his own house, and used only by
							himself, or at his order. There was much comment upon it, by Calhoun,
							Southard and Wirt; and a speech of Webster’s during the Session,
							adverting to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s inability to
							discharge the duties of his Office, and to the Law applicable to the
							case, which he read, was noticed— That debate was not reported, or was
							slurred over in the National Intelligencer, but Wirt said he had heard,
							Webster’s remarks were supposed to have been intended to attract the
							attention of the President to the actual state of the Treasury— The
							range of discussion this day was over the whole history of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s Administration—and to the deadly
							opposition against it by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s
							partizans from the Seminole war debates down to the Ratification of the
							Slave-trade Convention. The President said he thought M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had not sufficiently
							discountenanced this warfare; but that he had once shewn him a reply
							from <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">Cobb</persRef>, to a Letter from
							Crawford to him, which indicated that Crawford had disapproved the <hi
								rend="italic">Trio</hi> attack of 1821— I came home this Evening so
							much exhausted by the labour of the day that I was unable to write.</p>
