								ref="bourne-w">W. F. Bourne</persRef>, son of the <persRef

							an unusual exercise of influence with the Secretary of the Navy last
							Summer, obtained a Commission for this young man as a Captain in the
							Marine Corps— It seems he has proved to be one of those upon whom
							benefits are lost; has been twice under arrest, and is now dismissed
							from the service— He came to solicit my influence to obtain his
							restoration, but I could promise him nothing more than good will to
							second any satisfactory explanation he might give to the proper
							authority— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> had told me some days since at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> that he believed he should
							be obliged to dismiss him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent came
							for the renewal of my note for him—to be discounted at the U.S. Branch
							Bank, which I accordingly gave him. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay
							to tell me of what he called the second Lowriad—a paper written by him
							and published in the Washington Republican of this Evening, to prove
							that the President never read any Letter of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, either to <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef> or to <persRef
								ref="roberts-jonathan">Jonathan Roberts</persRef> or to <persRef
								ref="lacock-abner">A. Lacock</persRef>— Wirt, who has just returned
							from Baltimore came to talk with me, about <persRef ref="edwards-ninian"
								>N. Edwards</persRef>, and the President’s extreme anxieties
							relating to him— He said that Edwards ought to resign. That the
							President, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard were
							all of that opinion—and that he Wirt was decidedly so— I told him that
							had been my opinion from the beginning— That <persRef ref="cook-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef> had yesterday
							told me it was his, and I had unequivocally expressed to him that it was
							mine—of which I had no doubt that he had informed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards— Wirt said he had a great regard
							and Friendship for Edwards, and regretted to find, as he <pb type="ms"
								n="347"/>had seen at Baltimore, that the opinion of all parties was
							against him. I said it was so every where; and far more so than he
							deserved, because the real merits of the principal question between him
							and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, were not considered by the public—
							In their controversies, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford was the
							first aggressor, as far back as the appointment of <persRef
								ref="thomas-jesse">Jesse B. Thomas</persRef>, Edwards’s rival and
							competitor in Illinois, to examine the Land-Offices, and Banks, in that
							and the neighbouring States. That was undoubtedly a movement in concert
							with Thomas, for purposes hostile to Edwards— From that time they have
							been in adverse positions and with mutual recriminations, till
							Crawford’s ambiguous imputation of perjury to Edwards, in the report to
							the House of 22 March last— This was a charge at once insidious and
							cruel— Edwards was bound to meet and repel it— But as he had not left
							the City when it was made, he should have stopped and met it here— By
							leaving the City, and sending back his Address from Wheeling; by
							blending with it charges of official malfeasance against Crawford, and
							by avowing himself the author of the anonymous A. B. publications of the
							last year, he has placed himself in the position of a public accuser,
							under circumstances most unfavourable to himself. For although he has
							proved almost every fact that he had alleged, yet Crawford’s defence
							takes off all the edge of evil intentions, and the public are not only
							indulgent to all the errors, and inadvertencies proved upon him, but
							ascribe malicious and corrupt motives to Edwards for bringing forward
							the charges. This is essentially unjust, but such is the public
							prepossession, and Edwards may fall a victim to it. The bias already
							taken by the Committee, bears heavily upon him, and the movements of
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> against him, are of
							the most fatal import— Wirt said that he himself had known comparatively
							nothing of the case, as I had now unfolded it to him— I said that in the
							political consequences of this affair, I had so much of an indirect
							interest myself, that I distrusted my own judgment concerning it. I was
							very apprehensive that the President might require a formal opinion from
							the members of his Administration upon the question whether he should
							remove Edwards from the Mission to Mexico— If he did, I should in the
							first instance request him, in consideration of the peculiarity of my
							situation, to excuse me from giving an opinion— But if he should then
							require it, I would give it.— John Edwards came in a state of despair
							about the pardon of <persRef ref="perez-unknown">Perez</persRef>:
							shedding floods of tears and wringing his hands— I had got the pardon
							ready signed, and gave it to him, upon which he fell on his knees, and
							uttered a thanksgiving to God; after which, he invoked blessings upon
							the President, shook my hand with many effusions of gratitude, and
							departed— Dix came to take leave. I had much conversation with J. W.
							Taylor, concerning the movements in New-York, and the investigating
							Committee. He thinks that the resumption of General Jackson, as the
							Candidate of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clinton</persRef> and his party will give the vote of
							the State with certainty to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford. He
							also supposes that the Committee will confine their investigation
							entirely to the official conduct of the Secretary of the Treasury— He
							mentioned a publication made by Edwards at Louisville, on his way to
							this place; and it was republished in the Washington Republican of this
							Evening. And with it the Letter from <persRef ref="stephenson-benjamin"
								>Stephenson</persRef> the receiver of public monies, and President
							of the Bank of Edwardsville, which none of the Officers in the Treasury
							had any recollection of having been received, and which the Report of
							the Committee, argues, to have been probably never written. This
							statement of the Committee has a very harsh aspect, against Edwards, who
							had testified that the letter was written in his presence— Taylor said
							that this was a mere incorrectness of expression in the report, which
							would be explained. I told him I thought it hardly right in the
							Committee to have reported at-all, after sending for Edwards, and before
							he could arrive here. He said it would have been impossible to have
							satisfied the House of Representatives without making some report before
							they adjourned; but I thought the Committee should have been inflexible
							upon that point— He told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards
							was ill, and had been this day confined to his bed— <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> was also this day at the Office.
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

							before the Commissioners under the Florida Treaty, which they begin to
							be apprehensive will be rejected— Dexter and Welles appeared to be
							solicitous to obtain some intimation in their favour from the Executive;
							but I told them the Executive had no such authority. Houston asked me if
							I had heard of any project of setting up <persRef ref="forsyth-john">J.
								Forsyth</persRef> as a Candidate for the Vice-Presidency— I had not,
							and was much surprized at the question. He said it had been seriously
							contemplated, in the event of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> being
							withdrawn on account of his health, an event deemed probable; and that
							it was connected with a plan to support <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> for the Presidency;
							connected also with the visit of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickerson</persRef> to Richmond and Monticello— Houston said he had
							himself a high regard for all the Presidential Candidates except M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, who had wronged him personally
							in the year 1816. but he did not explain how. He applied also for a
							Passport for <persRef ref="reynolds-james">James B. Reynolds</persRef>
							also a Representative from Tennessee, who is going to Ireland; and is a
							native <pb type="ms" n="349"/>of that Country. I called at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and read to him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pereyra’s passionate protest. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							was there; and <persRef ref="mclean-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								J. M’Lean</persRef> the Postmaster General afterwards came in—
							Calhoun was there to introduce the Cherokee chiefs, <persRef
								ref="ridge-major">Major Ridge</persRef>, <persRef ref="ross-john"
								>Ross</persRef>, <persRef ref="lowry-george">Lowry</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hicks-charles">Hicks</persRef>, who have spent the
							winter here, and now came to take leave of the President— Ridge the
							first chief of the delegation, who speaks no English, made a short
							address in their language, to the President, which was interpreted by
							Ross and Lowry— It was merely an expression of thanks for the reception
							and treatment they had met here, and assurances that they would remember
							it after their return home— There was less of Indian Oratory, and more
							of the common style of white discourse than in the same Chief’s speech
							on their first introduction— The President answered briefly, by general
							expressions of kindness and interest in their favour— The manners and
							deportment of those men have in no respect differed from those of
							well-bred country Gentlemen— They have frequented all the Societies,
							where they have been invited at Evening parties, attended several
							Drawing rooms, and most of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams’s
							Tuesday Evenings— They dress like ourselves; except that <persRef
								ref="dicky-unknown"><unclear>Di</unclear>cky</persRef>, a young and
							very handsome man, wore habitually a purple scarf— He and Ross are
							half-breeds, and Ross is the writer of the Delegation— They have
							sustained a written controversy against the Georgia Delegation, with
							great advantage— The President this day gave me two Sheets of paper
							dated 20. and 21. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1823. being
							confirmations by the Senate of nominations to Office, at the Session of
							Congress before the last. These papers had been loosely mixed among
							others, now nearly eighteen months, and for want of these confirmations,
							new Nominations in several instances have been made at this last
							Session, of persons whose appointments were already complete. Among them
							that of <persRef ref="woodbridge-william">W. Woodbridge</persRef> as
							Secretary of the Michigan Territory, who I feared had been in the same
							predicament with <persRef ref="miller-james">Governor Miller</persRef>
							of Arkansas, acting upwards of a year, without any appointment— These
							irregularities happen, for want of system, in the multiplicity of
							business always crowding upon the President— And above all from his want
							of an efficient private Secretary— There was heavy rain this Evening,
							and some thunder— I found my Solitude irksome.</p>

								ref="nelson-jeremiah">Jeremiah Nelson</persRef> came— a <persRef
								ref="skinner-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Skinner</persRef>, and young <persRef ref="hodgson-william"
								>Hodgson</persRef>— Barbour told me he had been summoned back from
							home to attend the investigating Committee as a witness— He became such
							in this manner—a Letter was published in the Richmond Enquirer, stating
							that when the nomination of <persRef ref="edwards-ninian"
								>Edwards</persRef> for the Mexican Mission was before the Senate,
								<persRef ref="noble-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Noble</persRef>, Senator from Indiana, with a view to the vote he
							should give upon that nomination, asked Edwards if he was the author of
							the A. B. Letters; which Edwards positively and solemnly denied— The
							writer of this Letter is understood to be <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>T. Benton</persRef>, the Senator from Missouri. When the Letter in
							the Enquirer appeared here Barbour, being in conversation concerning it
							with, <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> the Speaker—Clay observed that the mere denial of
							being the author of an anonymous publication was justifiable.— It was
							the writers secret, and he had the right to disconcert improper
							curiosity by a direct denial— But if the question was asked by a
							Senator, with a view to his vote upon a nomination—then a denial
							contrary to the truth would be in his opinion dishonourable. A few
							minutes afterwards Barbour meeting Noble had asked him how it had been;
							and Noble told him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards had in
							the most positive and solemn manner denied to him that he had been the
							author of the A. B. Letters, but that it had been without any reference
							whatever to the nomination in the Senate, or to Noble’s vote upon it—
							And hereupon Noble and Benton are summoned to discredit Edwards; and
							Barbour to discredit Noble, by proving that he told the Story two
							different ways, inconsistent <pb type="ms" n="350"/>with each other.
							Cook told me that Edwards besides the copy of <persRef
								ref="stephenson-benjamin">Stephenson’s</persRef> Letter, which had
							been in question, had also found at the Land-Office, a copy of another
							Letter written about ten days later, and referring to it.— He said also
							that Edwards had received a confidential Letter from a friend saying
							that a Clerk in the Treasury had told him that the Letter from
							Stephenson had been received, and was several days in the Secretary’s
							possession. But he does not name the Clerk, and it is probable he will
							be unwilling to testify— The three Quaker’s came as a deputation from a
							Society of their persuasion, to express to the Government their great
							anxiety for the suppression of the Slave-trade— They had been with the
							President, who had requested them also to see me— They stated their
							great concern, that from all the Evidence they had been able to collect
							it appeared that the trade more extensively, and with greater inhumanity
							than ever— It was carried on they said, chiefly under the french flag,
							and they came to enquire, if some effectual appeal could not be made to
							the Government of France to prevail upon them to take measures for
							putting it down— I told them what had been done, and what I hoped might
							yet be done in negotiation, with the maritime powers, and promised them
							all the aid I could give them for the accomplishment of their purpose.
							H. Lee spoke of the Book he has lately published against <persRef
								ref="johnson-william">judge Johnson’s</persRef> Life of <persRef
								ref="greene-nathanael">Greene</persRef>, and of the Letter from the
								<persRef ref="hastings-warren">Marquis of Hastings</persRef>, to
							Lee’s father, in vindication of his conduct relative to the Execution of
								<persRef ref="hayne-isaac">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

								ref="cheves-langdon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves</persRef>
							had questioned the propriety of publishing that Letter, as it seemed to
							bear hard upon the character of Hayne; but I thought this was not a

								Baker</persRef> from Ecclesiastes 5.4. “When thou vowest a vow unto
							God, defer not to pay it: for he hath no pleasure in fools; pay that
							which thou hast vowed.” The Sermon was in reference to the Communion
							which had been administered in the morning— In the Evening, Little
							again—from Isaiah 42.8. “I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory
							will I not give to another.” Unitarian doctrine— After the morning
							service, I called at <persRef ref="fletcher-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher’s</persRef> and saw <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> N.
								Edwards</persRef>— He is quite unwell, suffering with a very severe
							cough from a cold taken upon his journey to this place. He spoke of his
							Address; and of his motives for sending it from Wheeling— He said when
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> Report of 22. March was put into
							his hands he was on the very point of his departure. His trunks were all
							packed, and he had no papers or documents to which he could resort. He
							saw that the paragraph in the Report was intended as an imputation of
							perjury against him, and he thought he had no means of repelling it—not
							then recollecting the Correspondence between himself and Crawford of 9.
							and 12. February 1822. He thought he had no means of self-defence, but
							by going to Edwardsville— On his way to Wheeling however many things
							occurred to his recollection, upon which he determined to write his
							Address— On arriving at Edwardsville he found not only the Letter from
								<persRef ref="stephenson-benjamin">Stephenson</persRef>, which had
							been in question, but another of a later date referring to it, and which
							he had no doubt had also been received by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford. He has an ingenious argument to shew that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford did receive the first Letter, but
							it raises a mere probability, and the Clerk in the Treasury, who had
							said that it was received flinches from giving testimony to the fact— On
							returning from Church this Evening I found <persRef ref="king-charles2"
								>C. B. King</persRef>, and <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W.
								Taylor</persRef> at my door. King soon went away. Taylor remained

							Richmond Enquirer; from the best authority (<persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">A. Stevenson</persRef>) asserting that one of
							the most distinguished members of the Committee (Webster) had said that
							if Edwards produced no stronger evidence to support his charges, the
							Committee would pronounce a heavy censure upon him shews the use of
							means to turn against Edwards the current of public opinion, so
							abhorrent to my sense of Justice, that I scarcely know how to speak of
							it with composure. I returned to Taylor his Letter to his Constituents,
							with thanks for the perusal of it.</p>

								ref="witherell-james">judge Witherell</persRef>, as a judge for the
							Territory of Michigan— Richards is a Catholic priest— A man of his
							Church applied to him to marry him; having a wife living, but from whom
							he was separated or divorced— Richards refused to marry him, and by
							direction of his bishop, gave him notice; that if he did marry, he would
							be excommunicated. The man did marry, and Richards did excommunicate

							and Witherell differed, and the third judge being absent, no decision
							could be given. Of the new judges one was Richards’s Counsel, and the

							to <persRef ref="tottie-unknown">Tottie</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="arfsidsen-unknown">Arfsidsen</persRef>, not to accept or pay

							presented to them, and upon which they have acted—one of which is to be
							transmitted to the Treasury Department, where the Claims are to be paid.
							There is a great Mass of Documents and Vouchers, which it is provided by
							the Convention shall be deposited in the Department of State, and as
							there will be for sometime frequent occasion to recur to them, the
							Commissioners recommended that they should remain in the custody of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Watkins, the only person who understands
							the order and arrangement in which they are kept— I spoke to them of
								<persRef ref="meade-richard">R. W. Meade’s</persRef> Protest. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tazewell said they would furnish me with a
							minute and thorough analysis of his claim, shewing to demonstration that
							there was no <pb type="ms" n="353"/>part of it within the Treaty— That
							Spain was bound to pay it. Judge White said that the board had perhaps
							rejected some claims that were good, and admitted some that ought to
							have been rejected; some such mistakes were unavoidable; but the errors
							were not considerable, and he hoped that on the whole substantial
							justice had been done— On taking leave of the Commissioners, I thanked
							them in behalf of the Executive Government, for the zeal, industry and
							ability with which they had discharged the duties of the Commission—
							Robinson, brought me a number of recommendatory Letters— Griswold had
							Letters of Introduction from <persRef ref="king-charles">C.

							compensation to the members of the House of Representatives, to that of
							the contingent expenses of the House— The latter of these appropriations
							for the present year, being deficient that sum and the former redundant.
							The question was upon the power of the President to direct the
							transfer—See U.S. Laws. Act of 3. March 1809. Vol. 4. p. 221. Act of 3.
							March 1817. Vol. 6. p 235. Act of 16. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>
							1818. p. 256. and that depends on the question whether the expenditures
							of the House of Representatives, may constructively be considered, as
							expenditures of the Treasury Department— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt thinks they may— No decision this day— The President had a Letter
							from <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>, referring to
							the Resolution of Congress, that a Public Ship be sent to bring him to
							the United States. He declares his intention to come this Summer, but
							expresses a preference to coming in a Public ship; from various
							considerations, without positively declining it— The President who
							thought that important political consequences were involved in this
							personal compliment, offered for discussion, whether a Public Ship
							should nevertheless be sent to France, for the General, or whether a
							person should be sent out to attend him as a companion hither— A Letter
							from <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brown</persRef>, confirmed what was already known; that many people
							in France, perhaps the Government party generally have considered this
							invitation as indicating strong hostility to the Bourbons— The more of
							exhibition there is in carrying it into execution; the more this
							sentiment will be felt; and the President said he thought the form in
							which it would shew itself would be in slights to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown— And he related how after the attack
							upon the Chesapeake, the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen of
								England</persRef> at a Drawing-Room passed him without speaking to
							him— On the other hand if full effect should not be given by the
							Executive to the Resolution of Congress, the People of this Country
							would be much dissatisfied— There was much desultory Conversation, but
							no decision— Some remarks were made upon the inconsiderateness of the
							Resolution— Upon the expense which it must occasion, left entirely
							unprovided for. Of the inconveniences and charges upon him, and the
							attitude of Public exhibition under which he must appear wherever he may
							go in this Country— I thought he saw much of this himself; and that he
							meant to decline coming out in a public ship, positively, though from
							delicacy he had not said so in peremptory terms— Another question
							discussed was whether the President could now sign the Act, concerning
							the Florida wreckers, which was examined, and actually announced to the
							House as having been signed, but accidentally among forty or fifty other
							Acts approved the last <pb type="ms" n="355"/>evening before the close
							of the Session, remained without his signature. Could the President sign
							an Act, Congress not being in Session. Wirt thought he could— So did I—
							The Article of the Constitution concerning the signature of the
							President to Acts of Congress was read and analyzed. Nothing in it
							requiring that the President should sign, while Congress are in Session—
							Calhoun said that uniform practice had established a practical
							Construction of the Constitution— I observed that the practice had
							merely grown out of the precedents in the British Parliament. But the
							principles were different. The King was a constituent part of
							Parliament, and no Act of Parliament could be valid without the king’s
							approbation— But the President is not a constituent part of Congress,
							and an Act of Congress may be valid as Law without his signature or
							assent— Calhoun still thought that the uniform practice made the Law.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt also thought that as the
							President had examined the Act for signature, and it had been announced
							that he had signed it; he might sign it now and date it as of that time,
							nunc pro tunc— The President seemed to be afraid of the captious and
							cavilling spirit of the time, and that there might be misrepresentation
							of motives, if the Act should be signed in this manner— Calhoun was
							under the same impression— And as the Act was to commence its operation
							only in October, and was not of an urgent character it was concluded to
							be the safest course to leave the Act unsigned, and state the facts to
							Congress at their next Session— The Letter from the Insurance Companies
							of New-York, and the two depositions enclosed with it were read and
							considered— The <persRef ref="chase-john">Captain</persRef>, all the
							Officers, and a large portion of the men of the privateer Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Santander are Citizens of the United
							States— She took in forty men, and part of her equipment in the United
							States— She took and sent in to Laguira two Vessels of the United
							States, and took out twenty-six bales of dry goods from a third— I read
							a despatch from <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">H. Nelson</persRef>,
							mentioning complaints of <persRef ref="heredia-narciso">Count
								Ofalia</persRef>, the Spanish Minister of foreign Affairs against
							depredations of South-American privateers fitted out in this Country—
							The President wished me to send for <persRef ref="salazar-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar</persRef>, and remonstrate
							with him, to give strong Instructions to <persRef ref="anderson-richard"
								>R. C. Anderson</persRef>, and to send out <persRef
								ref="watts-beaufort">Watts</persRef> by the way of Laguira, to
							demand restitution— All this I approved, but proposed also, that
							Instructions should be given to our Commanders of armed vessels to take
							the privateer General Santander, and bring her in for trial—by virtue of
							the Acts of Congress of 20. April 1818. U.S. Laws Vol. 6. P. 320. of 3.
							March 1819. p. 412. 15. May 1820. p. 529. And of 30. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1823. 17. C. 2. S. ch 7. p 5. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt entered largely into the
							consideration of the effect of those Laws, as expounded by the decisions
							of the U.S. Courts; the conclusion of which was, that we could not
							require of the Republic of Colombia to acknowledge the principle, that
							free ships make free goods: neither by our Treaty with Spain; nor by the
							Law of Nations— That we could not take at Sea, out of our own
							Jurisdiction, any vessel for violation of the Law of 20. April 1818.
							That we could take the privateer General Santander for violation of the
							Act of 3. March 1819. only upon the charge of having taken out 26 bales
							of dry goods from one of our merchantmen—but that she could be taken for
							that. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun doubted the right of
							expatriation— Said he was always against it, in feeling, and had never
							committed himself upon it, during the late war— I agreed with him in the
							Sentiment; but said we had foreclosed this argument against ourselves,
							by the Oath, renouncing foreign Allegiance which we required from
							foreigners, as the condition of naturalization— After long discussion,
							the Meeting was adjourned till tomorrow at Noon— I read <persRef
								ref="meade-richard">R. W. Meade’s</persRef> two Letters and Protest;
							and my draft of an answer, which was approved; and accordingly
							afterwards sent— Evening walk with <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson

							election of <persRef ref="smallwood-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smallwood</persRef> came to solicit the appointment of
							fourth Auditor— Cabinet Meeting at Noon— <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>
							present. <persRef ref="southard-samuel">Southard</persRef> was expected
							this day, but will only be here to-morrow— I put a question, which had
							not been much taken into view yesterday— Whether the unsigned Act of
							Congress is, or is not law, without the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> signature— The chief question yesterday
							having been, whether the President could now sign it. The Constitution
							provides that unsigned and unreturned Acts, shall after ten days be Law,
							unless Congress by adjourning within the ten days, prevent the return of
							the Act— In this case the adjournment, though it took place within the
							ten days did not <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> the return, because the
							return with objections had not <pb type="ms" n="356"/>been intended, and
							it had even been announced to the house that it had been signed. Wirt
							thought nevertheless that the Act was not Law, and so the President
							decided— The case of the Privateer General Santander was again debated—
							All the grounds of yesterday re-explored— I read the paragraphs of my
							Instructions to <persRef ref="anderson-richard">R. C. Anderson</persRef>
							respecting the obligation of our Treaty with Spain, upon the Republic of
							Colombia, and referred to the project of a commercial Treaty sent me by
								<persRef ref="salazar-jose">Salazar</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt insisted, that we could not without
							inconsistency deny the right of belligerents by the Law of Nations, to
							take the property of enemies, in neutral vessels—and read in the State
							papers <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef ref="genet-edmund"
								>Genet</persRef>, upon that subject. I considered the Law of Nations
							upon this point as unsettled; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s
							argument was supported by decisions of the Supreme Court, against which
							the Executive Government could not safely assume an adversary principle—
							That knot of National Law, will always ultimately resolve itself into a
							question of <hi rend="italic">force</hi>. The question as to the
							obligation of the Republic of Colombia, to abide by the stipulation of
							the Article of our Treaty of 1795 with Spain, made when Colombia, formed
							a part of the Spanish Dominions, presents a problem of more complexity—
							As a general principle the Independence of Colombia, absolves her from
							the engagements of the Treaties of Spain with other powers; but some of
							the obligations of those Treaties, remain binding upon her, such for
							example as demarcations of boundaries; and there are strong equitable
							claims for considering this stipulation of the number— I instanced the
							case of the <persRef ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of Brazil</persRef>; who has
							declared that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> shall consider himself bound by
							all the Treaties of Portugal— The opinion of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wirt however was that we could not insist absolutely upon
							it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun concurred with it, and
							although the President thought otherwise, I was sure it would be a
							desperate attempt to maintain against a foreign State a position, upon
							which there is so much division among ourselves. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wirt still thought that the privateer General Santander
							might be taken for the 26 bales of goods taken out of one of the
							captured vessels, but I observed that I wished the final determination
							not to be taken till tomorrow when the Secretary of the Navy will be
							here— The more, as upon looking into the Colombian privateering
							Ordinance this act appears to be authorized by it— There was some
							question about a Commission of 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Auditor,
							to be sent to <persRef ref="vanness-william">W. P. Van
							Ness</persRef>—and a doubt whether it should go from the Treasury or
							State Department. It is said in the newspapers that he has declined the
							appointment. Further discussion, whether a frigate shall be sent for
								<persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>; and whether
							to Havre, Brest or Marseilles— Decision postponed— At the Office.
								<persRef ref="preble-henry">H. Preble</persRef> came, concerning his
							claim, not allowed by the Florida Treaty Commissioners— The applications
							to the Spanish Government for copies of the Documents in the case, have
							all failed, and Preble wishes to resort to this and the Spanish
							Government for redress. Two Quakers, by the names of <persRef
								ref="james-unknown">James</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="lytle-unknown">Lytle</persRef> came with a <persRef
								ref="howland-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Howland</persRef>, to expound claims upon Great Britain, in which
							James is interested, for captures in 1805 and 1807. James is a Man about
							four-score years of age, and he gave me a long account of these
							captures, and of all the proceedings upon them shewing that great
							injustice had been done him as he thought— And he argued that as the
							United States had made peace with Great-Britain without obtaining
							indemnity for his losses, they were themselves bound to make him that
							indemnity— This is a favourite argument of all sufferers by depredation
							and wrong from foreign Governments. The argument of abstract right is
							strong— But as the Justice obtainable from foreign Nations is at all
							times, and under every state of things very imperfect, and as the only
							alternative in cases of denial of justice is the abandonment of the
							claim or War, a nation by abandoning the claim, after exhausting every
							pacific expedient for obtaining, neither partakes of the injustice done,
							nor makes itself responsable to the sufferer— For War, even if it
							eventually obtains justice for that sufferer secures it by the
							sufferings of thousands of others equally unmerited and which must
							ultimately remain unindemnified— And mere inability to obtain justice,
							cannot incur the <pb type="ms" n="357"/>obligation which it is unable to
							enforce. <persRef ref="barbour-john">John S. Barbour</persRef>, <persRef

							themselves of the embarrassments resulting from their own excessive
							restrictions. It is only by a broad Latitude of Construction, that the
							power of transfer can in this case be assumed— But it is of urgent
							necessity, and the President gave the order— The case of the Colombian
							Privateer General Santander was again considered— The taking of enemy’s
							property out of a neutral ship, is authorised by the Colombian
							privateering Ordinance: and so is the fitting out of privateers by
							foreigners— I had received a Letter from <persRef

								<persRef ref="unknown18">his brother’s</persRef> where <pb type="ms"
								n="358"/>he now lodges, and he gave me a summary account of the
							proceedings of the Committee. Noble’s testimony was of the strongest
							character against him. Evidently studied for operation and effect— Not

							the author of the A. B. Letters, but for a high panegyric upon the
							ability and integrity of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

								>Stephenson</persRef> a copy of which Edwards has brought is not
							found at the Treasury, nor recollected by any person there— Edwards
							delivered in yesterday a reply to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s Answer, longer than his Address; but it was not read—The
							Committee having sat till ten last Night examining Edwards and Noble—
								<persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef> acknowledged himself
							the writer of the Letter in the Richmond Enquirer, reporting incorrectly

								>Cook</persRef>, after Noble had given his testimony, Benton said
							that Noble must not go; as an attempt would be made to discredit him.
								<persRef ref="floyd-john">Floyd’s</persRef> bias continues as it has

								<persRef ref="mcarthur-duncan">M’Arthur’s</persRef> growing—
								<persRef ref="livingston-edward">Livingston</persRef> still retains

							drawn; not finished; but which he proposed to issue as a proclamation,
							or public declaration, of our principles, relating to neutrality, and to
							South-America— The whole subject was discussed in a desultory manner.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt was confirmed in his opinion
							that the Colombian Republic is not bound to admit the principle that
							Free Ships make free goods; either by the Law of Nations, or by our
							Treaty with Spain— And as the Colombian privateering ordinance
							authorises foreigners to fit out and take Commissions for Privateers
							under their flag, and also to take enemy’s property out of neutral
							ships, Chase cannot be taken, or tried as a Pirate upon either of those

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt recurred to the decisions of the
							Supreme Court, of which there have been several; admitting the right of
							expatriation as a general principle; but denying it in every particular
							case that has come before them— The last was in 1822. the Santissima
							Trinidad—in which they refused to acknowledge the expatriation of a
								<persRef ref="chaytor-james">Captain Chaytor</persRef>, under

								>Chase</persRef> in this case: reported in the 7<hi

								>Wheaton</persRef>— The result is that we are to treat the whole

							and bring in the privateer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard were both averse to the
							President’s issuing the Declaration or Manifesto that he had
							contemplated; and he gave up the idea— There was some talk of publishing
							an Article in the National Intelligencer, holding out threats of issuing
							orders for taking Chase and his Privateer, which <pb type="ms" n="359"
							/>it was supposed would frighten him off and deter others; but I
							disapprove all menaces as measures of Government, when you determine not
							to strike— The President rests much upon general considerations— Upon
							our interest and policy to sustain the South-American Nations.</p>
