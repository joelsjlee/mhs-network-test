								Adams</persRef> determined to stay and pass some days with M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Keating. As I was anxious to proceed, I
							rose much in advance of the time; but when with <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth Adams</persRef> we came to the
							wharf, a full quarter before six, we found the boat had passed on— Not
							three minutes before; and it was yet in full sight—but it was too late,
							and we returned to <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson’s</persRef> house. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams was very ill; confined to the bed—
							I passed a couple of hours in the library. At ten young<space/><persRef
								ref="hopkinson-unknown">Hopkinson</persRef> came from Philadelphia—
							We walked in the Garden and over the grounds of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-joseph">Count de Survilliers (Joseph
								Bonaparte)</persRef> He is making on them an extensive park, and
							spending large sums of money to little purpose, without either elegance
							comfort or profit— He himself was gone upon an excursion of two or three
							days; twenty miles distant, upon a grouse shooting party— His Secretary
								<persRef ref="carre-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carré</persRef> called upon us at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hopkinson’s; and we went to his house to see his pictures, but were not
							admitted, the family being at dinner— At 2 O’Clock we embarked,
							Elizabeth C. Adams and I in the Steamboat, and at seven in the Evening,
							arrived at Philadelphia. On board the boat I met, my old Schoolmate
								<persRef ref="deane-jesse">Jesse Deane</persRef>—he was the person
							who had yesterday accosted me from the wharf at New-York, with <persRef
								ref="mumford-gurdon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mumford</persRef>; and whom I did not then recognize— He was now
							accompanied by his daughter <persRef ref="alden-philvra">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alden</persRef>, and her <persRef
								ref="alden-horatio">husband</persRef>— The last time I had seen M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Deane was in August 1785 at Hartford,
							which is also now his residence— We had a long conversation in the Boat,
							and told over to each other the tales of our Childhood, in the Boston
							Frigate, and at the Schools of La Coeur and Pechigni. We all came and
							took lodgings at <persRef ref="shinn-elizabeth">Miss Shinn’s</persRef>
							in South 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Street— <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Blunt’s</persRef><persRef ref="blunt-unknown">mother</persRef> was
							also in the boat with us from Bordentown— I called at the Mansion house
							Hotel; and asked for <persRef ref="lafayette">General La

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson’s; leaving Elizabeth Adams
							at <persRef ref="randall-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah
								Randall’s</persRef>, where we found <persRef ref="marston-unknown3"

							meeting of the American Philosophical Society, at which Gen<hi

								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> was

									>l.</hi> La Fayette</persRef>; he had not risen; but a few
							minutes after sent me word he was rising and wished to see me— I went
							immediately, and found him in his bedchamber, dressing— In his breakfast
							chamber I met also his Son, <persRef ref="lafayette-george">George
								Washington</persRef>, and his Secretary <persRef
								ref="levasseur-auguste">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Le
								Vasseur</persRef>— After breakfast I went to <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph R.

								ref="bruxner-george">Brüxner</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="plessig-unknown">Plessig</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="cayley-john">Cayley</persRef> of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Petersburg; taken under a Commission issued from the
							Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, at the instance of <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">Levett Harris</persRef>, for the trial of his
							Cause against <persRef ref="lewis-william">W. D. Lewis</persRef>— Harris
							has been between one and two years collecting these and many other the
							depositions in Russia— <persRef ref="lewis-john">John D. Lewis</persRef>
							had written me several Letters, that in the Depositions of Brüxner,
							Plessig and Cayley there were abusive statements against me; and W. D.
							Lewis who has also been collecting testimony in Russia, and who arrived
							in Boston, the day after I last left there; wrote me a Letter which I
							received at New-York, requesting me to see M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ingersoll, as I should pass through Philadelphia; and
							ascertain whether it would not be necessary to take another Deposition
							from me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll sent first to <persRef
								ref="binney-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney</persRef>,
							and then to <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, who are of Counsel for Harris, for the Russian
							Depositions— They were sent to him, and I read over those of Brüxner,
							Plessig and Cayley— In my first and third depositions in the cause, I
							had been under the necessity of mentioning transactions in which these
							persons had been concerned with Harris; of a more than suspicious
							character— Harris took copies of my depositions with him to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, and these worthies saw what I
							had told of them. Neither of them denies any material fact stated by me;
							but Brüxner makes several base and malicious insinuations against me:
							boasts of my confidence in his house, and of having transacted my
							private pecuniary business, at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg— Of their having bought and sold Russian Stocks for me; and
							of my having given <persRef ref="campbell-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell</persRef>, a Letter of
							Recommendation to the House, when he went to Russia— The Letter itself
							is annexed to Bruxner’s deposition. Plessig and Cayley, indulge
							themselves in angry invective against me, but shake none of the facts
							stated by me— Plessig, whom I had even avoided to name, admits the fact
							which deeply implicated him, and Cayley declares there was no collusion
							between him and Harris in the case of the Monticello, <persRef
								ref="sall-unknown">Captain Sall</persRef>— After reading over the
							Depositions, I explained to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll the
							facts to which Brüxner’s <pb type="ms" n="264"/>malicious insinuations
							and misrepresentations applied, and told him that if it was desired; I
							would give an additional explanatory deposition— Or if possible I would
							come and give my testimony in open Court— This Ingersoll said would be
							exceedingly desirable. He said the trial would probably come on, early
							in December. I said it would scarcely be possible that I should be able
							to leave Washington at that time; but if the trial should be postponed
							till next Spring I should in all probability have leisure to come— I
							requested him if he should take out a new Commission, that he would also
							extend to it the taking of the Deposition of <persRef ref="hay-george"
								>George Hay</persRef>— In this business I was engaged till the hour
							of departure of the Steamboat for Newcastle (Noon) was past; and I lost
							the opportunity of proceeding this day on my way to Washington.
							Ingersoll asked me to dine with him— I went to <persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hopkinson’s</persRef>, but he was gone to Bordentown— At Hopkinson’s
							and on my return to <persRef ref="shinn-elizabeth">Miss
								Shinn’s</persRef>, I received notices of several messages from
								<persRef ref="barron-james">Commodore Barron</persRef>, commanding
							at the Navy-Yard, inviting my attendance there, to meet General La
							Fayette; but it was too late for me to go. The General was received
							there with an Address and a Collation. I dined at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph R. Ingersoll’s, with <persRef
								ref="chapman-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chapman</persRef>— After dinner I intended to have visited <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef>, but Ingersoll sent to
							his house to enquire if he was home— He was not— I went with Ingersoll
							and Chapman to the Theatre, which is fitting up for the great Ball to be
							given to General La Fayette, next Monday— Met there <persRef
								ref="dallas-george">G. M. Dallas</persRef><persRef
								ref="strickland-william">Strickland</persRef> the Architect,
								<persRef ref="wood-william">Wood</persRef>, the manager of the
							Theatre, and some others— They have Inscriptions, and Portraits and
							Motto’s; and painted Scenery; and columns, with the names of
							distinguished military Officers of the Revolutionary War— I observed to
							Dallas that they had no naval names; and as Philadelphians ought not to
							have forgotten that of <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas2">Biddle</persRef>.
							I next went to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson’s again; and
							there met <persRef ref="chapman-rebecca">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Chapman</persRef>, with whom I walked to <persRef
								ref="cadwalader-thomas">General Cadwalader’s</persRef>—An Evening
							party, at which General La Fayette, with his Son, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Le Vasseur attended. The two <persRef
								ref="wright-camilla;wright-frances" type="multi">Misses
								Wright</persRef>, English maiden Ladies who have followed General La
							Fayette to this Country, were also there— <persRef ref="morris-mary"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Morris</persRef>, widow of the

								daughters</persRef> of the late <persRef ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bollmann</persRef> and many others
							were of the company— I told General La Fayette, that I should call on
							him to-morrow Morning, and introduce to him, my old School-mate <persRef
								ref="deane-jesse">Jesse Deane</persRef>. To Miss Shinn’s about 11.

						<p><pb type="ms" n="265"/><date>3. VI:30—</date> I called this morning on

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Deane</persRef>, whom I introduced to

							of his visit to us at the School at that time. I intended to have taken
							the Boat for Newcastle, this day at Noon; but <persRef
								ref="adams-unknown4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams</persRef>
							of Baltimore called on me this Morning having come from Baltimore last
							Night— He left with me the Baltimore Patriot of the Evening in which was
							an Article stating that the Corporation of the City having learnt that
							the Secretaries of State and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">of the
								Navy</persRef>, were on their way, returning to Washington, had
							resolved to invite them to witness the reception of General La Fayette
							there, next <unclear>Thurs</unclear>day— And M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams earnestly urged me to accept this invitation— As I
							must pass through Baltimore I thought the refusal of it would have the
							appearance of a slight and concluded to accept it, and remain here till
							Wednesday. <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> came and invited me to his pew
							at Christ Church, where Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La Fayette was
							to attend public worship; and also to dine with him— But <persRef
								ref="peters-richard2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. Peters
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> soon after brought
							me an invitation from <persRef ref="peters-richard">his father</persRef>
							to dine with him, in company with Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La
							Fayette, with which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll’s
							permission I accepted. At Christ Church, the service was performed by
								<persRef ref="white-william">Bishop White</persRef>— His text was
							Psalm 73.25.26. “Who have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon
							earth that I desire besides thee.— My flesh and my heart faileth: but
							God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.” It was a
							Communion day Sermon; but the Bishop made no adaptation of any part of
							the service to the occasion of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> La
							Fayette’s presence— The house was crowded— I wrote to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and enclosed the Letter to
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
								Brent</persRef> to be forwarded by him to Loudoun— Went with R.
							Peters jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> and <persRef ref="jones-george"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef> of Georgia out
							to judge Peters’s, about four miles from the City and dined. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jones was during part of a Session in
							1807. a member of the Senate while I was there. He was appointed by the
							Executive of the State; but on the Meeting of the Legislature, <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> was chosen in his place— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jones sat in the Senate from the 26<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of October to the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							December 1807. since which, I had not seen him; and did not now
							recollect his person— At judge Peters’s we met a Quaker named <persRef
								ref="kersey-jesse">Kersey</persRef>; said to be an eloquent
							Preacher; but he went away before dinner— Judge Peters shewed us in his
							garden a Spanish Chestnut tree, the nut of which was planted by <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef>, just before
							his retirement from the Presidency— Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La
							Fayette, his <persRef ref="lafayette-george">Son</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="levasseur-auguste">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Le

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. Breck</persRef>, <persRef

							of Georgia, and some others— <persRef ref="peters-unknown3">Miss
								Peters</persRef>, the judge’s daughter, who keeps his house, was the

							four score years of age; in sound health; good Spirits, and of

							Returned in the Evening to Philadelphia, and I called at <persRef

						<p><date>4: VI.</date> I had invitations to attend, in company with <persRef
								ref="lafayette">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La
								Fayette</persRef>, at his visitation of various public Institutions
							of this City— Met him, about ten this morning at that of the deaf and
							dumb— The teacher is a young man by the name of <persRef
								ref="wells-unknown2">Wells</persRef>, whom I had met last night in
							the Steam-boat. The performances of the pupils were very creditable, and
							their proficiency in knowledge and facility of comprehension was
							surprizing— Thence we went to the Pennsylvania Hospital; for sick and
							insane persons— It is kept in excellent order— Among the Lunaticks was a
							man from Boston by the name of <persRef ref="scott-unknown5"
								>Scott</persRef>, who wished to see me, and sent me word that he had
							been President of the Phenix fire-club when I was a member of the
							Society. I accordingly saw and spoke with him. He enquired after
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and family, and
							exhibited to me no token of insanity— He followed us round several of
							the Apartments, and made some sensible remark, upon the picture by
								<persRef ref="west-benjamin">West</persRef>, of Christ healing the
							sick— In passing through the apartments of the sick we saw one woman in
							bed; insensible, and apparently in her last moments— She died in the
							course of the day. Our next visit was to the Penitentiary, the most
							remarkable incident of which was that they had the convicts drawn up in
							a double line in the yard, through which we passed— Such a Study of
							Phisiognomy, I never before beheld— The varieties of impression which
							vice, and guilty lives can produce upon the human Countenance, were
							never so exhibited to me— It was a thing to shudder at, and of which I
							had no conception. The contrast of desperation, malice, hatred, revenge,
							impudence, treachery and scorn visible upon this collection of
							Criminals, was the more remarkable from the cheerfulness, kind feeling
							and joy visible in the countenances of the people crowding about the
							General, wherever he goes— We proceeded to the Meeting of the Washington
							benevolent Society; where General La Fayette was admitted as an honorary
							member, and addressed by their President <persRef ref="milnor-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milnor</persRef>— I had been
							cautioned by <persRef ref="peters-richard2">R. Peters jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> against attending at this
							Ceremony, the Society being, or having heretofore been, a Political
							Society of the most violent character under the vizor of benevolence— I
							could not however <pb type="ms" n="267"/>avoid accompanying the General,
							and there was nothing of an objectionable character in the performances—
							We next went to the Schuylkill Water works, and viewed the dam; the
							wheels, and the pipes for the ascent of the water, with the reservoir at
							the top of the hill— The General then visited the <persRef
								ref="bollman-unknown;bollmann-unknown2" type="multi">two Misses
								Bollmann</persRef> at <persRef ref="nickson-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nickson’s</persRef> their Relation.
							Then went to the new Penitentiary now building; and then to the orphans
							and Widow’s Asylum, also a new Building— The orphans sung a hymn while
							we were there— The General was every where cordially welcomed, and
							enthusiastically greeted— On returning I alighted from the Carriage in
							Market Street; and called at <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson’s</persRef>, where I found
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, who had come in from Bordentown— I
							dined with General La Fayette at his lodgings at the Mansion House, with
							a company of about sixty persons— Among the rest, <persRef
								ref="shulze-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schultze</persRef>,
							the Governor of the Commonwealth. In the Evening I went with R. Peters
								jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and the Ladies to the Ball at the
							Theatre, which was very brilliant— Supper about Midnight— Between one
							and two in the Morning, after following the Ladies to M<hi

								Hopkinson</persRef> the President, delivered Diploma’s to <persRef

								Meredith</persRef>, and part of her family. Thence went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan to the Athenaeum—and thence to the
							State House. General La Fayette was received in the Hall of
							Independence—so called from being that where the Congress of the
							Confederation used to meet, and whence the Declaration of Independence
							issued— Its interior has however since been entirely altered— From the
							Hall, General La Fayette went upon the Steps of the South, front door of
							the State house, where the Children of the Schools, passed in review
							before him. 2250 girls, and 1800 boys, chiefly from seven to fourteen
							years of age— There were several addresses—numerous emblematic and
							mottoed banners—one Song— And a speech in French by <persRef
								ref="cadwalader-thomas">General Cadwalader’s</persRef><persRef
								ref="cadwalader-thomas2">son</persRef>; a lad of about fourteen—
							Some of the teachers came up the steps and shook hands with the General;
							and many of the children especially of the girls, succeeded, though
							against the previously announced regulation, and in spite of much
							opposition, in obtaining the same favour. This procession took up nearly
							three hours during which the General declined being seated, or covered,
							even with an Umbrella— He went thence to the University, but I did not
							accompany him. I paid a visit to <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ch. J. Ingersoll</persRef>, and at 4.
							attended at the Washington Hall, at a dinner given <pb type="ms" n="268"

							Philadelphia to General La Fayette— The company consisted of nearly one
							hundred persons, several of whom were guests invited. <persRef
								ref="shulze-john">Governor Schultze</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="peters-richard">Judge Peters</persRef> were of the party— The
							Toasts were characteristic of the Company, and <persRef
								ref="plantou-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Captain Biddle</persRef> sent me to peruse, respecting his

							of horsemen, going to meet <persRef ref="lafayette">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> La Fayette</persRef> at the frontier
							of the State— At 1/2 past eight we reached Frenchtown. The Steamboat

							there in waiting for General La Fayette, with three Committees from
							Baltimore to receive him— One from the City Corporation— One from the
							Militia-Brigade; and one from the Society of the Cincinnati— There was
							another Steam-boat in which the travellers from Philadelphia were to
							proceed as usual— Before alighting from the Stage I received an
							invitation from the Committees, to go with them, and in company with
							General La Fayette. Feeling myself scarcely at Liberty to decline this
							invitation, I recommended M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and the
							girls to the attention of Captain Finch, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> B. O. Tayloe, and the Boat in which they were <pb type="ms"

							Morning when General La Fayette arrived with an escort from Delaware—
								<persRef ref="mclane-louis">Lewis M’Lane</persRef> made him a speech
							on the wharf at parting; and as soon as he came on board the boat he was

							and appropriate answers— The Boat then left the wharf, we had a light
							supper, and retired for the Night— The Lady’s Cabin was appropriated for
							the General and his family; and by his invitation, one of the births in
							it was occupied by me. Among the persons who came from Baltimore to meet
							the General was <persRef ref="martin-dubois">Captain Dubois
								Martin</persRef>, the Officer who hired the vessel in which he came
							from France in the year 1777. He has been many years residing in

							married a young <persRef ref="martin-unknown2">wife</persRef>, and has a
								<persRef ref="martin-unknown3">child</persRef>— He is in
							circumstances not very prosperous, and told me the whole story of his
							engaging the Marquis to come over here; and of his hiring the vessel for
							him— The General himself also told it to me, not very differently.</p>

						<p><date>7. VI:30.</date> The Night was fine, and we rose this Morning in
