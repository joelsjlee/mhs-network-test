						<p><date>1. VI:45.</date><persRef ref="munro-isaac">Isaac Munro</persRef>,
							Editor of the Baltimore Patriot, and <persRef ref="williams-cumberland"
								>Cumberland D. Williams</persRef> son in Law to the late <persRef
								ref="pinkney-william">William Pinkney</persRef> called at my house
							this Morning. Williams appeared anxious to know how <persRef
								ref="pinkney-charles">Charles Pinkney</persRef>, the Secretary to
							the Legation at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg stood with
							the Government here, and I told him frankly— He said the hopes of the
							family were in a great measure centered in him— A young man named
								<persRef ref="hogdson-unknown2">Hodgson</persRef>, renewed his
							application for an appointment to a Clerkship in the Department of
							State—and brought a Letter of recommendation from <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef>— He said he had a great
							facility in learning languages; and if he could meet encouragement would
							learn some of the Oriental languages— I told him if he would learn the
							Arabic and Turkish, he would certainly obtain a possession the use of
							which would at sometime or other be wanted— He offered to make
							translations from French or Spanish, to shew his savoir faire— And I
							promised to give him some translation to do, for trial— <persRef
								ref="reed-john">John Reed</persRef> a member of the House from
							Massachusetts came with a letter, claiming the interposition of the
							Government, for the recovery of certain money seized in Mexico— I told
							him I would write to the Consul at Alvarado, concerning it— Reed said he
							was soon going home, and spoke of the Presidential Election. He is a
							federalist, but he says that two thirds of his Constituents are
							Republicans— He professed to be very friendly to me, but intimated an
							opinion that it would ultimately be necessary for my friends to unite
							with those of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— I told him there
							was nothing to be expected from that, but he said the assurances from
							the friends of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford were very
							strongly otherwise— I said that I had understood that a systematic
							effort was making to unite the federal party in Massachusetts in favour
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, and that the great struggle
							of the federalists at the recent State election for Governor, was
							connected with that purpose. He said it was not a general feeling, but
							that some of the federalists favoured M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, from an apprehension that my prejudices against them were so
							strong that in the event of my election they would be altogether
							proscribed. I asked him if he thought there was a doubt of my election
							by a large majority of the electoral votes, but for an opposition from
							the Republican party on the very ground of my being suspected of too
							much federalism— He said there was not— I told him I had originally been
							a federalist, just such as <persRef ref="washington-george">President
								Washington</persRef> had been— But of the course that had been
							pursued by the federalists during and preceding the late War, my opinion
							was well known and had been fully manifested by my conduct— Personally
							the federalists had done me wrong, and I expected no favour from them—
							But during the whole of the present Administration, it had been at least
							as much supported by the federalists as by the Republicans— If it should
							be the pleasure of the People of the United States that I should serve
							them as their President, I should be the President, not of a Section, or
							of a Faction, but of the whole Union— If the federalists chose as a body
							to array themselves against me, I should not complain, and very probably
							they might prevent my election. Possibly their opposition however, might
							strengthen me in the opposite party, and if after a combined and
							continued movement against me, I should still be elected, they must be
							aware how much the difficulty would be increased of favouring them with
							appointments without disgusting those of the opposite party, claiming
							the merit of friendly support against them— He was aware of all this,
							and said that he should endeavour to secure the choice in his District
							of an Elector, favourable to me— He said there was an appearance of
							opposition to me in the Old Colony, greater than in any other part of
							the State; the reason of which he did not know. But he had heard
							yesterday one of the Republican Members say that if two of the federal
							Members from Massachusetts should be for <pb type="ms" n="302"/>me, that
							would be sufficient— This had displeased him. Why should only two be
							wanted? Why not the whole?— I said I supposed the motive for that
							observation was, with reference to a Majority of the whole Delegation— I
							knew not how any of the federal members from Massachusetts would vote,
							but I had supposed that <persRef ref="nelson-jeremiah">Nelson</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="dwight-henry">Dwight</persRef>, Reed himself, <persRef
								ref="locke-john2">Locke</persRef> and <persRef ref="allen-samuel"
								>Allen</persRef> would be for me—and probably <persRef
								ref="lathrop-samuel">Lathrop</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> I considered as doubtful and
								<persRef ref="baylies-francis">Baylies</persRef>, as certainly
							against me— He said Baylies might possibly change, if all the rest of
							the delegation should be united, but he was certainly very much against
							me, having some connection with a nail manufactory in Bristol County, in
							which <persRef ref="otis-harrison">H. G. Otis</persRef> has an interest—
							His rancour against me therefore is derivative from Otis— Reed declared
							himself entirely satisfied with this conversation, which he said he had
							been for some time desirous of having with me— At the Office, <persRef
								ref="verplanck-gulian">D<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Verplanck</persRef> called for a Passport, and <persRef
								ref="woodward-augustus">A. B. Woodward</persRef>, to enquire for a
								<persRef ref="mcdonnell-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Donnel</persRef> at Detroit, concerning an application to the
							British Government, for the reversal of an outlawry against him in
							Canada; for having served against them in the late War, being a British
							Subject— M’Donnel in his Letter to Woodward seems disposed to stimulate
							a call from Congress for the papers; which Woodward remarked was
							absurd.— I attended the Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> at Noon— The question with
							regard to the recognition of the <persRef ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of
								Brazil</persRef>, and the reception of <persRef
								ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rebello</persRef>, as his Charge d’Affaires, was again discussed—
							The information from Brazil, from Lisbon, from France, and from Europe
							generally, warrants a strong suspicion that the soi disant Emperor of
							Brazil, is in secret concert with <persRef ref="john-vi">his
								father,</persRef> and with France, to sink back into a Portuguese
							Prince of Brazil, and to restore the Portuguese dominion in that
							Country— There is resistance also against the Imperial domination in
							Brazil itself and he had declared a Blockade of Pernambuco, assisted by
							a French force— I mentioned also the Letter I had received from <persRef
								ref="bezeah-william">W. Bezeau</persRef> styling himself late a
							Captain in the U.S. Army, warning me of this M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rebello, as of a suspicious character— I advised that I
							should be directed to send for him and in a conciliatory manner inform
							him that it is thought best to delay for some time the formal reception
							of him; and this was finally determined without opposition— The
							President intimated a disposition to send a message to Congress in
							secret Session, communicating all the various exciting Letters and
							despatches which have lately been received— It is all, indefinite alarm—
							I observed that unless such a communication to Congress should be made
							with the intention of recommending to them something to <hi
								rend="italic">do</hi>, it would only increase the excitement already
							existing— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> concurred in that opinion— At the Office, I
							drafted a form of Ratification for the Convention now before the Senate—
							As I was returning from the President’s after the Meeting, I met M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, who was going to it. He said he
							had not received the notice to attend it till within half an hour— Walk
							after dinner, and then had an Evening visit from <persRef
								ref="brown-ethan">E. A. Brown</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>2. VI:30.</date> A day of Midsummer heat— Heard <persRef
								ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>
							in the morning, from Ephesians 4.8. [“]Wherefore he saith, When he
							ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.”
							It was one of his best discourses, and among the gifts unto men, which
							he pointed out as given by Christ the Saviour were Truth, Liberty, and
							the assurance of immortal life— After the Sermon, he gave a short
							Lecture upon the philosophy of the human mind. The particular subject
							pleasure and pain. I called afterwards upon <persRef ref="lloyd-james"
								>James Lloyd</persRef>, Senator from Massachusetts, to mention the
							despatch from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, and the
							communication from <persRef ref="addington-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington</persRef>, with respect to
							the duties upon Iron. Lloyd said they would do nothing about it in
							Senate— That the Committee were four to one against it, and that he had
							returned the papers to <persRef ref="newton-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton</persRef> the Chairman of the
							Committee of Commerce of the House.— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Adams</persRef> went with me in the afternoon, to <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>,
							and we heard a stranger, from 5. John 40. “And ye will not come to me
							that ye might have life.” Evening service at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Little’s, and heard <persRef ref="storer-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Storer</persRef>, from John 7.17. “If
							any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether <pb
								type="ms" n="303"/>it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.” Good
							doctrine; good composition; lifeless delivery. After the service, I
							called at <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fuller’s</persRef> lodgings, and saw him— He goes for home to-morrow
							Morning; and my niece <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S.
								Adams</persRef> is going with him— Fuller read to me Letters from
								<persRef ref="sedgwick-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sedgwick</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="wheaton-henry">H.
								Wheaton</persRef>, respecting the publication signed Mercury, in the
							New-York Patriot, charging Fuller with having stated that I had
							authorised him to offer the Vice Presidency to <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="gardner-charles">Gardner</persRef> the Editor of the Patriot
							has published the denial of Fuller, but paltered and equivocated in the
							manner of publishing the denial, and stated in the paper, that the
							author of Mercury would communicate directly to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fuller himself— He told Sedgwick that Mercury would write to
							Fuller by the same Mail; but Fuller has received no Letter from him, and
							he will doubtless continue to <unclear>lurk</unclear>— Fuller suspects
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>; but I do
							not— He spoke of Clay, who he says is now quite flushed with hopes, and
							told <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef> that
							he was already sure of eight States, and should be elected— He plays
							brag as he has done all his life. Fuller said he would see <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef> this Evening— I told him Cook
							had not called to see me since the presentation of <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">N. Edwards’s</persRef> Address to the House,
							and probably had his reasons for avoiding it— I had not sought him; I
							had heard Cook’s intention was to take no part in this transaction in
							the house; which was very well; unless he should find it necessary to
							sustain the character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards— I had
							strong presentiments that it would be so, and in friendship for M<hi

							aware of the predicament in which he may be placed, and prepared for
							it.</p>

								<persRef ref="rice-luther">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luther
								Rice</persRef> came to apologize for the failure on the part of the

							arrangement might be made with the Directors of the U.S. Branch Bank
							to-morrow, by which the payment may be effected. I told him I hoped it
							would be, as I had relied upon it for the payment of a debt of my own— A
								<persRef ref="gardner-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. P.
								Gardner</persRef> called upon me for a subscription. <persRef
								ref="barbour-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. S.
								Barbour</persRef>, member of the House from Virginia, came with
								<persRef ref="moore-thomas2">T. L. Moore</persRef> who was the
							member from the same district in the last Congress— <persRef
								ref="reed-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Reed</persRef>,
							member from Massachusetts came, for a further conversation upon the
							subject on which we had spoken last Saturday— He had since then seen and
							talked with <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, and had
							asked him to see and talk with me, which he had declined. He said that
							Webster had expressed apprehensions, that in the event of my Election,
							there would be a general proscription of federalists from Office— And
							intimated that he could not favour a system by which such men as
								<persRef ref="mason-jeremiah">Jeremiah Mason</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire, and <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">Joseph
								Hopkinson</persRef> of Pennsylvania should be excluded from the
							public Service— Reed said he did not believe that I should act upon any
							such principle, but did not tell Webster that he had conversed with me—
							I told Reed, that with regard to individuals, it was impossible for me
							to give any pledge whatever. I had no personal acquaintance with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason, but knew him by reputation as a man
							of fine talents and highly respectable character— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson was and had been for many years
							my personal friend— I consider them both as well qualified for the
							public service, and never under any circumstances would I be made the
							instrument of a systematic exclusion of such men from it— With regard to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, I knew that lures had been
							held out to him from other quarters— Even from that which assumed the
							livery of exclusive and patent Republicanism— The Caucus Chief avowedly
							proclaimed in the Address of his partizans as to be supported on party
							grounds alone. I knew there was a Negotiation going on between that very
							party and the Massachusetts federalists, and I knew the men by whom it
							was <pb type="ms" n="304"/>conducted— How far M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster was connected with it I did not know— If he thought
							proper to join in the concerted plan of opposition to me I must abide by
							the issue— I had no favours to ask of him; but if he should take that
							course, I believed he would fail, even in the object of carrying the
							Massachusetts federalists with him.— Reed said he thought so too—but he
							did not believe that Webster had committed or would commit himself upon
							the subject— Reed appeared also to place great reliance upon
							South-Carolina— In which I told him he would find himself mistaken. The
							object of the South-Carolina delegation, being to get all possible aid
							from my friends, without yielding any thing in return— Whatever it was
							in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s power to transfer, he had
							transferred to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>,
							and now his friends were seeking support both from Jackson and from me.
							Reed said that <persRef ref="gist-joseph">Gist</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wilson-john2">Wilson</persRef>, the two members who attended
							the Caucus and were for <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> openly avowed that in the event of his being
							withdrawn, they would be for me— That he counted further upon <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="carter-john">Carter</persRef> in the house, and Hamilton had
							told him that Jackson’s votes for the Tariff, would lose him the
							electoral votes of South Carolina— I had no faith in this, and assured
							Reed he might depend that nothing was to be expected from South
							Carolina— As supporters of the present Administration however, I wished
							to be upon the best possible terms with them without expecting any thing
							from them for the future— <persRef ref="burton-hutchins">H. G.
								Burton</persRef> called to visit me, with a <persRef
								ref="williams-unknown">General Williams</persRef> of North Carolina;
							and <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="kirby-edmund;kirby-reynolds" type="multi">two Major
								Kirby’s</persRef>, brothers, of the army. <persRef
								ref="watts-beaufort">B. S. Watts</persRef>, appointed Secretary to
							the Legation to the Republic of Colombia, came to tell me that he was
							ready to depart, and to enquire how he was to go— At the Office <persRef
								ref="levy-n">N. Levy</persRef> the Vice-Consul at the Island of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas came to enquire, whether he could
							go back, or whether he should appoint a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cabot as his agent there in his stead— This is connected with the
							project of <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">C. Hughes’s</persRef> going
							to Copenhagen— I promised Levy to speak to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> about it and give him an
							answer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington came and asked of the
							progress of the Convention before the Senate— I told him they would
							probably get through it in the course of this week. He spoke also of a
							correspondence between <persRef ref="porter-david">Commodore
								Porter</persRef> and <persRef ref="owen-edward">Sir Edward
								Owen</persRef>, of a delicate character, and which he had heretofore
							mentioned informally to <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef>, the Secretary of
							the Navy— He is now to address me officially concerning it. Something
							was also said of the transactions recently at Algiers, and Addington
							spoke very gratefully of <persRef ref="shaler-william"
								>Shaler’s</persRef> proceedings both now and heretofore— <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus
							King</persRef>, Senator from New-York called and conversed upon various
							topics— The Convention— He said no opposition to it is contemplated in
							the Senate; but the papers are not yet printed; and the Tariff absorbs
							all the interest and feeling of the Senate at this time— Ten States are
							inflexible on each side of the question; four fluctuating, and the issue
							altogether doubtful. King himself is against the Tariff, and very highly
							excited— The <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef> and
							Crawford controversy— He says the issue of the whole depends upon the
							firmness, and incorruptible integrity of Webster—who told him he was
							determined there should be a thorough investigation of the subject— King
							at Webster’s desire has written to Mason of New-Hampshire, and to
								<persRef ref="stockton-richard">R. Stockton</persRef> of New Jersey,
							to ask a free communication of their views, as to the propriety of a
							complete investigation— He has not yet received the answer of either of
							them— King plainly told Webster, that it depended upon him whether this
							affair should be laid open in all its true colours, or smothered as it
							has been twice before. King says that <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren</persRef> told him, that <persRef ref="mcarthur-duncan">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> M’Arthur</persRef> one of the members
							of the Committee had said to a third person that he had examined all the
							documents and satisfied himself that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford was a perfectly honest man— The day was at the temperature of
							Summer heat— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was again taken with
							a severe turn of the Eresypalis— After dinner I took a long solitary
							walk to the Potowmack Bridge, and round over the Tyber Market Bridge to
							come home— I was afterwards too much wearied for writing, and removed to
							a Bedchamber in the upper Story.</p>

								Sullivan</persRef> brought me a printed copy of the Report of the
							Military Committee upon the Massachusetts claim, which is as favourable
							as he wishes, and upon which he thinks the House will act next week—
							Sullivan wished me to write to some friend of mine, expressing my
							opinions of his conduct in reference to the claim— I suggested to him
							the peculiarity of my position which made the propriety of it
							questionable. <persRef ref="rice-luther">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Luther Rice</persRef> came again, to tell me, he was going to-morrow
							for Philadelphia— The Columbian College have a proposal for borrowing
							35000 dollars of the Bank of the United States, to be paid by small
							instalments extending in part to a term of six or seven years— And he
							wished me to sign a recommendation of it to the <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">President</persRef> and Directors of the Bank,
							which I declined, on the ground of the personal interest I had as a
							Creditor to the College— I had called this morning at the Branch, and
							told <persRef ref="smith-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> the Cashier, that if they would accommodate the
							College to the amount, which they were bound to pay on the first of this
							Month to me, no issue of money would be necessary, but only a transfer
							of credit; as I should apply the whole sum, to the reduction of my own
							debt to the Bank.— Smith had induced me to expect this would be done;
							and Rice now said he too expected that thus far at least the
							accommodation would be granted next Tuesday— This was <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams’s</persRef> last Tuesday Evening’s party for the Season— But
							she was herself confined to her bed— The company was unusually thin—less
							than one hundred persons— I had conversations with <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="reed-john">Reed</persRef>, <persRef ref="breck-samuel"
								>Breck</persRef>, and the Secretary of the Navy, <persRef

								>D. P. Cook</persRef> promised to call upon me to-morrow Morning at
							ten— <persRef ref="woodward-augustus">A. B. Woodward</persRef> asked
							some questions concerning documents at the Department, relating to a
							project for establishing a Home Department in the Government of the
							Union— The morning was warm and at Noon I bathed with <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> in the Potowmack. Swam about
							fifteen minutes, and in that time was quite fatigued. There was distant
							thunder and a sprinkling of rain; after which the weather turned quite
							cool.</p>

								<persRef ref="parrott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							either <persRef ref="mason-jeremiah">Jeremiah Mason</persRef>, or the

								ref="bartlett-ichabod">Bartlett</persRef> he is not altogether
							certain. <pb type="ms" n="306"/><persRef ref="cook-daniel">Daniel Pope
								Cook</persRef> was here, and spoke of the controversy between
								<persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edwards</persRef> and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford</persRef>— I observed that
							he had declared his disposition to refrain from taking an active part in
							the discussion before the House, and asked him if he intended to
							persevere in that course under all possible circumstances— He said no.
							He had been laboriously occupied in making himself thoroughly master of
							the subject, to discuss the Report of the Committee when it should be
							made, if necessary. But if Justice should be done to it entirely by
							other members, he should say nothing. I asked him if he, had reason to
							expect that any other member would take a part to ensure a real and
							thorough sifting of the subject, instead of that mockery of
							investigation, exhibited by the two Committees of the last Session. He
							said that <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ingham</persRef> and <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Duffie</persRef> had both assured
							him they would not suffer the subject to pass without a thorough
							examination— That Ingham in particular felt himself implicated in the A.
							B. transactions of the last Winter, and had now examined with great care
							all the documents. I told him that from the composition of the present
							Committee, I had no confidence in the impartiality or candour of their
							report— The Chairman and one other member had already disclosed
							themselves as unqualified and rancorous partizans. Of the other member
							there were personal motives operating upon at least a majority, and
							stimulating them to favour Crawford, and to sacrifice Edwards. It was in
							the House alone, and in debate upon the Report, that Justice could be
							done to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, and although Ingham
							might come out in strength, there was not much reason to rely upon
							M’Duffie, who had already shewn an earnest disposition to throw off the
							investigation from the House to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>— Cook told me that the day before yesterday, a
							member whom he was not at liberty to name but in whom he had perfect
							confidence, assured him, that <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">T. W.
								Cobb</persRef>, the member from Georgia, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford’s most confidential friend, had told him, that
							Crawford had found among his private papers, the very Letter from
								<persRef ref="stephenson-benjamin">Stephenson</persRef> the receiver
							of public monies, and President of the Bank of Edwardsville, the receipt
							of which forms the issue between Crawford and Edwards— And Cook said he
							was greatly embarrassed what to do, between keeping the secret enjoined
							upon him by the member who gave him the information, and the duty in
							Justice to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards of disclosing the fact
							to the investigating Committee— I told Cook it was impossible that
							Crawford should have made known this fact to Cobb, so that Cobb should
							have revealed it to another member, and yet that Crawford should
							withhold it from the investigating Committee. I should sooner suspect
							Cobb of circulatinweg designedly such a statement, with the intent of
							exciting and disappointing an enquiry into it— The fact itself must so
							irrecoverably prostrate Crawford upon this point, that I could scarcely
							think he would make it known, if really true— I mentioned that I had a
							file of the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis Enquirer for 1819. in
							which I had found Edwards’s Publication, announcing his retirement from
							the Direction of the Edwarsville Bank. Cook asked me to send him a copy
							of it, and afterwards wrote me a Letter requesting it. He told me that
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> had promised him
							there should be a thorough, impartial, and judicial investigation of the
							whole subject— That he had also much confidence in <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="mcarthur-duncan">M’Arthur</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="owen-george">Owen</persRef> of Alabama— He said they had
							already controuled the gross partialities of <persRef ref="floyd-john"
								>Floyd</persRef>— He said there were other questionable transactions
							of Crawford with Banks, under investigation which he never could
							justify— A Memorial from <persRef ref="reddick-unknown">Reddick
							</persRef>of the Missouri Bank, before the Committee of Ways and Means
							and upon which <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M’Lane</persRef> the Chairman
							had been manoeuvering to smuggle in private concert with Reddick, a
							report discrediting Edwards’s testimony, without disclosing it to the
							Committee, and which Ingham a member of the Committee has detected and
							disconcerted— A transaction with the Bank of Juniata in Pennsylvania;
							implicating a member of Congress from that State, and which <pb
								type="ms" n="307"/><persRef ref="tod-john">Tod</persRef> told him
							was true; though <hi rend="italic">he</hi> did not chuse to meddle with
							such Affairs— It is the same thing about which I had a Letter from
								<persRef ref="fisher-issac">Isaac Fisher</persRef>, and spoke of to
							Tod. 29. December 1822. Some extraordinary indulgences to the Bank of
							Darien in Georgia— All these he thinks will come in some shape before
							the House— <persRef ref="sullivan-george">G. Sullivan</persRef> came for
							a Letter of Introduction for young <persRef ref="coolidge-thomas"
								>Coolidge</persRef> to <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> which I had promised
							last Evening, and now gave him— He told me that the Military Committee
							of H.R. had reported a Bill in favour of the Massachusetts claim which
							had been twice read and referred to a Committee of the whole House on
							the State of the Union. And that the two delegations of Massachusetts
							and Maine were to have a Meeting to-morrow Morning to determine upon
							their mode of proceeding to promote the passage of the Bill— At the
							office <persRef ref="forbes-james">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Forbes</persRef> came for the final settlement of an account—
								<persRef ref="levy-n">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Levy</persRef>
							to renew his application concerning his return to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas or his appointment of <persRef
								ref="cabot-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cabot</persRef>
							as his agent during his absence— I told him that if he should not hear
							from me to the contrary within a day or two, he might appoint his agent—
								<persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rebello</persRef> came as I had last Evening at my house requested
							that he would. I told him the grounds upon which the President had
							concluded to delay for sometime the reception of him as Charge
							d’Affaires from the <persRef ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of Brazil</persRef>—
							The information received from Lisbon, that France was actively
							negotiating there— The blockade of Pernambuco, announced by the
							Government of Rio de Janeiro itself, recognizing a formal resistance in
							Brazil against that Government; the acceptance of a French naval force,
							offered as to his Royal Highness the Prince of Brazil, to reduce
							Pernambuco, and symptoms indicated on the part of the Emperor himself,
							of a disposition to restore the Portuguese authority in Brazil, all
							concurring with the fact that the Constitution formed by the Emperor’s
							authority had not yet been sworn to by him, were inducements for
							postponing a decision here; it might be however only for a very short
							time, as the Course of Events might even in a few days remove the
							equivocal appearances which left doubts of the establishment of an
							Independent Government in Brazil— He appeared to be much disappointed,
							and said there was no foundation for the suspicion that Brazil was not
							finally, and irrevocably independent of Portugal— He denied that the
							Emperor had suffered himself to be treated as His Royal Highness the
							Prince of Brazil, by the Commander of the French Squadron, and declared
							that the offer of aid from that Officer to Blockade Pernambuco had not
							been accepted— He said they had made war upon Portugal; they had
							stationed a Frigate off Lisbon which had made several captures of
							Portuguese Vessels which had been condemned in Brazil— He knew not how
							the sincerity of Independence could be more firmly maintained— He wished
							that the United States might be the first to recognize the Independence
							of Brazil— The formation of an American system under the Auspices of the
							United States, to counteract the European system was very desirable, and
							must necessarily give an ascendency to the influence of the United
							States in Brazil, and throughout America— An influence which both France
							and Britain were assiduously labouring to anticipate— The Commercial
							Relations between the United States and Brazil were already important,
							and were increasing. He wished that the political Relations between them
							might be of the most friendly and harmonious character, and regretted
							that the hesitation and delay of recognition would have a tendency to
							produce a coolness in the Sentiments of the two Nations towards each
							other. I replied that I would report the substance of his observations
							to the President, and would then further communicate with him— That in
							the mean time every attention would be paid to any representation that
							he should make upon subjects which he had in charge from his Government—
							He said that as the Session of Congress was drawing towards a close he
							regretted the length of time which must pass before he could receive a
							definitive Answer. I said that the <pb type="ms" n="308"/>recognition
							and his reception might as well take place during the recess of
							Congress, as while they are in Session— He observed that I had mentioned
							to him that his written narrative and representations to me would be
							communicated to Congress— I said certainly; but that if he should be
							received during the recess, they would be sent to Congress at the
							commencement of their next Session— He asked me if I would give him an
							answer to the Notes he had addressed to me, in writing— I said if he
							wished it I would take the directions of the President in that respect,
							and was not aware that he would have any objection— We had supposed that
							he himself might prefer that the assignation of our reasons for delaying
							his reception should be given verbally rather than in writing— He asked
							if I had not given written answers to the Spanish South-American Agents
							before the recognition of their Governments;— I said I had sometimes,
							and sometimes had answered only verbally— I would however take the
							directions of the President and very shortly let him know the result—
							Immediately after he left me, I went to the President’s and made him a
							full Report of what had passed between us— I found the President
							strongly inclined to receiving him— He said that the essential principle
							for us was the point of Independence. The form of Government was not our
							concern, and by avoiding to meddle with it we should come less in
							collision with the European powers— I had received this morning from
								<persRef ref="raguet-condy">C. Raguet</persRef>, a duplicate of his
							Letter of 8. March, with an additional postscript of the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>saying that the Emperor was to take the
							Oath to the Constitution the next day; and that all was tranquil. No
							additions to the French Squadron of which the Letter of the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>had announced fifteen vessels as an
							expected reinforcement of the four which had arrived— The President
							concluded to suspend for a few days more his determination— After I
							returned to the Office, <persRef ref="english-george">George B.
								English</persRef> came, returned from his mission to Constantinople—
							I had received two or three days since three despatches from him, dated
							at Constantinople— He said he hoped that he had performed the business
							entrusted to him to the satisfaction of the President— I said, as far as
							was believed to have been in his power— He proposed to call upon the
							President, which I approved— <persRef ref="stetson-amasa">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Amasa Stetson</persRef> came to ask
							for a copy of an Act of Congress, just passed, in his favour— He is to
							have it to-morrow Morning— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef>
							came upon his afternoon visit— There was an Evening party at <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown’s</persRef> which I declined
							attending owing to the illness of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> who is still
							confined to her bed. <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Jos. Blunt</persRef>
							spent an hour with me this Evening— I took a late walk; and wasted the
							rest of the Evening in reading.</p>

						<p><date>6. VII.</date> Rain, almost the whole day— <persRef
								ref="johnson-george">George Johnson</persRef> was here— The
							prospects of his business are again much dashed; the accounts from
							Europe being less favourable than was to have been expected from those
							that preceded— At the Office <persRef ref="english-george">G. B.
								English</persRef> came again, having seen the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> this Morning. English
							enquired whether it was thought advisable to accept the proposition made
							to him by the <persRef ref="pasha-ibrahim">Capitan Pasha</persRef>—which
							was that in the course of the ensuing Summer, when he should be in
							command of the Turkish Squadron in the Mediterranean, the Commander of
							the American Squadron there should be authorised to meet him, and make
							to him such proposals for a Treaty, as the American Government might
							desire— He would then communicate them directly to <persRef
								ref="mahmudii">the Sultan</persRef>, and if he should approve them
							the Treaty might be concluded, before any of the European Powers should
							have any knowledge of the transaction— This expedient is devised to
							evade the interference of the Ministers of European Powers, especially
							of Great Britain to prevent a Treaty, which would be inevitable if the
							attempt to negotiate one should be made at Constantinople. I observed to
							English that the resort to this mode of Negotiation was liable to
							objections— The most prominent of which was suggested by his own
							despatches— It appeared from these, that the <pb type="ms" n="309"
								/><persRef ref="pasha-mehmed">Reis Effendi</persRef> the Ottoman
							Minister of Foreign Affairs, entertained already some suspicions of this
							design, and was probably exasperated against it, so that English had
							considered himself for some time in personal danger, and doubtful
							whether he should get safely away from the Country. He said that was
							true— But the Capitan Pasha, had been for several years the avowed and
							acknowledged patron of the American Nation at the Porte— An overture
							might therefore be made through him directly to the Sultan without
							encroaching upon the Department of the Reis Effendi. And this overture
							could not be more advantageously made, than by an apparently casual
							meeting between him and the Commander of the American Squadron in the
							Mediterranean— Its success would depend upon the light in which it would
							be viewed, by the Sultan; and the Capitan Pasha, must be purchased by
							the usual Presents in case of success— I told English that the President
							would reflect upon the Subject, and come to his determination as soon as
							possible— He asked me if he could flatter himself with an expectation of
							further employment, and said he had been for many years habituated to
							consider me as his patron and friend. I said it would always give me
							pleasure to serve him; but I could promise him nothing at this time. If
							any occasion should present itself of giving him a suitable occupation,
							I would not be unmindful of him. <persRef ref="hodgson-william">Young
								Hodgson</persRef> came in soon after with a specimen of his
							translation from the Portuguese, which was well done. He has now begun
							upon the Brazilian Constitution— <persRef ref="sullivan-george">G.

							Meeting of the Delegations of Massachusetts and Maine, <persRef
								ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd</persRef> in
							the Chair, at which it was unanimously agreed to press the passage of
							the Bill authorizing the Settlement of the Massachusetts claim, as
							earnestly as possible.— Sullivan has great hopes of obtaining its
							passage at this Session. I had returned home to dine, when at near six
							O’Clock, a Messenger from <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">Major
								Hamilton</persRef>, the member from South-Carolina, came to enquire
							for me— I had totally forgotten an engagement to dine with him— I found
							him waiting for me to sit down to table— <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef

							mind, upon this Convention recently concluded with Great-Britain, in
							which it was said the mutual right of search at Sea had been conceded—
							Insomuch that a Meeting had been called at Baltimore, to memorialize the
							Senate against the ratification of it— They both asked a number of
							questions concerning it, which I answered, by giving them the necessary
							explanations— The causes of this ebullition are two. The first a
							statement made by <persRef ref="canning-george">George Canning</persRef>
							in Parliament that in this Convention, the right of search was mutually
							conceded— And this statement made by him as a gilding to the pill, of a
							Bill to make the Slave-trade piracy the sine qua non, and preliminary to
							the concession of the mutual right of capture, and consequent right of
							visitation and search, which Bill he was then to introduce and carry
							through Parliament, is the first and as yet the only knowledge which our
							People have of this Convention: It having been circulated by paragraphs
							in all our Newspapers— The second is the keen and eager look out of my
							political opponents, at this moment, for any thing that may serve as a
							missile weapon against me. They have thus snatched at this jesuitical
							statement of Canning, and without seeing the <pb type="ms" n="310"
							/>Convention, endeavour to raise a popular clamour against me for
							conceding the right of search— <persRef ref="lathrop-samuel">M<hi

								<persRef ref="hodgson-william">Hodgson</persRef> brought a further

							Canning, and its enclosure, the Act of Parliament as passed on the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st. </hi>of March making the Slave-trade Piracy.
							They were sent by an Extra Packet, despatched for the special purpose of
							bringing out the Act, and which has arrived at Annapolis— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington had sent me this morning a
							despatch from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, of 1.
							April, enclosing a printed copy of the Bill, as it had passed the House
							of Lords the preceding day, and a private Letter of the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi>— Addington was inquisitive as to the
							Sentiments of the Government with regard to the correspondence between
								<persRef ref="porter-david">Commodore Porter</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="owen-edward">Sir Edward Owen</persRef>. I told him in my
							private judgment, Porter and <persRef ref="gregory-francis"
								>Gregory</persRef> were wrong; but what the Sentiments of the
							Government might be, I must wait the Instructions of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> to tell him— The main point
							of Addington’s complaint was the evil tendency of Gregory’s making the
							public conduct of an Officer in another Service, the ground of a
							personal quarrel— This is certainly wrong— But the mischief at the
							bottom, is the practice of duelling, and if I should now make this a
							case for strong censure either upon Gregory or Porter, it would
							infallibly be set down to the account of Presidential electioneering— So
							whimsical is the operation of accidental coincidences, in human affairs—
							I told Addington, that I heard it was probable there would be opposition
							to the Ratification of the Convention in the Senate— He said he knew
							there would— That it would be opposed by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi

							the President’s the despatches received from England, and reported to
							him M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington’s remarks— He seemed
							undetermined what to do with the complaint against Porter and Gregory;
							and a little uneasy at the opposition in Senate to the ratification of
							the Slave-trade Piracy Convention. He said he thought it very important;
							not only in itself; but as indicating to the European Holy allies, an
							understanding upon that great interest between the United States &amp;
							Great-Britain. He directed that copies of the papers this day received

								<persRef ref="mclean-william">his brother</persRef> in the State of

							it to get into the newspapers— As that would look too much like

							is one of the names on the proposed electoral ticket for Ohio; and
							writes that he is sanguine of success— We know so little of that in
							futurity which is best for ourselves, that whether I ought to <hi

							thinking of the frosty Caucasus— To suffer without feeling, is not in
							human nature, and when I consider that to me alone of all the Candidates
							before the Nation, failure of success, would be equivalent to a vote of
							censure by the Nation upon my past service, I cannot dissemble to
							myself, that I have more at stake upon the result than any other

							prosperous and to adverse fortune— If I am able to bear success, I must
							be tempered to endure defeat— He who is equal to the task of serving a

						<p><date>10. VII.</date><persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> called upon me this
							morning to say that he had prepared a Book to be deposited in the
							Congress Library at the Capitol; to contain the subscriptions of all
							persons in the Service of the United States at Washington, for the
							Greeks— His project was that every individual would subscribe one day’s
							pay— He had requested the subscription of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, who told him he would
							consult the members of his Administration upon the propriety of his
							subscribing— The Doctor hoped I should advise him to it— The <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Secretaries of War</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">the Navy</persRef> had said they would
							subscribe, if the President and I did— <persRef ref="scott-john2">Lord
								Eldon</persRef> the English Chancellor had subscribed a hundred
							Pounds Sterling, and even the Quakers in England, had subscribed upwards
							of 7000 pounds— The Greeks were in great want of it, and deep distress—
							There was a tremendous force of Turks, going against them, but the
								<persRef ref="muhammadali">Bashaw of Egypt</persRef> had declared
							himself independent of the <persRef ref="mahmudii">Sultan</persRef>, and
							there was no doubt that by the diversion he would make the cause of the
							Greeks would be triumphant. I told him he ought to have a subscription
							book number two, for the Bashaw of Egypt—at which he laughed, and said
							yes, it would be very proper— But to answer seriously his question I
							told him I should not subscribe for the Greeks, nor advise the President
							to subscribe— We had objects of distress to relieve, at home, more than
							sufficient to absorb all my capacities of contribution; and a
							subscription for the Greeks, would in my view of things be a breach of
							neutrality, and therefore improper. The Doctor said he was very sorry to
							find in me instead of an assistant as he had expected an opponent, and
							urged all the arguments of the crusading Spirit, applicable to the case,
							but I was inflexible. While he was flourishing for the Greeks and their
							cause, <persRef ref="benton-thomas"><unclear>T. H.</unclear>

							and <persRef ref="hollins-unknown">his son</persRef>, with a <persRef
								ref="mayer-christian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mayer</persRef>, applying for copies of Papers, to lay before the
							Florida claim Commission. They relate to Documents which it has been
							hitherto found impracticable to obtain from the Havana and the copies
							were made out for them— <persRef ref="hodgson-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hodgson</persRef> brought me his

							paper received this morning; an application for the aid of the United

								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Forsyth</persRef> came, and shewed me a deposition which <persRef
								ref="meade-richard">R. W. Meade</persRef>, had obtained from
								<persRef ref="morena-guerra">Guerra Moreno</persRef> a member of the
							late Spanish Cortes, purporting that the Cortes had annulled the grants
							of Land to <persRef ref="alagon-unknown">Alagon</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="punonrostro">Puñon Rostro</persRef>, only upon the understood
							Condition that Meade’s claim upon the Spanish Government was included in
							the Treaty— That he and another member of the Cortes had been appointed
							a Committee to go to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth, and enquire
							if the claim of Meade was included in the Treaty, and he had told them
							that it was— Forsyth said that Meade had applied to him for a statement
							concerning these facts, which he had drawn up, but did not know, whether
							he should make it to the Department of State; or whether he was bound to
							give it to Meade at-all. I told him that Meade wanted it as Evidence to
							support his claim before the Florida Commissioners. That he was probably
							not compellable to give it as testimony before the Commission; because
							it related to the discharge of his public duty as a Minister abroad; but
							as there appeared to be no motive for keeping it secret, I saw no reason
							why he should refuse to give it as a statement to Meade, to be used as
							Evidence by him before the Commission, in support of his claim: though
							it <pb type="ms" n="313"/>appeared to me, to demolish entirely all that
							Meade wished to prove by the deposition of Moreno— Forsyth had read to
							me his statement, which was that he had no recollection whatever of the
							Conversation, mentioned in Moreno’s deposition, as having been held by
							him and another member of the Cortes with Forsyth— That if it was held,
							they did not tell him that they came as a Committee of the Cortes, nor
							did he know them as such— That no Committee of the Cortes had ever
							communicated with him in his public capacity— That in casual
							conversation, to which he at the time had attached no importance, and of
							which he had never given any account to his Government, he might have
							said to Moreno, as he certainly had said to many others, that he thought
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meade’s claim was included in the
							Treaty, and would be entitled to the same benefit from it with all the
							rest— I said this was not what Meade wanted— His pretension was that his
							claim should be priviledged above all the rest, and paid entire, not as
							it was at the conclusion of the Treaty, but as liquidated in Spain
							eighteen Months afterwards— Forsyth said he would be glad enough now to
							come in for his portion with the rest—and added that he would give him
							his statement as he had read it to me— <persRef ref="sullivan-george"
								>George Sullivan</persRef> came and told me that he had now a new
							obstacle to the passage of the Act in favour of the Massachusetts claim;
							a man by the name of <persRef ref="byers-unknown">Byers</persRef> who
							pretended he had a claim upon it, and who threatened that if not quieted
							he would remonstrate against and prevent the passage of the Act— But
							Sullivan had very civilly set him at defiance. <persRef
								ref="barbour-john">John S. Barbour</persRef> the member of the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rector</persRef>, of Fauquier
							County, one of his Constituents, and his brother, <persRef
								ref="rector-william">General Rector</persRef>, of Missouri came with

							and a Letter from <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">H. Baldwin</persRef> to

								ref="irish-william">Irish’s</persRef> District— The same that had
							given rise to the controversy with <persRef ref="lowrie-walter"
								>Lowrie</persRef>. There was party rancour and malignity at work in

							seen the President, and made many enquiries, concerning the character of
							his agency; the objects to which it would be devoted, and its probable
							duration— Also the manner how he was to obtain a conveyance to the place
							of his destination. He said he wanted to return home to North-Carolina
							for about a fort-night before his departure; and I told him that during
							that time I would endeavour to prepare his Instructions— I also promised
							to enquire, if there was a public vessel in which he could have a
							passage— He spoke of his baggage and library, as being desirous of
							taking them with him— These private economics of our Public Ministers
							and Agents, are among the most disagreeable appendages to my public
							duties— I told him of the principal objects of his Mission— That the
							first of them was to obtain and transmit information, respecting the
							Country to which he was going—A new central South-American, and as it
							would seem confederated Republic— Situated at and including the Isthmus
							of Panama, a position of the highest Geographical importance: important
							also by the commercial connections and lodgments on the soil, by the
							British, with the neighbouring Bay of Honduras and <pb type="ms" n="314"
							/>Mosquito shore— It was furthermore interesting from the step at one
							time taken by the Province of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Salvador,
							now forming a portion of the Republic, to connect itself directly with
							the United States— It was understood that one of the deputies who came
							here on that occasion was now or recently had been at the head of the
							new Guatemalan Government— By the public Newspapers it appeared that
							they had appointed a public agent or Minister to come to the United
							States— The Republic bordered upon those of Mexico, Colombia, and Peru;
							but our information concerning it was scanty, and we expected to receive
							much from his agency— He is to see me again in a day or two— <persRef
								ref="kinnard-unknown">Lieutenant Kinnard</persRef> of the Army came
							to solicit an appointment in the diplomatic line— He had brought me a
							Letter of recommendation from <persRef ref="darlington-william">D<hi

							last Congress from Pennsylvania— I advised him to make a written
							application, to send several more recommendations with it; to be placed
							upon the files of the Department, and to await the event of a future
							vacancy— At the President’s— He had sent in to the Senate the
							nominations of Wilkins and Worthington— He directed a Cabinet Meeting
							for the day after to-morrow at one O’Clock, to consider again of the

							translated by <persRef ref="hodgson-william">Hodgson</persRef>— The
							President also enquired of me, for the documents referred to in the

							minutes of several of them which I mentioned to him— He said he had
							determined to look in to the merits of the controversy— <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> made his usual call at the
							Office;— <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef> called and
							spent with me the Evening— He said he had received three Letters from
								<persRef ref="mower-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mower</persRef>— Written in a manner somewhat mysterious, and the
							last of them under the signature of O’Neal— They purported that <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Clinton</persRef>, and <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">judge
								Spencer</persRef>, both of whom he had seen, approved entirely the
							sentiments that he Mower had expressed here, and were satisfied at the
							course which had been taken— They were both opposed to <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>— Both convinced that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> could not be carried
							against him in New-York, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton was
							gratified to learn that friendly sentiments towards him were entertained
							by me— Taylor spoke also of the strong desire of most of the members of
							the House to close the Session of Congress; and notwithstanding they
							have sent a Messenger after Edwards, he thinks they will adjourn next
							week, after finishing the Tariff bill, without waiting for the
							possibility of his arrival— He said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s answer to the Address of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Edwards had been sent in to the Committee this Morning— That it was
							temperate and discreet— With regard to the transactions with the Bank of
							Edwardsville, satisfactory—with respect to those with the Bank of
							Missouri, explanatory; and upon the affair of <persRef
								ref="mitchell-david">D. B. Mitchell</persRef> and the smuggled
							Slaves entirely silent— Taylor asked me, if I knew any thing of the
							complaints of <persRef ref="henry-r3">R. R. Henry</persRef>— I said I
							had delivered to the President, several Letters from Henry; but I had
							not examined into his charges—on the perusal of his Letters I suspected
							there was much foundation for his complaints— I asked him if he had seen
							the National Democrat of Albany, containing Henry’s publication in which
							his name was mentioned— He said he had this day received the paper; but
							the House had been told that the subject had been twice investigated by
							order of the President, and that Henry’s complaints had been proved
							unfounded— I said I believed the investigations had been very partially
							made; but I had rather purposely avoided penetrating deeply into these
							transactions. Taylor said he intended to move in Committee to ask for
							copies of those Letters between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							and D. B. Mitchell which Crawford had not reported in answer to the Call
							of the house of 31. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1819. but which
							Mitchell himself has published— I told Taylor that if the Committee
							could report without waiting for Edwards, without in substance deciding
							against him, I thought the adjournment of Congress might take place
							without waiting for him— But if the Report was to bear upon <pb
								type="ms" n="315"/>him with the effect of censure, I thought it
							should not be made, till he should have been heard— He said that one
							member of the Committee, <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston</persRef> had declared his
							opinion, and it was probably that of a majority of the Committee, that
							they should Report the facts, and leave the decision upon them to the
							house— That I said might be very well; but there was a way of reporting
							facts equivalent to a decision upon them, and in which the side of the
							Reporter was quite as distinctly seen. He said that <persRef
								ref="randolph-john">Randolph</persRef> had not attended several of
							the late meetings of the Committee; and <persRef ref="floyd-john"
								>Floyd</persRef> was sick, and had also been absent— <persRef

							Finance of the Senate, requesting me to meet them at the Capitol at 9
							O’Clock this morning— They had a Bill from the House of Representatives,
							creating five Millions of Dollars Stock, at an interest of four and a
							half per Cent; to pay the awards of the Commissioners under the Florida
							Treaty— The Committee wished to ask my opinion upon the construction of
							the provisions in the 11<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the
							Treaty— <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef> of New-York had written me a note last Evening,
							stating the purport of their enquiry— The Committee were Smith of
							Maryland, <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">Macon</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">Holmes</persRef> of Maine, King of New-York and
								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef>— The 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article stipulates that the United
							States would pay the awards to the amount of five Millions of Dollars,
							either immediately from the Treasury, or in Stock at 6 per Cent, payable
							from the proceeds of the Sales of the Lands, or in any other manner that
							Congress might direct— The questions were two—First was the payment in
							any other manner, as a third alternative applicable to both the prior
							members of the Sentence, or only an alternative for the payment of the
							Stock otherwise than by the proceeds of the Lands— The second whether
							the interest as well as the principal might be made payable from the
							proceeds of the Lands: which included the question whether Congress
							might not postpone the payment, and even the allowance of interest, till
							they should chuse to open land-Offices— Involving also the question
							whether if the Lands should not fetch five Millions, Congress would be
							bound to pay more, whether principal or interest, than they would fetch—
							I told the Committee they were aware that Treaties must speak for
							themselves, and that every other person was as competent to construe
							their stipulations, as the Negotiator of them— With this preliminary
							remark I could tell them what I had intended in drawing the Articles— It
							was, that Congress should pay the five Millions—in cash or in Stock, at
							their option— And if in Stock; from the proceeds in Lands, or in any
							other manner; but in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> manner— As to the
							question what was to be done, if the proceeds of the Lands fell short of
							the five Millions there had never entered such a thought into my mind—
							Whether correctly or not, I had believed, nor harboured a doubt, that
							the Lands would sell for more than double the five Millions— The
							Committee spoke also of the question concerning the discrimination
							between the duties on rolled and hammered iron; as bearing on the Tariff
							Bill: but this was merely incidental, after about an hour’s interview
							with the Committee they dismissed me, and I went into the
							Senate-chamber, just as they were meeting for the day— The <persRef
								ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice-President</persRef> took the Chair, and
							they proceeded upon the Tariff-Bill— Motions for removing the
							discrimination between rolled and hammered iron, and for prohibiting
							rolled iron, were made and discussed, and finally withdrawn— Then
							various other amendments were proposed, and disposed of; and the
							question upon the passage of the bill to a third reading was taken by
							yeas and nays 25 and 22— The Senate then went into the Consideration of
							Executive business, and I passed into the House of Representatives,
							where they were occupied on various bills of minor importance— I
							remained there until the adjournment, between three and four O’Clock—
							Many of the Members came and spoke with me— Some upon Affairs of their
							own, and others upon those of their friends— <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef> came and told
							me he was very much afraid of Rhode Island’s going wrong; and had been
							endeavouring to prevail upon <persRef ref="knight-nehemiah"
								>Knight</persRef> to take a warm and decided part; but he seemed to
							hang back— I told him Knight <hi rend="italic">could</hi><pb type="ms"
								n="316"/>not take a decided part until he should ascertain which
							side would be strongest. He was elected by a majority of a single vote
							to the Senate— To obtain that, his Colleague <persRef ref="dewolf-james"
								>D’Wolfe</persRef> says he made positive promises which he has now
							violated. D’Wolfe says also that Knight urged him to attend the Caucus,
							by telling him that if he did not, <persRef ref="bates-barnabas"
								>Bates</persRef> would be renominated and appointed Collector at
							Bristol— Knight’s propensities were to <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>; but he would
							endeavour to secure influence to himself with the next administration,
							by finally coming out for him who may succeed— There was more hope of
							D’Wolfe, than of him— Crowninshield said Knight had told him D’Wolfe was
							for Crawford— I said that might be; but I did not believe it— His bias
							was otherwise, although I had no doubt he too would finally go with the
							majority— Crowninshield still thought he could do something with Knight,
							and I told him, he might if he pleased renew his experiment— Knight and
								<persRef ref="hayne-robert">Hayne</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef>, afterwards came in, from
							the Senate, where they had laid upon the table the Slave-trade
							Convention— Crawfordism has taken the alarm, lest this concert between
							the United States and Great-Britain, for suppressing the Slave-trade,
							should turn to a concert for the abolition of Slavery— Knight told me he
							thought the duration of the Convention was too long, and that it should
							be limited— Hayne asked if in case the Convention should be ratified
							without limitation, we could afterwards repeal the Law, making the
							Slave-trade Piracy; and thereby annul the Convention: I thought we could
							not. Van Buren said he thought we could— After the House adjourned I
							attended at my Office— <persRef ref="sullivan-george">Sullivan</persRef>
							came there and spoke about the progress of the claim. <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef>, the Chairman of the
							Committee who reported the Bill in its favour, is very averse to calling
							it up during the remnant of this Session. Sullivan is for insisting in a
							peremptory manner upon having it called up— The expediency of which I
							told him would I thought depend upon the disposition of the whole
							Massachusetts delegation, honestly and earnestly to press for the
							decision. <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="poussin-william">Captain Poussin</persRef>— There was

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi><unclear>South</unclear>ard</persRef> were present— The

								ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silvestre
								Rebello</persRef> as Chargé d’Affaires from the <persRef
								ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of Brazil</persRef>— The advice from <persRef
								ref="raguet-condy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Raguet</persRef>
							of 24. March, that the Emperor was to take the Oath to the Constitution
							the next day; and the later accounts in the newspapers that he actually
							had done so removed some of the obstacles which there had been at the
							last meeting to an immediate recognition of the Brazilian Empire.
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef>, who had then been the principal objector was now not
							present; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, then absent, now
							declared himself decisively for the immediate reception of Rebello— He
							said we had nothing to do with their forms of Government. It was our
							principle not to intermeddle with them; and we could not justify
							delaying the recognition of the Brazilian Government on that account— I
							suggested the propriety of a nomination of Raguet as Charge d’Affaires
							at Rio de Janeiro, immediately after the reception of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello, and of a Message to Congress,
							proposing an appropriation for a Charge d’Affaires to that Government.
							The President seemed to think that no Message to Congress would be
							necessary, but expressed himself willing to make the nomination to the
							Senate— He recurred to the decision in the Autumn of 1817 that the power
							of recognizing foreign Governments was necessarily implied in that of
							receiving Ambassadors and Public Ministers— Though at the same time it
							was determined, that the exercise of that power <pb type="ms" n="317"
							/>would not be expedient without good assurance, that both Houses of
							Congress would in sentiment concur with the Executive upon the propriety
							of the measure— It will be well yet to reflect upon the most prudent
							course of proceeding in this case— Just before going to the President’s
							I had received two Letters from <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3"
								>Alexander Hamilton</persRef>, with a voluminous report, and a
							bundle of documents, upon the East-Florida, Land-title claims. In one of
							the Letters, Hamilton mentioned that he had sent in his resignation,
							under date of the 13<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of March, and by
							Letter of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this Month, had
							requested to withdraw this tender of resignation, that his Report might
							have official authority and responsibility. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford had received this last Letter, but had not
							communicated it to the President— He not knowing of it had the day
							before yesterday nominated <persRef ref="worthington-william">W. G. D.
								Worthington</persRef>, to Hamilton’s place— I now urged him to send
							immediately a Message to the Senate, withdrawing the nomination of
							Worthington which he did; writing at the same time a note to the
								<persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice-President</persRef>, assigning
							the reasons for the withdrawal— Hamilton’s Letters and Report, very
							seriously implicate the integrity of <persRef
								ref="floyd-davis;blair-william" type="multi">his two Colleagues in
								the Commission</persRef>; and he complains that his representations
							have not been properly treated by the Government— Crawford spoke of
							Worthington as a wild and extravagant man—and he is certainly a very
							injudicious, though not a dishonest man— Crawford remarked upon the
							looseness of the two Acts of Congress, constituting these Florida
							land-title Commissions— He said they were drawn by <persRef
								ref="eaton-unknown3">Eaton</persRef>, who was a man ambitious of
							using hard and strange words; such as deraignment of title, which before
							it was in these Acts he did not believe had been used since the time of

							very singular the enlargement of the powers of the Commissioners by the

									>r</hi> R. King</persRef> called this Morning on me, and said he
							was apprehensive it would be absolutely necessary for the Senate to
							annex in some form a limitation to the Slave-trade Convention now before
							them— He was much averse to it himself, and thought it very absurd— But
							there was no reasoning with fear— The members from some of the Southern
							States, had taken a panic, at the late Speeches in the British
							Parliament, looking to the abolition of Slavery, and were exceedingly
							adverse to forming any concert with the British Government whatever, in
							reference to the subject of Slavery— The question was whether the
							limitation should be for a term of years; or that the Convention may at
							any time be annulled, on either side, by giving a notice of days or
							Months— I said of the two evils, the limitation for a term of years
							would be the least— But either would be highly pernicious— That it would
							defeat the joint attempt to influence other Nations to make the
							Slave-trade piracy— For how absurd that we should try to prevail upon
							all other Nations, to declare it piracy, when they might retort upon us
							that we have shrunk from our own obligations, and made it a piracy for a
							term of years, reserving ourselves the right of repealing our own Law— I
							said also that <hi rend="italic">any</hi> limitation would be peculiarly
								<pb type="ms" n="318"/>ungracious from us, the whole project being
							our own, and adopted at our instance by Great-Britain— Of all which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King himself is fully sensible— Visit from
								<persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef>, a member of
							the House from North-Carolina, with <persRef ref="caldwell-joseph">D<hi

								ref="arnold-unknown">Arnold</persRef> of Providence, Rhode-Island,
							came to complain against a decision unfavourable to them; of the Florida
							Treaty claim Commission, upon a claim they had before them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Burgess told me the whole story of the
							claim, which was long— A case of seizure of a Cargo at Lima, for
							attempting to trade there without a license; though with a permission
							from the Vice-Roy of Chili. After hearing out the Story, I told them
							that there was no appeal from the decision of the Commissioners to the
							Executive Government, and that we had no controul over them whatever—
								<persRef ref="man-t">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann</persRef>
							came for directions respecting the means of conveyance for him to

								<persRef ref="tracy-albert">Albert H. Tracy</persRef>, member of the
							house from New-York, who sat and conversed with me an hour or more, upon
							political topics generally— His object seemed to be to ascertain how the
							Presidential canvas stood particularly in Connecticut, the Legislature
							of which is now in Session— Tracy appeared to be convinced that the
							Report of the Committee of investigation, would entirely justify
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, and in
							substance if not in words condemn <persRef ref="edwards-ninian"
								>Edwards</persRef>— He thought they would even do this without
							waiting for Edwards to be here, although they have sent for him— And he
							said perhaps it would be the best thing that could happen for Edwards;
							because after it was effected the manifest injustice of it, would turn
							the public mind in his favour— <persRef ref="addington-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington</persRef> the British Charge
							d’Affaires came to speak of the Slave trade Convention, and of the

							the iron, I told him the removal of the discrimination was impossible;
							and that the ground taken for rejecting it would be that we receive
							rolled iron from other countries as well as from England; as appears
							from the returns of Commerce for the last year under Sanford’s Law—
								<persRef ref="hodgson-william">Young Hodgson</persRef> was again
							here, and <persRef ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef>, who

						<p><date>15. VII.</date><persRef ref="plumer-william2">W. Plumer</persRef> a
							member from New-Hampshire was here this Morning— He said <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> had spoken to him yesterday,
							and intimated that the Committee would report altogether in favour of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— That upon the charges of <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edwards</persRef> he had substantially justified himself; and there
							was no ground for censure at least of a serious nature upon him— That as
							to his charge upon Edwards, they considered that as a personal affair,
							into which they would not enter— It was a quarrel between two individual
							Officers of the Government, which Congress were under no necessity of
							deciding— As this decision would bear heavily upon Edwards, he and
								<persRef ref="cook-daniel">Cook</persRef> would be wanting to mingle
							the Presidential question with it, and to get the friends of the other
							Candidates to oppose the report in the house, and censure it without
							doors— But it was best to separate it from the Presidential question
							altogether; and to let Edwards fall, upon his own demerits— And it was
							desirable that the Editors of the Newspapers friendly to me have a hint
							to take that course, representing the whole affair as the Report will
							do, and leave <pb type="ms" n="319"/>Edwards to his fate— I said the
							Committee might report to the house with regard to the charges against
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, as favourably as they
							could. His defence, with regard to the management of the public funds
							was strong; that against the charge of withholding and suppressing
							documents, with the exception of the case of <persRef
								ref="mitchell-david">D. B. Mitchell’s</persRef> negro smuggling upon
							which he says nothing, is plausible, and with a spirit of liberality and
							candour may be accepted as sufficient— Some circumstances which had a
							suspicious appearance, and upon which Edwards in his charges
							emphatically dwelt, are fully explained. He himself had in substance
							retracted a great portion of the indirect and ambiguous charge of
							perjury against Edwards made in his Report to the house of
							Representatives of 22. March last— But he has not retracted the whole of
							it, and although he has adduced argument and circumstantial evidence to
							prove that he did not in 1819. receive Edwards’s publication in the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis Enquirer, he has not explicitly
							denied it, nor has he given any sufficient reason for making that attack
							upon Edwards— That attack was the first public blow, in the quarrel, and
							if Edwards had the feelings of a man it was impossible he should not
							return it— To sacrifice Edwards is not the way for the Committee or the
							House, to avoid taking part in this quarrel— I desired Plumer to say to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, that far from inducing any
							friends of mine to countenance such a report, I should consider it as
							the most revolting injustice. That if the Committee meant to do justice
							between man and man, they ought to direct the Attendance of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford before them; put him upon oath to
							answer whether he did or did not receive in the autumn of 1819. the
							publication of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards in the
							Newspaper—either from Edwards himself or from <persRef
								ref="stephenson-benjamin">Stephenson</persRef> the receiver of public
							monies, and President of the Edwardsville Bank. Whatever else M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford in his reply had justified, he
							had not even palliated his attack upon Edwards— And if <hi rend="italic"
								>he</hi> should be sacrificed by the report of the Committee, they
							would only make themselves the tools of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s resentments— I should give no countenance directly or
							indirectly to that. He said he understood that <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward">Livingston</persRef> was drawing the report,
							and Webster was to revise it— <persRef ref="randolph-john"
								>Randolph</persRef> went off the day before yesterday, for England;
							and <persRef ref="floyd-john">Floyd</persRef> is sick— Livingston and
							Webster were making up the report between themselves, and were rather
							shy of the other members— Plumer said Webster had also spoken to him
							about the Presidential Election— Had told him that he should conform to
							the opinion of the State—but without taking <hi rend="italic">much</hi>
							interest in the question— He was not for breaking terms with any party
							upon the subject— His object was the introduction of federalists into
							power— For himself he was not ambitious; he was growing old, and would
							readily yield up any pretensions of his own, if <persRef
								ref="mason-jeremiah">Jeremiah Mason</persRef>, could be promoted— He
							thought the Attorney General’s place, would be a very good one for
							Mason— He did not exactly like the selection of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> for Vice-President— And his opinion of <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							had during the present Session of Congress very much depretiated— He
							thought <persRef key="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>, would be a
							very Suitable Vice-President— Plumer said he supposed that was to make a
							vacancy in the Mission to Great-Britain, which Webster would be willing
							to fill himself— I told him it would not be necessary to make Rush
							Vice-President for that— He was at all Events coming home—perhaps this
							next Summer—but if not, certainly at the close of this Administration—
							The objections to Rush as Vice President with a Northern President were,
							to taking both the Officers from non-slave holding States; both from the
							same great Section of the Country— There was no person who could be
							substituted for Jackson to fill the Vice-Presidency— No man who had so
							solid a mass of popularity to secure in support of the Administration.
							He would be satisfied, and so would substantially his friends, to be
							Vice-President, and as my supporters must oppose him for the Presidency,
							the only way that they could manifest their regard for him, and their
							respect for his services was to vote for him as Vice-President— Plumer
							concurred in this opinion— While he was here <persRef
								ref="livermore-arthur">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Livermore</persRef>, another member <pb type="ms" n="320"/>from
							New-Hampshire came to tell me that he was exceedingly afraid of the
							effect of setting up Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson as
							Vice-President, on account of a passage in one of his Letters to
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, in one of his Letters just published wherein he
							says he would have hung the three principal leaders of the Hartford
							Convention as Spies— I told Livermore they must set it off in favour of
							the fine Sentiments in the same Letter, for putting down the Monster
							party. It was a hasty and undigested sentiment, thrown out in the
							privacy of a confidential Letter, and it was hardly fair to hold him
							responsible for it— Livermore said he was satisfied— He had only been
							afraid, as there would be two tickets made up, at their meeting of the
							Legislature in June, that the name of General Jackson annexed to mine,
							might rather tend to weigh down than assist it— I said the
							Vice-Presidency was a station in which the General could hang no one;
							and in which he would need to quarrel with no one— His name and
							character would serve to restore the forgotten dignity of the place, and
							it would afford an easy and dignified retirement to his old age—
								<persRef ref="newton-thomas">T. Newton</persRef>, member from
							Virginia, came with a draft of a Report as Chairman of the Committee of
							Commerce—upon <persRef ref="breck-samuel">Breck’s</persRef> Resolution
							to enquire if any Law, exists, contravening the Convention of 1815. with
							Great-Britain— He affirms there does not and in answer to the British
							complaint, avers that rolled as well as hammered iron, is imported from
							other Countries as well as from Great-Britain— The returns of Commerce
							under <persRef ref="sanford-nathan">Sanford’s</persRef> Law, for the
							year ending last September shew a considerable importation of rolled
							iron from Sweden, and a small one from Russia— I told Newton I wished he
							would add a brief argument to shew that rolled and hammered iron were
							not the <hi rend="italic">like</hi> Articles: but he did not incline to
							this— <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Hay</persRef> called as he not unfrequently does, seemingly to
							enquire for news, and to sound opinions— He spoke of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s answer to Edwards’s Address as
							very unsatisfactory, and upon some observations that I made referring to
							points upon which I thought it a good defence, he said I was rather more
							candid and charitable towards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							than he was— At the Office, <persRef ref="mason-john2">M<hi

								ref="dias-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dias</persRef>, of
							New-York, a Citizen of the United States of many years standing, but a
							native of France, who had a claim before the Florida Treaty Commission
							which they have rejected, he thinks unjustly— He took up an hour perhaps
							in detailing over to me all the circumstances relating to it, and
							concluded by asking my interposition to prevail upon the Commissioners
							to reconsider and admit his claim— Saying he had heard I had so
							interfered, and effectually in a case of Mess<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs.</hi><persRef ref="perkins-unknown2">Perkins</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="lloyd-james">Lloyd</persRef>— I told him he had been
							misinformed. I had interfered in no case, and the Executive Government
							had no coutroul over the decisions of the Commission— In one case only
							when the Commissioners had doubts upon the construction of a clause in
							the Treaty—they had written to me a Letter of enquiry which I had
							answered— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dias left with me several
							pamphlets relating to his claim, and to the repeated decisions of the
							Commissioners against it— <persRef ref="dunlap-andrew">M<hi

								<persRef ref="english-thomas">his fathers</persRef> necessities and
							his own. If the President concludes to proceed in the idea of a naval
							Negotiation with the <persRef ref="pasha-ibrahim">Capitan
								Pasha</persRef>, he wishes to be employed in it, or at least to
							write to his Dragoman, of whom he made a high eulogy— <persRef
								ref="bradley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. C.
								Bradley</persRef>, member from Vermont, called to take leave— Going
							for home to-morrow— He spoke of the late Commissioner <persRef
								ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van Ness’s</persRef> claim for Salary,
							higher than the Law of Congress allows; to be considered as speedily as
							possible. <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton</persRef> had
							proposed a trial at Law; but that he thought would not answer— Bradley
							said too that <persRef ref="storrs-henry">Storrs</persRef> had intimated
							to him, that in my Letter of Instruction to R. Rush last Summer, <pb
								type="ms" n="321"/>upon the North-eastern boundary, I had censured
							the whole proceedings of the Commission under the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the Ghent Treaty, so as to
							include the American Commissioner and Agent in the censure— I told
							Bradley I had no such intention— I had considered the conduct of the
								<persRef ref="barclay-thomas">British Commissioner</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="chipman-ward">Agent</persRef> as absolutely shameful—
							And had pointed at transactions of the Commission resulting from it, as
							unfit, for the credit of both parties to be laid before a third party,
							being a foreign Sovereign— Bradley said he had been utterly ashamed of
							them himself. I told him, I would sometime when he had leisure, shew him
							the Instruction itself— Storrs, as a member of the Committee of Foreign
							Relations, of the House, obtained the perusal of the Instruction, by the
							confidential communication of it to the Committee, and this is the use
							he has made of it. Yet <persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dwight</persRef>, who is very
							intimate with Storrs, and himself an open, generous-hearted man,
							believes Storrs to be much my friend— Walking after dinner, I met
								<persRef ref="cushman-joshua">Cushman</persRef> and walked with him.
							Then D. P. Cook, and finally <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander
								Hamilton</persRef>, who walked with me to my door— I told him of the
							accident, which had occasioned the nomination of <persRef
								ref="worthington-william">W. G. D. Worthington</persRef>, as

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, withdrawing the tender of
							his resignation, not having been communicated to the President; which I
							attributed to the disorder in the Treasury Department, incident to M<hi

							I should on Monday advise the President to send his Report and

						<p><date>16. VII.</date> Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi

							what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.” <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef> who was there walked home with me, and came
							in— He spoke to me, of the extreme aversion of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef>, Chairman of the Military
							Committee to calling up the Bill for settling the Massachusetts Claim,
							which he has reported— He said Hamilton had changed his views in this
							respect; and for what reason? <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
								>Poinsett</persRef> took the same course— And the federal portion of
							the Massachusetts delegation, seemed to be not hearty in the cause, of
							pressing it now to a decision— I told him the coldness of the federal
							members of the delegation was easily accountable— If the settlement
							should now be obtained, it was upon principles opposite to theirs; they
							were sensible it must operate against their party, and therefore could
							not give their co-operation with much alacrity. As for the mutations of
							Hamilton and Poinsett, I knew not how to account for them, unless as
							Vice-presidential electioneering in behalf of <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>— <persRef ref="king-william"
								>William King</persRef> had constantly made of the claim an
							electioneering engine for <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef>, and there were many indications that Calhoun,
							and his friends were willing to make the same use of it— Crowninshield
							spoke to me also of <persRef ref="dunlap-andrew">Andrew
							Dunlap</persRef>, who he said was a relation of his; and of his objects
							in coming here. He gave me a character of him, not very favourable— In
							the afternoon I heard at the Presbyterian Church, <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>,
							from Isaiah 53.1. “Who hath believed our report?” and in the Evening
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little again, from Jeremiah 51.15–16.
							[“]He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by

							When he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the
							Heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
							Earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out
							of his treasures.” The general topic of the discourse was the goodness
							of God, as manifested in the works of Creation. A theme which has a
							natural tendency to run into common place— After returning home I spent
							the remainder of the Evening, in writing, and in a cursory perusal of
								<persRef ref="pickering-timothy">T. Pickering’s</persRef> pamphlet,
							of which I received a second copy from <persRef ref="davis-john3">J. B.

						<p><date>17. VII.</date> I received early this morning a note from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, making several
							enquiries respecting an opinion given by <persRef ref="wirt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> the Attorney
							General, on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February 1820. as the
							President now supposed, on a Resolution of the House of Representatives
							of 31. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r. </hi>1819. calling on the Secretary
							of the Treasury for information concerning the illicit introduction of
							Slaves, at the Creek Agency by <persRef ref="mitchell-david">D. B.
								Mitchell</persRef> in 1817— But it was not on the Resolution of the
							House that the opinion was given— It was on a Letter from <persRef
								ref="clarke-john2">Governor Clark</persRef> of Georgia to me,
							enclosing charges against Mitchell, and Resolutions of the Legislature
							of Georgia, which Clark requested might be communicated to the House of
							Representatives, in answer to that call— I examined the documents of the
							time relating to the transaction; at my house, and at the Office; and
							made minutes of the dates of the successive proceedings, material to the
							subject of the President’s enquiries.— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> came in while I was
							engaged upon the enquiry, having been also requested by the President to
							give him information on the subject. He came to ask the date of Governor
							Clark’s Letter to me, and the time of its reception; which I told him— I
							called at the President’s, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							soon afterwards came in— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> also came while we
							were there— The President was writing a short Letter to <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>, in answer to enquiries verbally made by him, in
							conversation, upon this subject— The President had consulted M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, and had on his table a Letter from
							him, much of which consisted of erroneous conjecture, upon an imperfect
							knowledge and recollection of the facts— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, reported on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of January
							1820 in answer to the call of the house of 31. Dec<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> 1819— Two month’s before that time several publications in
							the Georgia Journal, by Clark who was just then elected Governor of
							Georgia, had though not under the authority of his name, exposed the
							guilt of Mitchell in such manner, as could leave little doubt upon any
							rational and impartial mind concerning it. These publications were
							perfectly notorious all over Georgia, and were well known to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford. Yet he made his report to the
							House, on their resolution, and withheld the communication, of all the
							documents in his possession, which deeply implicated Mitchell; among
							which were three Letters from Mitchell to himself, and one from him to
							Mitchell— This is now made an incidental subject of enquiry, by the
							Committee of investigation, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s inquiries of the President have reference to it. The draft of
							the President’s Letter, after remarking that Governor Clark’s Letter was
							received after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s report upon the
							Resolution of the House had been made, concluded by saying “of the other
							Letters to which your refer, I have no knowledge or recollection”—or
							words to that effect— I remarked to the President that these words might
							seem to imply a denial that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had
							ever communicated the Letters to him— But it appeared from the Letters
							published in Mitchell’s pamphlet, that they were communicated to the
							President in 1818. He altered the phrase, after much discussion, so as
							to avoid all direct reference, to the Letters between Mitchell and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, and simply to state that he had
							not pursued the enquiry, beyond the Letter of Governor Clark— I left
							with the President all the documents, that I had collected at the
							Office, relating to the case, among which was a Letter from Governor
							Clark, dated 14. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1821. with enclosures,
							upon which nothing was done, because it was received, after Mitchell had
							been dismissed upon the final opinion of the Attorney General against
							him. I spoke also to the President of the Report and Documents of
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>
							Commissioner of Land-titles in East-Florida, denouncing and
							remonstrating against the proceedings of his two Colleagues, <persRef
								ref="blair-william">Blair</persRef> and <persRef ref="floyd-davis"
								>Floyd</persRef>; which I advised should be sent with a message to
							the House of Representatives— He said he would send them, and desired me
							to draw up a message for him to send. He shewed me a Letter that he had
							received from Hamilton, written after my conversation with him, the
							Evening before last, and in which he apologises for a former Letter
							written on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi><pb type="ms" n="323"
							/>threatening an appeal to the public— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard requested me to attend a Meeting again at the President’s
							to-morrow at 11— On returning to the Office, I found a new Note from
								<persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rebello</persRef> urging the recognition of the <persRef
								ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of Brazil</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> paid his customary visit— In the
							Evening I called on Alexander Hamilton at his lodgings, and left his
							report, to be revised by himself to correct some inaccuracies in it;
							telling him that it would be sent to the House of Representatives with a
							Message from the President to-morrow— He promised to send it back to me,
							early in the Morning— The remainder of the Evening, I was occupied in
							writing— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef>, and <persRef

						<p><date>18. VI:30.</date><persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef> Senator from
							Kentucky, called on me this morning, and introduced to me a <persRef
								ref="prentiss-unknown3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Prentiss</persRef> of that State, but formerly of Massachusetts—
							Johnson spoke of the Slave-trade Convention now before the Senate, with
							great doubt whether it would be ratified at-all, but he said it
							certainly would not without an annexed condition of limitation— It is
							opposed on two grounds; one for the concession of the right of search—
							The other, from jealousy of the Southern Members, against the views of
							the British Government concerning Negro-Slavery— The Caucus and the
							Presidential Election also furnish other, though unavowed motives for
							opposition— <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thornton</persRef> called to shew me an answer to an
							application from a patentee, for an alteration in the specification,
							which I approved; and <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef>, about the Message,
							to be sent with <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3">Hamilton’s</persRef>
							report and Documents— I had drafted the Message, and gave him the
							report, which Hamilton had sent back to me this morning revised. It was
							near Noon when I went to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, and found <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> with him. The first object of the meeting was to
							determine whether certain promotions of Officers in the Navy should be
							proposed as nominations to the Senate— Two Captains and eleven
							Lieutenants have died in the course of the last year— Shall their places
							be supplied by promotions, or shall they be left as economizing
							vacancies— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard were disposed to fill them up.
							The motives for this were abundant in the wish to gratify the ambition
							of aspirants— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun remarked that to
							leave Officers too long stationary in rank, had a tendency to produce
							discouragement and disorder in the service. The stimulus of hope being
							necessary to keep emulation active, and to preserve from corrupting
							vices— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, if he had
							employment for all the Officers now in active service?— He said no— Not
							without putting more vessels in Commission— I said the Franklin 74. was
							about to return from the Pacific—did he intend to send out this year
							another line of Battleship? No—he should leave only a frigate in the
							South-Sea; with perhaps a Schooner— I remarked that the pirates and the
							privateers in the West-India seas, had greatly diminished, and it was
							reasonably to be hoped would not again increase during the present year—
							It was to be expected that the expenses of the navy for the present year
							should be less than those of the last— If there was not full employment
							for all the Officers in actual service, I should advise rather to leave
							the vacancies open, and say to the young Gentlemen lacking advancement,
							that they must wait. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard said there
							would also be some difficulty in making the selection for promotion— And
							I added that in the event of an emergency requiring the employment of
							more officers than we now have it would always be in season to make the
							promotion— It was asked how the Senators would feel disposed; and the
							President suggested that enquiry should be made, say of <persRef
								ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd</persRef> of
							Massachusetts and <persRef ref="hayne-robert">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Hayne</persRef>— I said that might be well—but I knew
							how they would answer— They would advise to the measure— It was not from
							them, or men like them that opposition was to be foreseen—but there were
							others of very different character— Calhoun said there were sixteen or
							seventeen members of the Senate who might be set down, as systematically
							hostile to the Administration, and prepared to manifest that hostility
							by any opposition which they could urge with a prospect of success—
							Which success I observed, by no means required that they should carry
							their measure against the Administration— For even when they could not
							defeat a proposed measure <pb type="ms" n="324"/>of the Administration,
							they could excite irritation against it in Congress and clamour and
							discontent against it in the Nation— The President concluded that the
							vacancies should not be filled up at this time— He then spoke of a
							nomination for the fourth Auditor’s Office. He said he proposed to
							nominate <persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef>, now second
							Auditor, to be the fourth, and then for the second, he had made up his
							mind not to nominate a member of Congress— Then there was <persRef
								ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef>
							of Vermont, <persRef ref="durrell-daniel">judge Durrell</persRef> of New
							Hampshire, and <persRef ref="alden-charles">General Alden</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania— The pretensions of all these persons were fully discussed;
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard both urged the President not to nominate Lee as
							fourth Auditor, for various reasons which Calhoun set forth, and in
							which Southard and I fully concurred— No determination was taken with
							regard to the person to be nominated— I mentioned the prospect that the
							Convention for the suppression of the Slave-trade would be rejected in
							Senate, at which the President was much astonished— The ostensible
							pretences of this unexpected opposition were mentioned, the concession
							of the right of search, and the panic of the South at the measures
							taking in England for the abolition of Slavery, and with which this
							Convention was there associated. The real, or at least more operating
							causes were only glanced at— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							proposed that <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Mercer</persRef> should be engaged now while the
							Convention was before the Senate to offer a Resolution in the House,
							calling for information of what the Executive have done to carry into
							effect the Resolution of the House— This motion might be laid on the
							table, and would operate as an admonition to some of the Senators— I
							thought it more advisable to leave them now to act for themselves; but
							in the event of the rejection of the Convention, I thought it should
							together with all the documents connected with it be communicated to the
							House as a sequel to those already sent in answer to a call moved by
							Mercer during the present Session. I said if the debates in Senate on
							Executive business were public I did not believe there would have been
							raised a voice against the Convention— The President said that if they
							should reject the Convention; he would take the strongest measure that
							could be adopted in placing it before the House— The Message, with the
							Report of Alexander Hamilton, and documents relative to the proceedings
							of the Land Commissioners in East-Florida, was signed by the President,
							and sent to the House— Upon the subject of the <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef> and <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> affair I left with
							the President Mitchell’s pamphlet, and extracts from my diary in January
							and February 1820—relating to Governor Clark’s Letter to me, containing
							the charges against Mitchell; and shewing why they were not communicated
							to Congress— I desired that the President after perusing the extracts
							would return them to me, as I brought them only with a view to refresh
							his memory; by reference to the occurrences at the time— He promised he
							would return them. He enquired whether I knew, how the Committee of
							Investigation were likely to Report— I said I had heard they would
							report an entire justification of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, and that which would be equivalent to censure upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards— He asked with evident anxiety,
							whether if they should so report, he could with propriety continue M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards in the mission to Mexico— I said
							that would be a subject for deliberate consideration. I had heard that
							the grounds upon which the Committee were disposed to report so
							favourably to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford were that they
							meant to confine their investigation to the charges of official
							misconduct against him, and did not mean to enquire into his implied
							charge against Edwards which produced the explosion— On the plea, that
							they would not interpose in the personal altercations of two Officers of
							the Government— If this <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be the basis of
							the Report, and the House should sustain it, and the President should
							remove M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, upon deference to such a
							decision, my belief was that Edwards could and would appeal to the
							Nation upon it with effect— I had heard that after the report, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford would probably demand the removal
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards— The President said that would
							again present <pb type="ms" n="325"/>the subject in a different aspect—
							The position in which the President is placed with reference to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, and his party is exceedingly
							difficult— They are pursuing him personally, and his administration with
							the deadliest rancour of hostility: and they are impudently charging him
							with hostility to Crawford— Upon the attack made by <persRef
								ref="cocke-john">Cocke</persRef>, directly upon the President last
							week, <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">Cobb</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef>, expressly protested
							that by their votes, they did not mean to give an opinion upon the
							merits of the case— This was intended as a rod held up in terrorem, to
							intimidate the President from acting upon Edwards’s case, in any manner
							unfavourably to Crawford. This is a subject, which will have a long
							futurity. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams’s</persRef> alternate Tuesday Evening party was
							attended only by a few persons who had not heard of the notice given

						<p><date>19. VII.</date><persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dwight,</persRef> a member of the
							House from Massachusetts, called to make a morning visit. <persRef
								ref="mower-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mower</persRef> of
							New-York was here, as I inferred from his conversation to renew, in
							behalf of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, the
							attempt to obtain for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, the electoral vote of New-York for the
							Presidency— He told me that he had seen M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clinton, and a particular and intimate friend of his, (<persRef
								ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose Spencer</persRef>) who thoroughly
							approved of all the arrangements of Mower here—and were decidedly of
							opinion that there was, <hi rend="italic">in the Legislature</hi>, no
							chance for any person against <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> but me— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton was however doubtful, whether by
							the purchase of <persRef ref="young-samuel">Young</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">Peter B. Porter</persRef>, and with them of
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> party, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford would not ultimately prevail in
							the Legislature— But <persRef ref="crary-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-solomon">Solomon Van Rensselaer</persRef> were
							confident that Crawford could under no circumstances whatever obtain the
							vote of New-York— But <persRef ref="yates-joseph">Governor
								Yates</persRef> had determined to call the Legislature together and
							recommend to them the passage of an Act, giving the choice of Electors
							to the People— The Proclamation was already prepared, and would issue
							immediately after the adjournment of Congress— It would instantly kill
							two men, William H. Crawford and Henry Clay—and if the election went
							before the people; no man could stand in competition with General
							Jackson. The 8<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of January, and the Battle
							of New-Orleans was a thing that every man would understand, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton had told him that General Jackson,
							would beat him, Clinton himself, before the People of New-York by 33 1/3
							per cent. Mower added that the <persRef ref="simpson-stephen">Editor of
								the Columbian Observer</persRef>, Jackson’s paper at Philadelphia,
							had mentioned to him that <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> Administration, and federalism would be
							objections against me. He said he supposed I knew this— I said I had
							heard of it. Mower said he should stay here till the beginning of the
							next week, and congratulated himself upon having narrowly escaped the
							dreadful explosion of the Boiler of the Steam-Boat Ætna, by which nearly
							twenty lives were lost on her return to New-York from the trip, in which
							he had been the morning of the same day a passenger in her. <persRef
								ref="english-george">G. B. English</persRef> was here upon his
							project of preparing for the negotiation of a commercial Treaty with the
							Ottoman Porte, by interviews between the Commander of our Squadron, in
							the Mediterranean, and the <persRef ref="pasha-ibrahim">Capitan
								Pasha</persRef>. I intimated to him the objections and difficulties
							in the way; he then solicited some additional compensation for the
							service that he has recently performed— At the Office <persRef
								ref="watts-beaufort">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B. T.
								Watts</persRef>, appointed Secretary to the Legation to Colombia,
							came to enquire how, and when he was to obtain his passage—with regard
							to which the Secretary of the Navy is to determine— <persRef
								ref="gallaudet-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallaudet</persRef> came with a pamphlet upon Education, and an
							application for employment in the Department, for himself and <persRef
								ref="gallaudet-thomas">his Son</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="elkins-jeremiah">Jeremiah Elkins</persRef> came upon a similar
							errand, with certificates of recommendation— <persRef
								ref="addington-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addington</persRef> the British Chargé d’Affaires came, in great
							solicitude for the fate of the Slave-trade Convention before the Senate.
							He said he had been informed there was no possible chance that its
							ratification should be advised unless with a limitation to a term of
							years; and although it seemed absurd to connect together the ideas of
							Piracy for a term of years, with the Law of Nations—a great universal
							principle of morality for five years, yet rather than lose the
							Convention he would wish for the limitation, to which he had no doubt,
							that with the explanations that he should give, his Government would
							accede— He said it was perhaps on the consideration, that such a
							difficulty might arise here, which <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stratford Canning’s</persRef><pb
								type="ms" n="326"/>knowledge of our Constitution might have led him
							to suggest, that the British ratification was reserved until the
							Convention should be returned with ours— Addington asked me also,
							observing that the question would not be deemed indiscreet, whether
								<persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rebello</persRef> was received here as Charge d’Affaires from the
								<persRef ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of Brazil</persRef>— I told him that
							he had not yet been formally received, the definitive determination not
							having yet been taken— We had much conversation, upon the peculiar
							condition of Brazil at this time, involving the principle both of
							Independence and of legitimacy, in a manner altogether different from
							that of the Spanish Colonies— <persRef ref="woodward-augustus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef> came to enquire for
							documents relating to the project heretofore formed, and recommended by
								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef> in his Message of 3. Dec<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> 1816 to Congress, for the Establishment of a Home
							Department. <persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef> brought and
							introduced a <persRef ref="clark-unknown3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clark</persRef> of New-York— <persRef ref="dias-j">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dias</persRef> called again to request
							of me an <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi>, whether his claim was or was
							not included in the Treaty with Spain— I told him that I could not give
							an opinion—for two reason’s, first because I could not without a minute
							examination of all the circumstances of the case, form an opinion; and
							if I could, I should think it improper to give it against the decision
							of the Commissioners; if concurring with them, it would be useless to
							him— I called at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>
							and found <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> with him; but they
							immediately withdrew— With regard to the project of G. B. English, the
							President was not decided—as to his obtaining further employment, he
							said he had heard English’s character questioned, and his book censured—
							I said English was an avowed unbeliever; and had published foolish books
							of unbelief. He had been charged with having turned Turk— But he had
							denied this to me— There were many who considered infidelity as
							identical with immorality— I was myself tinged with that prejudice—but
							thought myself bound not to indulge it indiscriminately. English had
							been my pupil at Cambridge— His family was respectable, and many years
							known to me. I had obtained for him his first Commission in the army— He
							leaned upon me for patronage, and much as I disapproved his
							excentricities; and wild as had been his Spirit of adventure, I had
							never heard or known any thing of him dishonest or dishonourable. I was
							however by no means clear that he ought to be now again employed. The
							President said he was willing to make him an additional allowance of 200
							dollars; or at the rate of 2000 dollars a year from the time of his
							appointment until his return here— While I was with the President, he
							received a short note from <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">W.
								Lowrie</persRef>, the Senator from Pennsylvania, returning him the
							copy of his the President’s Letter to General Jackson of 14 December
							1816 which Lowrie had received from Richmond anonymously, and improperly
							detained— It was not signed, nor addressed to General Jackson, nor was
							the name of the General mentioned in it— But the last paragraph of four
							or five lines was in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							handwriting, and the rest in that of the late <persRef
								ref="purviance-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Purviance</persRef>— The President said he did not know how to
							understand <hi rend="italic">this</hi> movement of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie— I said I thought he should take it
							as a step towards conciliation, and a tacit acknowledgment that he had
							been wrong in detaining it hitherto— He said he was yet perfectly
							confident that he had never read any Letter, to <persRef
								ref="findlay-william">Findlay</persRef> and Lowrie. That he had
							never kept General Jackson’s Letter upon file on his table, and
							certainly did not five or six years after it was written go to his
							trunks to search for it, on the occasion of the appointment of Irish— It
							was not until after a long search, and in an old forgotten trunk that it
							was found when needed in February last— Still I believe that the
							President is mistaken; and this leads me to notice a proper
							discrimination in the <pb type="ms" n="327"/>estimate of seemingly
							contradictory testimony— The same incident produces impressions
							altogether different upon memories equally good— It is dangerous to
							oppose mere non-recollection, even though sustained by probable
							circumstances, to the assertion of positive remembrance, and my own
							experience, concurs with my observation of all the men, overplied with a
							multiplicity and variety of business, whom I have ever intimately known,
							to convince me of the imperfection of the most tenacious memory of man.
							But the imperfections of memory are very seldom inventive—unless in a
							mind altogether insane— They consist in the <hi rend="italic">loss</hi>
							of facts, and not in the fabrication of them— If Lowrie’s assertion that
							the President read to him and Findlay Jackson’s Letter be not true, he
							has falsified the fact— If the President read the Letter, he has merely
							forgotten the fact— The error on one side is mere human infirmity—on the
							other it would be wilful falsehood. I spent the Evening at home;
							writing— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef> went to spend
							a week with <persRef ref="decatur-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Decatur</persRef>.</p>

								ref="eldridge-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eldridge</persRef>, from the State of New-York— <persRef
								ref="plumer-william2">W. Plumer</persRef> was here, and we had long
							conversation upon political topics generally— He shewed me a Letter,
							from <persRef ref="cocke-john">General Cocke</persRef> of Tennessee to
							him, not signed, enquiring, concerning conversations at the boarding
							house at which they both lodged in 1821—concerning my opinions the year
							before upon the restriction of Slavery in Missouri— Cocke intimates that
							he had understood Plumer to have said, I was in favour of the
							restriction— And Plumer said he had a Letter from <persRef
								ref="hill-isaac">Hill</persRef>, the Editor of the New-Hampshire
							Patriot now a thorough Crawfordite, saying he had formerly understood
							Plumer to have told him that I was in favour of the restriction, and now
							it was published that I had been against it. Plumer said he very
							indistinctly recollected, both the conversations to which Cocke
							referred, and any thing that had passed between him and me on the
							subject— The object of Cocke, was to get an electioneering weapon
							against me for the Southern Country, and that of Hill to get one against
							me for the North, and also one against Plumer himself— Plumer said
								<persRef ref="barton-david">Barton</persRef>, one of the Missouri
							Senators told him that Cocke had been all this Session at him to get a
							certificate from him, about those conversations; but that Barton,
							considering the whole controversy as past and gone by, had refused to
							give him. Plumer said he had written to <persRef ref="archer-stevenson"
								>judge Archer</persRef>, who had also been present at the boarding
							house conversations to enquire of his recollections concerning them; and
							he asked me for mine, of what my opinions had been— I told him that the
							only conversation I recollected to have had with him on the first
							Missouri question, that of the Restriction was on the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February 1820. and I read to him the
							account of it given at the time, in my diary of that date. He said he
							particularly recollected the distinction I had drawn between a
							restriction upon Illinois, and one upon Missouri, and wished me to give
							him a copy of the extract from my Diary which I promised— Both Houses of
							Congress have agreed to adjourn this day week; and Plumer still thinks
							the investigating Committee will report in favour of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> upon <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards’s</persRef> charges, avoiding all
							research into the attack of Crawford upon him— Plumer asked me also, if
							I expected him on his return home, still to attend to the discharge of
								<persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas Hellen’s</persRef> Bills— I said
							I should. <persRef ref="adlum-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Adlum</persRef> was here about his wines; but I was much engaged and
							requested him to call again— <persRef ref="forward-walter">Walter
								Forward</persRef>, member of the House, from Pittsburgh
							Pennsylvania, came, he said, by the advice of some of my friends, to ask
							me, what were my opinions upon the subject of the Tariff, and the
							protection of manufactures— He said it was a subject of great interest
							among his Constituents and he knew he should be enquired of by many of
							them concerning my opinions with reference to it— I told him I had no
							desire either to obtrude, or to withhold them— I was glad the Tariff
							bill had passed, though I had no other knowledge of its details, than
							had been elicited in the debate; and had formed no decisive opinion upon
							them— I hope its operation would be satisfactory to those whose
							interests it was particularly adapted to promote without being
							oppressive upon the agricultural, and commercial interests as had <pb
								type="ms" n="328"/>been apprehended— I was cautioned to distrust
							Forward, by my Pittsburg Correspondents two years ago— He attended the
							Caucus last February and voted there for Crawford— Since then, my
							correspondents themselves have come out; held a public meeting, and
							nominated Crawford; and now Forward comes and asks me these

									>r</hi> Dennis</persRef> a candidate as Presidential Elector,
							friendly to me in his District, mentioning that he had flattering hopes

						<p><date>21. V:30.</date> I called this morning before seven at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and left with him the copy
							of <persRef ref="addington-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addington’s</persRef> note, and the observations I had written last
							Evening; which I read to him— He was then preparing his Message to the
							Senate— After breakfast I called upon <persRef ref="taylor-john2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Taylor</persRef> of Caroline, the
							Senator from Virginia, to tell him that the President would send a
							message this day, and to ask him, if the Convention should be called up
							in Senate before it arrived, to keep off the decision until it should
							come. He said the President had been with him last Evening, and told him
							of his intention to send a Message, and while I was there, a note came
							in from the President, repeating the notice that the message would go in
							this morning— In the observations I wrote last Evening, it was stated
							that the project of a Convention sent last Summer to England, was
							proposed to the British Government, by order of the President with the
								<hi rend="italic">unanimous</hi> advice of the members of the
							Administration. When I read it the President observed that <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> said it had not been communicated to him. I said
							it had not only been communicated to him, but that he had been present
							at the meeting of the cabinet at which it was approved, and assented to
							it without hinting an objection. He had objected strongly to a part of
							my Instruction to <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef>, which accompanied the project, as a
							misplaced declamation against the right of Search, while in the project
							of the Convention itself, it was conceded; and in consequence of his
							objection a great part of my draft of the <pb type="ms" n="329"/>Letter
							to Rush had been struck out— The President himself prepared a substitute
							for it which was inserted in its stead— He said he perfectly recollected
							it; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had told him yesterday,
							that he had not been present at the Meeting upon the draft of the
							Convention— He said he supposed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s memory had been impaired by his disorder— After returning
							home I recurred to my Diary of 19. and 20. June last, and found that the
							part of my argument against search, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford objected to, was in the Letter to <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">S. Canning</persRef> of the same date with
							the Instruction to Rush— That the President proposed it should be
							transferred from the Letter to Canning to the Instruction to Rush; but
							that I concluded to strike it out altogether; taking the President’s
							substitute for it. I mentioned this to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Taylor, who had told me that the opposition to the Convention in the
							Senate, was entirely a Presidential electioneering manoeuvre— <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">Holmes</persRef> of Maine were its prime
							instigators, and almost all its supporters are dead set Crawford men—
							His Colleague however, <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef>, he said had behaved with great magnanimity and
							honestly supported the Convention. Speaking of Crawford’s health, he
							said he had heard from a source to which he gave credit, that the answer
							to <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">N. Edwards’s</persRef> Address, was
							written by <persRef ref="tucker-george">George Tucker</persRef>, the
							member of the house from Virginia. The style and temper of the paper,
							both very good, render this highly probable. <persRef
								ref="miller-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller</persRef>
							a member of the House from Pennsylvania, came and took leave— He has
							been ill with a bilious fever and is barely convalescent— I called a
							second time at the President’s, who had then finished the draft of his
							Message to the Senate, which he read to me, and in which he had
							incorporated a part of the observations I had written last Evening— He
							had omitted the references to the Reports of Committees of the House of
							Representatives, in February 1821. and in April 1822, and the Extracts
							from them; but on my observing to him that my object in introducing them
							was to place the Senate in the event of their rejecting the Convention,
							in the most direct opposition possible to the House, he said he would
							send a note of the extracts, with them to the Senate, with them, if I
							would have them made out— The President further determined in the case
							of the rejection of the Convention, to send a message to the House,
							communicating to them all the papers, and informing them of his
							determination to suspend all further negotiation with the Powers of
							Europe and America, upon the Resolution of the House of 28. February
							1823. He told me also that <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> had been with him,
							and distinctly remembered that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							was present at the Cabinet Meeting at which it was determined to propose
							to the British Government my project of a Convention for the suppression
							of the Slave trade— The Message to the Senate was sent in; and I was
							much occupied the rest of the day in preparing for that eventually to be
							sent to the House— At the Office, <persRef ref="reed-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> John Reed</persRef>, a member from
							Massachusetts came, and had a long conversation with me upon general
							politics— He spoke with regret of the recent publication of <persRef
								ref="pickering-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.
								Pickering</persRef>. I told him that as there had been provocation
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pickering, in the publication of
								<persRef ref="cunninham-william">Cunningham’s</persRef> pamphlet,
							though contrary to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> will,
							yet I could not censure M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pickering for
							exhibiting his resentment to the world, against him— I thought he had
							injudiciously attacked <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, and unjustly
							renewed an old attack upon me— There was in his invective upon me only
							one thing deserving of notice, and that was a gross misrepresentation
							equivalent to a wilful falsehood— It was that of my having uttered a
							sentiment of servile subserviency to the Executive, in the debate upon
							the Embargo, in December 1807— I told Reed how the fact in that case had
							been, and he said he regretted not having known it some days since, when
							he had heard the same thing spoken of— <persRef ref="branch-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch</persRef>, a Senator from
							North-Carolina, came with <persRef ref="man-t">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Mann</persRef> to take leave— They go together for
							North-Carolina the day after to-morrow— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Branch spoke of the Convention before the Senate, against which I found
							him very strongly prepossessed— He said he had been favourably inclined
							towards it at first, but that many objections had been raised against
							it, and the more they had been discussed the more weight he had thought
							there was in the objections. I endeavoured to convince him that his
							impressions <pb type="ms" n="330"/>were erroneous, and exposed largely
							to him the policy of the measure, the motives upon which the Convention
							had been founded, and the high importance of its ratification— I told
							him the President had determined to suspend all further negotiation upon
							the Resolution of the House of Representatives of 28 February 1823. in
							the event of the rejection of the Convention— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Branch appeared disposed to reconsider his aversion to the
							Convention, but gave me no assurance that he would vote for it— He also
							spoke to me concerning the compensation to be allowed to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann— My Letter to him had fixed it at the
							rate of 3000 dollars a year, with contingent travelling expenses; but
							the President had written a Letter, mentioning it as, at least 3000. and
							from that up to 4500. dollars, with contingencies generally— He said
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann would take a Servant, and wished
							to take a Secretary—and seemed to enquire if these and their travelling
							expenses would be allowed as contingencies— I said no, but with regard

							would I had no doubt adopt the allowance to the state of the fund for

								ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> made his usual visit— In the
							Evening, <persRef ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seymour</persRef> a Senator, and <persRef ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mallary</persRef>, a member of the
							House, from Vermont called and spent an hour with me— They are about
							returning home; and spoke to me of the prospects in various parts of the
							Union, and of their own dispositions, with regard to the future— While
							they were with me a man by the name of <persRef ref="edwards-john">John
								Edwards</persRef> came with a wild and deeply agitated air, and
							asked if I had received certain Letters from New-York addressed to the
							President, soliciting the pardon of a man named <persRef
								ref="perez-unknown">Perez</persRef>, under sentence of death for
							Piracy. I had not— He had been to the President, who said he had not
							received them, and referred him to me— Where could he find them, for
							they had been written? I told him to enquire at the general Post-Office—
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>
							afterwards came, and passed the remainder of the Evening with me— His
							report against his <persRef ref="floyd-davis;blair-william" type="multi"
								>colleagues of the Land Commission</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine is before the Committee upon
							Public Lands— Hamilton talked much to me of the political condition of
							New-York, and appeared to be much exasperated against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford for withholding from the
							President, his, Hamilton’s Letter of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.
							</hi>of this Month, withdrawing his resignation— And he said that upon
							his making a written application to the Treasury Department enquiring
							whether that Letter <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been communicated to the
							President, he had found endorsed upon his application the word “yes”—
							Without directly offering me his services as a partizan in New-York, he
							talked as if he wished me to ask them, and told me that he confessed he
							had taken great pains about two years since to prevail upon <persRef
								ref="thompson-jonathan">Jonathan Thompson</persRef>, collector of
							the customs at New-York, a man of great influence with the Republican
							party, and who had been very favourably disposed towards me, to declare
							for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, which he had done— He spoke
							in a manner to convey the idea, that he had yet much power to regulate
							the opinions and movements of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson,
							but I was slow of understanding, and did not encourage him to enlarge
							upon the overture. <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi

								<persRef ref="phillips-isaac">Captain Phillips</persRef> came, and

									>r</hi> Burleigh</persRef>, a member of the House, from Maine,
							and <persRef ref="adams-parmenio">P. Adams</persRef> a member from

							the nomination of <persRef ref="ames-benjamin">Benjamin Ames</persRef>,
							as Marshal of Maine, which is yet suspended <pb type="ms" n="331"/>in
							the Senate. Burleigh was apprehensive that the decision upon it would be
							postponed until the next Session of Congress, and that in the interval,
							the district will be without a Marshal— This would of itself be a great
							inconvenience, but Burleigh supposes that in the interval <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">Holmes</persRef> would use it as an electioneering
							engine, and promise it to a dozen different aspirants on the condition
							of fealty to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>—
							Burleigh told me the purport of the deposition against Ames, and of
							those in his favour, and asked if the nomination of Ames could not be
							withdrawn— I told him that would be to decide the point against Ames,
							without reference to the testimony— He said the only deposition against
							Ames, implicated in like manner <persRef ref="king-william">William
								King</persRef>, and charged Holmes with a breach of confidence, in
							divulging contrary to his pledged word of honour, the fact of the
							witness’s having seen Ames at Bermuda in 1813— Burleigh doubted
							therefore whether the deposition would be produced, and if it should
							there was counter testimony to discredit the fact. I said I thought it
							would at all events be best to make a decision. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams enquired for a pardon or remission of sentence, for a
							man in his district named <persRef ref="fuller-unknown3"
								>Fuller</persRef>, sometime since applied for by him; and for which
							I referred him to the Department. <persRef ref="burton-hutchins">H. G.
								Burton</persRef> of North-Carolina came and introduced, two persons
							from that State, named <persRef ref="blount-unknown">Blount</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="knox-unknown">Knox</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="wells-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

									>r</hi> John Tod</persRef>, member of the House from
							Pennsylvania, came with a renewal of application, for an appointment of
							a person named <persRef ref="espy-unknown">Espey</persRef>, to a
							Clerkship; of which there is now none in the Department vacant. I
							congratulated Tod upon the success at last of his Tariff-Bill, reported
							by him as Chairman of his Committee of Manufactures— He appeared to be
							highly delighted with it, and said he believed it was better than if
							they had made it more burdensome. <persRef ref="english-george">G. B.
								English</persRef> came for the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> decision upon his proposals for a new
							Negotiation with the <persRef ref="pasha-ibrahim">Capitan
								Pasha</persRef>. I gave him no encouragement on this head, but told
							him an additional allowance would be made him upon his last Expedition—
							I went to the President’s upon the preparation of a message to the House
							of Representatives, in case of the rejection of the Slave-trade
							Convention by the Senate, and while there two of the Florida Treaty
							Commissioners, <persRef ref="white-hugh">Judge White</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tazewell</persRef> came in with a draft of a Report, which they
							propose to make at the close of the Commission which must be on the
							eighth of the next Month; and which they gave me to peruse, and for any
							remarks that I might think proper to make upon it. They mentioned having
							received the copy of a Note from <persRef ref="salmon-hilario">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Salmon</persRef>, the Chargé
							d’Affaires of Spain, remonstrating against decisions which he supposes
							them to have made upon two points before them; but one of which,
							relating to interest upon the claims they told me they had not decided.
							I left their Report with the President who told me he would read and
							return it to me on Monday— The President spoke to me of the reception of
								<persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rebello</persRef> as Charge d’Affaires from Brazil; and said if he
							should postpone it, till after the close of the Session of Congress, he
							apprehended it might be represented, as if he had purposely deferred it
							to assume the authority of recognizing without consulting Congress. I
							proposed to him therefore to receive M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rebello next Tuesday, to which he agreed— On returning to the Office, I
							found <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> there; and as he saw me
							uneasy as to the decision of the Senate upon the Convention, he said he
							would see <persRef ref="taylor-john2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Taylor</persRef> the Senator from Virginia as soon as he should come
							home, and let me know the result— He came in about seven in the Evening
							and told me that the Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> had just got
							home, totally exhausted, and said that the Convention had been advised
							for ratification, but spoiled by amendments and exceptions— I took a
							solitary walk of an hour to allow Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Taylor time to dine, and then called upon him myself— In my walk I met
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>, who
							told me that his Report against his Colleagues had been transferred from
							the Committee of Public Lands to the Judiciary Committee, and was now in
							the hands of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef>. He also told me that he had Letters
							from New-York mentioning that <persRef ref="yates-joseph">Governor
								Yates</persRef> was there; and would certainly convoke the
							Legislature to recommend the passage of an Act, giving the choice of
							Presidential Electors to the People— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Taylor gave me the particulars of the decision this day in the Senate
							upon the Convention— The limitation is that either party may renounce
							the Convention with notice, six Months before hand— The second Article
							is stricken out; and the Coast of “America,” is <pb type="ms" n="332"
							/>excepted from the right of capture and search. He said that his
							Colleague, <persRef ref="barbour-james">Barbour</persRef> had made this
							day the best Speech he had ever heard from him, in support of the
							Convention, and had done entire Justice to it— But all the other
							partizans of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had made of it a
							bitter, and rancorous party matter— Holmes had made a speech of two
							hours to the bare walls—and <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van

							>Dickerson</persRef>, <persRef ref="gaillard-john">Gaillard</persRef>,

								>Ware</persRef>, were all, dead shot against the whole Convention—
							Others fluctuated, for there were twenty members of the Senate, who
							might be set down, devoted to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford—
							He added that he should have some hopes of his Colleague, but he had
							understood that his Son, was to marry <persRef ref="crawford-caroline"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s daughter</persRef>—
							And so you see, said he, how this world goes— After the final vote upon

						<p><date>23. VII.</date><persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Hay</persRef>, called this Morning, to enquire
							from the President concerning the decision of the Senate upon the
							Convention, the substance of which I told him; mentioning the
							modifications and exceptions which <persRef ref="taylor-john2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Taylor</persRef> had spoken of, as
							having been adopted— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay seeing this Book
							on my Table, and observing that he had seen it almost always on my table
							enquired jestingly whether it was <persRef ref="burnet-gilbert">Bishop
								Burnet’s</persRef> History of his own Times— I said perhaps it might
							be. At least I believed it to contain the most complete materials for
							the History of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s Administration
							extant— And I added that I proposed to devote the leisure of my life
							hereafter to that design— But the Conditions of my undertaking it were
							Life, Health, and Leisure— And upon the form I had not yet seriously
							reflected— He said it was a pity that <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Monroe</persRef> had not kept a
							Diary—a very brief one in comparison with mine would have sufficed— But
							he now remembers nothing; as to time and circumstance— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay spoke as he always does with extreme
							bitterness of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, whom he declares to be one of the
							most insincere men in the world— He reminded me of a Letter written by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe in 1818–19. upon my controversial papers with Spain
							and relating to the Seminole War. They were in a style even of
							extravagant encomium— Precisely at the same time Hay says, <persRef
								ref="ritchie-thomas">Ritchie</persRef> of Richmond told him that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson had spoken of the same
							papers in terms of severe reprobation, to a Gentleman from whom he had
							it— Hay said he told Ritchie that that Gentleman <hi rend="italic"
								>lied</hi>—but he knew better—the Gentleman was <persRef
								ref="coles-edward">Edward Coles</persRef>, and he had told the
							truth— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson!— His enmity to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe was inveterate, though disguised,
							and he was at the bottom of all the opposition to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe in Virginia. <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef>
							came to mention the issue in the Senate on the Convention; of which he
							had heard, and thought I was not informed. <persRef ref="king-rufus"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus King</persRef>, came, and
							in a long conversation gave me all the particulars of the proceedings in
							the Senate; shewed me the parts of the Convention which have been
							stricken out, and the yeas and nays upon every question that was taken—
							He said that in the management of the opposition there had been great
							disingenuousness and rancour, and it had been clearly and plainly
							disclosed to the observation of every one, that the main object of it
							was, an electioneering engine against me— He said that after making the
							crime Piracy, and inviting all others to do the same, to cavil at the
							right of searching for the Pirates was an absurdity; and without meaning
							to compliment me, he would say he thought the abuses to which the
							exercise of the right were liable had been guarded against with the
							utmost care in the Convention. He knew not how they could have been
							better guarded— The message of the President had been very properly sent
							in; but all that it contained had already been said in Senate before it
							came in. He did not know whether, now, the Convention would be worth
							accepting or would be accepted by Great-Britain— I told him I thought it
							would. The essential bases of the Convention were untouched— The three
							great principles, that the trade shall be Piracy— The mutual right of
							Search and capture, and the trial of the captured party by his own
							Country are secured— <pb type="ms" n="333"/>The two Articles eliminated,
							were no part of our project— The exception of the Coast of America from
							the searchable seas, has operation, only with regard to the coast of
							Brazil, and may hereafter be removed so far as may be necessary, by
							further Negotiation— The only material injury done to the Convention is
							the reservation of the power in either party to renounce it with six
							Months notice; a power leaving an important question, what authority in
							the organization of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Government is competent
							to give that notice— I presume it must be by authority of an Act of
							Congress— I spoke also to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King,
							concerning the nomination of <persRef ref="ames-benjamin">Benjamin
								Ames</persRef> as Marshal of the District of Maine— The objection
							against him is that he traded with the Enemy during the late War, and a
							deposition of <persRef ref="harrod-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Harrod</persRef> has been obtained, stating that he
							being a prisoner at Bermuda saw and spoke to Ames there. Circumstantial
							strong but not conclusive testimony has been produced by Ames— The
							deposition of Harrod adds that he saw at Bermuda also a Vessel from
							Bath, with Potatoes, said to have belonged to <persRef
								ref="king-william">William King</persRef>— It says too that <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">John Holmes</persRef>, prevailed upon the witness
							about two years since, to tell him these facts respecting Ames, by
							pledging his word of Honour, that he would never divulge them— William
							King has sent a declaration to the Committee that he was not the owner
							of the Potato vessel, and did not trade with the British during the War;
							and Holmes admits that he gave to Harrod the pledge of secresy, but
							alleges that it could not interfere with the discharge of public duties—
							Upon the subject of New-York Politics, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							King said it was certain that the Governor, <persRef ref="yates-joseph"
								>Yates</persRef> would call the Legislature together, and propose to
							them the passage of a Law to give the choice of Presidential Electors,
							to the People; and no doubt that the Law would pass— What the result
							would be, it was impossible to foretell— He told me also an
							extraordinary story about the purchase of a Newspaper lately set up in
							New-York, called the National Union; a Clintonian paper, which first
							announced itself as favouring <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, and lamenting that there was an overwhelming
							majority of the People of New-York for me, but now had come out for
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> as
							President, and <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">DeWitt Clinton</persRef> as
							Governor of the State— And he told me some of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren’s</persRef> Negotiations to disencumber himself from the
							ownership of the Albany Argus— The British Chargé d’Affaires <persRef
								ref="addington-henry">Addington</persRef> called likewise to speak
							upon the subject of the Convention— He had been informed of the manner
							in which it passed, and said he hoped it would be accepted as it has
							been ratified here. He said it had been explained by him in Letters
							already despatched to his Government. He understood the opposition to
							have arisen purely from party Spirit; and to be in a great measure
							occasional— He asked me if I could let him have, confidentially a copy
							of the President’s last Message to the Senate—urging the ratification of
							the Convention, to send to his Government— It would undoubtedly have the
							effect of reconciling them to the modifications, annexed to the
							Ratification here— I said I would propose it to the President, and
							thought he would probably not object— But as there was a motion pending
							before the Senate, for taking off the injunction of Secresy from all
							their proceedings on the subject, the message would perhaps in that
							manner be made public— These visits detained me from the morning
							service— In the afternoon I heard <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, from Romans 12.12.
							“Rejoicing in Hope”—and the text was more impressive to me at this
							moment than the Sermon— In the Evening, <persRef ref="little-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef> preached from
							Galatians 4.31. “So then, brethren, we are not children of the
							bondwoman, but of the free.” The house was well filled; many members of
							Congress being present; and it was a valedictory discourse to them, upon
							religious Liberty— As I was coming out <persRef ref="stewart-andrew">A.
								Stewart</persRef>, a member of the House, spoke to me of it as an
							eloquent and well written Sermon— Returning home I met <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">Daniel P. Cook</persRef>, who walked home with me,
							came in, and sat an hour, conversing chiefly upon the affair of <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edwards</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— He is
							under deep anxiety with regard to the Report of the Committee, which he
							is apprehensive will not only substantially justify M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, but in a most insidious manner,
							indirectly take side against Edwards. From the Conversations of <pb
								type="ms" n="334"/><persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>
							with <persRef ref="plumer-william2">Plumer</persRef>, I am apprehensive
							there is much ground for the expectation— The disclosures of character
							made by Webster in this affair, have been strongly marked, and prove
							that William King is not the only man entrusted with the secret, that
							Webster is to have an Office of high distinction in the Event of
							Crawford’s election as President— His address in getting himself
							appointed a member of this Committee, which he did, by suggesting the
							reference in the House without moving it, and the cunning of <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, who at that time complained of
							his appointment as of a person unfriendly to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford, the high pretensions of impartiality with which
							Webster began the investigation, and his volunteer promise to Cook, that
							he would pursue the enquiry judicially; his consultation with Rufus
							King, as to the principles upon which the investigation was to be
							managed and through him with <persRef ref="mason-jeremiah">Jeremiah
								Mason</persRef> and <persRef ref="stockton-richard">Richard
								Stockton</persRef>—with his late underhanded attempts to prevail
							upon me to exercise influence over the Editors of Newspapers friendly to
							me, that they may sustain the Report of the committee to sacrifice the
							character and reputation of Edwards to glut the revenge of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, present altogether a combination
							of talent, of Ambition, of political management, and of heartless
							injustice, which have thrown open to my inspection M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster’s inmost character— He evidently
							considers the Report of the Committee as depending alone upon him; and
							so do the Public, I have no doubt that in a great measure it really
							does—but I have great confidence in <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W.
								Taylor</persRef>.</p>

								Barbour</persRef>, a Senator from Virginia, and Chairman of the
							Committee of Foreign Relations of the Senate came and spoke of the
							proceedings of the Senate upon the Convention, and of the motion made by
							him for removing the injunction of Secresy from all the proceedings. I

							by the Senate, with regard to their own proceedings; but some question
							would remain whether they could publish the confidential communications
							of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> to them— M<hi

							came in while I was in this Conversation with Barbour said that the

							vacant upwards of a year, for it has already been more than half a year
							vacant, judge Dick’s illness, having disabled him from holding any
							Court. Livingston said too that Robertson had so many of the wild
							Virginia notions about the judiciary, that he feared he would do
							mischief on the Bench— He spoke well of all the other Candidates, whom
							he named; and of <persRef ref="smith-john8">Smith, the District
								Attorney</persRef>—but especially so of Davizac, <persRef

							should be glad, if I had no objection to stating them, to know my

							conciliated by a Spirit of mutual accommodation and concession— I was
							satisfied with the Tariff bill as it has passed, because it appeared to
							me to have been elaborated precisely to that point. I thought I had seen
							in it an admirable illustration of the practical operation of our
							National Government. The two parties had contested every inch of the
							ground between them with great ardour and ability; and the details of
							the bill had finally brought them to questions decided by the casting
							vote of the presiding Officer in each house; and an adjustment by
							conference between the two houses— With the result it was reasonable to
							expect that both parties would be satisfied. M’Duffie appeared to be
							well satisfied with it himself, and he said that the final vote upon it
							in the house gave a majority of fifty votes in its favour— I told him
							that there was another subject, upon which my opinions had been greatly
							misrepresented in the Southern Country, with a view to excite local
							prejudices against me. It was upon the Slave question generally and the
							Missouri Restriction particularly— My opinion had been against the
							proposed restriction in Missouri, as contravening, both the
							Constitution, and the Louisiana Treaty. This was the first Missouri
							question— The second was upon an Article introduced into the
							Constitution of the State of Missouri, which I thought contrary to the
							Constitution of the United States. I then stated explicitly what my
							opinions had been upon both questions, and noticed the artifice of the
							misrepresentation which from my opposition to the Article in the
							Missouri Constitution inferred my having favoured the restriction. I
							added that the Article of the Missouri Constitution required the
							Legislature of that State to do precisely what the Legislature of his
							own State of South Carolina, had since done—and which <persRef
								ref="johnson-william">Judge William Johnson</persRef>, a native and
							Citizen of the State itself had pronounced to be contrary to the
							Constitution of the United States— M’Duffie said he had no doubt it was
							so; and was very glad I had given him this explanation. I called at the
							President’s, and spoke of the Brazilian chargé d’Affaires, whom he had
							determined to receive to-morrow. I advised that we should first
							ascertain whether the Brazilian Government considered itself bound by
							the Treaties of Portugal with Great-Britain for the suppression of the
							Slave-trade; and whether the <persRef ref="pedro-iv">Emperor</persRef>
							was disposed to suppress the trade itself— To this the President agreed;
							and on returning to the Office, I sent for <persRef
								ref="rebello-silvestre">Rebello</persRef>, who immediately came— He
							said the Emperor had declared by a Proclamation, set forth in the
							succinct narrative furnished me by Rebello himself, that he considered
							himself bound by all the Treaties of Portugal previously concluded; and
							added that he would send me an extract from his Instructions, in which
							the Emperors disposition for the total abolition of the traffic was
							pronounced in the most decisive manner— I asked him what number of
							Slaves had been introduced into Brazil in the course of the last year.
							He said from seven to eight thousand— What was the proportion of black
							and coloured people in Brazil to the whites? four or five to one— Under
							what flag the trade was now carried on to Brazil?— He said it was in
							vessels which bore the Portugueze flag at the Settlements, in Africa,
							where they procured the Slaves, and whence they departed, but took the
							Brazilian flag upon arriving in the Ports of Brazil— He said also that
							the importations were now confined to such as are shipped from places
							more than five degrees South of the Equator, where existing
							Establishments embracing large masses of property would require time to
							admit of their being totally broken up— He afterwards sent me, a note
							including the extract from his Instructions, and a reference to the
							Emperor’s Proclamation, which he had mentioned— <persRef
								ref="hodgson-william">Young Hodgson</persRef> called at the Office,
							and had a Portugueze pamphlet, a <pb type="ms" n="336"/>periodical work
							published in Brazil, in which there were several Essays for and against
							the abolition of the Slave-trade— Those in favour of the abolition,
							having been written by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello himself,
							who was the Judge of the mixed Commission under the Treaty with Great
							Britain at Rio de Janeiro— <persRef ref="trimble-david">David
								Trimble</persRef>, member of the House from Kentucky came and took
							leave. He spoke of his earnestness in support of the election of
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> to the Presidency; and said he hoped there was less
							of personal animosity between him and me than there had been heretofore—
							I told him there never had been on my part, any animosity, other than
							that which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had chosen to raise—
							Trimble said he did not wish to enter upon this subject, and after some
							other remarks said all he could tell me was that of the Candidates
							before the public; for the Presidency, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay would be his first choice; but I should not be his last— He meant I
							should take this as a proof of his friendly disposition to me. <persRef
								ref="edwards-john">John Edwards</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>, <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackelberg</persRef> and <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef>
							were here. I had a pardon made out for <persRef ref="perez-unknown"
								>Perez</persRef>, which I sent to the President to sign— But the
							President chose to reserve it, and directed me to write to the <persRef
								ref="tillotson-robert">District Attorney</persRef> Tillotson—
							Edwards was with me, when I sent <persRef ref="thruston-thomas"
								>Thruston</persRef> to the President with the pardon; and when he
							came back with the direction to write instead of the pardon signed,
							Edwards seemed as if he was going into a convulsion— He at last wept
							abundantly— I told him kindly that he must not suffer himself to be so
							much agitated; to make himself easy, and be assured that the man would
							ultimately be pardoned— Southard came to say that the President inclined
							to the appointment of <persRef ref="vanness-william">judge W. P. Van
								Ness</persRef> as fourth Auditor, and asked if I had any objection—
							I said I wished the President would appoint him; chiefly to get him out
							of his present Office, where his discordancy with <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">judge Thomson</persRef> the Circuit judge was
							very pernicious, besides other Considerations— Stackelberg came to speak
							of his intended departure; and to enquire what Salvage is allowed in the
							United States upon recaptured vessels— In the Evening, walking out I met
								<persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">N. Biddle</persRef>, the President of
							U.S. Bank, with <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickens</persRef>—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford was taken ill again on
							Saturday Night, and keeps his bed— I called on <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>, at the
							President’s request, to ask if he was now ready to consider his
							resignation as taking effect; so that the nomination of Worthington
							might be renewed— He said yes; but that <persRef
								ref="worthingon-william">Worthington</persRef> would be rejected by
							the Senate, and was moreover incompetent— After I returned home <persRef
								ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef> came and past the

							observed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s friends were

							called to take leave, and I returned him the printed copy that he had

							Commerce, upon the rolled and hammered iron question. It denies
							altogether the Justice of the British Claim. I called upon <persRef
								ref="taylor-john2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Taylor</persRef>, the Senator from Virginia, and mentioned to him
							the paragraph in the National Intelligencer of this Morning, stating
							that by a Rule of the Senate, no Extracts from their executive Journal
							could be taken; and that the removal of the injunction of Secresy was
							only with respect to the facts, and not to the documents— Taylor said it
							must be a trick to evade the publication; but that was not the intention
							of the Senate, and he would see to have it rectified— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Taylor told me he should leave the City
							to return home to-morrow. He spoke therefore freely upon the
							Presidential Election— The Legislature of Virginia he said had been <hi
								rend="italic">managed</hi> into a declaration in support of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>, as the Caucus Candidate; and the State would
							support him if he continued on the list of Candidates— But he was again
							ill—rumours were afloat that he had suffered a paralytic affection of
							the tongue, and since Sunday had been quite or nearly speechless— It was
							doubtful whether he would recover; at least so as to be sustainable for
							a Presidential Candidate— The State of Virginia would be compelled to
							look elsewhere, and he felt perfectly sure that neither <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> nor
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> could obtain
							the vote of the State— The Richmond Junto would attempt to bring up
							Clay; but they could not succeed, and if the choice should come to the
							House of Representatives I might take it for a certainty that the vote
							of the Virginia delegation would be neither for Jackson nor Clay— He
							thought every thing depended upon the State of New-York, and had not a
							doubt that Virginia would declare for me, if New-York should do so. That
							event however is now less probable than it was three Months since— <pb
								type="ms" n="338"/>I told Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Taylor
							what I knew of the state of the question, in every part of the Union:
							Prospects every where— Nothing to be relied upon any where— <persRef
								ref="plumer-william2">W. Plumer</persRef> came and took leave— He is
							to go to-morrow, immediately after the adjournment of the House— He told

							That <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> had read to him a
							very long Letter that he had written to <persRef ref="canning-stratford"
								>Stratford Canning</persRef>, to urge the ratification of the
							Convention in England, as it has been ratified here— The argument of the
							Letter was that I had heretofore been opposed to the concession of the
							right of Search, and opposed to making the Slave-trade Piracy by Law.
							That the opposition to the Convention now, was a personal opposition to
							me, connected with the Presidential question— That my interest is now
							altogether engaged in support of the Convention, and if it should not be
							ratified there is no prospect that any concert between the two Countries
							for this purpose can be established— I gave Plumer a check for 150
							dollars to pay <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">T. J. Hellen’s</persRef>
							bills. <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							I found <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef>, the
							Clerk of the Treasury there— He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford had been gradually growing better since Sunday, but kept his

								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							be employed for the ensuing Season— The Franklin 74, is expected to
							arrive from the Pacific in July, and it is not proposed to send another
							Line of Battle ship for the present into those Seas— I advised that the
							Squadron in the Mediterranean should be reinforced and a 74 sent
							thither. The existing war between Great-Britain and Algiers, as well as
							that between the Turks and Greek’s, give peculiar interest to that
							quarter at this time; and <persRef ref="shaler-william">Shaler</persRef>
							has written requesting with great urgency that the squadron may
							communicate frequently with him at Algiers— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard expressed the wish that <persRef ref="rodgers-john"
								>Captain Rodgers</persRef> now the presiding member of the Navy
							Commissioners may be induced to go out as Commander of the Squadron. The
							Columbus or the North-Carolina, to be the flag-ship— Rodgers preferring
							the former, built here under his direction, but having the reputation of
							a dull sailor, and Calhoun recommending the North-Carolina, to shew
							variety of force in the Mediterranean, where the Columbus has already
							once been. I brought into discussion whether the proposed interview
							between Rodgers and the <persRef ref="pasha-ibrahim">Capitan
								Pasha</persRef>, should be authorized: the disposition towards it
							was unanimous, but I desired it might not be decided upon without
							further and full deliberation— Whether <persRef ref="english-george"
								>English</persRef> should be allowed to go in the Event of the
							project’s being carried into effect is further to be considered— It is
							not certain that Rodgers will be willing to go. There are difficulties
							of economical and domestic arrangement—deficiency of pay, and some
							question of the additional expence which a meeting with the Capitan
							Pasha may render necessary— All this, is to be kept profoundly secret—
							The ship cannot be ready in less than three Months; and in the mean time
							the Constitution frigate may be sent out sooner— Before the Cabinet
							meeting broke up—<persRef ref="eaton-john">J. H. Eaton</persRef> of the
							Senate, and <persRef ref="foot-samuel">S. A. Foot</persRef> of the
							House, the Committee of enrolled Bills, came in with several for the
							President’s signature. He said he would go up this Evening to the
							Capitol— At one O’Clock, I presented <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jose Silvestre Rebello</persRef>
							to the President, as Charge d’Affaires from the <persRef ref="pedro-iv"
								>Emperor of Brazil</persRef>. He made a short address in English,
							which he speaks indifferently; and which the President answered with
							kindness as usual. The friendship and harmony between the two Countries
							formed the theme of these discourses, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rebello promised grateful recollection that the Government of the United
							States has been the first to acknowledge the Independence of Brazil. He
							glanced also at the concert <pb type="ms" n="339"/>of American Powers to
							sustain the general system of American Independence. To this the
							President did not particularly allude in his answer; but confined
							himself to general expressions of interest for the Brazilian Nation, and
							our friendly intercourse with them— After the presentation, I desired
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello to send a list of his
							Servants to the Department of State, which he promised— Returning to my
							Office I began the draft of a despatch to <persRef key="rush-richard">R.
								Rush</persRef>; and had a visit from <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E.
								Wyer</persRef>— After dinner, I walked up to the Capitol— The two

								>r</hi> Calhoun, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="everett-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> were there— I learnt that the Senate had rejected

							as Marshal for the district of Maine, and would probably reject that of
								<persRef ref="wingate-joseph">Joseph T. Wingate</persRef> as
							Collector of the Port of Bath— The President then at my request
							nominated <persRef ref="greene-benjamin">Benjamin Greene</persRef> as
							Marshal; and I went into the House to consult the members of the
							delegation for a nomination of Collector at Bath— They all joined in
							recommending <persRef ref="herrick-ebenezer">S. Herrick</persRef>, and I
							sent his name by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett to the
							President— But he sent me back word that he could not nominate any

								>Cushman</persRef> and <persRef ref="burleigh-william"
								>Burleigh</persRef>, to see if they and the other members from the
							State in the House, could agree upon a person to recommend; but they
							could not. They said they would see if they could before Morning— The
							House was in that chaotic state, which always happens at the last hours
							of a Session— No quorum—about one hundred members present coming and
							going walking about the house, and taking leave of one another— Some
							going off this Night. Others directly from the house to-morrow Morning.
							Many of them came up to me and took leave— I returned to the President’s
							chamber, and found him in the examination of Bills for signature— They
							were all read through, and both Houses having about ten O’Clock,
							adjourned till 8 to-morrow morning, the President requested us to meet
							him there again at that time— He took me home in his Carriage— On my
							return I found <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi

								>Greene</persRef> had already been confirmed as Marshal— <persRef
								ref="herrick-ebenezer">Herrick</persRef> upon hearing of the
							appointment of Hill, was very much mortified, and said he had a
							particular friend of his whom he wished to have had appointed, but it
							was too late. I told Herrick he must lay the appointment of Hill to my
							account, as the delegation could not agree to any one else. There were
							also several appointments in Florida, under a new act re-organizing the
							judicial Establishment there— <persRef ref="worthington-william"
								>Worthington</persRef> was confirmed as Commissioner of Land titles
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine— <persRef
								ref="blair-william">Blair</persRef> another of the Commissioners,
							was appointed a judge, and <persRef ref="murray-george">Murray</persRef>
							appointed a Commissioner in his place. For notwithstanding the
							denunciation by <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander
								Hamilton</persRef> of his Colleagues, Congress have done nothing to
							supersede the operations of the Commissioners— I went in to the Senate
							in a moment of interval from their Sessions upon Executive business, and
							took leave of most of the Senators still there— I spoke to <persRef
								ref="vandyke-nicholas2">Van Dyke</persRef> of <pb type="ms" n="340"
							/>Delaware, concerning the fire at Newcastle, and <persRef
								ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire came to me, and enquired, for whom I thought it would be
							advisable to give the vote, for Vice-President. I told him the Sentiment
							of my friends appeared to favour <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson</persRef>, and it was
							entirely agreeable to me. We were interrupted in this Conversation, and
							the Senate returning to the Consideration of Executive business I
							withdrew— About ten, the usual Committee of two members from each house,
								<persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">Macon</persRef> and<space/>of the
							Senate <persRef ref="foot-samuel">Foot</persRef> of Connecticut
							and<space/>of the house, came and announced to the President that they
							were ready to adjourn if he had nothing further to communicate. There
							were only two or three nominations for the Senate to act upon in
							Executive business and about half past ten, both houses adjourned— There
							was no quorum in the House, this morning, so that the motion to fill up
							the Committee of investigation by the appointment of two members in the
							place of John Randolph and of <persRef ref="owen-george">Owen</persRef>,
							did not pass— Before leaving the Capitol the President in close
							confidence told <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi><unclear>South</unclear>ard</persRef>,
							and me, that a friend of his had informed him confidentially, and that
							he might be prepared to act upon such an event, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had assured him, that unless M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">Southard</hi><hi
								rend="strikethrough">upon</hi> Edwards upon his examination should
							furnish more satisfactory grounds for his inculpation of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, the final report of the
							Committee would be decisive against him. And the President strongly
							intimated that he would in that case remove Edwards— I expressed a doubt
							whether the Committee would thus decide; Calhoun said it was impossible—
							With the exception of the indefinite charge of having mismanaged the
							finances, they had found all the facts as charged by Edwards— They had
							made at least two glaring mis-statements to operate against him, and had
							credited <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> for all the bad money that he had
							passed off upon public creditors, as if he had never received it— I
							asked the President who it was that had given him this hint, but he
							declined telling— He took me home in his Carriage— <persRef
								ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Dwight</persRef> soon afterwards called and took leave. At the
							Office, <persRef ref="lee-john">John Lee</persRef>, Cushman, and
								<persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef>, members of the
							house came and took leave. An English vagrant named <persRef
								ref="wagg-unknown">Wagg</persRef>, with <persRef ref="wagg-unknown2"
								>his wife</persRef>— <persRef ref="woodward-augustus">A. B.
								Woodward</persRef>, <persRef ref="addington-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="edwards-john">J. Edwards</persRef> absorbed the day— With
							Mercer I had a long conversation upon the Slave-trade Convention, and
							the proceedings of the Senate upon it— He said that when the National
							Intelligencer announced that no copy of those proceedings could be
							obtained he himself had gone to the presiding Officer, and insisted upon
							having copies, and had obtained them and they would be published in the
							Intelligencer— I had observed to Mercer, that after what had taken place
							in the Senate upon this Convention, and the subsequent effort obviously
							intended to follow it up, to make it unpopular; the power of the
							President to negotiate further under the Resolution of the House would
							be much checked until there should be some further manifestation of
							opinion by Congress in its favour. He now expressed to me some doubt
							whether this could be done at the next Session of Congress. He said it
							was apparent, and known to every one that the opposition now started
							against the Convention was merely personal, pointed against me, with
							reference to the Presidential Election, and but for that would not have
							existed. That it was barely temporary and occasional; but that probably
							the excitement from which it arose would be at its height at the next
							Session of Congress, and that then would be a moment peculiarly
							unfavourable for a calm discussion of the subject in the House— I told
							him I had no doubt it would be so at the beginning of the Session; but
							that my project was this— If the British Government should ratify the
							Convention as modified, the President will of course notice it in his
							annual message at the commencement of the Session; and it will be among
							the documents communicated with the Message— That part of the Message
							will in the ordinary course of business be referred to a select
							Committee, which may take the whole subject under consideration,
							including what is further to be done— They may keep it before them until
							the Presidential Election shall have been decided, after which there
							will be <pb type="ms" n="341"/>no motive for persisting in the factious
							opposition to the principles of the Convention which has now so suddenly
							and unexpectedly gotten up: to benefit M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, by fastening odium upon me— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford had favoured the concession of the right of Search even while I
							resisted it; and without the preliminary condition of making the
							Slave-trade piracy— He had encouraged <persRef ref="canning-stratford"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> in pressing
							for its concession— The project of Convention which I sent to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> had
							been submitted to his inspection; he had been present at the Cabinet
							Meeting, when it was determined to propose it, and fully assented to
							that measure. Though he now denied that fact— Mercer asked me upon what
							authority I made that statement. I said from the lips of the President—
							Mercer appeared surprized, and said that he had mentioned to the
							President, that he had heard this stated concerning M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford; but the President instead of
							confirming it had spoken as if he doubted it. He said he wondered why
							the President should have used this reserve with him, while consulting
							him confidentially on the subject, and after having had frequent
							communications with him upon subjects of a still more confidential
							nature. He had always considered me as opposed to his views, in relation
							to the suppression of the Slave trade; and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford as favouring them— That I thought the Colonization
							Society, wild and visionary in their plans; while M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford was one of their Vice-Presidents,
							and last Summer had spent a day, in presiding at one of their meetings.
							He further said that while Baron Hyde de Neuville was here, he had
							proposed a Convention between the United States and France, for the
							suppression of the Slave-trade; granting a mutual right of Search and
							capture, and stipulating to send on board of every Cruizer against the
							Slave-traders a joint Commission of Judges to try the persons captured
							of either Nation— That the President authorized him Mercer to make such
							a Convention with <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">De
								Neuville</persRef>, but afterwards withdrew the authority— Mercer
							spoke also of <persRef ref="smyth-alexander">Alexander Smyth’s</persRef>
							attacks upon me as being a favourer of the Slave-trade; of his hand-bill
							detailing their private conversations, and mine with Mercer; and of his
							own relations with Crawford; which he said had not been intimate. He
							approved the idea of acting in Congress upon the Slave-trade, at the
							next Session, after the decision upon the Presidential Election, and on
							his parting from me I assured him I should be happy to co-operate with
							him in the further support of the Cause; at which he expressed his
							satisfaction— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward came to speak of
							his project for the Establishment of a Home Department, and to enquire
							if I had examined his book, on the divisions of knowledge, and the
							Classification and nomenclature of the Sciences. I had not seen the
							book— Addington was anxious to despatch his Packet with the ratified
							Convention, and I promised to be ready for him on Monday next. John
							Edwards came to intreat that when the pardon for <persRef
								ref="perez-unknown">Perez</persRef> should be made out, it should be
							given to him to be the bearer of it— In the Evening <persRef
								ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef> came with <persRef
								ref="lyford-william">Lyford</persRef> the keeper of the Commercial
							reading room at Norfolk came to see me; and <persRef
								ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seymour</persRef>, Senator from Vermont, Livingston of Louisiana,
								<persRef ref="hobart-aaron">Hobart</persRef> and Crowninshield of
							Massachusetts, and <persRef ref="ellis-william">Ellis</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania came and took leave. John W. Taylor a member of the
							Committee of Investigation, who remains, to attend the further meetings
							of that Committee also called and sat with me till the close of the
							Evening— With Seymour, Crowninshield and Taylor I had particular
							Conversations; with the two former concerning the Presidential Election;
							with the latter relative to the proceedings of the Committee. Seymour on
							his way home will stop some time in the State of New-York— His main
							anxiety is to make friends by giving assurances of a <hi rend="italic"
								>Republican</hi> Administration— Crowninshield’s to give at home
							correct views of facts. Taylor told me the substance of what had passed
							in Committee— They have adjourned to the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>of June—to give time to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards to
							arrive, and prepare for his examination— In the mean time M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Livingston is going to New York,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster to Philadelphia— Floyd moved
							that if Edwards should not arrive by the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							of June, the Committee should adjourn without day; but this was not
							agreed to— <persRef ref="cuthbert-alfred">Cuthbert</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> addressed a note to
							the Committee, requesting that <persRef ref="noble-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Noble</persRef>, Senator from Indiana,
							and two or three other persons should be summoned to Attend as witnesses
							to discredit Edwards. Taylor gave me many details of proceedings in the
							Committee manifesting the timid, insidious and treacherous partiality of
							Webster, to which Livingston assents. He mentioned to me several
							passages in the Report, in which he had obtained alterations from the
							most marked partiality in Crawford’s favour to equal Justice— He said it
							was not difficult to meet the open and undisguised prejudices of Floyd,
							but it was hard to manage those which came in insidious forms from
							elsewhere.</p>

								ref="wadsworth-unknown2">Wadsworth</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="terry-unknown">Terry</persRef>—and <persRef ref="wyer-edward"
								>E. Wyer</persRef>— In the course of the morning I called at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>— Cook had not
							heard from <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">N. Edwards</persRef>; but
								<persRef ref="dunn-john">Dunn</persRef>, the Messenger from the
							House, sent to summon him, returned here this Evening, having left
							Edwards at Washington Pennsylvania—230 miles from hence; to come on by
							the next Stage. Cook is in great anxiety, knowing that the majority of
							the Committee remaining here are against Edwards, and aware of the
							prejudice against him in the public mind— He regretted greatly the
							absence of <persRef ref="owen-george">Owen</persRef> upon whose
							integrity and firmness he relied— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little
							came with the remainder of the Supplementary Register that he has been
							compiling— Clay said little upon public affairs— Spoke with apparent
							coolness of the affair of Edwards and <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>; and complained to
							having had within these few days a return of his dispepsy. Poinsett is
							going to New York—thence to Charleston S.C. and proposes between this
							and the next Session of Congress to make a voyage to Europe— He said he
							was willing to go to Naples, and see if any thing could be done there,
							with certain claims, which had been the object of <persRef
								ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Pinkney’s</persRef> unsuccessful mission there— Poinsett said he
							would undertake nothing which would disqualify him for his seat in
							Congress; and of course should receive no compensation for what he might
							do— But if a Frigate was going out to the Mediterranean, he would be
							glad to take passage in her, and to be the medium of any communication,
							that the Government might wish to make at Naples— He said he had spoken
							of it this morning with the President, who had told him he would confer
							concerning it with me. I asked Poinsett, whether if he should go, he
							could not extend his trip farther, and give us some account of the
							condition of the Greeks. He said it would give him great satisfaction if
							he could; but he was afraid there would not be time— He was told the
							frigate would be ready to sail in three weeks, and in that case she
							might without going out of her way <unclear>touch</unclear> and take him
							up at Charleston— But he knew what three weeks meant, in the fitting out
							of a ship of War; and he believed he could go to Charleston, and return
							to New-York, before she would be ready. I spoke of this to the
							President, who appeared to be desirous that Poinsett should go as he
							proposed; and that if possible he should extend his excursion to Greece—
							This Evening I met and walked with <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander3"
								>Alexander Hamilton</persRef> who told me he should go to-morrow
							morning upon his return to New-York. He is much dissatisfied with the
							neglect of Congress, to take any decisive measure upon his denunciation
							of his <persRef ref="floyd-davis;blair-william" type="multi">Colleagues,
								as Commissioners of land-titles</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Augustine— I know not how to account for this apathy, but
							by the conjecture, that there, as in all the new territories where there
							are lands on Sale, the influence of fraudulent Land-claimants is
							paramount to all other, and that it is fruitless to attempt to sustain
							the public interest against it. Hamilton offered also to write to me
							upon the general topic of New-York Politics.</p>

								<persRef ref="sullivan-sarah">his wife</persRef> and his <persRef
								ref="sullivan-george3;sullivan-james" type="multi">two
								sons</persRef>, returning to Boston— He asked me how he should
							account for the appointment of <persRef ref="hill-mark">Mark Langdon
								Hill</persRef> as Collector for the Port of Bath— I told him how it
							had happened, and he appeared to be satisfied with the Statement—
								<persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef> was here with a
							new small Print of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, and some others. <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef>, Secretary of
							the Navy was here, with a Letter to him from <persRef ref="angus-samuel"
								>Captain Samuel Angus</persRef>, demanding in grossly insulting
							language an answer to former solicitations of his to obtain the command
							of a Navy Yard— This Letter dated and received sometime in April, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had sent to <persRef
								ref="evans-samuel">Captain Evans</persRef>, with directions to take
							it with witnesses present to Angus, and demand of him whether it had
							been written by him. This Evans had done; but Angus declined answering
							whether he had or had not written the Letter, saying that he had written
							several Letters soliciting a Navy-Yard; and that he was not obliged to
							criminate himself— Southard said the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> had to decide what he should do in this <pb
								type="ms" n="343"/>affair. I asked him whether he knew that Angus
							was subject to occasional alienations of mind— He said no—whether he had
							heard of his being at times intemperate?—yes. I told him of my first
							acquaintance with Angus, when I went with him in the John Adams, from
							Gothenburg to the Texel, when he was just convalescent from a fever and
							residuary delirium, during which the command of the ship had devolved on
							his first Lieutenant, <persRef ref="yarnall-john">Yarnall</persRef>— I
							had then every reason to be satisfied with Angus’s obliging conduct to
							me—but had perceived some indications in him of a mind not altogether
							settled— I had lately heard he was intemperate; and the tone of his
							Letter, with his afterwards declining to acknowledge his having written
							it, convinced me that he did write it in a moment of insanity or of
							intoxication— I had so much regard for him, from the accidental relation
							there had once been between him and me, that I should wish him to be
							treated with all tenderness compatible with duty to the public service—
							Southard said he would cause further enquiry to be made— If the Letter
							was written in sober senses, he ought immediately to be dismissed the
							service— If in a fit of insanity or intemperance, it proved him
							disqualified for the command of a navy-yard—with both these positions I
							fully concurred. Southard told me he was going upon business next week
							to Norfolk— He said too that <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren</persRef>, and <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon"
								>Dickerson</persRef> were gone to Richmond, whence they were to
							proceed on visits to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>, and there was much speculation as to the object of
							their journey— I said I had little doubt it was to prepare and concert
							the movement of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> partizans, in the
							event of his being withdrawn or declining as a candidate for the
							Presidential Election: and my belief was, they meant to take up <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> for
							their substituted candidate. Southard said Clay had expectations of that
							sort himself, and had also been much elated by three meetings lately
							gotten up in his favour in New-Jersey—about which he had yesterday asked
							him several questions— The truth was that if those meetings had been
							convened by those whom he suspected, there was nothing that would so
							effectually secure against him the vote of New-Jersey, unless it was his
							being supported by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickerson— I told him
							that my main reason for believing, that Clay was the man they intended
							to push for was the profligate opposition they had got up and pressed in
							Senate against the Convention for the suppression of the Slave-trade—the
							only object of which was to use it as a weapon to raise a popular
							clamour against me— This they would have avoided under the high
							probability of Crawford’s withdrawing from the field, if they had not
							determined at all events to keep out me? This I observed was M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren’s course; although he was under
							some personal obligation to me. I then told him in close confidence of
							the transactions and correspondence which preceded the appointment of
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Smith Thompson</persRef> as a judge of
							the Supreme Court of the United States, last Summer, and the distant and
							disguised grasping of Van Buren, both at that office, and at a Mission
							abroad, of all which he had before known nothing— I asked him whether he
							knew, who it was that had communicated <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster’s</persRef> secret notification to the President, that if
								<persRef ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef> should produce no
							new proof of his charges, the Committee would pronounce against him a
							sentence of severe reprobation— He said no, but he suspected it was
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef>— I said that as it
							had struck my mind, there was a baseness in it, that had revolted me
							beyond measure. Its object apparently was to urge the President to
							remove Edwards, and at the same time to reserve a retreat into
							impartiality if the President should not prove sufficiently pliable— It
							seemed to me, as if the Judges of the Supreme Court having before them a
							man upon trial for life and death, should send a secret Message to the
							President saying—If you will execute this man, we will condemn him.
							Southard said the illustration was a strong one but he thought it
							correct. I said this was not the only underhand artifice of Webster’s to
							operate upon the public mind against Edwards, and if the whole Committee
							should be swayed in this manner, and the President should yield to it,
							as he seemed to be disposed, I expected he would call upon the members
							of his Administration for their opinions on the question whether he
							should remove Edwards—and if he should thus call upon me, I would expose
							the whole of this vile intrigue to the Nation— But as the President had
							withheld the name of the person through whom Webster had thus felt his
							pulse; there was yet evidently some reserve yet upon this affair, and I
								<pb type="ms" n="344"/>should not press for the information—
							Southard said the President was so harrassed that he scarcely knew where
							to set his foot— But if Poinsett was still here, he would ask him
							whether he was the person who had made the communication from Webster,
							and he had no doubt he would tell him— And he would see me again
							to-morrow— <persRef ref="cuthbert-alfred">A. Cuthbert</persRef>, member
							from Georgia, and <persRef ref="mckee-john">J. M’Kee</persRef>, member
							from Alabama, called and took leave; as did <persRef

								<persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef> came,
							under difficulties about disposing of his bills upon his Government, to
							raise money to pay his debts here, before embarking on his leave of

							of the Senators from Missouri called with a <persRef
								ref="russell-unknown6">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> who had called upon me once before— I called at
							the President’s for my draft of a despatch to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, to go with the ratified
							Convention. He read and approved it— He also spoke of N. Edwards, and of
							the expectation of his arrival here on Monday— I asked him if he had
							understood that the communication made to him of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster’s statement that the committee would severely
							censure Edwards if he should produce no further evidence in support of
							his charges against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, was
							intended by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster to be made; he said
							no— It was merely a notice given him by a friend, that he might be
							prepared for such a result. Solitary walk after dinner, and closed the
							Evening by writing two short Letters.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> to speak to
							Seaton about it— To tell him that I should cause a publication of the
							documents to be made in the National Journal Extra, with notice that
							that in the Intelligencer was incomplete— And I requested him to speak
							to <persRef ref="force-peter">Force</persRef> to have the documents
							accurately published. Seaton apologised to me to day for the
							defectiveness of the publication; he said they had published the
							proceedings of the Senate, as he had received them from <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mercer</persRef>; and had omitted the extracts from the two Reports of
							Committees of the House, supposing them not to be material, and because
							they had been published before (meaning when the Reports were made[)]. I
							observed to him the effect upon the view of the subject exhibited to the
							public of the omission of the extracts, and of the insertion of the
							Editorial Article of argument against the right of Search. He said that
							Article was written by a member of the Senate, and was published just as
							he had given it. He told D. Brent yesterday that this Senator was J.
							Holmes of Maine— In the afternoon I heard at the Presbyterian Church,
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, from Daniel 5.27. “Tekel; thou art weighed in the
							balances, and art found wanting.” A text which he said he had taken at
							the request of a member of the Society— The Discourse was an enumeration
								<pb type="ms" n="345"/>of the various classes of men, to whom this
							censure would apply— In the Evening I heard M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Little again; and still it was a Sermon upon benevolence—
								<persRef ref="everett-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> and <persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P.
								Cook</persRef> were there, and walked with me afterwards, till on
							reaching home I left them.</p>

						<p><date>31. VII.</date> The stream of visitors is yet without intermission,

							ten days after the close of the Session, more copious than at any other

								<persRef ref="jennings-jonathan">Jonathan Jennings</persRef> member
							from Indiana—<persRef ref="english-d">D. B. English</persRef>—<persRef

								Addington</persRef>, <persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P.
							Cook</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef>—and
							after dinner, at home, <persRef ref="sherburne-jonathan">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Sherburne</persRef> of the Navy. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jennings came to take leave, and left a
							written application, for copies of his Letters and a statement of
							circumstances respecting the appointment of <persRef ref="dewey-charles"
								>Charles Dewey</persRef> as District attorney in Indiana— English
							for the final settlement of his account—also to take leave, and to urge
							again his application for further employment. Cuthbert upon a claim of a
							person named <persRef ref="maric-unknown">Maric</persRef>—of Savannah,
							whose vessel was last Summer seized and confiscated in Hayti, for
							entering a Port of the Island contrary to a Proclamation of the
							Government— Maric petitioned Congress without effect, and Cuthbert now
							applies in his behalf to the Executive— He told me the papers relating
							to the case would be sent me from the Clerk’s Office of the House of
							Representatives; and wished me to specify what further documents would
							be wanted— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Royall came as a Lady to ask
							relief, and complained of having been harshly treated elsewhere— Baron
							Stackelberg in great embarrassment about his bills of Exchange, upon his
							Government; which his correspondents at Baltimore have sold, and now
							refuse to pay over to him, the money they have received for them, until
							they shall receive advice from Sweden that they have been accepted— The
							Florida Treaty Commissioners came to say that they were preparing for
							the final close of their Commission. I returned to them the draft of a
							Report, which Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs. </hi>White and Tazewell had
							some days since delivered to me, and told them that the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had read it, as I had also
							done, and nothing had occurred to either of us, as proper to be altered
							in or omitted from it— They observed upon the shortness of the time yet
							left them, and said that although they had given repeated notices, that
							they should receive no new Memorials after certain specified periods,
							they had not adhered to these rules, but expected they should have
							claims and arguments pouring in upon them to the very last hour of their
							Sittings. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington came to enquire if I
							was ready to despatch the ratified Convention— I had inclined to have
							sent it by a special Messenger, and last week had asked Addington if he
							could have a passage in the Packet, to which he had immediately
							assented— But the moment a suspicion of a special messenger got wind, I
							was beset with conflicting applications for it; so that I could not have
							gratified one applicant, without mortifying others, and the fund is so
							scanty from which the expence of a special messenger must have been
							paid, that I concluded to save it, and to send the Convention, by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington’s Messenger— I read to him the
							whole of my Instruction to <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>
							to go with the ratified Convention, with which he appeared to be
							entirely satisfied—and I had the Convention, with the Instruction,
							packed in a small trunk, addressed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush, sealed up, and delivered with the key of the trunk, to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Addington, this Evening— D. P. Cook came
							and told me that he expected the arrival of <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edwards</persRef> this evening. Cook said he thought Edwards ought
							to resign his appointment as Minister to Mexico, and devote himself to
							the complete developement of this affair— And as he could probably
							expect no justice from this Committee, he would determine whether on
							that avowed ground, to decline pursuing the subject before them and make
							a direct appeal to Congress or to the Nation, or after protesting
							against those <pb type="ms" n="346"/>members of the Committee who had
							prejudged the case, and taken side against him, to proceed in the
							investigation— I agreed with him that the best course for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards to take, was to resign his Office;
							but I thought he should not decline the investigation, so far as it
							personally concerned himself. I remarked that in the present state of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> health, it would be I thought at
							once wise and generous in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, if he
							would offer to take the report of the Committee so far as it went to
							acquit or excuse M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, as final and
							conclusive, and to disclaim the intention of pressing farther any
							investigation of his official conduct— Wyer called at the Office, and
							spoke of the state of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s health,
							which is a problem— <persRef ref="ironside-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ironside</persRef> brought me an Act
							of Congress which in the hurry of the last day of the Session, and among
							the forty or fifty Acts then brought to him, for his examination and
							signature, by some accident missed of being signed by him. The question
							is whether it can be signed by him now— It is an act concerning wreckers
							on the Coast of Florida— I desired <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> to ascertain whether
							it had been announced to the House in which the Bill originated that it
							had been signed— Lieutenant Sherburne came to urge again with great
							earnestness that <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler</persRef> might again be
							employed for the surveys provided by a recent act of Congress to be
							made— While he was with me the Stage from Frederick passed by my house,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards was in it— I called
							afterwards at the President’s, having heard in the course of the day
							that he was going to-morrow to Loudoun— But he had concluded to postpone
							for some days his departure.</p>
