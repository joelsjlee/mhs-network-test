						<p><date>17. V:15.</date> Rain Storm, the whole day— At the Office, Visits
							from <persRef ref="kelly-william">W. Kelly</persRef>, Senator from
							Alabama— <persRef ref="letcher-robert">Letcher</persRef> member of H.R.
							from Kentucky; and <persRef ref="english-george">G. B.
							English</persRef>— Letcher came ostensibly, with a claim of an assistant
							to the Marshal of Kentucky, for additional compensation for his service
							in taking the Census of 1820— But his apparent main object was to talk
							about the Presidential Election— The account was yesterday received of
							the choice of Electors in Louisiana, by the Legislature; from which it
							is rendered almost certain that three of the votes have been for
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>; probably
							four; and perhaps all five—but certainly none for <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— This
							leaves <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> with 41. and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay with 37. electoral votes; M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford therefore will, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay will not be one of the three persons from whom the House of
							Representatives, voting by States, will be called to choose a President—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Letcher is an intimate friend of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s, and lodges at the same house with
							him— He expects that after the result is known that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay cannot be voted for in the house,
							there will be meetings of the People in the several Counties,
							instructing their members to vote for Jackson, and perhaps that similar
							Instructions will be sent on by their Legislature— These he supposes
							will be gotten up, by what they call the <hi rend="italic">Relief</hi>
							party, in the politics of the State; and by men like <persRef
								ref="rowan-john">Rowan</persRef>, <persRef ref="barry-william"
								>Barry</persRef> and <persRef ref="bibb-george">Bibb</persRef>,
							secondary leaders of the State, not daring to oppose Clay openly on
							account of his own popularity in the State, but seizing upon the first
							opportunity afforded them indirectly to put him down— Letcher is
							evidently alarmed <pb type="ms" n="718"/>at this; and in the midst of
							strong professessions of independence, and of indifference about
							retaining his Seat; is plainly not prepared to act definitively in
							opposition to the will of his Constituents— He intimated that the Relief
							party were in fact hostile to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— That
							of the Kentucky delegation here, a large portion were warmly attached to
							him— That lately speaking of what might ensue here, he had expressed the
							wish to go in harmony with his friends; which Letcher said he
							interpreted as a wish that his friends would go in harmony with him—
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R.
								M. Johnson</persRef> Letcher thinks is warmly of the Relief party;
							and as to the Presidency determined to be at all Events on the strongest
							side— I observed to Letcher that Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
							had candidly told me so himself— Letcher wished to know what my
							sentiments towards Clay were; and I told him without disguise that I
							harboured no hostility against him—that whatever of difference there had
							been between us had arisen altogether from him and not from me— I
							adverted to <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell’s</persRef>
							attack upon me, which I said I believed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay had been privy to, and countenanced— But having completely repelled
							that attack, I felt no animosity against any person concerned in it—
							Letcher said Clay’s friends thought he had been wrong in his Letter
							against me concerning that affair— It was written in a moment of
							excitement— He was sure Clay felt now no hostility to me— He had spoken
							respectfully of me; and was a man of sincerity— Of the 14 Electors of
							Kentucky, seven voted for <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							as Vice-President, and this vote I thought; and Letcher fully concurred
							in the opinion was more hostile to Clay, than any vote for Jackson as
							President could be— It held up Calhoun as a future competitor against
							Clay, and thereby postponed all his prospects indefinitely— The drift of
							all Letcher’s discourse was much the same as <persRef ref="wyer-edward"
								>Wyer</persRef> had told me, that Clay would willingly support me,
							if he could thereby serve himself, and the substance of his <hi
								rend="italic">meaning</hi> was that if Clay’s friends could <hi
								rend="italic">know</hi> that he would have a prominent share in the
							Administration, that might induce them to vote for me, even in the face
							of Instructions— But Letcher <pb type="ms" n="719"/>did not profess to
							have any authority from Clay for what he said, and he made no definite
							propositions. He spoke of his interview with me as altogether
							confidential; and in my answers to him I spoke in mere general terms—
							Kelly’s talk was chiefly about the last Winters Caucus, and the hopeless
							proposals of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— I told G. B.
							English that the President had determined he should go out with <persRef
								ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef> in the capacity of
							interpreter, and entirely under his directions; with which he declared
							himself fully satisfied. He is to receive his Instructions next week—
								<persRef ref="mcintyre-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alexander M’Intire</persRef>, Bookkeeper of the Metropolis Bank,
							came this Evening, and told me; that from certain movements of <persRef
								ref="kerr-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr</persRef>
							the Cashier of that Bank this day, he expected Kerr was about to
							commence an action at Law, against <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, for
							having told the fact that he Kerr, had altered the Note of <persRef
								ref="moulton-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Moulton</persRef>, after it was signed by her and endorsed by me— His
							object he said doubtless was to prevent him from being a legal witness
							to the fact of which he was the only witness— He alone having seen it
							done. He said that in consequence of this expectation, he had this day
							gone before a Magistrate, and made Oath to the fact; and he shewed me
							the deposition, which I read— He asked me, if his deposition so taken
							before an action commenced would not be competent evidence for him, upon
							the Action— I told him it would not— That he would be a competent
							witness to the fact before a Grand Jury, or upon an Indictment; but that
							nothing said by him could be evidence, upon an action against himself— I
							said I supposed M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Moulton, and I myself
							would be competent witnesses to the facts so far as she or I recollected
							them— What might be the recollection of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Moulton, I did not know— I had no positive recollection of the words of
							the Note—neither of those words, nor of the others in the Note; but from
							circumstances which I do distinctly recollect as having occurred at the
							time, I am as sure that the words were not there; as if I had taken a
							copy of the Note there, and the words should now not be found in the
							copy— M’Intire said he would <pb type="ms" n="720"/>send and enquire of
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Moulton with regard to her
							recollection, and would also take advice of <persRef ref="jones-walter"
								>Walter Jones</persRef>. He said there had been an entire
							non-intercourse between him and Kerr at the Bank, since he told Kerr of
							his having altered the Note. He said there was another case of Kerr’s
							altering a Check upon the U.S. Branch Bank, to a Check on the Bank of
							the Metropolis, and paying money upon it, the proof of which was
							complete. I have heard of this case before— <persRef
								ref="johnson-francis">F. Johnson</persRef> of Kentucky came this
							morning to the Office to urge the reappointment of the Russelville
							Newspaper, for printing the Laws— I shewed him the Letter from 7. of the
							12 members of the House from Kentucky demanding a change— He thought
							some of them would retract; between this and Monday morning; until which
							time I promised to delay the appointment— <persRef ref="tilton-d">D.

								ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> and <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron

							Letters recommending <persRef ref="scott-andrew">Andrew Scott</persRef>,
							brother of <persRef ref="scott-john">John Scott</persRef>, the member of
							the House, from Missouri, for the appointment of Governor of the
							Arkansas Territory— The President said that the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef> had just reported that
							Andrew Scott ought to be removed from his Office, of judge in the same
							territory, for having killed in a duel, his Colleague upon the bench,
								<persRef ref="selden-joseph">Selden</persRef>— He could hardly
							therefore be just at this time appointed Governor of the Territory— The
							President directed that the Salary for <persRef ref="english-george">G.
								B. English</persRef>, should be at the rate of 2000 dollars <pb
								type="ms" n="721"/>a year; and that for his expenses on board the
							ship, some arrangement should be made with the Navy Department— I dined
							at the President’s with a company of about thirty members of Congress—
								<persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> walked home with
							me, and passed the remainder of the Evening in conversation upon
							political topics and prospects— <persRef ref="tomlinson-gideon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tomlinson</persRef> of Connecticut was
							among the members of Congress who called this morning at the Office.
							Bradley spoke to me of the claim of <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C.
								P. Van Ness</persRef>, Governor of Vermont as Commissioner under the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the Treaty of Ghent. F.
							Johnson and Letcher were as warmly discussing the question whether, a
							Newspaper to print the United States Laws should be at Russelville or at
							Hopkinsville in Kentucky. Letcher was one of the members who signed the
							paper requesting the appointment for the paper at Hopkinsville— Johnson
							wished him now, to strike out his name, from the paper, which he
							declined; but he said if he had known there was a collision about it, he
							would not have signed the paper, as he thought it of no sort of
							consequence, which of the two should be appointed. There was something
							approaching to altercation between them about it— They were no sooner
							gone, than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sandford of Tennessee came in,
							upon a similar collision in that State— He soliciting the appointment
							for the Columbian Observer in his District, against the Sparta Review in
								<persRef ref="isacks-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Isacks’s</persRef> District, which had the printing for the last
							Session. I read to him Isack’s Letter in behalf of the Sparta Review— He
							spoke of the superior populousness of his district, and the greater
							circulation of the paper recommended by him, but as I told him Isacks
							would probably be of a different opinion, he finally desired me to
							suspend the appointment till he could see if Isacks could not be
							prevailed upon to acquiesce in the change—which I promised to do. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Watkins expressed a strong wish to
							reconcile me with <persRef ref="meade-richard">R. W. Meade</persRef>—to
							which I said I had no sort of objection— Meade whose claim upon the
							Spanish Government was rejected by the Florida Commission, is now about
							to bring it before Congress, and Watkins said, was desirous of doing
							nothing about it, but with my advice— I told the D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> that I was willing to bury in oblivion all resentment
							against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><pb type="ms" n="722"/>Meade, but
							in my present position, I should not be willing to advise him as to his
							course or this claim. If that was his object I thought it better that we
							should remain as we now were; than to meet, with a prospect of differing
							again, in a painful manner, as had already happened. He said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meade had erroneously formed the opinion
							that I was prejudiced against him: he was now convinced of his mistake,
							and wished for a reconciliation. To this I said I was perfectly willing
							to accede— I wished and hoped to have nothing further to do with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meade’s claims, but Congress might refer
							it to me for a Report; in which case, I should report conformably to all
							that I had heretofore written upon the case— I thought the Commission
							had done wrong in excluding his claim entirely; but that the fault was
							in himself and his own Counsel, in claiming to be admitted upon terms
							different from all the other claimants, and to be paid his whole claim
							as adjusted by the Spanish Government eighteen months after the
							signature of the Treaty; and that, because the United States had
							originally had no right to interpose with Spain, in his favour at-all—
							Watkins asked me if I would dine at his house with Meade to-morrow and I
							accepted the invitation. Baron Tuyll came to enquire concerning an
							invitation to dine with the President next Wednesday, and whether he
							should have precedence over the Ministers from South-America— I spoke of
							it to the President— As there is no other of the South-American
							Ministers now here but <persRef ref="salazar-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar</persRef>, from the Republic
							of Colombia, no question of Baron Tuyll’s precedence can arise— Reed
							came to say that he wished to come with <persRef ref="mcarthur-duncan"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> M’Arthur</persRef> to visit
							me; and Tomlinson to inform me of <persRef ref="mckim-isaac;mckim-ann"

							an invitation to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adam’s</persRef> Tuesday Evenings—
							The Evening Conversation with J. W. Taylor was confidential; and I asked
							him what were Tracy’s particular views— He said entirely friendly— He
							also told me that <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef> had told him explicitly at the late Session of the
							New-York Legislature, that he was in favour of the Election of <persRef

							the President and Members of the Congress of the United States; a style
							used under the Congress of the Confederation; but unsuitable to our
							present Constitution, by which there is no President of Congress and no

							said the <persRef ref="maxencedamas-ange">Baron de Damas</persRef>,
							Minister of Foreign Affairs had written to him that the subject would be
							examined into— I told him it was a matter of no consequence. He said he
							was instructed to speak of the conduct of the Consul of the United
							States at Tangier who had received with some ostentation the fugitives
							from a late abortive attempt upon Tarifa— I said I had heard nothing of
							this before. He asked whether it might not be a proper occasion for him
							to present the persons attached to the French Legation, to the
							President, upon the delivery of the Credential Letter— I told him it had
							been usual for Ministers to present their Secretaries of Legation, but
							that other persons attached to foreign Missions were usually introduced
							at the drawing Rooms— I added however that I would mention his wish to
							the President, and take his directions concerning it. Evening at home,

							relate to his transactions in the Pacific, during his late command

							Piracies, which I had sent him as Chairman of the Committee of Foreign
							Relations of the Senate; and for copies of which there is now a Call by
							Resolution of that body. He soon however introduced the other topic, and
							freely stated to me his own impressions, and what he believed to be
							those of a majority of the Virginia Delegation in the House of
							Representatives— Their first choice had been <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>. The Electors of the State had voted for him, and
							a majority of the People of the State were favourable to him— The
							representation of the State in the House would vote at first for him;
							and adhere to him, as long as they could hope for success; but if they
							should <pb type="ms" n="727"/>find that impracticable, their next
							preference would be for me— He had no doubt this was the feeling of the
							people of the State— That I was much more popular there than <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, or even than
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, though he was one of their own natives. He said he
							thought it would be Treason to the Constitution, to hold out and prevent
							an election by the House until the fourth of March, so as to give the
							actual Presidency to the Vice-President. He asked if I thought my
							friends in the house would not, if they must make a choice, prefer M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford to General Jackson— I said I
							believed they would not make an option, but would adhere to me, until
							they should obtain a majority of States, or that one should be made
							against them— He said something about a moral majority of votes in
							New-York for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford; but he did not
							press much this argument; nor did I think it deserved waste of time in
							refuting it— He spoke of my Letter, jointly with <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Lean</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>, relative to the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July dinner, as having produced an
							impression against me, very strong in Virginia; by its appearance as if
							I had joined in a combination, against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford— I gave him the same explanation of that Event as I had already
							given to <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">A. Dickins</persRef>: assuring
							him that I had on that occasion not acted in hostility to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford; but to avoid being made to
							partake in a public insult to <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards</persRef>. I said that if it
							was to do over again, I thought I should do the same. I had been placed
							in a difficult situation, and if I had erred, it had been an error of
							judgment; and not of intention hostile to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford. He then passing to matters of greater importance enquired of
							my Sentiments concerning the Tariff and Internal Improvements; which I
							gave him with perfect Candour— I said that the ultimate principle of my
							system with reference to the great interests of the Country was <hi
								rend="italic">conciliation</hi> and not <hi rend="italic"
								>collision</hi>— I was satisfied with the Tariff as now established,
							and should if any change in it should be desired incline rather to
							reduce than to increase it— There was in my opinion no Constitutional
							question involved in the discussion— The revenue was abundant, and the
								<pb type="ms" n="728"/>protection to manufactures adequate to their
							fair claims for support—and if the Tariff should be found to bear hard
							upon the agricultural and commercial interests, I should incline to an
							alleviation of it in their favour— As to internal improvements, my
							opinions had been published in most of the newspapers, in extracts of
							Letters from me: and had no doubt been seen by him— Since the Act of
							Congress establishing the Cumberland Road, there had been no
							Constitutional question worth disputing about, involved in the
							discussion. It was certainly a great power to be exercised by Congress
							and perhaps liable to great abuses. So were all the other great powers
							of Congress, and the controul over it was in the organization of the
							Government, the election franchise—the State authorities, and the good
							sense and firmness of the people— Upon these subjects we had much
							discourse, and he left me with the impression that the interview had
							been entirely satisfactory to him— It was then one O’Clock, at which
							time the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had intended to
							receive the <persRef ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">Baron de
								Mareuil</persRef>, but I had not been able to give him notice of it—
							I called therefore at the President’s and he postponed the Baron’s

							had some conversation with him upon the Northwest Coast Convention; his
							objections to which I could not entirely remove— He thought its effect

							inference from the Article which authorizes trade, for ten years to the
							Citizens and subjects of each party within the boundary assigned to the

							did not think this a necessary consequence. And I observed that in all

							in the natural course of Events we must outgrow all the obstacles which
