								Bates</persRef>, as Collector, for the Port of Bristol, where

								Calhoun</persRef> and his friends. The professions of friendship,
							and the acts of insidious hostility— The requisitions upon me to dismiss

								>Binns</persRef> which they thereby excited against me; the
							flaunting declaration in the Franklin Gazette, immediately afterwards,
							that they were under no obligation to me for the appointment— The
							decided part taken against me by that paper in the controversy with
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>, and its
							frequent ill disguised attacks upon me since— The Courtship of the

							toast to the Memory of <persRef ref="ames-fisher">Fisher Ames</persRef>
							at the Edgefield dinner to <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie</persRef>— The newspapers set up in Massachusetts, to
							support M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun— The smuggled paragraphs,
							asserting that my friends in New England had abandoned me for him, and
							the panegyric of the Washington Republican upon the Boston Galaxy, a
							paper for years advertised for Sale to the highest bidder of the
							Presidential candidates, and which has at last opened a battery of
							scurrilous abuse upon me, and in avowed support of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun; I mentioned all these things to
							him in frankness; but told him they had not the slightest effect upon my
							opinion with regard to the appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dallas— He wished to apologize for <persRef ref="norvell-joshua"
								>Norvell</persRef>, the Editor of the Franklin Gazette, who he said
							entertained the highest respect for me— And whose appointment had been
								<pb type="ms" n="222"/>urged not from any hostility to me— The
							papers published against me, in the controversy with Russell, he Ingham
							had disapproved—and had written to Norvell to refuse them; but it
							happened that before receiving his Letter, Norvell had promised to
							publish the first; and then could not reject the others— The main
							foundation of the opposition of the Franklin Gazette and of the
							Republicans in Pennsylvania, to me, was owing to their seeing that I was
							supported by <persRef ref="walsh-robert">Walsh</persRef>— I told him
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh’s support of me had not been
							solicited by me. It was voluntary and spontaneous; and had been by no
							means uniform— In the Russell controversy he had been at first against
							me; and upon other occasions had not been sparing of censure upon me—
							The friends of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had no doubt the
							right to set him up as a Candidate for the Presidency, and if they chose
							to promote as the head of an administration, a man whose elevation must
							of itself operate as a proscription from the Executive of the Nation, of
								<hi rend="italic">all</hi> the other men who were distinguished
							before the Nation, they surely might; but the error seemed to be in
							supposing that this might be done, without any manifestation of enmity
							towards them. My complaint was, not that attempts were made to tear my
							reputation to pieces for the benefit of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun; but that they were preceded and accompanied by professions of
							great respect and esteem, and with the expression of earnest desires for
							harmony and good understanding. He said that it had not been considered
							that mere age was the decisive qualification for the Presidency. I said
							certainly not— But ours was practically more a Government of personal
							consideration and influence, than of written Articles— There was in the
							Genius of our Institutions a graduated subordination among the persons
							by whom the Government was administered. Reputation was the basis of our
							Elections; and the emblem of its organization was a pyramid at the point
							of which was the Chief, under whom men of high Consideration though not
							equal to his naturally found there places— Among the sources of this
							Consideration, Age and Experience had their share; and unless superseded
							by very transcendent merit, a decisive share— This had never yet been
							otherwise under our present Constitution— Not a single instance had
							occurred of a person older than the President of the United States
							accepting Office as a Head of Department under him— This was not the
							result of any written Law, but it arose from the natural operation of
							our system. What the effect of such a departure from it, as the Election
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun might be, I could not
							undertake to say; but this I would say; and had said to those of my
							friends who had spoken to me on the subject; that if the harmony of the
							Country could be promoted, by setting me altogether aside, I would
							cheerfully acquiesce in that disposition: and never would be the
							occasion or the supporter of factious opposition to any Administration
							whatsoever. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham professed to be
							satisfied with this exposition of my views and feelings; but as I gave
							him no reason to expect I could be reconciled to the appointment of
							Dallas to Mexico, he was doubtless not satisfied with the result of the
							Meeting— At the Office; <persRef ref="hicks-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hicks</persRef> came and I gave him a
							Letter to <persRef ref="wilcocks-james">J. S. Wilcocks</persRef> our
							Consul at Mexico— I attended in the Evening the Drawing Room at the
							President’s— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> being not very well,
							did not go. The Assembly was less numerous than at the last. The Judges
							of the Supreme Court were there. On returning home I found <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> at my house, and had a long
							Conversation with him— He told me that <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">Jesse
								B. Thomas</persRef> a Senator from Illinois, had strongly urged upon
							him the expediency of my acquiescing in the nomination as Vice
							President, with <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> for the Presidency.
							He said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford would certainly be
							elected— And he spoke of certain members of Congress, as ultimately to
							vote for him, who appear to be far otherwise disposed at this time. That
							it was however <pb type="ms" n="223"/>very desirable that he should
							carry with him the strength which he would derive from the co-operation
							of my friends. That from the state of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s health it was highly probable the duties of the Presidency
							would devolve upon the Vice-President which had made it necessary to
							select with peculiar anxiety a person qualified for the contingency
							which was to be anticipated. That a compliance with the views of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s friends on this occasion would
							be rendering them a service, which would recommend me to their future
							favour and would doubtless secure my election hereafter to the
							Presidency. Taylor said he had answered, that admitting even the
							certainty that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford should be
							elected, that was no sufficient reason, for the acquiescence of my
							friends in the proposed arrangement. If the election should be carried
							against them, they will at least have followed their own sense of what
							was right and fit— They could not place me in subordination to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford without inverting the natural
							order of things, and placing the North in a position of inferiority to
							the South— Should they be so placed by the Constitutional voice of the
							People, they must undoubtedly submit; but they could not consent to be
							so placed by their own act— Taylor said Thomas had asked him to see him
							again after thinking on the subject. I said he might tell him then if he
							thought fit, that he had seen me; and I had told him that I was so
							satisfied of the inexpediency of a Congressional caucus nomination at
							this time that I should decline accepting it were it even for the
							Presidency— He said he thought it would be better that without referring
							to me; or to my determination, he should simply state the perseverance
							of my friends, in the sentiments he had already expressed, as being
							theirs.</p>
