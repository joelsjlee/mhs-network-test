                  >r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> called and took me in his Chaise to attend the
              annual Meeting of the Proprietors of Neponset Bridge which was held at the Public

              Superintendant, and sworn into Office by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller— The

              called this morning and paid me the interest upon the Note of the Parish to me, from
              its date 29. May 1827. to the first of October next— I told him I should wish only for
              payment of the Interest on the Note to the Executors of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef>, and not the principal for the present. I promised to execute the
              Deed of the half Acre of Land at the foot of Penn’s Hill to his Son <persRef
                ref="curtis-samuel">Samuel</persRef>, and told him it had not been executed before,
              only because by <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Quincy’s</persRef> absence, I had not been able to cancel the mortgage upon the
              farm— He said my Warranty would be sufficient for his Son—and spoke of the partition
              fence which must be maintained jointly between us. He said also that <persRef ref="white-nathaniel">White</persRef> had called
              upon his Son to maintain half the fence between them— After breakfast I took a walk
              with <persRef ref="felt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Felt</persRef> to Mount
              Wollaston— He gave me three numbers of a Work, he is publishing under the title of
              Annals of Salem, and of which he told me there would be two more numbers. He mentioned
              a design to publish a great part of the Old Colony Records, a very good, but I thought
              a somewhat hazardous undertaking— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef
                ref="felt-abigail">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Felt</persRef> declined staying
              with us to dine, and were going from here to Medford. I had morning visits from
                <persRef ref="prince-john3">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Prince</persRef> of
              Salem, and <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Holbrook</persRef>, and afterwards from <persRef ref="parker-john4">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> John Parker</persRef>, who told me he was 72 years old,
              and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Read</persRef> of South
              Carolina—a nephew of <persRef ref="read-jacob">Jacob Read</persRef> once a member of
              Congress. Just before dinner I bathed, and swam between wharf and wharf—precisely 15
              minutes— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out to dine, and brought
              me Letters from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef

                >General S. Smith</persRef> of Baltimore— Also one from <persRef

              order of the Trustees of the Boston Atheneum, my bust executed by <persRef
                ref="greenough-horatio">his Son</persRef>— It was sent to me by mistake. Much of the
              morning was absorbed by my visitors, and I barely made out to write my page of
              Memoirs— In the afternoon I read some pages of <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas"
                >Hutchinson</persRef>, and a few Letters in the third Volume of <persRef
                ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand</persRef>, which I still find very amusing.
              The day was sultry with a distant thunder-shower in the Evening.</p>

              and of great abundance, and not a little singularity of Conversation— He shewed me a
              fowling piece loaded, disguised as a walking Stick, and a piece of an old Greek
              Manuscript, said to have been found in the City of Canopus— He told me also something
              of his controversies with <persRef ref="buchanan-james3">James Buchanan</persRef> the
              British Consul at New-York, and of monuments he has ordered to be erected to the

            <p><date>4. V:15.</date> Friday— To Boston and Quincy.</p>
            <p>This morning before Breakfast I took a walk with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef> round his garden and grounds, which are
              laid out with great neatness, to much utility; not without ornament; and although at
              great expense, with a very judicious economy. The Middlesex Canal forms a boundary to
              the Garden, and over it he has thrown a bridge of Granite which gives him the benefit
              of a Mile’s walk on the western border of the Canal. He has flourishing Thorn hedges,
              both Virginian and English; and the growth of the Native is far more luxuriant and
              healthy than that of the exotic. He has a great variety of flowers, an abundance of
              Water— A small green-house lately built, a Multitude of Trees; forest and fruit—
              Foreign and indigenous— And a few marble Statues from Italy. This and the prospects
              are the two points upon which I think the place susceptible of <pb type="ms" n="249"
              />improvement— There are many Country Seats in this Neighbourhood of more splendor,
              magnificence and expense— I wish there were one with indications of Mind and Morals— A
              large and valuable Library— Samples of painting and Sculpture, pregnant with
              Instruction— Interesting Portraits of our Countrymen, by native Artists. Historical
              Pictures illustrative of memorable events in our History— How much more could I say—
              But when will there be such a Country Seat in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

                and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frothingham</persRef> breakfasted with us—
                <persRef ref="brooks-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brooks</persRef> came
              down— Struggling to be cheerful, but drooping under an irrecoverable disease— After
              breakfast I came with my nephew to Boston. Stopped at Winter-Hill to call on <persRef

              <persRef ref="shirley-frances">wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="bollan-frances">daughter</persRef>— I wished to take a copy of

              told me he had one, of which he would send me a copy; which he afterwards did— I

              told me that he was very low, and could see no person but his physician— I went to the

              immediately; but I am more and more confirmed in the opinion that it should not— No

            <p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
                Whitney</persRef>, in the morning from Matthew 9.13.— “I am not come to call the
              righteous, but sinners to repentance” and in the afternoon from 2. Peter 3.16—“In
              which are some things hard to be understood.” The morning discourse was a very earnest
              exhortation to repentance; with some anti-calvinistic doctrines; which are indeed so
              absurd, that Reason is ashamed of debating them— That of the afternoon, was one of a
              Series, explanatory of some of the things hard to be understood— Upon the same text,
              he had reviewed on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July the Gospel of <persRef
                ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef>— This day his examination was of the Book of Luke.
              Why he passed over that of <persRef ref="mark">Mark</persRef>, he did not inform us—
              He began by a short commendatory character of <persRef ref="luke">Luke’s</persRef>
              gospel; said he was the most learned of the Evangelists—probably one of the disciples,
              who going to Emmaus, met Jesus after the Resurrection, and afterwards a companion of
                <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>. He noted all the parts of Luke’s narrative, not
              contained in any other of the Gospels.— The first passage which he cited as hard to be
              understood, was the forty days temptation of Jesus by the devil—which he gave it as
              his opinion was a Vision. The next was Chapter 5.20. where Jesus declares to the man
              whom he <hi rend="strikethrough">had</hi> cured of the palsy, that his sins were
              forgiven. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney encountered the argument of this fact
              to the Godhead of Christ, rather feebly. The Scribes and Pharisees who heard the
              saying, cried out that it was blasphemy, and truly said who can forgive Sins but God?
              Jesus replies by healing the palsied man with a word, and asks the objectors which of
              the two miracles is the easiest? The power of suspending the Laws of physical nature
              was susceptible of Evidence to the Senses— The power of moral remission was to be
              inferred from it— But the power of performing miracles was exercised by <persRef
                ref="moses">Moses</persRef> and the prophets— Yet they had not power upon earth to
              forgive Sins. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney was not more successful in his
              commentary upon the demoniac Swine, or the seven Devils of <persRef ref="marymagdalen"
                >Mary Magdalen</persRef>. These are things yet hard to be understood— I read the
                8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermons of
                <persRef ref="freeman-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman’s</persRef>

                <persRef ref="dexter-franklin">Frankin</persRef> was, upon which she asked to speak
              with me in private, and told me that she and her two other children were all
              mortified, at the part, which Franklin Dexter had taken with the Boston Confederates
              against me— She assured me that no other person of <pb type="ms" n="251"/>her family
              thought or felt as he did, on that subject; that they lamented the course he had
              taken, and imputed it to the connections he had formed. She meant his marriage with a
                <persRef ref="dexter-catherine2">daughter</persRef> of <persRef
                ref="prescott-william">William Prescott</persRef>, a member of the Hartford
              Convention. I told her I had made every allowance on that account— That I retained no
              resentment whatever against her Son, but had every kind feeling towards all her family
              that I had ever cherished. This afternoon at four O’Clock I went with <persRef
                ref="adams-thomas2">Lieutenant T. B. Adams</persRef>, and his Sister <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail</persRef> in to Boston— Stopp’d at the Stone-Cutters

                >Dickinson</persRef>; and left with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary, the revised
              Inscription for the Monument, in which I had made several alterations, and some
              addition— After leaving Thomas and Abigail at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> N. H.
              Foster’s</persRef>, I went to my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house,
              where they received company this Evening upon the occasion of their marriage. They
              have a small but very comfortable House; furnished with elegance. Their company
              besides the family relations, was not numerous; but was generally of cordial friends.
              The <persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Chevalier Huygens</persRef>, the Minister from the

                Derby</persRef>, and several whom I did not know. I gave <persRef ref="gray-francis"
                >F. C. Gray</persRef>, a Letter to the Proprietors of the Boston Athenaeum; and
              asked <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef> to
              come and dine with me at Quincy to-morrow which he promised he would do. It was near
              nine, when the company began to come, and by half past ten, all excepting the family
              had retired— We returned to Quincy, and reached home about half past eleven— Thomas
              and Abigail stopped for the Night with us— There is a fashionable formality in these
              wedding visits, and subsequent parties; different from the practice heretofore; and
              objectionable in many cases for its expensiveness. The Lady sends her Cards with her
              maiden name, and on the back of it at Home, such an Evening— The bridemen, introduce
              all the Visitors, to the bride with as much ceremony as at an European Court
              presentation— The dresses of the Ladies are too costly: and this wedding visit is
              succeeded by evening parties or dinners given by friends</p>

              price for which I purchased of Chamberlin— He wished me also to take two of his
              Shares, but was not yet willing to part with them at less than 75 dollars a Share— I
              take it for granted he will come down to 60— This is hazardous Speculation; and all my

              told him they should be at his disposal, either to complete the publication of
              diplomatic correspondence authorised by Congress, or for the composition of his
              History— He has collected in France and England voluminous materials for that History,
              but I perceive by his Conversation, that he has become a partizan of <persRef

              the <persRef ref="gravier-charles">Count de Vergennes</persRef>, in relation to the
              controversies of those Times. His motives have doubtless reference to himself, to the
              present and the future; I offered him the freest use of my father’s Letter books, but
              was somewhat more reserved with regard to his papers— I found it the more necessary to
              use this reserve after <pb type="ms" n="252"/>ascertaining the bias he had taken.

              of the unhappy condition of the Indians, in the Southern States. I told him there were
              two class<unclear>es</unclear> of People among us; one of which sympathised with the
              Indians, and the other acted against them: and that it would be so till the Indian
              race shall be extinct— They will continue to be pitied, and exterminated— I was myself
              one of the sympathisers; but all I had been able to do, was to stay for a short time
              the exterminating hand and to pay the Indians as liberally as I could for the lands
              taken from them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren thought something would be done
              for protection of the Indians at the next Session of Congress— Proof that he knows
              little of the composition of that body. <persRef ref="savil-samuel">Deacon

            <p>for the exercise of the day. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>
              called upon me, and returned to me the draft of a Deed from <persRef ref="adams-john"
                >my fathers</persRef> Executors, which I had given him more than two months since—
              He left also several other papers relating to the Execution of my father’s Will; and
              with them my mortgage of the family mansion house and farm which we are to cancel— I
              spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy upon three Subjects, for his
              consideration and interesting to me, with reference to the University. First,
              respecting the donations, of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> W. N. Boylston</persRef>, and of which I told him the Executors proposed,
              as soon as they could command funds, to pay over to the Treasurer of the College, the
              principal Sums, to raise the two annuities of 100 and of 60 dollars— Secondly, I
              observed that as he was effecting a reform in the Administration of the Affairs of the
              University, I hoped he would induce the Corporation to manifest some sensibility to
              friendly donations— I said that nearly forty years since, my father made to the
              College a donation of Books— That more than thirty years since, I made a similar
              donation myself— That shortly after mine was made, a friend of mine advised me to
              claim the right of having my name affixed in the Alcove where the Books were; but I
              did not then think it worth while— And my father never claimed it during his life
              time— I now should wish him to enquire into the matter, and if according to the usage
              we were entitled to have our names in the Alcoves they should be placed there— I
              believed that this attention was due from the Government of the Institution, and that
              they had already lost much by the neglect of many benefactions— He said he was
              convinced of it, and that for the last twenty years there were no Records, and for the
              last four or five no accounts— That <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch</persRef>, and <persRef ref="francis-ebenezer"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis</persRef> had plucked the College from the
              fire. He promised immediate attention to my remarks, and faithful enquiry. He said he
              had just had the name of Elliot put up in an Alcove, for the donations of the late
                <persRef ref="eliot-samuel2">Samuel Elliot</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="eliot-samuel3;eliot-william">his two Sons</persRef>. Thirdly, I spoke to him of
              the decision of the College Government, excluding my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2"
                >John</persRef>, and nearly one half his Class from their degrees— It told him I
              thought they had been harshly, and their Parents and friends unjustly treated. I had
              written so to <persRef ref="kirkland-john">President Kirkland</persRef>—and I had
              hoped that when the second degrees were conferred upon the Class they would have been
              restored to their places, but was disappointed. I now wished him to review the
              proceedings of the College Government on that occasion, and to do what he should think
              right, with regard not only to my Son John—but to all the members of his class who had
              been excluded from their degrees. He promised that he would— He said it had been a
              Government of favoritism, but should be so no longer— He spoke of the appointment of a
              Tutor, and said he had been solicited by a particular friend in behalf of one of his
              relations, but had preferred a young man of higher standing for Talents and
              Scholarship. He mentioned other points, upon which he had straitened the discipline of
              the College, and said there was an excellent Spirit prevailing among the Students—

            <p>Being without interruption this day, I found it escape from me, and at its close that
              I had written little, if any thing more than usual— Instead of a Letter, I wrote
              nearly two pages of Memoirs but could read very little— I worked an hour with the

              with them. I read only a few pages of <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas"
                >Hutchinson’s</persRef> 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Volume; but they contained
              the Account of his controversy with the House of Representatives and Council of
              Massachusetts-Bay in February and March 1773. upon the Power of the British Parliament
              in the Colony. I met a few days since among <persRef ref="adams-john">my

                Adams</persRef> without date, but having reference to this dispute; and written
              while it was in progress. Hutchinson says that the papers of the House were written by

              assistance of John Adams, though not then a member of the House— This Note of Samuel

              and if I can persevere in this, I shall need no other in fair winter till the hard
              frosts. <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
                >r.</hi></persRef> was here this afternoon; and I spoke to him to put up Book cases
              in the house where I now reside, in my bed-chamber— I have a Library, packed up in
              Trunks and Boxes in Boston; of which I have scarcely ever had the use, and which I
              have now no place for putting up. I intended to have built an house for that purpose,
              but find myself destitute of the means— My next design was to build in my yard a small
              Office of Stone, which I might use for a Library and Study; but even this must be
              postponed for the present. I have determined to turn my Bed-chamber to those uses, and
              before incurring any expenses which must prove burdensome, to cling to the fragment of
              the wreck yet left me, and await the final dispensations of Providence, concerning me
              and my family— I engaged M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams, to procure 1000 feet of
              Pine, boards, and up to fit up Book cases all round my bed-chamber— I also desired him
              to examine the house, and report to me such repairs as may be necessary to put it in
              good tenantable condition— He is to commence upon the work in the course of the next
              week. <pb type="ms" n="255"/>I sent this morning to the Post-Office a Letter to

                >t.</hi> Monday last. I wrote one page of Memoirs; but engrossed much time in
              looking over the series of Laws of Massachusetts respecting Schools. It gave occasion
              to enquiries in my own mind, the solution of which will require much more time— In the
              afternoon, I resumed the examination of my fathers Journal’s of earliest date— Those
              which the Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> is copying are of 1755 and 1756. Those
              which I now took up, were of 1758. 1759. and 1760 upon loose sheets of fool’s cap
              paper, folded to make 16 pages a sheet; written in so small a hand that they can
              scarcely be read without a magnifying glass, and the leaves so scattered that I could
              not bring them all together— I found in them much interesting matter; and some
              opinions of characters and things which ought never to be divulged. To arrange and
              copy them will still be a work of Time. I finished reading the third Volume of
                <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson’s</persRef> History, and am glad that it
              has been published— I propose writing some remarks upon it, and therefore say nothing

            <p>After returning last Evening from <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf’s</persRef>, and just before going to bed I
              was suddenly seized with a sharp pain in my left side, and upon that loin, which
              continued through the night and deprived me entirely of Sleep. I suppose it rhumatism—
              During part of the Night I had a slight fever, and in restlessness felt the Solitude
              of absence from all my family. This is the second night that I have passed thus within
              the last Month, and the suffering is in parts which admonish me to set my house in
              Order— The weather for the last ten days had been so cold, especially in the morning
              and evening that I have <pb type="ms" n="256"/>shivered for want of a fire— All my
              neighbours have made fires; but intending to make alterations in my fire-places, and
              perhaps from a pride of hardihood which would have been more suitable to me thirty
              years since than now, I postponed it— Last Night there was a change in the weather
              from dry cold to damp and temperate— And I have observed it is rather moisture than
              cold in the atmosphere, which brings these attacks upon me— I rose this morning later
              than usual, and by daylight— Finding myself easier, I pursued my daily employments
              excepting the hour of spading which I was obliged to intermit. I finished a Letter to
                <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Waterhouse</persRef>, and wrote a page of Memoirs. But after dinner, I could no
              longer labour— The loss of the Night’s sleep, and a frequent twinge of pain, prompted
              me to indulge myself with a ride; and I went with <persRef ref="foster-louisa">Louisa

            <p>I was suffering all this day, with the rhumatism, and a severe Cold but having slept
              the last night was more able to employ this morning in writing— Wrote a short Letter
              to <persRef ref="johnson-alexander">A. B. Johnson</persRef> of Utica and then about a
              page of the Memoirs, besides copying into them the Letter from <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to <persRef ref="webb-nathan">Nathan
                Webb</persRef> of 12. October 1755. A Letter in the Analysis of which I find so much
              matter for commentary that a sober judgment must be called in to curb enthusiastic
              admiration— I propose to give the Letter entire, for it is the foot of Hercules—
              Nothing that my father ever wrote in the subsequent course of his life, bears in more
              indelible characters the stamp of his genius and of his heart— <persRef
                ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william"
                >Wirt</persRef> have both spoken of this Letter, with high commendation; but neither
              of them has noticed the part of it which is most deeply affecting to me its encomium,
              tender and sublime, upon friendship. If I should say that the annals of epistolary
              correspondence cannot furnish a Letter more replete at once with intellect and heart,
              I should commit no excess. But I shall endeavour to keep myself largely within the
              bounds of moderation— After dinner, I worked about an hour with the Spade. I sent into
              Boston, for my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, who came out to pass the Night with us. He
              brought me a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> of the 9<hi
                rend="superscript">th</hi>— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My dear
                wife</persRef> has again been very ill; he says she is much better. Her sufferings
              distress me deeply; would that I could contribute more effectually to their
              alleviation— Charles brought me also a Letter, and three Volumes of Newspapers from
                <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Waterhouse</persRef>— <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef>, and
              his daughter <persRef ref="dearborn-julia">Julia</persRef>, paid us an afternoon
              visit. The General left for my perusal two Volumes of Manuscript; upon the Grecian
              orders of Architecture, and two Volumes of a Life of Jesus Christ; all of his own
              composition. <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> stays with us

              the horticultural Society next Saturday. I answered John’s Letter, and wrote a short
              one to <persRef ref="angus-samuel">Captain Samuel Angus</persRef>, to send him with a
              copy of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
              Letter to me concerning him of 25 March 1825. the original of which is on the files of
              the Navy Department; and of which John has sent me a copy certified by the Chief Clerk
              of that Department. <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> called upon me
              to repeat the request of a resurvey of the woodlot the title of which is in question
              between the Estate of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and that of my
              Uncle <persRef ref="adams-peter">Peter</persRef>— He thinks the Season has now come in
              which it can be most easily effected. I promised to give attention to it. There was a
              sprinkling of rain all the morning, which became steady in the afternoon, and
              continued all the Evening—and the weather was so cold that we had a fire in our dining
              room. I am yet suffering with my rhumatism, and am losing the use of my right-hand for
              writing. With extreme difficulty, I wrote a page and a half of Memoirs; read a Chapter
              of <persRef ref="pitkin-timothy">Pitkin’s</persRef> History of the United States, and
              several Sections of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Treatise upon
              Friendship, with the French Translation of <persRef ref="u">Barrett</persRef>— I have
              found among my father’s paper the first sheet of his original draft of the Essay upon
              the Canon and Feudal Law, which I compared with a printed copy of it— The variations

              out from Boston this afternoon— When he first came I was again in the Nursery; having
              divided my task of exercise into two parts; forenoon and afternoon, about three
              quarters of an hour each. I wrote to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my

              yesterday, powers to receive dividends for me at the State Bank, and the Boylston
              Market— He brought me also a Petition to <persRef ref="hall-joseph">Judge

              announcing that he shall give up the farm, at the expiration of the year, because its
              proceeds will not enable him to pay the rent. But Charles said he would probably renew
              the lease for five years if I would allow him to expend half the rent on the
              improvement of the farm; which I told him was the best thing I could do. I received

              never heard before. Towards Evening I walked across the hills, and stopped at <persRef
                ref="greenleaf-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Greenleaf’s</persRef>; to
              enquire of <persRef ref="greenleaf-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                Greenleaf</persRef>, some particulars of <persRef ref="cranch-richard">her
                father’s</persRef> life. She brought down a bundle of old papers containing the
              rough drafts of many of her father’s Letters, and Letters from some of his friends and
              relatives to him—among them one from his brother <persRef ref="cranch-william3"
                >William</persRef>, written in 1746. when he Richard was in Plymouth Sound, on board
              of the Wilmington, the vessel in which he came to this Country. He landed at Boston in
              November 1746— The account of his several employments and residences, from that time,
              till he came to Braintree in April 1775 is still imperfect; but I expect to make it
              out with sufficient accuracy— I was not a little diverted at finding among the old
              Letters, one from <persRef ref="webb-nathan">Nathan Webb</persRef> to him, dated at
              Middletown 1757, in which the beautiful paragraph upon Friendship, of my father’s
              Letter to Webb written in October 1755, is copied verbatim and given by Webb as his
              own— I wrote a short Letter to <persRef ref="duponceau-peter">P. S.
                Duponceau</persRef> to enclose to him <persRef ref="hodgson-william"
                >Hodgson’s</persRef> Dissertation upon the Tuarycks, and read a few pages of

              It is to be put up in length horizontally, and its width perpendicular—divided into
              two Columns; one for my father and one for my mother— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Cary had copied on a paper covering a Board of the size <pb type="ms" n="259"/>of the
              Tablet, a part of the Inscription which I had left with him; and the effect appeared
              to me to be good. He had already marked in pencil the dedicating initials D.O.M. upon
              the Stone— I noticed however several corrections to be made in the
              inscription—especially of the punctuation. I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Cary to complete the copy of the Inscription, upon the paper over the board, and then
              to send me an exact copy of that, so that I may have an opportunity of correcting any
              error, and preventing its transmission to the Stone— At my Son <persRef

              Testament, from 2. Peter 3.16. “In which are some things hard to be understood.” The

              enlightened Trinitarians as spurious— I have heard and seen this often asserted by

                <persRef ref="reynolds-jeremiah">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reynolds</persRef>
              was here this morning, last from New Bedford— He stated to me the present condition of
              their expedition for commerce and for Science to the South Seas— One vessel has sailed
              from New-York but is now at Stonington. A second is ready to sail from New-Bedford and
                D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reynolds himself is going in her. The Lyceum of
              Natural History at New-York have undertaken to give the Instructions for the
              Scientific part of the undertaking. A third vessel is very shortly to follow the two

              is the Agent for the whole undertaking, and the Doctor now came to solicit a
              contribution from me. He had written me to the same effect from New-York, and I had
              answered his Letter declining the contribution; but he had not received my answer— He
              shewed me Letters from <persRef ref="dekay-james">Professor De Kay</persRef>, of

                <pb type="ms" n="261"/>also read to me a statement of all the proceedings hitherto
              in fitting out the expedition. I told him that after my recommendation to Congress of
              a public expedition, and its sanction twice by the House of Representatives, and the
              manner in which the design had been defeated by the Senate, I did not think it
              advisable or perhaps proper for me to take any part in an expedition, which was
              altogether a private and mercantile concern, though I wished them all possible
              success— The Doctor shewed me also a Letter from <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Judge
                M’lean</persRef> of 29. June, last, in which he announces his determination shortly
              to resign his Seat as a Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States—says he is <hi

            <p>The band of Musicians early this Morning struck their Tents and departed. I wrote a
              Letter to <persRef ref="litchfield-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Litchfield</persRef>, the Agent to the New-England Soap-stone Company— Worked an
              hour with the Spade in my nursery before dinner and planted a row of apple cores, with
              the seeds, by way of experiment— Wrote upwards of a page of Memoirs and read a few
              pages of <persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge Story’s</persRef> inaugural Address.— After
              dinner I wrote again, about an hour and then walked to <persRef ref="souther-john"
                >Captain Souther’s</persRef>— He is now Chairman of the Selectmen, and of the
              Assessors. He was at his Mill, where I went and found him— I had with me the tax-bill,
              delivered me by <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef>; in which I am
              taxed for the present year, for State, County and Town tax, 69:44—and for Parish Tax
              31.32 all for Real Estate— No Polls— No personal Estate or Income— The whole amount is
              100:76. I enquired of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Souther, what was the Real
              Estate, for which I was thus taxed— He did not know— The tax was taken from that of
              the last year, and that from the tax of the year before. <persRef ref="spear-daniel"
                >Deacon Spear</persRef> was then Chairman of the Selectmen and assessors, and
              Captain Souther is to enquire of him and will inform me— The System of taxation itself
              is so complicated, that Captain Souther himself either does not comprehend or could
              not explain it to me— In the Tax-Bill, the State, County and Town-tax, are all thrown
              into one— The State tax is levied by an Act of the Legislature— The tax upon the whole
              Commonwealth for this year is 75000 dollars—of which the portion of the Town of Quincy
              is 198— Their portion of the County-tax is 576:34. and their Town-tax is 3881:90. The
              whole amount being 4656:24. The assessment is made upon a double formula of 2. Cents
              to 100 dollars multiplied by 28—so that the tax is 56 cents upon every 100 dollars of
              the valuation— I suppose the Statute-book will explain— But Captain Souther told me
              that, an Act of the Legislature last Winter <pb type="ms" n="262"/>had trebled the tax
              upon Woodlands— Harvey Field told me that if I had been here on the first of May they
              would have taxed me for personal Estate— I asked Captain Souther whether in assessing
              the tax upon personal Estate they made any allowance for a man’s debts he said they
              did, and taxed him only for the balance left him after deduction of his debts. From
              the Captain’s I went to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>, and found
              there his brother in Law <persRef ref="harrod-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Charles Harrod</persRef>, who gave me some Willow and Water Oak Acorns, Three

                ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef> was below, recovering but very feeble— I
              walked home and read a few of <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du

            <p><date>24. V.</date> Thursday.</p>
            <p>There was a training day for a Regiment of Militia, upon the fields behind my Houses
              at the foot of Penn’s Hill; but I had no inclination to behold it. I worked with the
              Spade upwards of an hour before dinner, wrote to my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2"
                >John</persRef>, and towards Evening took an hour’s walk— <persRef
                ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> left us— Her brother <persRef
                ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas</persRef> came to pass the night here— In the Memoirs I
              barely copied the Letter from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to
                <persRef ref="cranch-richard">R. Cranch</persRef> of 29. August 1756— These Letters
              and Extracts from his Journals absorb much of my Time, and I am not sure that their
              insertion will be advisable— They may render the work at once too voluminous and
              unsuited to the popular taste— But I must proceed. I read <persRef ref="story-joseph"
                >Judge Story’s</persRef> Discourse upon his Inauguration as Dana professor of Law at
              Harvard University, and I propose to write him a Letter concerning it. In the Evening
              I read several of <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand’s</persRef> Letters—
              It belongs probably to the effect of age upon the taste and judgment that these
              Letters are more interesting to me than any novel— They are records of realities— In
              youth it was directly the reverse— Fairy Tales; the Arabian Nights, fictitious
              Adventures of every kind <hi rend="italic">delighted</hi> me— And the more there was
              in them of invention; the more pleasing they were. My imagination pictured them all as
              realities, and I dreamed of enchantments as if there was a world in which they
              existed— At ten years of age I read <persRef ref="shakespeare-william"
                >Shakespears</persRef> Tempest, As you like it, Merry wives of Windsor, Much Ado
              about Nothing, and King Lear— The humours of <persRef ref="falstaff-john"
                >Falstaff</persRef> scarcely affected me at all— <persRef ref="bardolph"
                >Bardolph</persRef> and <persRef ref="pistol">Pistol</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="nym">Nym</persRef> were personages quite unintelligible to me; and the lesson
              of <persRef ref="sirhughevans">Sir Hugh Evans</persRef> to the boy <persRef
                ref="williampage">William</persRef> was too serious an affair. But the incantations
              of <persRef ref="prospero">Prospero</persRef>, the Loves of <persRef ref="ferdinand">Ferdinand</persRef> and <persRef ref="miranda">Miranda</persRef>, the more than etherial sprightly
              loveliness of <persRef ref="ariel">Ariel</persRef>, and the worse than beastly grossness of <persRef ref="caliban">Caliban</persRef>, made for me a
              world of Revels and lap’d me in Elysium. With these books in a closet of <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail">my mother’s</persRef> bed chamber there was also a small Edition
              in two Volumes of <persRef ref="milton-john">Milton’s</persRef> Paradise Lost, which I
              believe I attempted ten times to read and never could get through half a book. I might
              as well have attempted to read <persRef ref="homer">Homer</persRef> before I had
              learnt the Greek Alphabet— I was mortified even to the shedding of solitary tears,
              that I could not even conceive what it was that my father and mother admired so much
              in that book, and yet I was ashamed to ask them an explanation. I smoked tobacco and
              read Milton, at the same time and from the same motive; to find out what was the
              recondite charm in them which gave my father so much pleasure— After making myself
              four or five times sick with smoking I mastered that accomplishment, and acquired a
              habit, which thirty years afterwards, I had much more difficulty in breaking off— But
              I did not master Milton— I was nearly thirty when I first read the Paradise Lost with
              delight and astonishment— But of late years <pb type="ms" n="263"/>I have lost the
              relish for fiction— I see nothing with sympathy but men, women and children of flesh
              and blood— Madame du Deffand’s Suppers, afford me savoury food, and I was charmed this
              Evening with her picture of the Lucan family sending a Piano to her apartments—the
              father making his daughters play and sing an hour or two— <persRef ref="u">Lady
                Stormont</persRef> joining in the concert— The Piano and children being then sent
              home and leaving a party to sup. The visit of <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi

            <p>I awoke this morning; rose and lighted my Lamp, and found it was a few minutes short
              of three O’Clock. Read four Chapters in the Bible to finish the first Book of Kings;
              and seven Sections in <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Amicitia, to
              finish the second reading of that— Then returned to bed, and dozed till broad
              daylight. I was chilled and could get no heat in bed— I betook myself to the spade in
              my Nursery, and dug for half an hour till driven into the house by the rain— <persRef
                ref="apthorp-william">William P. Apthorp</persRef> was here yesterday; to enquire if
              I had occasion to purchase any old wine; but I have more than I want upon my hands.
                <persRef ref="apthorp-g">His father’s</persRef> stock is for sale; and they are

              prosperous family of Apthorps remaining at Quincy— It will soon be extinct here. The
              families that endure, are in the humble vale— High-Life is beyond all things
              transitory— William told me that they found great difficulty in letting the House,
              because it had the reputation of being haunted— He said the rumour had originated from
              a woman; a Mantua-maker, who had slept in the west wing of the house; while <persRef
                ref="apthorp-anna">his mother</persRef> was living; and to his Mother’s having
              gone late at Night, to fetch something, into the room where the woman was in bed— I
              worked again with the Spade in my Nursery before dinner; and towards Evening walked to
                <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> House. His Son <persRef

                Story</persRef>, for which I had very cogent motives; but the consequences of which
              are with a higher power— I intend is as introductory to a Correspondence with him,
              which may influence his Career, and Lectures as Professor of Law at Cambridge— But I
              know not how he will receive it. My experience has taught me to distrust deeply my own
              foresight in the relation of effects with their causes.— <persRef ref="adams-john">My

                ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Amicitia— The Dialogue is between <persRef

                ref="scaevola">Mutius Scaevola</persRef>, whom he pronounces the brightest genius
              and most upright Roman of his time— He adds that one day on the occasion of a violent

                ref="sulpicius-publius">Publius Sulpicius</persRef> then a Tribune of the People who
              till then had been his most intimate friend, Scaevola, sitting in his Hemicycle, and
              conversing with friends among whom Cicero was present, upon this rupture which caused
              great excitement in the City, repeated the purport of a Discourse, of Laelius upon
              Friendship, many years before; a few days after the Death of his friend <persRef

              this narrative of <pb type="ms" n="264"/>Scaevola, and as Atticus had often urged him
              to write upon Friendship, he thought he could not more effectually comply with this
              request, than by introducing Laelius as the Speaker on that subject, and writing from
              memory what Scaevola had reported him to have said— How ingenious and beautiful a
              Frame for a Dissertation! But I have no Time for further comment here.</p>

              questionable title, said if it should be fair weather he would come at 8 O’Clock next
              Thursday Morning. In Boston I stopp’d at <persRef ref="cary-alpheus">M<hi

              was to be shut; I had time however to ascertain that <persRef ref="adams-jerymy"
                >Jerymy Adams</persRef> was admitted to the freeman’s Oath on the 6<hi

              Neither of these is on the list of our Ancestors— After dinner <persRef

              call but he was not at home— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

            <p>Heard <persRef ref="lamson-alvan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamson</persRef> of
              Dedham in the morning from Jeremiah 4.14. [“]O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from
              wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within
              thee?[”] And in the afternoon from Luke 8.15. [“]But that on the good ground are they,
              which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth
              fruit with Patience.” These were two moral Essays, extremely well written and well
              meditated— Sermons of this description are very pleasing to me; but there is an air of
              family resemblance among them all which colours them all with one complection. What
              would be the success of a Minister who should adopt the principle of giving to his
              discourses as much variety as possible— Who should at one time describe a scriptural
              character—at another discuss a point of controversy; at a third comment upon a
              parable; at a fourth dwell upon a point of morals— Perhaps it would <pb type="ms"
                n="265"/>require a variety of Talent, with Genius and Learning; but such a preacher
              must be generally pleasing— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamson’s Sermons had no
              allusion to the thoughts of other men. Very little even to his texts; all was spun out
              from the Reflections of his own mind— Differing in this respect from a Sermon of
                <persRef ref="bourdaloue-louis">Bourdaloue</persRef>, which I read yesterday and
              this morning upon the duties of Parents to their children— This is the first Sermon of
              that celebrated preacher that I have ever read; but I think I shall read many more. He
              was one of the most famous preachers of the time of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis
                14</persRef>. but differing much in the manner from <persRef ref="bossuet-jacques"
                >Bossuet</persRef>, <persRef ref="flechier-esprit">Flechier</persRef>, or <persRef
                ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef>— Bourdaloue quotes the Saints and Fathers
              in great profusion— His reasoning is much strengthened by quotations— His divisions of
              his subject are artificial and ingenious— Part of his argument from the peculiar
              character of the Tenets of the Romish Church, is not applicable to persons of the
              Protestant Churches— But much of his doctrine belongs to general morality— He urges
              that Parents have no right to controul the vocation of their children, and yet that
              Parents are the persons responsible for the vices of their children. I read also the
              Sermons 14 and 15. of the Volume of <persRef ref="freeman-james">D<hi

            <p>The Morning was so cold that I found it impossible to write either in my Chamber or
              at the Office, till after Breakfast—but the day was one of the finest of Autumn— I
              went into Boston with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>— Stop’d and left them, opposite to the South
              Boston Bridge. Called at <persRef ref="cary-alpheus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Cary</persRef> the Stone Cutters, and gave him the final directions, respecting the
              punctuation of the Inscription. He said <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi

              At <persRef ref="foster-james">James H. Foster’s</persRef> I asked his daughter
                <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth2">Elizabeth</persRef> to go with me to Quincy. Met at

                  Nath<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Curtis</persRef>, and went with him to the
              Probate-Office— The Letter of Administration upon <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2"
                >Thomas Boylston’s</persRef> Estate was made out in the names of the three Executors
              of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">W. N. Boylston</persRef>, but the judge would not take
                <unclear>each</unclear> of them as bondsman for the others, and required two
              bondsmen beside— I therefore requested that my name should be struck out from the bond
              as one of the Administrators and signed as a bondsman for the others. M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis however thought it would be more advisable that the
              Letter of Administration should be in my name; and they the bondsmen; upon which we
              left the business unfinished, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis concluded to

              Charles’s House; and thence went to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s,
              and took Elizabeth out to Quincy where we arrived just before three. The man from the

              Steady rain from before daylight till 3 in the afternoon, the weather gradually

              would come to resurvey the Woodlot Thursday morning at 8. Met my brother returning

                >Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> was working all day;
              fitting up the book-shelves in my bed chamber— My Memoirs are suspended. I finished
              reading this morning <persRef ref="bourdaloue-louis">Bourdaloue’s</persRef> Sermon
              upon Marriage— He takes his division from <persRef ref="staugustine">Saint
                Augustin</persRef>—considering it with reference to partnership, progeny and
              Sacrament— It is as a Sacrament that the Roman Catholics consider marriage as
              indissoluble. Bourdaloue says, that Christ instituted it as a Sacrament, shortly after
              being present at the Marriage of Cana. I do not perceive the Institution of a
              Sacrament, but I believe the indissoluble character of the marriage bond, is a
              powerful guard of morals. Bourdaloue speaks of the duties, the afflictions and the
              dangers of the married state, most of which are the same in all ages— He urges warmly
              the necessity of making it a religious transaction. A Sacrament—and thinks it should
              be contracted only by special vocation. He speaks of ill assorted matches, and
              discordant couples as very common— He exhorts the Ladies to exercise their influence
              over their husbands, in favour of Religion, and cites a compliment of Saint Augustin
              to a married woman of his time, assuring her that if Jupiter himself could have had
              such a wife she would have converted him to Christianity.</p>

              tea, till 9 or 10. I pass the time in idleness, reading occasionally a few of <persRef
                ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffands</persRef> Letters— Retire to bed usually
              before ten— I have more business than is pleasing, and being of small, momentary
              household concern it absorbs time and leaves me little for what I deem important. At
              the beginning of this Month my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> was
              married; I hope and pray, well— Of what is to remain after me, this constitutes almost
              all that I have to hope, and in imploring again a blessing from God, I humbly hope the
              prayer may not be presumptuous.</p>
