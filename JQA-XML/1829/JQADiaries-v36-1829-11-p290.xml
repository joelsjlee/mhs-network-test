            <p>Heard <persRef ref="willard-sydney">Professor Willard</persRef> this morning from
              Romans 10. [“]But the righteousness which is of Faith speaketh on this wise. Say not
              in thine heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven? (that is to bring Christ down from
              above:) 7. Or who shall descend into the deep? (that is to bring up Christ again from
              the dead) 8: But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy
              heart: that is the word of faith, which we preach.” It was a Sermon upon the right of
              private judgment in religious concerns and the interpretation of the Scriptures—
              Rational and cogent. The afternoon text was from Psalm    [“]They shall bear fruit in
              their Old Age.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Willard and <persRef
                ref="willard-joseph">his Son</persRef> dined with us, and also <persRef
                ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>— After the afternoon Service I read two
              Sermons of <persRef ref="swift-jonathan">Swift</persRef>—one upon the Martyrdom of
                <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles the first</persRef>, preached on Sunday the 30<hi
                rend="superscript">th</hi> of January 1725. 26. and the other upon the excellence of
              Christianity in opposition to the Heathen Philosophy. The political Sermon is in the
              rankest tone of Toryism—repeatedly styling Charles the blessed Martyr, and raving at
              the wicked puritans— He nevertheless declares his approbation of the expulsion of
                <persRef ref="james-ii">James the second</persRef>—passes a short and cold encomium
              upon <persRef ref="william-iii">William the third</persRef>, and pronounces the judges who decided the right of Charles I
              to levy ship-money wicked. He considers the dissenters of his own times as the
              successors of the Puritans, and has a fling at them for not observing the day as a
              religious solemnity— It would be an amusing Speculation to compare this Sermon with
              that of <persRef ref="mayhew-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayhew</persRef>
              upon the same Catastrophe. But I have never heard or read a political Sermon,
              consistent with the Spirit of Christianity. The Sermon upon the superior Excellence of
              the Christian Religion to the Grecian Philosophy, is a good subject very badly
              treated— Shallow, superficial and unjust to the philosophers. He probably knew nothing
              of the Grecian Philosophy—and speaks from ignorance. It is a poor tribute of praise to
              the Christian system of morals to declare it superior to that which is itself weak and
              absurd— Its real merit consists in its superiority to the sublimest and profoundest
              conceptions of the human mind— I also this Evening finished reading <persRef
                ref="condorcet-marie">Condorcet’s</persRef> Life of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
                >Voltaire</persRef>— It is almost unqualified Panegyric— Much less entertaining than
              I had expected, uniformly grave and didactic, with scarcely a sprightly thought in the
              book. The best part of it is the Summary of his hero’s character with which he
              closes.</p>

            <p><persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> brought
              me this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>
              enclosing a printed copy of the Constitution of the Phillips Academy at Andover. From
              this and the Rules and Regulations of the Derby School at Hingham it will be for me to
              draw up the plan of the Classical School to be established here, and it is perhaps
              just that this duty should devolve upon me. The Masons are yet at work upon my
              Chimney, and <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r.</hi></persRef> came about the additional bookshelves which I must fit up in my
              Northeastern upper chamber to stow away a large portion of my library— These works
              must be precipitated to enable me to go towards the close of this month to Washington—
                <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> came to give me notice that on
              Saturday Night, my house at the foot of Penn’s Hill; the house in which I was born had
                <pb type="ms" n="291"/>taken fire, and suffered, very considerable injury— The fire
              by the blessing of God was extinguished so that the house was saved— The fire happened
              in the same way as it did in 1803 to my house in Hanover Street— It was now in the
              part of the House occupied by <persRef ref="field-william">William Field</persRef>;
              and Harvey asked who was to be at the expense of the repairs— I said it must be he who
              made the fire; but he said William Field had been told that the repairs must be made
              by me— For the damage had been occasioned, by placing a Fireframe in the Chimney, for
              which W. Field had received permission from <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
                brother</persRef>— I said my brother had not given him permission to set the house
              on fire— He asked me to come and look at it, which I promised to do to-morrow. He said
              that he and William Field were both going this day to Brighton. The Northeasterly
              Storm, continues; but now without the gale— Towards the dusk of Evening I walked to
              <persRef ref="sever-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sever</persRef> the Schoolmaster’s
              who is also the Town-Clerk— I asked to see the Record upon the Town Book of the last
              boundary line between the Towns of Quincy and Milton— He lent me the Report made by
              the Select men themselves—<persRef ref="spear-daniel">Daniel Spear</persRef> and
                <persRef ref="souther-john">John Souther</persRef> on the part of Quincy in November
              1826. which I brought home and had copied— I unpacked a few more of my books, and
              proceeded in the abstract of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> title
              vouchers. <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">W. Greenleaf</persRef> is copying his early
              Journals. I read only a few pages of the Appendix to <persRef ref="condorcet-marie"

            <p>Much of the day was again absorbed in continuing the abstract from <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> title Deeds, and yet they were not completed—
                <persRef ref="humphrey-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys</persRef> the
              Surveyor called this Morning; and gave me a minute of the contents of the three Lots
              of Woodland surveyed last week by him for the Estate of my father. Their amount fully
              makes up the quantity of land to which he was entitled, by all the voucher deeds he
              has left. I spoke to him of the course of the boundary line between the Towns of
              Milton and Quincy; as likely to illustrate that of the several Lots in the Deeds of
              600 Acres lands— He was hurried to proceed to Dedham, and could not wait for further
              elucidations. There was rain all the morning; Some additional boxes of my books were
              unpacked; but I could not find room for them upon my shelves. <persRef
                ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> called here after dinner, with the papers
              relating to Lands of mine sold in the State of Vermont, and to an undivided remnant of
              the Estate of <persRef ref="quincy-norton">Norton Quincy</persRef>— I had promised
                <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef>, to go and look at the breach in
              the house at the foot of Penn’s Hill made by the fire on Saturday Night. My brother
              took me there in his Chaise— The floor has burnt through from the cellar, and two
              large beams are entirely burnt off. The damage to the house is considerable; but the
              house has been spared— In that house, I was born. It cannot last many years longer;
              yet I cannot suppress a hope that it will outlast me.— Had it been consumed I should
              have felt it as a calamity far beyond its intrinsic value— My own death is an event
              which cannot be remote— To part with the world and with life is the
                <unclear>Law</unclear> to which I must soon submit; but there is a lingering
              attachment to this Earth—which looks beyond the grave and fondly hopes that Children
              and Grand-children to be followed by later Generations will enjoy life where I have
              enjoyed, when this generation and the next will all be in the tomb— May this weakness
              be forgiven me and this mentis gratissimus error go with me to the close of life. <pb
                type="ms" n="292"/>I walked home, and spent the Evening in reading the appendix to
                <persRef ref="condorcet-marie">Condorcet’s</persRef> Life of <persRef
                ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> and a number of Voltaire’s Letters— There
              are two between him and <persRef ref="rousseau-jean">J. J. Rousseau</persRef> upon
              Rousseau’s sending him his Discourse upon the Inequalities of Condition among men,
              which deserve to be studied as models. There are also two remarkable subsequent
              Letters in one of which Voltaire asks Rousseau, permission to publish Voltaire’s own
              Letter, while Rousseau’s answer tells him that the request relieves him from much
              concern which he had felt at a prospect that the Letters were becoming public, in
              consequence of his having lent them to two or three persons to read— There is in
              Voltaire’s Letters an unaccountable fascination.</p>

                ref="thompson-benjamin">Rumford</persRef> Roaster, Boilers, Kettle and Steamer,
              recommended to me the addition of a Smoak Jack in the Chimney; to which I assented;
              whereupon, one of them went into Boston, and brought out <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Wall</persRef>, who makes them— This is an invention
              with which I was not acquainted and which I now adopt by way of experiment. I had
              commenced last Evening a Letter to <persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef>,
              which sundry interruptions this day prevented me from finishing till this Evening; and
              which thus occupied the day. The Subjects upon which I commenced this Correspondence
              are copious, and in compressing my ideas, I fear I shall not be altogether
              intelligible to the Judge— My purpose was to put him upon thinking of some things of
              high moment which it was obvious he had not duly meditated—to check his strain of
              unbounded, and unfounded panegyrick upon the bitterest enemies of his Country that
              ever lived, and to hint to him the incongruity of recommending the Study of
              Philosophy, with a sneer upon <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef>. May the result of

              Braintree Common Lands in the possession of his brother <persRef ref="brackett-james">James Brackett</persRef>— He said he
              would make enquiry for it of his brother who was now here— <persRef ref="adams-thomas"
                >My brother</persRef> dined with us. We examined the papers relating to the Vermont
              Lands, and to the undivided remnant of <persRef ref="quincy-norton">Norton
                Quincy’s</persRef> Estate in Braintree— I agreed to sign the power of Attorney to
              him to act in this case in behalf of the representatives of <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail">my Mother’s</persRef> interest in the claim. He shewed me also
              the papers relating to the division of the Medford Estate with <persRef

              were here; and are to finish this Evening the appraisement of the remaining lots yet
              unsold of my father’s Estate— The Deacon renewed to me his proposals for an exchange

                <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">Brigham</persRef>; to whom he had sold it. I had time

            <p>The principal purpose of a Diary as mine has been kept is to perform the Pythagorean
              precept, and render to myself an account of the manner in which I spend every moment
              of my time. Yet it often happens that when the day is gone I am myself at a loss to
              remember how it slip’d away— And so it was with this— I continued unpacking and
              putting up books; and <persRef ref="clapp-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Clap</persRef> the Mason from Boston, finished his work in my kitchen with the
              exception of the Smoke-jack still to be put up. Towards Evening I walked out— called
              at <persRef ref="sever-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sever’s</persRef> and left the copy
              which he had left me of the line last drawn between the Towns of Quincy and Milton—
                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sever was not returned from School. I stop’d next at

              leave the certificate of the Canal Share 12.49—to be made out in my name, but he was

            <p>Part of this day was consumed in a fruitless search for papers. <persRef
                ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> sold the wood lots, on my Lawyer’s Common—
              The manner of making these Sales is by staking out small Lots of ground, and selling
              them upon the spot, at Auction— The wood to be cut down, and taken away by the
              purchasers. I walked up to the place; and went entirely round the lot before I found
              them. There were about thirty persons there; men chiefly residing in the
              neighbourhood. Labouring men, who purchased chiefly for their own consumption. The
              management of wood land is one of the things upon which I want information. A part of
              the Science of husbandry, upon which these my neighbours now amuse themselves at the
              expence of my ignorance, and take advantage of it. <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon
                Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer">his brother</persRef> renewed
              their Siege upon me to swap land with them— They wish me to take land that is good for
              nothing, in exchange for land which is good; and from the facility of my nature there
              is a prospect that they will succeed— <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey
                Field</persRef> chaffered with me about the site of the School house which they have
              built upon my land; and for which I told him I should claim ground Rent— He asked me
              what I would take for it— I said the land was worth a thousand dollars an Acre— I’ll
              give it said he— So the land is mine.— Not so fast said I— Take a whole Acre, and you
              shall have it— <persRef ref="nightingale-josiah">Josiah Nightingale</persRef> had
              purchased one of the lots of Wood, which by the conditions of the Sale is to be cut
              down carried away and paid for before the first of April next. Nightingale came to me,
              and said—I suppose you will allow me another winter to take off part of it— I told him
              he must take all the Conditions of Sale from Deacon Spear— These men <pb type="ms"
                n="294"/>are too sharp for me to deal with, and some of them understand the art of
              Flattery better than Courtiers— It was half past two when I got home; and I was too
              weary for reading or writing the remainder of the day— Harvey Field offered me, as we
              were returning six dollars for an old Oak tree near his house under which I used to
              pick acorns when I was a child— I told him the sight of it was worth more to me than
              six dollars— I spent the afternoon in idleness, and the Evening in talking with
                <persRef ref="thaxter-anna">Miss Thaxter</persRef> about <persRef ref="josiah">King

            <p><date>7. IV:45.</date> Saturday.</p>
            <p>I intended to have gone into Boston this Morning; but there came on a North-East
              Storm with heavy rain which continued the whole day and confined me to the house. I
              received Letters from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and
              from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, enclosing one from <persRef
                ref="brooks-sidney">Sidney Brooks</persRef>. I wrote to M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> Brooks and to my wife which occupied the day, excepting the time consumed in
              a search of papers relating to the Execution of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father’s</persRef> Will. Upon this search I found several things to be done, which
              had escaped from my mind: of every object which requires a continuance of action at
              distant intervals of time, there should be periodical Seasons for taking up and
              reviewing what has already been done— I am preparing a fifth Account for Settlement at
              the probate Office: and meet a question whether the fourth has been settled— I took it
              to Dedham for that purpose on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of October 1827. but
              the judge was gone upon a Journey, and no probate Court was then held. Whether it was
              afterwards settled or not my Memory does not decisively Report. Interests of high
              importance to myself and others require that I should proceed in this affair with
              great regularity, and putting every thing upon record. The Account that I had drawn up
              and prepared last Summer must be made up anew and the cancelling of the Mortgages, be
              entered upon my own book of Record of the Administration— I finished reading this
              Evening the Appendix to <persRef ref="condorcet-marie">Condorcet’s</persRef> Life of
                <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>; and began the memoirs of his
              own Life written by Voltaire himself—a posthumous work, which I read at its first
              publication in 1784. At the age of 22—Voltaire was imprisoned in the Bastille, for a
              short poem called Les J’ai Vus—or Things I have seen— Condorcet somewhat equivocally
              disavows the authorship; but gives the Poem itself in the Appendix— It is every way
              worthy of Voltaire, and was very naturally in the eyes of the Regent worthy of the
              Bastille. His Declaration or Petition to the <persRef ref="frederick-ii">King of
                Prussia</persRef>, upon his arrest and imprisonment at Francfort for the Livre de
              Poeshies du Roi mon Maitre is ludicrous, by the mixture of excessive terror, of
              affected profound respect, and of involuntary irrepressible sarcasm of which it is
              composed— He begins by declaring that he is dying and keeps through the whole paper
              that he has but a few days to live— Tis the last Scene of the Fourberies de Scapin
              over again to a tittle.</p>

              your lights burning; 36. And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord,
              when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open
              to him immediately.” This was a discourse upon the duty of being prepared for death,
              and as frequently happens, the text was more deeply impressive upon me than the
              Sermon. I think much upon the subject, and yet have not set my household in order. I
              have much to do to prepare for my departure, and have frequent admonitions in the
              state of my health to do it without further delay— Eight months of Leisure have passed
              away and how little have I done. Worldly concerns still absorb my time— How hard it is

                ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef> upon Slander— They are for the substance,
              admirable discourses—full of excellent observation, and sound principle; but
              altogether obsolete in Style. <persRef ref="pitt-william">Lord Chatham</persRef> is
              said to have been a great admirer of Barrow, and so was <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef>— But this writer, as well as <persRef ref="tillotson-john"
                >Tillotson</persRef> and <persRef ref="butler-joseph">Butler</persRef> is like a
              Chesnut surrounded by such a rough and prickly Coat, that you must carefully cast off
              the shell before you can come at the nutritive part— His text is [“]He that uttereth
              Slander is a Fool[”]— The first Sermon describes the various modes of Slander, and the
              second the proofs of its folly. There are a number of singular and obsolete words—curt
              for short—shrewd for shrowd and parlous for dangerous, in which sense it is used by

              occupied and unwell, with stitches of Rhumatism, and kept my chamber. I spoke to my

                <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> to be sent to the Trustees— I took

            <p>I had an indifferent Night; being more than once, awaked by twinges of rhumatism, or
              stitches of some more threatening disease which within the last four months has
              returned upon me several Times— They are of a pressure and severity to warn me that my
              departure may be sudden and Solitary; I find as yet relief by an instantaneous change
              of position; but this may be not always my lot— Cold and damp weather thus affects me
              now, habitually, and although I resorted yesterday to the last of my flannels, the
              waistcoat it proves not a sufficient shelter. May the admonition not be lost upon me.
              I began the draft of a Deed, in my Sketch diurnal. <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon
                Spear</persRef> called upon me and settled with me, for his Sales of standing wood
              on my Lawyers common. They amounted to 302 dollars of which he takes ten per Cent for
              selling and collecting the proceeds of Sales, one per Cent for the State tax on
              Auctions— He paid me 73 dollars in cash, and gave me his Note, payable the 1<hi

                ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Curtis</persRef> came before
              Deacon Spear had left me— I went with him to the probate Court, where I filed the
              fifth Account of the Executors of <persRef ref="adams-john">John Adams</persRef>, and
              the Supplementary inventory, returned by the Appraisers, and to which I was sworn—
                <persRef ref="robbins-edward">Judge Robbins</persRef> thought he had no Authority to
              indicate the particular ten Acres of woodland in the 600 Acres, which should be set

              that the prospects of the Canal have much declined since <pb type="ms" n="297"/>the
              early part of the Summer when I came home— The Stone cutting business upon which the
              success of the Canal depended is departing from the Town itself and even the workmen
              who were occupied upon it here, are transferring the Scene of their operations to
              Sandy Bay— I went to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> and delivered
              to him a Letter from his Son <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas</persRef>, written at

            <p>The greatest part of this day was engaged in unpacking and putting up books, the room
              for which is yet exceedingly scanty. Much of my time is absorbed by looking in to many
              of the books before they are put up, and the day is gone before I am aware of it.
                <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"

              <persRef ref="thaxter-norton">brother</persRef> called here this afternoon upon his

                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Price Greenleaf</persRef> was here in the Evening—
                <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> came with a load of Wood, and I
              had conversation with him upon the renewal of his lease— I told him I would renew the
              lease to him and <persRef ref="spear-lemuel">his brother</persRef> for two three or
              five years at their option at the rent they now pay which is 600 dollars a year, and
              which I was determined not to reduce any further— It has already been reduced from
              1000 dollars to 600— He urged very hard for a reduction to 500 which I positively
              declined— He then said he would bring his brother to talk with me to which I readily
              agreed, but told him it would make no alteration in my determination— I lost the day
              for all writing except the Journal of yesterday, and the draft of the Deed which I
              propose to give of the two pews the Monument and Tomb; the recital in which will
              apparently be longer than the Deed— In the Evening I read a few Letters of the
              Correspondence of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> with the
                <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Marquise du Deffand</persRef>. This correspondence
              proves that he disbelieved any future State of existence, and that he was all his
              lifetime flattering himself that he should have the glory of demolishing the Christian
              Religion. His life appears to have been a long disease, and he was always imagining or
              representing himself to his Correspondents as at the point of Death. He constantly
              complains that all his Letters sent by the Post-Office are opened; he published his
              irreligious books under fictitious names, and was continually disavowing that he was
              the author of them— There is a very good Letter from the President <persRef
                ref="henault-charles">Henault</persRef> to him censuring his Philosophie de
              l’Histoire by the pretended <persRef ref="bazin">Abbe Bazin</persRef>; which was not even
              a fictitious name— There was such a person, who wrote to Voltaire complaining of the
              misuse of his name and to whom Voltaire replied only by fool’s jokes.</p>

              of his house. I called at his Office, and then at the Registry of Deeds where I took

              came this morning and informed me, what he thought was the extent of the damage done
              by the fire, to the house at the foot of Penn’s hill, which I directed him to repair—
              I went to Boston and dined with <persRef ref="brooks-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Edward Brooks</persRef>. I suffered so much from the cold weather, that on
              coming to Boston Neck, I left the Chaise, and walked into the City. Called at <persRef
                ref="cary-alpheus">Cary</persRef> and <persRef ref="dickinson-david"
                >Dickinson’s</persRef> Shop but neither of them was there. At <persRef
                ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef>, I saw
              his daughters <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth2">Elizabeth</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="foster-louisa">Louisa</persRef>. At <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge
                Davis’s</persRef> I made some enquiries respecting the preface to the third Volume
              of <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson’s</persRef> History, which the judge
              could not satisfactorily answer— There was much negotiation to obtain the publication
              of it at all. The <persRef ref="hutchinson-john2">Editor</persRef> is a Grandson of
              Governor Hutchinson— He would not publish it in this Country; nor in England without a
              contribution to defray the expense of the publication. The editor sent me one copy of
              it with a civil Letter of acknowledgment for my contribution, and in that copy there
              was an interesting preface containing some account of the last days of Governor
              Hutchinson, after he took refuge in England. For my contribution three copies of the
              volume have been delivered to me here; without the preface. I asked the judge how it
              happened that the preface had been withdrawn from these Volumes he said the Editor had
              written that it was not applicable to this Country: but that he had sent him and
                <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage</persRef>, each a
              copy of the book with the preface— The judge asked me, if I would Review it for the
              North American Review— <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> had
              asked me the same question yesterday— I said I would if <persRef ref="sparks-jared"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef> would publish the Review as I
              should write it; but not if it was to be written so as to give no offence to any one—
              The judge spoke to me also of the recent publication of the Memoir of <persRef
                ref="lee-arthur">Arthur Lee</persRef>; and the Correspondence connected with it;
              particularly as it bears upon the character of <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi

            <p>On rising this morning I found the ground covered with Snow. As the weather moderated
              it turned to rain and before night the ground was bare— It confined me however to the
              house and for my daily task of exercise, I was compelled to unpack and put up my
              books— I have nearly got through with my boxes, and must find room for stowing away
              all the books brought out from Boston— This is I hope and pray the last removal they
              are destined to undergo during my life, and I cannot flatter myself that I shall ever
              possess them so as to derive from them all the benefit which I had hoped— It remains
              for me to submit with cheerfulness to a different dispensation and to rely that in
              another age and under other auspices my intentions may be no longer barren or
              unfruitful— The cold weather of this Season precludes me also from the possibility of
              writing before breakfast: and so I betook myself this morning to reading. I began with
              the first chapter, of the seventh Book of <persRef ref="grahame-james">James
                Grahame’s</persRef> history of the rise and progress of the United States of America
              It is the foundation of the Colony of Pennsylvania and the Life of <persRef
                ref="penn-william">William Penn</persRef>— This is the first Historian who has done
              Justice to the founders of the North-American Colonies. It has heretofore happened
              that the first Settlers of New-England have suffered in reputation even from their own
              historians— <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="robertson-william3">Robertson</persRef> have slandered them systematically. On
              the other hand Penn has had more than Justice done him— Grahame meets it out to him
              with an equal balance— Penn’s Toleration, and the Quaker disclaimer of carnal weapons,
              were excellent ingredients for the Settlement of a Colony—but his proprietary
              Government was a monarchy— His controversy with <persRef ref="calvert-charles">Lord
                Baltimore</persRef> is not creditable to his disinterestedness, and his political
              system terminated in a principality devolved upon his descendants—and dissolved only
              by the Revolutionary War of Independence— Neither Penn nor his Institutions were
              Republican— In the Evening I read a few pages of the second Book, which commences the
              History of New-England.</p>

                Bigelow</persRef> has recently published, entitled <persRef ref="paul"
                >Paul</persRef> at Athens, a Preacher of Unitarianism, of which he has sent me a
              copy, ingenious and forcible—perhaps not altogether candid— I read also two Sermons of
                <persRef ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef>—one upon detraction— The other against
              rash and censorious judgments— They seem to be sequels to the two Sermons upon
              Slander. I hardly know what to think of this writer— His reputation stands high, and
              there is a Story that <persRef ref="pitt-william">Lord Chatham</persRef> passed some
              extravagant commendation upon him. <persRef ref="adams-john">My father</persRef> had a
              high opinion of him, and his Sermons are yet so fashionable that a new Edition of them
              has been recently published— I find him dry and somewhat tedious— There is nothing in
              them that I should call eloquence— He proves his maxims of morals as he would prove a
              theorem of <persRef ref="euclid">Euclid</persRef>— There is nothing in these
              discourses for the heart. Obsolete words and a crabbed Style, much thought; sound
              sense—frequent quotations, Latin and Greek, from authors now forgotten, and often in
              sentences not worthy of preservation— I finished reading the Chapter of <persRef
                ref="grahame-james">Grahame’s</persRef> History containing the account of the first
              Settlement of New-England. It is excellent, and for the first time renders ample
              Justice to our Puritan fore-fathers. He has detected and gently rebuked the
              misrepresentations of <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume</persRef>, <persRef
                ref="robertson-william3">Robertson</persRef> and <persRef ref="chalmers-george"
                >Chalmers</persRef>— His exposures of them rouse my indignation— Never were men more
              scandalously traduced than have been the first Settlers of New-England— <persRef
                ref="sparks-jared">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef> told me that
              Grahame’s History had little success in England. This will of course affect its
              popularity here.</p>

            <p>I finished at length this day the unpacking of my books, and got them housed. They
              are in lamentable confusion, and it is very doubtful whether I shall ever have the
              Time and means to put them in order. <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> called here with a card given him by a
                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, of the New-England
              Stereotype Foundery at Boston, and proposing to print for me upon reasonable terms any
              work that I may have the intention of publishing. I told him I had none for the
              present; and that if I should have hereafter, I shall probably apply to the company
              for a further exposition of their Terms— <persRef ref="cary-alpheus">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary</persRef> came with his Bill for the erection of
              the Monument to the Memory of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and
                <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> in the Stone Temple at Quincy; which I
              paid. He spoke of putting up behind the bust a black marble obelisk about four feet
              high; to bring the bust more in relief; but I have concluded to defer doing any thing
              further for the present. It is probable the walls of the House will be painted, and
              another loose marble to be adjusted to their Wall, would lay a foundation for a
              necessity of future repairs. <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was here
              this forenoon and also <persRef ref="sumner-william">General Sumner</persRef>, who had
              been to see the Monument and approved it— He told me that <persRef ref="knapp-samuel"
                >S. L. Knapp</persRef> had written a biographical account of <persRef
                ref="knapp-isaac">his father</persRef>, which he thought admirable, and also a
              monumental inscription upon his Tomb in the Park place burying ground at Boston. The
                <pb type="ms" n="301"/>General spoke to me also of certain speculations which had
              been proposed to him in New-York in Lands in the Mexican State of Texas— He says that
              all the Lands in the State have been granted with the assent of the Mexican Congress
              to purchasers Citizens of the United States, who are now offering them for Sale at
              New-York— And that it is expected the present Administration of the United States will
              purchase the State of Texas of the Mexican Republic. I told him I did not believe the
              Mexican Republic would or could sell the State; but I thought our present
              Administration would take it by War; and if so I believed the result of it would be to
              break up our Union— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Beale</persRef> and <persRef ref="miller-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller</persRef> came to speak of the
              distribution of the Lot of Land near the Meeting House, given by my father to the
              Town. <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
                Greenleaf</persRef> afterwards came and conversed with me on the same Subject. They
              have sent for <persRef ref="fuller-stephen2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Fuller</persRef>, a Surveyor at Boston, who is to come and view the ground next
              Wednesday Morning and make a plan for laying out the ground; and they invited me to be
              present at the time when he will be there— With my little family I spent the Evening
              at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef>, and the first time
              for several years I joined in a hand at whist— Read the second Chapter of the second
              Book of <persRef ref="grahame-james">Grahame’s</persRef> History with great
              Satisfaction— The Style of this writer though plain is elegant. He writes apparently
              under deep religious impressions without enthusiasm; a lofty sense of morals—tolerant,
              humane, devoted to Justice and impartiality; with a philosophical Spirit, and a
              fervent love of Liberty, and a burning zeal, for the prevalence of human rights. This
              is precisely the character required, to write the History of the Settlement of
              New-England; as well as that of the North American Union— There is bitterness against
              the Princes of the house of Stuart; and they were doubtless all bad characters— There
              is a leaning favourable to almost all eminent Puritans—even to <persRef
                ref="vane-henry">Sir Henry Vane</persRef>, <persRef ref="peters-hugh">Hugh
                Peters</persRef> and <persRef ref="cromwell-oliver">Cromwell</persRef>. Yet he
              spares them not when he thinks their characters deserve censure— The narrative is
              concise, and clear; and he gives to the religious dissensions which raged so early in
              the Colony an interest of which they scarcely seemed susceptible— He seems to me to
              underrate <persRef ref="winthrop-john2">Winthrop’s</persRef> Journal, but he very
              justly charges <persRef ref="savage-james">Savage</persRef> with underrating <persRef

            <p>Warm rain the whole day—confined me to the house; put up the last of my books, upon
              the shelves— They are in great disorder—many odd volumes of large Collections are
              missing— I have yet to assort them; and to make out a catalogue of them; for which
              Time and Perseverance are essential— <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey</persRef> brought me this morning my plans, and
              his Bills— The Plans all correspond with sufficient exactness with my Deeds and
              previous plans, excepting the Penn’s Valley farm, where there is a deficiency of more
              than 20 Acres. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey said <persRef
                ref="bracket-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemuel Brackett</persRef> had
              engaged him to go over the ground and mark the lines between his lot and mine upon
              Pine Hill— I agreed to go with them for that purpose on Friday or Saturday next, if
              the weather should be fair— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey promised to go
              round that part of the Penn’s Valley farm where the mistake may be at the same time;
              and said if there was a mistake he would notify it without additional charge— <persRef
                ref="bass-isaac">Isaac Bass</persRef> was here respecting an exchange of Land
              between him and me, which may suit the convenience of us both— I had spoken of it last

              project since I abandoned that of building, upon the Hill. We examined the bearing of
              the ground upon a plan reduced from that of <persRef ref="withington-mather"
                >Withington</persRef>, and agreed to think more about it before coming to a
              determination— Bass said he would prefer to exchange rather than to sell, and I told
              him I had no desire whatever to purchase— <pb type="ms" n="302"/>Finished the draft of

              Stone Temple to the Supervisors of the Adams Temple and School fund, which I have
              prepared for their examination, and if they please, acceptance. I read the third

            <p>Heavy rain almost the whole Night, which continued part of this morning. I went to

                Mother</persRef>— I also gave him the draft of a Deed to the Supervisors of the
              Temple and School fund of the Tomb, monument and two Pews: and I had some conversation
              with my brother about sending his Son, <persRef ref="adams-john3">John

                ref="harrod-susan">Susan Harrod</persRef> here; and they spent the day with us— The
              afternoon was consumed in commencing a Catalogue of my books; but before we had got
              through even a notice of the Folio Volumes, darkness came— I distress myself with the
              consciousness that my few hours of remaining life are slipping away from me
              unimproved— That my occupations are engrossed for transitory purposes, and that I am
              losing day after day without atchieving any thing— The Memoir of <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> life has been six weeks suspended; and in the
              interval what have I done? I have made some small progress in preparation for my own
              departure, and that is all. I have brought my Books from Boston, and lodged them at
              this House. I have completed the Surveys of the Lands which belonged to my father’s
              Estate; and have nearly completed a Survey of all my own— I have plans of the
              whole—and in the event of my own decease very shortly; the labours of my Executors
              will be facilitated, though I have yet much to do to set my house in order. Another
              Summer of leisure and health if allowed me, will I trust be sufficient to enable me to
              leave my Affairs in some condition of regularity. May the Mercies of Providence not
              forsake me— I wrote short Letters to T. B. Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> To

              yesterday the first volume of a new work—an Encyclopaedia Americana, a Translation or

              again for various indulgences, part of which I consented to and declined yielding the
              rest— He and <persRef ref="spear-lemuel">his brother</persRef> have concluded to renew

              year’s notice in two years. He is to bring me their copy of the Lease, upon which I
              promised to endorse the renewal— I read this morning the fifth and last Chapter of the

              with great pleasure; and with no small mortification—pleasure to find Justice done at
              last to the pilgrim founders of this Empire. Mortification that this tardy Justice
              should be dispensed by a Stranger— Grahame is a profoundly religious man, and
              therefore indulges in no sarcasms at the piety of the pilgrims— He is a republican,
              and palliates none of the royal perfidies which they experienced— He has a tinge of
              that enthusiasm for which they were derided, and which was one of their virtues— He
              disbelieves not even witchcraft. He admires <persRef ref="vane-henry">Sir Henry

              a kindly feeling even for <persRef ref="cromwell-oliver">Oliver Cromwell</persRef>. He
              says that <persRef ref="mather-cotton">Mather’s</persRef> Magnalia is the most

              the biographical portions of it, are superior in dignity and interest to the
              compositions of <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef>. I think this is overrating
              him— Yet Grahame freely censures his faults. He quotes from <persRef

              from Boston, and the Supervisors wished me to be present at the Survey of the School

              wished me to purchase his lot, but asked 500 dollars for it, which I could not give, I
              left them to finish the drawing of the line and fixing of the bounds— <persRef

              could perceive no mistake upon the plan, nor any thing which could account for the
              deficiency of more than twenty Acres of the Land, which there must be by comparison
              with the deeds— Deacon Adams promised to call upon me to-morrow, and look over my
              Deeds.— On returning I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller with <persRef

            <p><persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams</persRef>, called immediately after dinner,
              and with him I examined all the old titles of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father’s</persRef> Estate in Quincy, comparing them with the plans recently taken by
                <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey</persRef>—
              My first object in this examination was to ascertain how it happened that the Penn’s
              Valley farm, upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey’s Survey falls so much short
              of the quantity assigned to it in my fathers deed of 6 August 1803. I ascertained this
              error, which is chiefly if not all in the Deed— Before this Estate was conveyed to me,
              it was appraised at my fathers request, by my Uncle <persRef ref="adams-peter">Peter
                B. Adams</persRef>, <persRef ref="hall-john3">John Hall</persRef> and <persRef ref="brackett-james">James
              Brackett</persRef>; and they made the mistake— They estimated the paternal homestead then
              tenanted by <persRef ref="briesler-john">John Briesler</persRef> at fifty Acres,
              whereas it was only 35. and the place purchased of <persRef ref="u">Vesey</persRef> at
              48. which was only 46. They thus made 108 Acres where there were only 91—but the 7
              Acres purchased of <persRef ref="babcock-moses">Moses</persRef> and <unclear><persRef
                  ref="babcock-hulda">Huldah Babcock</persRef> still remain unaccounted for. I
                rectified in this examination also</unclear>
              <pb type="ms" n="305"/>some of my own errors with regard to the location of lands in
              some of the old Deeds. In a single instance, that of the Town River Saltmarsh, the
              Survey gives more land than the Deeds. In all the others there is a deduction— The
              loss on the mass of Surveys of my fathers property and mine is little less than 40
              Acres— The Deacon was here till after dark; and I read over to him the bounds of all
              the Deeds, which I did not already know; and he made most of them known to me— After
              he was gone I went with <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">W. C. Greenleaf</persRef> to
                <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
                Greenleaf’s</persRef>— I delivered to him my Letter to the Supervisors of the Temple
              and School fund, inviting them to call a meeting of the Ministers, Magistrates,
              Lawyers and Physicians inhabiting in the Town of Quincy, to determine what Arts and
              Sciences, and what languages besides the Greek and Latin shall be taught at the
              proposed School— This must be decided before the School-house can be built and even
              before the School can be established— I had also some conversation with M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf upon the plan for laying out the School-house
              Square in house-Lots— A project entirely my own, and for the event of which I have
              much solicitude— I executed and acknowledged before M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Greenleaf as a Justice of Peace, a Mortgage of two houses in Boston, as a substitute
              for that of the Penn’s Valley farm; to my father’s Executors— Read this Morning the

              of the book of the Law, that he rent his clothes.”— He read the whole chapter, and the
              Sermon was an exposition of the whole transaction recorded in it; the discovery of the
              Book of the Law by <persRef ref="hilkiah">Hilkiah</persRef> the High Priest in the
              reign of <persRef ref="josiah">Josiah</persRef>— Upon this very remarkable part of the

              asked him a number of Questions which he was not then prepared to answer— When
                <persRef ref="thaxter-anna">Miss Thaxter</persRef> was here she renewed the subject;
              and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dean’s Sermon answered most of the questions that I

              dined with us; and my nephew <persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef>. M<hi

              She died of a lingering consumption— The funeral prayer was made by M<hi

              but no male descendant from my uncle <persRef ref="adams-peter">Peter</persRef> of the

              and now his daughter. I had scarcely ever seen this young woman and I cannot commit to
              writing the thoughts which oppressed me while I followed her to the grave— The Lesson
              of the Scripture is in no case to despair of the Mercy of God— Let me not abandon my
              faith. I read this morning the third Chapter of <persRef ref="grahame-james"
                >Grahame’s</persRef> first Book, which completes the History of the Colony of
              Virginia to the end of the seventeenth Century— New England is the favourite Colony of
                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grahame, and the favorite Colony she will be of every
              honest, philosophical and religious enquirer after Truth, who shall search the
              fountains of American History— There was no magnanimous or consciencious purpose in
              the Settlement of Virginia— No spirit of Freedom. It was all mere adventurous

                >Barrow</persRef> upon Quietness and doing our own business— The doctrinal morality
              of these discourses is more obsolete than their language. There is a passage in the
              first of these Sermons in which he considers all discussion upon public affairs or
              public men an injurious and pragmatical in private individuals; and he quotes with

              Cent for his fees of selling the wood and collecting the money— One per Cent for the
              tax— Of the balance he paid me more than one third in cash, and gave me his note
              payable on the first of May for the remainder— I paid the Bill of William Spear who
              charged me 9 1/2 days Surveying for himself and <persRef ref="baxter-elijah">Elijah
                Baxter</persRef> each at 1 1/2 dollar a day— Exorbitant charges which I could not
              reasonably contest, as I had neglected to make my bargain before hand— I spoke to
              Deacon Spear of advertising my Penn’s Valley farm, for a lease; but he thought it
              would be best to wait until the Month of March— As the rain held up after dinner I
              walked to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>— His daughter <persRef
                ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> is confined to her chamber threatened with
              a pulmonary fever. My brother and <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef> came back with me, and they attended a
              Meeting of the Supervisors, at <persRef ref="beale-george">G. W. Beale’s</persRef>— I
              received a Note from my Son Charles, advising me that the Susan and Phoebe had arrived
              at Boston, and was at the Head of the Long wharf— I sent immediately for <persRef
                ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hubbard</persRef> the Sexton, and engaged him
              to go into Boston early to-morrow Morning; and to give me immediate notice when he
              returns— I read little this Evening. In the morning I had read the third Book of
                <persRef ref="grahame-james">Grahame’s</persRef> History consisting of one Chapter
              and containing the History of the Settlement of Maryland. He is very favourable to the

                >second</persRef> Lord’s Baltimore, and thinks the founder of the Colony of Maryland
              more entitled to the reputation of setting the first example of Toleration than
                <persRef ref="penn-william">William Penn</persRef>— He accounts well for the
              singular fact, that the Courtier quaker founder of a principality should have taken
              from a Roman Catholic Nobleman, the praise of toleration, and from the democratic
              puritans of New-England that of humane and honest dealings with the Indians.</p>

            <p>I called this morning at <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Whitney’s</persRef>, and informed him of the arrival of the vessel with the remains
              of <persRef ref="adams-george">my deceased Son</persRef>, and repeated the request
              that he would make a short prayer at their re-interment, with which he readily
              complied— About half past one <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Hubbard</persRef> returned from Boston: I went to the burying yard with <persRef
                ref="greenleaf-william">W. C. Greenleaf</persRef>; and after a short and impressive
              prayer by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney, the case containing the Coffin was
              deposited in the family Tomb— May a blessed and merciful God, accept the tribute of
              gratitude that I have been permitted to perform this last act of duty to the earthly
              ruins of my child! May I cherish the hope that this afflictive dispensation comes not
              as the first stroke of the destroying Angel, but as the discipline of a chastising
              hand? In this Journal was recorded on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April
              1801. the birth of this my first born Son. Desired How long, how anxiously! granted to
              fervent prayers after frequent disappointments. With what earnestness of hope: with
              what anguish of fear have we followed the course of his short career? How small a
              portion of his life was passed under the paternal roof! With what exquisite delight I
              have hailed the gleams of prosperous fortune, which so rarely illumined his path—and
              how have I grieved in Spirit at the afflictions with which it was so thickly beset—
              His heart so full of the kindliest affections! His Spirit glowing with the most
              exalted purity— A Soul abstracted from the business of earthly concerns, that it could
              not endure the contemplation of its own infirmities. Heavenly father let it have mercy
              before thee; and in the day of retribution let not my errors be visited upon my
              child!</p>

            <p><date>26. VI.</date> Thursday. Thanksgiving day. </p>
            <p>I rose at Six—lighted my candle with my flint, steel and match which I had brought;
              and then made my fire— Read three Chapters of the Book of Job, and wrote till I was
              called to breakfast. I went with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Brooks</persRef> to Meeting and heard <persRef ref="stetson-caleb">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r.</hi> Stetson</persRef>, from 1. John 4.19. “For we love him,
              because he first loved us.”—upon the love of God. A very ingenious and rational
              Discourse; with some passages of good writing. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stetson
              acknowledged the impossibility of our forming any definite conceptions of the Nature
              of God; and discriminated well between the ideas annexed to the term love as applied
              to our fellow Creatures and to God— In the text the Love of God, is resolved into
              Gratitude; but who shall mark the difference between the term love when applied to the
              action of God’s benevolence to man and the return of man’s worship to God— What means
              the word Love as applied from God to man— God created man— Is creation an Act of love—
              God created the world and every animated being in it— The beasts of the forest, the
              fishes of the Sea, the fowls of the Air and the Cattle upon a thousand hills. Love is
              therefore not manifested in the act of Creation. The Love of God to man, was
              manifested in the endowments bestowed upon man, especially in that of an immortal
              Soul— The benevolence of God to man is manifested by all the enjoyments of his
              existence by all the powers that he exercises, by all the hopes of immortality which
              he is permitted to conceive and entertain— For all this gratitude is doubtless due
              from man; and gratitude is a sentiment of the heart— But the love of man can make no
              return of beneficence to God— It can be manifested only in worship, in obedience to
              his will, and in beneficence to our fellow creatures— Man can make no return of good
              to God— He can neither add to nor deduct from his blessedness; but gratitude for
              benefits received is conformable to the nature of man, and is necessary to him for the
              enjoyment of them— Gratitude to God is therefore one of the blessings conferred by God
              upon man; and the Love of God, is no other than Self-love. The collection of Hymns
              used here has been collected by a man at Cambridge named <persRef
                ref="dabney-jonathan">Dabney</persRef>, and is apparently inferior to that of
                <persRef ref="belknap-jeremy">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Belknap</persRef>. The
              compilation of Psalms and Hymns has become a Bookseller’s job, and the consequence is
              that they become Sectarian books, and almost every Society has a different one— The
              Hymn How beauteous are their feet is omitted from this collection— I question whether
              in the whole collection there is one equal to it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

            <p>On rising this morning I found the ground covered with Snow which had fallen in the
              Night— I read and wrote as usual three hours till breakfast time, having come prepared
              for that purpose. After breakfast <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
              <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> came into Boston with me, and Charles
              with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef>—
                <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Quincy</persRef>
              called at Charles’s Office with a note from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">his

              him at Cambridge which I could not without inconvenience, and sending back the two
              Deeds I had sent him with some remarks. I went to the Branch Bank, and made my
              arrangements preparatory to my departure for Washington— Having applied to the
              purchase on my own account of three Gallery pews in the Meeting House at Quincy the
              sum of 168 dollars which I received for two years Interest upon the Note for
                <unclear>1600</unclear> dollars of the Parish Treasurer to the Executors of <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>; I now allowed interest upon it from the 5<hi

              deposited 169:50 to the credit of the Executors— I then by a transfer of 600 dollars
              from the credit of the Executors, to that of my private account, borrowed that sum for
              which I left with my Son Charles a Note upon interest for 600 dollars to be delivered
              to my Co-executor M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy—and I then drew by a Check 400
              dollars from my private credit, to pay off my outstanding Bills and debts here, and
              the expenses of my Journey to Washington— Thence I called at <persRef

              copy of the head taken of me by her father in 1825. She merely chalked out my dress
              intending to finish it as a work of her own. I came home to dine at Quincy; and
              immediately after dinner attended a meeting of the Ministers, Magistrates, Lawyers and
              Physicians of the Town, at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> Tavern, to determine
              upon the studies, additional to the Greek and Latin Languages, to be pursued at the

                Douglas</persRef> the occasional minister of the Episcopal Church— My Letter to the
              Supervisors requesting the call of this Meeting was read, and after some discussion, a
              unanimous vote was passed, advising that the additional studies should be those
              required for admission at any of our Universities; no pupil to be admitted but after
              an examination in reading, writing and arithmetic through the double rule of three as

              we executed a renewal of the lease to them of the Mount Wollaston Farm, for two years

              are still interrupted, but I resumed this morning the reading of <persRef
                ref="grahame-james">Grahame’s</persRef> History, and went through the first Chapter
              of the fifth Book being the History of the Settlement of New-York— On Tuesday and
              Wednesday Morning’s I read the two Chapters of the fourth Book being the History of
              North and South-Carolina, which is chiefly remarkable, as the experimental trial of
              the philosophical Constitution of <persRef ref="locke-john">John Locke</persRef>, and
              its signal failure—a Utopia realized. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grahame
              stigmatizes with great severity the character of the <persRef ref="cooper-anthony"
                >Earl of Shaftesbury</persRef>, and considers the reputation of Locke as somewhat
              tarnished by his connection with so vile a personage— He was grandfather to the author
              of the Characteristicks.</p>

            <p>Foul and Stormy day. Heard <persRef ref="whitney-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Nicholas Bowes Whitney</persRef>; this morning from Matthew 25.19. “After
              a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them,” and in the
              afternoon from Proverbs 22.2. “The rich and poor meet together: The Lord is the maker
              of them all.” I had heard a Sermon from this text on the 21<hi rend="superscript"
                >st.</hi> of June last from <persRef ref="young-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Young</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney dined with us— And
                <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>, who
              came out from Boston, and gave us the unwelcome intelligence that <persRef
                ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef>
              warehouse at the corner of Summer Street was this morning about four O’Clock consumed
              to ashes by fire. He said it was rumoured the loss of goods was to the amount of 20000
              dollars, and that he had only 8000 dollars insured— After the afternoon Service,
              Degrand had a long conversation with me upon politicks, and chiefly upon the question
              of whether it would be advisable to set up immediately <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> as an opposition candidate for the
              Presidency— I repeated what I had said heretofore— That it would be well to wait, and
              see if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, would be brought forward by his own State—
              I did not think he would; believing that <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H.
                Benton</persRef>, had supplanted him in the popular favour of the West— Degrand
              thought that the Legislature of Massachusetts would nominate Clay, if I should
              recommend him. I told Degrand that I perceived no necessity for my interfering with
              the election— The present prospect is that <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
                >Jackson</persRef> will be re-elected without opposition, as long as he lives— As to
              his successor, if <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>, <persRef
                ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, and Benton should be the candidates, they are
              all political profligates; the principles of Benton being those of a highway
              robber—Van Buren’s those of a dirty intriguer, and Calhoun’s mere prostitution to
              popularity. To either of those men, it was desirable that New-England should never
              degrade herself by giving support. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay is far above
              them all in character, but if he should ever recover popular favour, sufficient to
              bring him forward as a Candidate it must be by some discontent raised by the
              mismanagement of this administration— This cannot happen for some time, and if it
              should happen, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s popularity must first disclose
              itself in the West— It will be time enough for New-England then to move. I thought it
              probable however that the approaching Session of Congress would give some new
              direction to parties, and that the Members in that Body from New-England, would be
              solicited to take their sides. At present it was impossible to foresee what would be
              the strife of party or who would be the combatants.</p>

            <p>I commence my preparations for my departure for Washington, with mortification at the
              thought how little I have done in the half year that I have been here— Should it
              please Heaven to take me away before I can return here, my affairs would be left in
              nearly as much disorder as they would have been six Months back; and amidst the
              blessings yet left me, the harrow is upon my Soul for the calamity that cannot be
              repaired— Enough— My Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> with <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> returned this Morning— May the blessing of
              God be with them! <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was here; and gave
              me an abstract of his account, leaving a balance of 950:35 due to me, for which he
              promised to give me his note— He spoke of placing his Son <persRef ref="adams-john3"
                >John Quincy</persRef> at the Exeter Academy and I promised to pay the expense of
              his board— I dined with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Smith</persRef>, <persRef

              was not at home. I saw however <persRef ref="curtis-noah">his father</persRef>, and
              spoke to him of an arrangement by which I may lease in the Spring the house in which
              S. Curtis lives, and from which he proposes to go out the first of September next— As
              there will be no prospect of leasing the house at that Season, I wished to advertise
              it in the Spring, in such manner that Curtis might remain in the house till he will be
              ready to go into the one that he proposes to build— <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter

              inform her of my intention to depart hence the day after to-morrow, and was occupied

            <p><hi rend="italic"><date>Day.</date></hi> I continue to rise usually between 4. and 6.
              O’Clock; average about 5. But after reading 3 Chapters of the Bible, the coldness of
              the Season has compelled me to substitute reading instead of writing until breakfast.
              I have the last fortnight read a chapter of <persRef ref="grahame-james"
                >Grahame’s</persRef> History every Morning. We now breakfast between 8 and 9. We
              dine at two— Have tea at six or seven—and between nine and ten I retire to bed. The
              unpacking of my library received from Boston has been completed; but I have been
              obliged to put them up as they came from the boxes; they are in great disorder and no
              catalogue of them has been made— The details of the household absorb no small portion
              of my time— Many of my books entice away here and there an occasional hour— The plans
              of my Surveys— The Title Deeds of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>
              Estates— The disposal of my farms and the Administration of my father’s, <persRef

                >T. Boylston’s</persRef> Estates, with transient visitors and occasional
              interruptions have brought me to the time of my necessary departure for Washington.—
              If my life and health are spared; I pray that I may be enabled to give a better
              account of the next Season, here.</p>
