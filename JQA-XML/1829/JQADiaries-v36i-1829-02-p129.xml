						<p><date>8. V.</date> Sunday— Rain</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef>—from John 4.20. “Our fathers worshipped in this
							mountain, and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to
							worship”— The discourse was upon religious discord, and gave a striking
							picture of the rancorous spirit of hostility which existed between the
							Jews and the Samaritans. He did not however consider it historically,
							but merely as a religious feud upon the question where should be the
							place of worship— And he said that the dissensions among Christians now,
							were quite as frivolous, being not indeed on the <hi rend="italic"
								>where</hi>, but on the <hi rend="italic">how</hi>, the Creator
							should be worshipped. This subject would furnish a text for an
							impressive political discourse— The religious dissensions between the
							Jews and the Samaritans were consequent upon their political division—
							It was <persRef ref="jeroboam">Jeroboam</persRef> the son of <persRef
								ref="nebat">Nebat</persRef>, who after the revolt of the ten tribes
							from the House of David, set up the golden Calves in Bethel and in Dan,
							and made priests of the lowest of the people, and established a
							heretical, semi-idolatrous worship in Samaria, to prevent the ten tribes
							from returning to their subjection to the descendants of <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef>. It was one of the consequences of the
							division of the kingdom—the Temple of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>, and the Ark of the Covenant remaining at
							Jerusalem— The immediate cause of the revolt was heavy taxation
							occasioned by the disorders and extravagance of the Old Age of Solomon—
							The wars that followed the division were sectional, and sectarian; and
							finally terminated in the conquest and captivity of both parties— The
							kingdom of Israel by <persRef ref="shalmaneser-iii"
								>Shalmaneser</persRef> king of Assyria, and afterwards that of Judah
							by <persRef ref="nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</persRef> king of
							Babylon. The details of the History from the division to the conquest
							would yield a fund of valuable matter for a political Dissertation, and
							illustrate the value and importance of Union— I will take it up if I
							have leisure hereafter— The storm of rain continued through the whole of
							this day— There was no afternoon service at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church.— I occupied the leisure of the day in
							preparing a Message to the Senate with army Nominations, and in signing
							Land-grants of which 11    were sent me from the Land Office yesterday—
							I received also a Note with a list of nominations from the <persRef

							said there was not, to his knowledge— He spoke of the Polytheism of
							Christianity— I told him there was no Polytheism in any sect of
							Christianity, and in proof of it read to him the Athanasian creed, of

								Lowrie</persRef> the Secretary of the Senate, brought me three

							Maine, one advising and consenting to two Indian Treaties which had been

								<persRef ref="smith-nathan">Nathan Smith</persRef> as District

							sent me only a printed Copy of them by a new Rule, which they have
							adopted at this Session. I said they should at least send back those
							Treaties which had been sent to them before they had adopted their
							rule.— <persRef ref="wallace-james">Dr Wallace</persRef> was here I

						<p>There was again a heavy fall of Snow this morning, the third that we have

							the Secretary of the Senate for a copy of the Executive Journal of that
							body, for the present Session of Congress; which he said he thought

							shall be out of office— A young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Taylor</persRef> from New-York who has been applying here for a
							purser’s commission came and said he would give up the pursuit and go
							home— I advised him rather to leave his name on the Register of

							and his Son in Law <persRef ref="greene-benjamin2">M<hi

							appointment of the Warden would be given to the President alone. And he

							that if the appointment should fall to me, I would duly consider his

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church, <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi

							“Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I
							make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.” It was the first of a Series
							of Discourses upon the moral influence of Christianity upon the world.
							The text is not so opposite to the Doctrine as many others which might
							have been selected; but the Sermon itself was of a high order of
							composition— It was indeed upon the same Subject on which I had heard
							two or three Sermons of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow before—
							They are powerful in reasoning and Eloquence, but sometimes perhaps too
							Sectarian— He this day attributed the difference between the political
							character of our Revolution and History, and that of the new
							South-American States, to the Roman Catholic influence in that Country,
							and the Protestant predominance in ours. True, but perhaps not expedient
							to be told at this time and place— I asked <persRef ref="story-joseph"
								>Judge Story</persRef> to call upon me at four O’Clock— He came and
							I asked him if I could consult him as a friend upon a subject of deep
							importance to me— He readily assented, and as an evidence of the

							in my character he mentioned that in the winter of 1816–1817. he had
							earnestly advised <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef> to appoint me Secretary of State— I
							then related to him the present state of my controversy with the Boston
							Confederates, and my intention to publish in the course of the Summer a
							reply to their appeal— I said I wished to proceed in this matter with
							deliberation and advice— I had hitherto taken that of my friends here—
							Of this I should henceforth be deprived, and wished for that of a sober
							judicious and intelligent person, at every step I shall take. He said he
							would very cheerfully comply with my request— He said he had read the
							additional papers in <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Elliot’s</persRef>
							republication of the pamphlet, and had been astonished at the strength
							of the Evidence they contained in support of my charges— He regretted

						<p style="text-align: center;">The Month.</p>
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day—</hi></date> Much the same as last month.
							With the exception of two or three light Colds, my health has been
							better than for several preceding years. I have recovered much of my
							bodily strength, and only find the difficulty of writing increase upon
							me. This is a source of deep concern to me, as all the usefulness and
							all the promise of comfort before me, for my remnant of life will
							consist in the faculty of writing— But I must take the dispensations of
							Providence as they come— Thankful to heaven for the good Resigned and
							submissive to the severe. The month has been remarkable as the last of
							my public service, and the preceding pages will shew that the business
							of my office crowds upon me, with accumulation as it draws near to its
							end— Three days more and I shall be restored to private life and left to
							an old age of retirement, though certainly not of repose. I go into it
							with a combination of parties, and of public men, against my character
							and reputation such as I believe never before was exhibited against any
							man since this Union existed— Posterity will scarcely believe it—but so
							it is—that this combination against me has been formed, and is now
							exulting in triumph over me, for the devotion of my life, and of all the
							faculties of my Soul, to the Union—and to the Improvement, Physical,
							Moral and Intellectual of my Country. The North assails me for my
							fidelity to the Union—the South for my ardent aspirations of
							improvement— Yet bate I not a jot of heart and hope— Passion, Prejudice,
							Envy and Jealousy will pass— The Cause of Union and of Improvement will
							remain; and I have duties to it and to my Country yet to discharge— On
							the eleventh of this Month <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson</persRef> of Tennessee was declared to be elected President
							and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef> Vice President
							of the United States for four years from the fourth of March next— On
							the same day, the President elect, arrived in this city and took
							lodgings at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> Hotel. A
							self-constituted Central Committee, of persons pretending to be his
							exclusive friends and partizans, with <persRef ref="vanness-john">John
								P. Van Ness</persRef> at their head; undertook to usher him into the
							City: to order the firing of guns, and manifestations of public
							rejoicing in his honour, and to assume the Office of Masters of
							Ceremonies to introduce to him all his visitors. They continued to
							exercise these functions till the public disgust became <hi
								rend="italic">audible </hi><pb type="ms" n="158"/>audible— They even
							published a regulation of the ceremony of his inauguration, and
							proclaimed <persRef ref="towson-nathan">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Towson</persRef> the Paymaster General, and one of
							their own number, Marshal for arranging the procession to the Capitol—
							This however has since been given up— The President-elect, a few days
							since sent for Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Towson, and requested
							him to resign his Office of Marshal for the central Committee, which he
							did, and the Marshal of the District of Columbia, is to have the
							ordering of the Commission as has been customary heretofore. <persRef
								ref="jackson-rachel">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> having died in December, the General has signified
							his wish to avoid all displays of festivity or rejoicing, and all
							magnificent parade. He has not thought proper to hold any personal
							communication with me since his arrival. I sent him word by <persRef
								ref="ringgold-tench">Marshal Ringgold</persRef>, that I should
							remove with my family from the House so that he may if he thinks proper
							receive his visits of congratulation here on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of March. He desired Ringgold to thank me for this
							information— Spoke uncertainly whether he would come into the House on
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> or not; but said if it would be in
							any manner inconvenient to my family to remove he wished us not to hurry
							ourselves at-all, but to stay in the house as long as should suit our
							convenience, were it even a Month— He has with him his nephew <persRef
								ref="donelson-andrew">Andrew Jackson Donelson</persRef> with
								<persRef ref="donelson-emily">his wife</persRef>, a <persRef
								ref="eastin-mary">Miss Easten</persRef>, an adopted Son, named
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew3">Jackson</persRef>, and perhaps some
							others. His avoidance of me has been noticed in the newspapers. The
							Telegraph Newspaper has assigned for the reason of this incivility, that
							he knows I have been personally concerned in the publications against
							his wife, in the National Journal— This is not true—I have not been
							privy to any publication in any newspaper, against either himself or his
							wife— Within a few days another reason has been assigned— <persRef
								ref="hoffman-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David
								Hoffman</persRef> of Baltimore, urged me to attend the inauguration,
							and said, in that event he was informed it was General Jackson’s
							intention to pay me a visit— His reason for not having done it before
							having been the chance there might have been of his meeting <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> with
							me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold says <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean</persRef>
							the Postmaster General told him that he had conversed with the General,
							upon his abstaining from visiting me, and that the General had told him
							he came here <pb type="ms" n="159"/>with the intention of calling upon
							me, but had been dissuaded from it by his friends— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								ref="adams-john2">my Son’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail Adams</persRef> this day. As I shall be
							constantly occupied with public business until and including the third
							of March I shall not be able to leave this House until the Evening of
							that day— The removal of my Effects and the preparation of the House for
							the reception of another family have so much absorbed the time that it
