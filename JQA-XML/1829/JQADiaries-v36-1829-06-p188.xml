						<p>Convalescent; but not well enough to mount my horse— The day continued
							showery, with distant thunder and lightening; and damp with sultry heat—
							A young man named <persRef ref="u">Bryan</persRef>, came to solicit a
							subscription for an Apprentice’s library in the City. After dinner I
							rode with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> in the Carriage to the Post Office,
							where I found a Letter from <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore
								Chauncey</persRef>— The Season of the year has come when I cannot
							write in the Evening, and the Season of life has come when I can
							scarcely hold a pen— I wasted great part of the day upon my observations
							on parties, yet wrote very little— I have abandoned all thought of other
							composition. This Evening I read the first Book of <persRef
								ref="irving-washington">Washington Irving’s</persRef> life of
								<persRef ref="columbus-christopher">Columbus</persRef>, with which I
							am well pleased. It gives the early years of the link between the
							History of the old world, and of the new—is scanty of facts, and
							somewhat incredible as to the manner of his arriving in Portugal—but the
							narrative is entertaining traces with sagacity and judgment the sources
							of the discovery in the great navigator’s mind.</p>

							Hartford in 1796. and republished at Philadelphia, in a paper called the

							was, whether he had a file of the paper that contained those Essays, and
							could lend it to me— He said he was the publisher of the paper, and
							believed he had an incomplete file of it, which he would look up and
							send me. It was an experiment he had made just after he was of age, and
							which did not succeed. It was a paper published twice a day— A Quarto
							Sheet in the Morning, and a Newspaper in the Evening. But he could not
							keep it up more than one year— We had some further Conversation upon the
							Politics of those Times and the Revolutions of opinion since.— My parley
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Smith shortened my ride— <persRef

								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>, and with <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander"
								>General Hamilton</persRef>, would require great boldness of

								ref="walpole-horace">Horace Walpole</persRef> to seal up my
							Manuscript, and direct that it should be published not till 30 years

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh compared the proceedings in the

							more Independence, and more free exercise of mind in Parliament than in
							Congress—in which I differed from him— There is perhaps as much. We

							triumph of Columbus both arriving on the same day at Palos—his remorse
							and speedy death, leaving a dishonoured name while that of Columbus
							brightens from age to age; led me into a train of meditations upon human
							Nature— How many Pinzon’s there are of the human species in all ages—and

								>wife</persRef> and infant <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>daughter</persRef> at Meridian Hill—intending to return to them— My
							Son in a month or six weeks; myself perhaps next October— The parting
							from my wife was distressing to her and to me— The Afflictions with
							which we have been visited especially the last have so weakened us in
							body and mind that our dejection of Spirit seems irrecoverable— We
							parted with anguish that I cannot describe. We went to the Stage-Office
							in our Carriage, and took the 9 O’Clock Stage for Baltimore. It was 25
							minutes past nine when we started— We had two Ladies and one man as
							fellow passengers.— We dined at <persRef ref="merrill-john"
								>Merrill’s</persRef>, and arrived at <persRef ref="barnum-david"
								>Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel, Baltimore about half past four in the

						<p><date>13. IV—</date> Saturday— Philadelphia to New-York</p>
						<p>We took passage in the Union Line to New-York— At 6 this Morning we left
							the wharf in the Steam-boat Burlington, and after stopping at that place
							and at Bristol to land, and take in passengers, took the Stage at the
							Landing 7 Miles short of Trenton. I wrote to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> before leaving
							Philadelphia— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> came on board
							the Boat, and took leave of me. He was going immediately in the boat for
							Baltimore, intending to reach Washington this Night. At 20 minutes past
							8. we reached the landing, and passing through Trenton, Princeton, and
							Kingston arrived at New-Brunswick, at 1/2 past 12. distance 34 Miles— In
							passing through Trenton I had hoped to see <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>, but was disappointed— The competition in the
							lines of Stages, hurries them through so that they stop’d scarcely five
							minutes to change their horses at Trenton. But as there were only 8
							Stages waiting at the landing, and there were 104 passengers proceeding
							for New-York, the Boat after we left it came on to Bordentown, and
							thence came on in four more Stages to New-Brunswick— But we had to wait
							three quarters of an hour in the Steam boat Swan, which took us to
							New-York— There we landed at five in the afternoon. <persRef
								ref="wool-john">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Wool</persRef> was

							been found by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							in the afternoon by a boy named <persRef ref="waterbury-william">William

							in change and the key of his trunk. No language can express my feelings
							on remarking the point of time at which the hour and minute hands of the

						<p>There was a heavy thunder-gust in the Night, and several showers this

							visitors. <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> was out, accompanied
							by <persRef ref="dewindt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Wint</persRef>, a great part of the day; in search of a Carriage and
							pair of Horses, which he finally found and purchased. About noon, I
							walked out and visited my niece <persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">Caroline
								De Wint</persRef> at N. 3<unclear>1</unclear> Greenwich Street— She
							and her husband have been obliged to come to the City after having
							removed to Fishkill Landing, on Account of a Catarrhal Cough to which
							she is annually subject, and which they call the blossom Cold. It is
							much more severe in the Country than in the City. Her children are all
							at Fishkill Landing, and one of them has the fever and Ague. I visited
							also my old friend <persRef ref="mccormick-daniel">Daniel
								M’Cormick</persRef> and found him in good health, though very
							feeble, being as he told me, in his 85<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							year. He said he had been offered 40,000 dollars, for the House in Wall
							Street where he resides, but that a mere high price could not tempt him
							to remove at his time of life— I have known him residing there these
							forty years. The Street has in that time become the centre of all the
							commercial business of New-York, and the Banks and Insurance Offices
							have encroached on all the dwelling-houses down to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s, the only one which remains as
							I first knew it. The population of the City has in the mean time
							increased at least seven fold— <persRef ref="pitcairn-joseph">Joseph
								Pitcairn</persRef> came in while I was there. He lives in the City
							with a man named <pb type="ms" n="195"/><persRef ref="u"
								>Sessovis</persRef>, a German, to whom <persRef
								ref="sessovis-hellen">his daughter</persRef> was married when they
							were last in Scotland He also came in while I was with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick— I knew M’Cormick when he was
							not more than 45. and Pitcairn when under 30. M’Cormick must be at least
							20 years older than Pitcairn; but they are now both in the sixth of
								<persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> seven
							Ages— M’Cormick lingering in it from a life of prosperous celibacy, and
							regulated indulgence. Pitcairn hurried into it, by a life also of
							prosperous fortune, but of wild adventure and much vicissitude— He looks
							the most shattered of the two. <persRef ref="sullivan-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Sullivan</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Chauncey</persRef> spent great part

						<p>I was up just in time to see, from the Upper deck of the Steam-boat, the

							in sight of Point Judith: with smooth water, a clear atmosphere, and a
							cool light Eastern Breeze— We passed round Point Judith at 5. stop’d at
							Newport about 20 minutes to land, and take in passengers, and reached
							the wharf at Providence at 9. exactly seventeen hours from New-York. The
							distance is at least 200 miles. Several Stages were on the wharf, which
							took the passengers proceeding for Boston, where they must have arrived
							about three in the afternoon. I went to the Franklin Hotel; and there
							waited in the sitting Room till Noon. Meanwhile the Carriage and Horses
							were landed from the Boat, and the Horses had an interval of rest.
							Several of the Citizens of Providence called in while I was there. Among
							them were <persRef ref="knight-nehemiah">N. R. Knight</persRef> the
							Senator, <persRef ref="earle-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Earle</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillinghast</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Parmenter</persRef>, and <persRef ref="pitman-john"
								>Judge Pittman</persRef>. They all spoke of great distress and ruin
							among the manufacturers. Heavy failures happening every day. Among the
							rest a house named <persRef ref="wilkinson-david">Wilkinson</persRef>,
							owners of the largest Cotton Establishment at Pawtucket; failed for half
							a Million of Dollars— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knight told me that
								<persRef ref="fenner-james">Governor Fenner’s</persRef> Son in Law,
							named <persRef ref="mallett-edward">Millet</persRef>, who had
							unsuccessfully gone lately to Washington, to obtain the Collector’s
							place, had failed, and involved M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fenner to
							the amount of thirty thousand dollars. The distress and want of money is
							almost universal— Immediately after noon we left Providence, and after
							stopping 20 minutes at <persRef ref="hatch-israel">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hatch’s</persRef> at Attleborough,
							came at 20 minutes past four to Fuller’s Tavern at Walpole, where we put
							up for the Night— The heat of the weather was oppressive, and our horses
							being new and not used to each other were somewhat tried— I saw Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hatch who was complaining of the Times,
							and fearful of losing his Office as Postmaster. We dined after arriving
							at Walpole, and having a long Evening before me, I employed it until
							dark in writing to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, and in my Diary— This while I have any use of my
							right hand, is a never failing resource for giving wings to Time; but I
							have neglected taking a book with me, and thereby lose some hours which
							should have been made profitable.</p>

						<p><date>18. IV:15.</date> Thursday. Walpole to Quincy— Home.</p>
						<p>I rose with the Sun, and at a Quarter past six we left <persRef
								ref="fuller-stephen">Fuller’s</persRef>. Stop’d at the Post-Office
							five miles from his house, and left the Letter for <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> to be taken by the
							Mail from Boston to Washington. At a quarter past eight we came to
								<persRef ref="u">Bride’s</persRef> at Dedham, where we breakfasted,
							and at half past eleven alighted at my paternal Mansion in Quincy; which
							if it please God, is to be my home for the short remnant of my days—
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> and his family had
							left <unclear>it</unclear> in April— It was now uninhabited, and with
							scarcely any furniture in it. I determined however to take up my abode
							in it from this day. We went however to my brother’s House and dined. He
							had gone this morning to Boston, but came back to dinner. His family
							were all well, except <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail</persRef>
							who is suffering with a tooth-ache— My brother’s <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">wife’s</persRef> Mother is there; <persRef
								ref="harrod-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Harrod</persRef>;
							and a young man named <persRef ref="gourgas-john">Gourgas</persRef>, a
							lawyer in this town, came and dined with the family: he is engaged to my
							brother’s daughter <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>—
							After dinner we returned to my own house, where I propose now to pass
							the Summer, and hope to make comfortable for my wife in
								Sum<unclear>mers</unclear> hereafter— There is now barely furniture
							enough in it to enable us to pass the night here, with the aid of
								<persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Isaac Farrar</persRef> who rents the
							farm, and of <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>. They live in the
							adjoining farm <unclear>house.</unclear> My Son <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out from Boston this
							afternoon, and returned in the Evening— Elizabeth C.
								Ad<unclear>ams</unclear> called in; and <persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, whom I invited to come and keep house
							for me this Summer which she promised to do. I wrote a Letter to my
							wife, informing her of our arrival. There was kitchen <pb type="ms"
								n="197"/>and table-furniture in the house, with which we were
							enabled to have tea made in the Evening—and there is stabling for my
							horses, and room for my Chariotee in the barn. We made a short Evening,
							and retired early to bed. My situation here now strongly reminds me of
							that in which <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> first came
							into the same House in June 1788— I enter it with a feeling of deep
							solemnity at the responsibilities devolving upon me, and at the
							prospects before me. Almighty God from whom alone all good thoughts,
							words and actions proceed, be present with me in thy Mercy. May I never
							be forsaken of thee, and never forget or disregard my entire dependence
							upon thee. Bestow upon me a Spirit of Gratitude, of Humility, of
							Cheerfulness and of Resignation— Of Gratitude, for the numberless
							blessings which thou hast given me to enjoy, and which thou art yet
							heaping upon me from hour to hour. Of Humility to be conscious of my own
							infirmities, and unworthiness— Of Cheerfulness to be contented with the
							favours thou art pleased to bestow; and of Resignation to the
							Dispensations of thy Will. Bless and preserve the partner of my life—
							The children thou hast given us: my kindred, friends, and Country; and
							finally all my fellow beings of the human race— Grant me Health, Peace
							of Mind, the Will and the Power to employ the remaining days which thou
							hast allotted me on Earth to purposes approved by thee and tributary to
							the well-being of others, and to my own preparation for appearing in thy
							presence to give an Account of the Deeds done in the Body. It is not in
							Man that walketh to direct his Steps. Be thou, Oh Merciful God, my
							Guide. Give me Discernment and Perseverance in Life, Fortitude in Death,
							and the hope and fruition of a blessed immortality.</p>

						<p>I was up in the Night, unwell, and continued so all the morning of this

							He mentioned that <persRef ref="greenough-david"
								>Greenough’s father</persRef> was desirous of having the Busts opened and
							exhibited at the Athenaeum; to which I consented, as respected that of
							my father, on condition that the subsequent repacking of the Bust, and
							its delivery to me here at Quincy undamaged, shall be at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenough’s risk. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quincy spoke to me also of the present condition of the
							University, and of its funds and accounts which have been loosely and
							carelessly kept— There has been some controversy on the subject, and the
							spunge has been passed on loose accountability because persons of fair
							and estimable characters have been involved in it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy said he was now merely observing
							and acquiring information, intending to wait till after commencement
							before he should begin to put in operation his purposes of improvement—
							He added that he should be glad to receive advice from any of his
							friends, and particularly from me. He expressed an earnest desire to
							promote the cultivation of the Greek and Latin Languages, which I
							approved; and I recommended that the Art of Book-keeping, or of
							Merchants Accounts should be introduced among the studies of the
							University— He said he would propose it to the Corporation— <persRef

								<unclear>maker of</unclear> them all,” and in the afternoon from 1.
							Corinthians 10.31. “Whether therefore ye <unclear>eat, or</unclear>
							drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God”— The preacher is
							the Son of <persRef ref="young-alexander2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi>
								<unclear>Young</unclear></persRef> who was many years one of the
							Editors of the New-England Palladium, a newspap<unclear>er
								published</unclear> at Boston, and which commenced while I was
							practising Law there— The Son is <unclear>now</unclear>
								abo<unclear>ut</unclear> thirty, and writes well, according to the
							present Cambridge Style of compositio<unclear>n. Th</unclear>e Meeting
							House is that which was proposed by <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> donation to the town, and <unclear>has</unclear>
							been erected by the Parish— It is a spacious, neat, and elegant Building
							of the Gra<unclear>nite o</unclear>r Sienite Stone, <unclear>taken
								fro</unclear>m the Quarry given by my father to the Town. It is
							generally <unclear>in a</unclear> Style of pure simplicity; but its
							external appearance is now greatly disfigured by <unclear>a
								dark</unclear> moisture which has oozed out from the Stones,
							staining unequally their surface, and giving to the whole an appearance
							of dirtiness. This does not happen generally to the
								<unclear>Qu</unclear>incy <pb type="ms" n="199"/>Stone, and it gives
							much concern to the people of the Parish, who still entertain however
							the hope that it is only an effusion from the interior of the Stone
							which will pass off in the course of two or three years. The House was
							dedicated on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November 1828— The
							remains of my father and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>
							are deposited in the vault under the building which was granted to me by
							the Town and parish for the purpose— They were transported to it from
							the family tomb in the grave yard on the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of April 1828. It is not easy to account to myself for the
							mingled emotions which I experienced at Meeting, upon this my first
							attendance on public worship at this house— My Soul was humbled to the
							dust; and my heart distressed almost to convulsion— The reading of the
								284<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> hymn had some effect in soothing
							my agitation. <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef>
							and her brother <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> were

						<p>Ad poenitendum properat cito qui-judicat— I found this maxim this morning
							in an old pamphlet published in 1624. called a Plaine pathway to
							plantations; bound up with several others of the same date and among the
							rest with <persRef ref="winslow-edward">Edward Winslow’s</persRef> Good

							and <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Smith</persRef> went into Boston
							this Morning, with the Chariotee and Horses, one of which has until this
							day been lame from a hurt on the left hind leg, probably taken on board
							the Steam-boat. I visited again my garden nursery, and examined more
							particularly the desolation of my young trees. In the Summer garden
							cellar, there are several remaining, perhaps one third of those which
							came up in the two preceding Summers. In the Nursery there are not one
							in ten living. The severity of the last winter killed most of them and
							weeds have strangled some of those which had survived the frost— I found
							several with the roots of weeds coiled round them like Serpents. The
							Horse-Chesnuts are almost all living, and next to them the Apricots have
							chiefly escaped. Three or four Oaks only out of hundreds remain; and of
							the Spanish Cork-oaks, not one—but I find the dead stalks and leaves of
							many of them— A few peaches and plums of the last year have come up. The
							garden is otherwise in no flourishing condition, and there is scarcely
							any fruit of any kind, upon the old trees. <persRef ref="adams-thomas"

							home I found that John and Louisa Smith had returned from Boston, and
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> was also here. John

							brought me a Letter or note from me addressed to the judge of Probate of
							Suffolk County, declining to take out Administration of the Effects of
							my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, and requesting that
							Letters of Administration may be granted to Charles Francis Adams which

						<p>My Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went into Boston
							this Morning and returned again in the Evening. He took out this day the
							Letters of Administration upon the Estate of his brother <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, and brought out two of his
							Account Books, and some of the papers shewing the state of his Accounts
							with me. I rode one of my Horses to Braintree a round of about nine
							miles; but I find him a very dangerous horse for me, and that if I ride
							him it will be at extreme peril. Immediately before dinner, I planted
							with <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> a number of large
							Chesnuts which <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> sent me from
							the neighbourhood of Constantinople; but which not having been packed in
							sand will probably never come up. John planted also in the Garden some
							Lima Beans, which E. Wyer had been sent me from South-America by E.
							Wyer, in one of his former Voyages. The raising of trees from the seed,
							I find by three years experience to be so difficult and precarious that
							I shall abandon the attempt, except on the very small scale of my
							Nursery— The frost, the drought and the worm are three deadly enemies
							with whom it is in vain to contend, unless by a person always present
							and always vigilant. I had this Evening a long conversation with my Son
							Charles upon his prospects and purposes for his establishment, and for
							the future arrangement of my own affairs. He expects to be married on
							the first of September next to <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">Abigail
								Brooks</persRef> a daughter of <persRef ref="brooks-peter">Peter C.
								Brooks</persRef> of Medford. I have always wished that one of my
							Sons at least should settle in this place of my nativity, and of that of
							my forefathers for nearly two centuries. I had hopes that this would
							have been done by George— Those hopes by the will of Heaven have been
							extinguished—upon which my duty is humble and submissive resignation.
							John has no inclination to come here, and the circumstances of his
							family make it probable that his Settlement will be at Washington— I
							have transferred to Charles the Agency of my Affairs in Boston, and
							intend to charge him with my concerns here. My first object is to place
							my property in such a state that I may live with my family without
							encroaching upon my capital. The next is to build a house here, in which
							my Library my own manuscript books and papers, and those of my father
							may be deposited for preservation: but for the execution of these
							designs there must be much further exertion, meditation, perseverance,
							and above all a blessing.</p>

						<p>I marked the place of the Sun’s rising, at the extreme of his Northern

							wished to have no concern with any religious controversy: for that I

							different roads to the same end— He then told me that he proposed to
							publish an antimasonic paper at Patucket, and asked my opinion upon that
							question. I told him that until lately I had thought not unfavourably of
							the masonic institution; nor yet very favourably—but that having now
							become a subject of party dissension, I thought it mischievous and hoped
							it would be voluntarily given up: but that I was not disposed to

						<p>After breakfast this morning I walked with my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> to the hill opposite to the house,
							with the view of examining a site for erecting a house, which I propose
							to build if I can provide the necessary means. My intention is to adapt
							the erection of this house to the accomplishment of the second purpose
							of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> in his donations to
							this Town; the building of a Stone School-House for an Academy. The spot
							where I wish to build is in the rear of the lot of 8 Acres of land near
							the New Meeting House, given by my father to the Town. The situation is
							one of the most beautiful in the world, and the objects as connected
							together are of great interest to the public, as well as to my family.—
							But my designs are yet fluctuating in my mind, and I dare scarcely
							flatter myself that I shall have life and means to carry them into
							effect— I will not however prematurely despair—and I wish to proceed
							with due deliberation. <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">Lieutenant
								Governor Winthrop</persRef> paid me a Morning visit— I wrote to
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef> Secretary
							of State in behalf of the Weymouth importing company— Immediately after

								Curtis</persRef>, and afterwards upon <persRef ref="boylston-alicia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston</persRef> my
							Co-executor and Executrix of the Will of <persRef ref="boylston-ward"
								>Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Curtis exhibited to me a Statement of his proceedings in Execution of
							the Will, which appear to have been prudent and proper, and he advised
							with me concerning the further steps to be taken for the disposal of the
							property— There is land in various places to be sold— I agreed to meet
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis at <persRef
								ref="robbins-edward">Judge Robbins’s</persRef> probate Court at
							Dedham on Wednesday the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next Month

								Francis</persRef> Treasurer of Harvard University and <persRef

							Boylston put into my hands a small file of papers relating to the

							who are Shoemakers— One of them is now building a house in the

							belonging to me and adjoining the House where they live— His father
							wrote to me last winter to enquire if I would sell about half an Acre of
							my land there, and I postponed a determination upon the proposal till I
							should come here— In the mean time the Land was appraised at the rate of
							600 dollars an Acre which is too low. I told Curtis he should have half
							an Acre 8 rods front for 400 dollars— He said he would think of it. The
							two brothers were at work, and had five journeymen at work in the shop
							with them— I had some talk with them, and also with Harvey Field, upon
							the state of business and property in the town— The Curtis’s and Harvey
							Field are industrious and intelligent men. Field is a butcher, and finds
							other occasional occupations— He said he had been for two Months past
							keeping three or four fishing boats out, supplying the town with fish:
							but that the Season for that was now over— As we were walking towards
							the valley at the foot of Penn’s Hill, we saw on the Old Mill-Pond Hill,
							men at work erecting a new Stone School-House— G. W. Beale told me this

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lowell-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Charles Lowell</persRef> of Boston, from Matthew 6.28. [“]And why
							take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they
							grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 29. And yet I say unto you,
							that even <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> in all his glory was
							not arrayed like one of these”— The discourse was very short. The
							absolute unqualified character of this precept was noticed, and
							considered as applicable only to the disciples of the time of Christ
							himself. It was perhaps also specially addressed to the peculiar
							character of the Nation; at all times noted for greediness of gain— The
							moral doctrines of Christianity are generally founded upon an exclusion
							of selfishness— Love, Reverence, and submission to God is the first of
							Christian duties and virtues— To love his neighbour as himself is the
							second— The general precept therefore allows him to love himself as his
							neighbour, but as by the Law of Nature man loves himself more than his
							neighbour, to counteract this propensity the special precepts of Christ
							often seem to require of him to love his neighbour more than himself—
							Thus while his injunctions are so positive and so repeated against
							taking thought for the morrow, and against solicitude for the
							necessaries of life, the parable of the ten virgins, and of the talents
							and the frequent references to faithful stewardship, are equally strong
							and pointed in favour of Industry and frugality— In this passage of the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Matthew from the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 34<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							verse, the doctrine is not against Industry, <pb type="ms" n="204"/>but
							against avarice, against the accumulation of, against extreme solicitude
							for future wants— The allusion to the lilies of the field and to
							Solomon, is by way of illustration, beautiful in thought, striking to
							the imagination—presenting in pregnant contrast the profusion of
							ornament in the bounties of nature, with the utmost magnificence of
							human toil— But the precept itself is not in this similitude. Christ
							does not mean to tell his disciples that they should not toil and spin;
							but that they should not consume themselves with cares to hoard up
							treasures. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell’s afternoon Sermon was
							from 1. John 2.13. part of the verse— “I write unto you, fathers— I
							write unto you, young men.” Also very short— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lowell is labouring under ill health— His manner is very
							solemn; his voice strong and harmonious, but his elocution slow to a
							degree that loses all animation. The day was cold and showery. Returning
							from Meeting this afternoon, I found <persRef ref="sullivan-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Sullivan</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="sullivan-george3">his Son</persRef>, the late Cadet
							here— They left New-York yesterday: left the Stage at Dedham to come
							round this way in a Gig; went hence into Boston, and start again
							to-morrow for New-York. <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef>
							with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth;adams-abigail2">his two

						<p>I went up this Morning to <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef>, and he
							took the acknowledgment of a power which I executed to my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to receive dividends upon any
							United States 6 per cent Stocks standing in my name, and which he took
							with him to Boston— I spoke also to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greenleaf of my wish that preparations should be made for carrying into
							execution the second object of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> donations to the town of Quincy. the erection of
							a Stone School House over the cellar of the House in which <persRef
								ref="hancock-john">Governor Hancock</persRef> was born— I told him
							of my design to build a House on the brow of the Hill behind the Square
							given by my father to the Town, and that my means of effecting this
							purpose would depend upon the opening of the Square— I said I was not
							desirous of urging the erection of the School-house prematurely; but
							that the plan of it, and the estimate of the cost of building it, and
							also of the foundation necessary for supporting a teacher of the School
							should be made— I said it was not my purpose that it should cost any
							thing to the Town, but my intention was to contribute something to the
							accomplishment of the object myself, if I should possess the means— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf said he would call upon me, and
							take measures for having the estimates and the plans prepared— He
							proposed also to go with me to the Meeting-House, to view the side of
							the Wall to which the Tablet with the obituary Inscription, and the Bust
							of my father is to be adapted— I told him I should make enquiries
							whether the Tablet could be made of polished Granite— <persRef

							Minister at Jamaica Plains and <persRef ref="whitney-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Whitney</persRef> paid me a
							morning visit, and <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">William
								Greenleaf</persRef> in the afternoon. The day was cold and showery.
							I attempted to commence the breaking up of the ground in my Nursery with
							the spade and hoe, but was driven back to the House by the rain— Towards
							Evening I walked to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>
							and spent half an hour with him and his family. I read a few Letters of
								<persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand</persRef>; part of
							the Article in <persRef ref="leclerc-george">Buffon’s</persRef> Natural
							History upon the Cock—part of the Article in the Dictionaire Oeconomique
							of <persRef ref="chomel-noel">Chomel</persRef>, edited by <persRef
								ref="delamarre-l">La Marre</persRef>, upon the Treatment of fowls,
							and some papers of my father’s, the assortment of which I propose to
							make— I also made out a list of the Lots of Land which I propose to have
							surveyed. Charles says I have too many irons in the fire—</p>
