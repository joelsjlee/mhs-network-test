						<p><persRef ref="dawes-rufus;dawes-horace">Rufus and Horace Dawes</persRef>
							are Sons of the late <persRef ref="dawes-thomas">Judge Dawes</persRef>
							who reside at Baltimore— They came this morning, and <persRef
								ref="cranch-elizabeth">Elizabeth Cranch</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> returned with them
							to <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was
							here and spoke of the universal consternation of all the office-holders
							at Washington, upon the dismissions which have taken place within the
							last two days. A large portion of the population of Washington, are
							dependent for bread upon these Offices; and it is a proscription of
							which no one knows upon whom it will fall next— Every one is in
							breathless expectation—trembling at heart and afraid to speak— Some of
							the dismissions are deserved; from age—from incapacity—from
							intemperance—from irregularities of private life, and these are made the
							pretext; for justifying all the removals— The persons appointed are of
							equally various characters—some good— The greater part very indifferent—
							Some notoriously bad— On the average much less respectable than those
							dismissed— Among the last is the Postmaster—<persRef ref="munroe-thomas"
								>Thomas Munroe</persRef>, a man of excellent character highly
							esteemed; in whose place is substituted a <persRef ref="jones-william4"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>; of no character
							at-all— <persRef ref="sweeny-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sweeny</persRef> one of the principal Clerks is like wise dismissed—
							This operation upon the Post-Office is doubtless intended to serve as a
							foundation for others; and is of most mischievous tendency to the morals
							of the community— I rode this day to the Navy Yard, and Eastern Branch,
							the weather being pleasant and rather cool. I got through with the Fable
							of <persRef ref="simonides">Simonides</persRef>; but very imperfectly,
							much to my dissatisfaction, and taking in not half the ideas of <persRef
								ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaine</persRef>. In the Evening however
							I got through with <persRef ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Ode to
							Grosphus, as well as I believe I am capable of performing— In this and
							the Ode of Horace to Licinius I have succeeded so well, that if I could
							be equally fortunate every day it would afford me a useful and
							creditable occupation for my leisure— But there is a secret of
							composition which I cannot discover— The reason why I find the extreme
							difference in the facility of writing, one day over another— And the
							great difficulty is the standard beyond which I cannot rise; which
							however golden for the condition of life, is but a Saturnian age of lead
							for poetry. I wrote this Evening part of a Letter to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> in
							answer to two from him.</p>

							/>particulars of that fatal Event, the loss of my Dear, Dear Son
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>— I see the causes of it
							distinctly— The motion of the Stage and Steamboat in twenty-four hours
							had produced a fever, with a rushing of the blood to the brain— He had
							complained of it in the Evening: said he wished the motion would be
							great enough to produce Sea-sickness; and spoke of stopping a day at
							New-York to be bled— He had been pleasant and cheerful in conversation
							with several of the passengers in the afternoon; but got up in the
							Night, and spoke to two or three persons in a manner indicating a
							wandering mind— And thus walking on the upper deck of the boat; alone
							and in the dark; it pleased the disposer of all Events, to take him to
							himself— Blessed God! forgive the repining of mortal flesh, at this
							mysterious dispensation of thy will! forgive the wanderings of my own
							mind under its excruciating torture! have compassion upon the <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">partner of my Soul</persRef>; and bear
							her up with thine everlasting arm— Deep have been her afflictions
							heretofore— But this! oh this! stay thy hand God of Mercy— Let her not
							say My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken me?— Teach her and me; to
							bear thy holy will; and to bless thy name— Judge Cranch told me that
								<persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> arrived here, under arrest yesterday, at the suit
							of the Government— He was in the same boat from Providence with my Son
							and was returning to this City when he was arrested at Philadelphia— He
							was taken yesterday before judge Cranch, who committed him to prison,
							requiring bail to the amount of 5000 dollars which he was unable to
							give— <persRef ref="key-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. B. Key</persRef> was requested by the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> to assist the
							District Attorney <persRef ref="swann-thomas">Swan</persRef>, who is now
							absent in the prosecution; and told the judge they might perhaps require
							bail, to a larger amount— Judge Cranch brought home, <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef>
							went home with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye; but <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> W. S.
								Smith</persRef> came out to spend some days with her Sister— Human
							suffering can go but one degree beyond what she endures, and from which
							I humbly supplicate the throne of Grace that she may be spared— Last
							Sunday at Church, <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Laurie</persRef> read the 14<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Chapter of Job, with an impressiveness of manner which
							struck me exceedingly. How much more deeply is it brought home to me
							now— It was proper that some one of the family should go to New-York, to
							receive possession of my poor Sons effects, and to ascertain if it might
							be possible to recover his remains— I was desirous of going myself, and
							had so determined, but at the earnest recommendation of M<hi

						<p>Almighty and Merciful God; in the dispensations of thy Providence, it has

								Patterson</persRef> of Philadelphia, came out on a visit to
							sympathize with me, for which I pray the blessing of God upon them. They
							spoke to me words of comfort—from the holy gospel of God, and they
							kneeled and <pb type="ms" n="176"/>prayed fervently with me, and for me
							and my family— They also promised me to pray devoutly for us, in their
							own supplications to Heaven— A young man by the name of <persRef ref="u"
								>Keep</persRef>—belonging to Boston, came, and told me that he had
							passed great part of the last, and of the preceding Winter, and had
							attended most of the Drawing Rooms, but I did not recollect his person.
							He told me that he was a fellow passenger with my departed son, in the
							Steam-boat from Providence last Wednesday— That he himself had left
							Boston on Tuesday; but that the Boat of that day failed— And that in the
							Boat of Wednesday there were the passengers of two days— That George
							came in the Stage of Wednesday Morning, and embarked immediately in the
							Boat— That his conversation all the afternoon was cheerful and
							intelligent; but that in the Evening, he complained of a severe
							head-ache—said he wished the motion of the Boat, would be so great as to
							make him Sea-sick— He asked him, Keep, if he was coming on to
							Washington, immediately; and upon his answering that he was; said he was
							glad of it—that he would come on with him— That he had intended to stop
							one day at New-York, to be bled; but that for the sake of his company,
							he would come on immediately— That he had been for several days unwell;
							and that on Monday night after going to bed he had taken an impression
							that there were persons breaking into his chamber. That he had risen
							from bed, and made search; and although he found no person, and there
							was no person there; he had not been able to remove the impression from
							his mind— That his nervous system was so deeply affected, that he could
							not exclude the impression that the birds were speaking to him; and that
							the machinery of the Steam-boat seemed also, as if it was speaking— Keep
							said that this idea had sometimes occurred to himself; that it was like
							the sound of a person speaking; and George said it seemed to him, like
							the perpetually repeated words “let it be.”— That he had conversed with
							a missionary on board, named <persRef ref="jones-peter">Peter
								Jones</persRef>, who had Indian boys with him, and had given him a
							donation— That he had retired to his berth about the same time with most
							of the other passengers, but had got up and returned to bed twice in the
							course of the Night— That he waked a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker</persRef>, a stranger, and
							asked him if he had been circulating reports against him among the
							passengers— Upon his saying no George went with a Candle to the births
							of other passengers, and then returned to his own. That he finally rose
							about three O’Clock; went to <persRef ref="u">Captain Bunker</persRef>
							and asked him to set him ashore— The Boat was then going at the rate of
							16 miles an hour— Captain Bunker asked him why he wished to be set on
							shore— He said because there was a combination of all the Passengers
							against him—and he had heard them talking and laughing against him—
							Bunker’s attention was taken from this, by an accident, which
							immediately afterwards happened to himself in hurting his foot— George
							afterwards had some conversation with a <persRef ref="stevens-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stevens</persRef>, a Common-Councilman
							of Boston—who is now here; and who M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Keep
							said had told him that he would have called upon me, but did not know
							how he should be received; he being a warm partizan of the present
							administration. I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Keep to say to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stevens, that I should be much
							obliged to him if he would call. It was but about ten minutes after this
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stevens, when Stevens,
							seeing Georges Hat near the edge of the end of the upper deck of the
							Boat, enquired if any body had seen him within a few minutes— He was not
							to be found in the Boat— From the situation of his hat and Cloak, it was
							inferred; that in the wandering of his mind he had fallen overboard. It
							was too late for human help— The rest Oh! God! is only known to thee— It
							was thy will, to take him from the world, unseen by human eye; unheard
							by human ear— Oh! God! remember him and us in mercy; hear us on thy
							throne; and when thou hearest answer and forgive. <pb type="ms" n="177"
							/>This was a day of deep and dreadful affliction to the partner of my
							life; whose state of health is itself alarming, by the still flowing
							mercies of God, our reason has not deserted us, but imaginations wild
							and unsustained by reason come over us both— I walked this afternoon
							round the square at the back of the College, and in the deepest anguish
							of my Soul, saw a Rainbow suddenly spread before me. It touched my heart
							by no superstitious fancy, but by an association of ideas, as an
							admonition to trust in the goodness and mercy of God. </p>

							suffering under severe indisposition herself; and affectionate with the

							to-morrow the service of the Dead; in the humble hope that our Creator,
							will graciously condescend to accept it in behalf of our hapless
								<persRef ref="adams-george">Son</persRef>— I walked alone; two hours
							before dinner; to the Rockville Road thence to the Turnpike, and back by
							the way of the College— In this walk I meditated a prayer to God;
							believing that the severe dispensations of his providence, are intented
							for wise and good purposes; imploring him that his purpose in this may
							be known and felt by us, and that it may bear the fruits of blessedness
							upon us and upon our conduct— This is the temper of mind into which I
							believe I ought to be brought by this Event, and for which the grace of
							God is yet necessary to controul the depravity of my nature— I long to
							cast off the world; and would henceforth commune only with God, and with
							my own family— The Law of my members wars with the Law of my heart. I
							was not able effectually to accomplish my prayer and must meditate over
							it again— Oh! my unhappy Son! what a Paradise of earthly enjoyment I had
							figured to my self as awaiting thee and me— It is withered for ever— But
							let not murmuring or repining pass from my lips— I received a Letter
							from my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> written last

						<p>The perturbation of my mind is still exceedingly great, and my thoughts

							before this calamity; but hitherto without success— All the prospects

						<p>The health of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my dear
								wife</persRef> is suffering under the stroke, the full severity of
							which we have not yet felt— The mind is stunn’d by sudden and heavy
							calamity, as is the body by the infliction of a blow upon the head— The
							consciousness of pain returns with a renewal of sensation, and disease
							and infirmity of body come back with aggravation— I feel this sensibly,
							but it presses more intensely upon my beloved wife— She was obliged this
							day to take to her bed—had a severe fainting fit, followed by
							distressing perspirations, a racking cough, and a strong fever— I
							received a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>
							at Quincy, and one from <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet
								Welsh</persRef>— They were both consolatory— Harriet’s was addressed

							line of it attests the purity, the benevolence, and the cheerful Spirit
							of our dear departed <persRef ref="adams-george">Son</persRef>, it
							aggravates the burden of our irreparable bereavement— I rode on
							horseback before dinner; and again endeavoured to fix my wandering
							thoughts by composition. After my return home the <persRef

						<p>The heat is becoming so oppressive that I can no longer ride in the

							Manhood pass, And age, with furrow’d brow: Time was, Time shall be,
							drain the glass; But where, in Time is now?— Time is the measure but of
							change: No present Hour is found: The past, the future fill the range,
							Of Time’s unceasing round: Where then is now? in realms above: With
							God’s atoning Lamb. In Regions of eternal Love; Where sits enthron’d I
							am. Then Pilgrim, let thy joys and tears, On Time no longer lean: But
							henceforth all thy Hopes and Fears, From Earth’s Affections wean, To God
							let votive accents rise, With Truth, with Virtue live: So all the bliss
							that Time denies, Eternity shall give.</p>

								<persRef ref="isabellamaria">Donna Isabella</persRef>— But before
							his arrival here Don Miguel had assumed the Crown as King, but was not
							recognized by none of the European Powers— I had declined receiving him
							on the ground that Don Miguel being at all Events no longer Regent his
							Credentials as such could not be received, and reserving the question of
							recognition till the new Credentials should be received— These are now
							come, but the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> still
							suspends that reception of him— He says he is going to revoke
							immediately all the Commissions of the Portuguese Consuls; and that he
							himself to his great regret will be compelled to embark shortly on his

							his charge d’Affaires here unrecognized. He says that Don Miguel
							positively refuses to marry <persRef ref="maria-ii">his niece</persRef>,
							and that an inclination for a Bavarian Princess has perhaps some
							influence upon this determination— He told me that his despatches from
							his Government expressed great regret at the change of Administration
							here. But I incline to think that Don Miguel’s sympathies are with the
							Hickory broom. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade asked if there had

							readily agree to one upon the basis of equalizing duties such as we had
							proposed. I asked if he had powers to sign a Treaty. He said no—that his
							Government had thought best not to give him power to treat until they

						<p>When I rode out this morning there was a thick fog— I went by the
							Race-ground back of <persRef ref="pierce-isaac">Pearce’s</persRef>
							Mills, the fog gradually clearing away, so that precisely as I came out
							at <persRef ref="adlum-john">Adlums</persRef> corner, the Sun came out
							in all his power, scorching from the fog; and I had the rest of my ride,
							for a great part facing him— I came home heated and overpowered with
							fatigue— A man named <persRef ref="white-asa">Asa White</persRef> came
							with a petition, and a recommendation from a Lodge of Masons at Weymouth
							Massachusetts where he originally belonged. He said he was a
							boat-builder by trade and had been for some time employed in the public
							Service at Portsmouth Virginia; but was discharged last Summer; and is
							now without employment— He was apparently in great distress, and in some
							alienation of mind. His dress and appearance indicated no urgent want,
							and his petition was for an appointment, which I told him I had no power
							to bestow— I expressed a sympathetic concern for his suffering, at which
							he overflowed with gratitude— The cause of his grief additional to his
							disoccupation, he did not explain— After dinner, I rode out with
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">my Son</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							was here in the Evening— I asked him for the papers relating to my
							payments on account of <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J.
								Hellen</persRef>, which he promised to send me to-morrow Morning. He
							spoke of paying in certain bank stock, at the price which he had paid
							for it; though since depreciated. I told him I thought the Orphans Court
							would allow him for the depreciation— We have had several days of Summer
							heat which have brought on me an oppressive languor. </p>

						<p>I was very unwell all Night and this day—the first that I have been
							confined to the house, since the inflammation of my eyes at Ealing in
							1815— I took a glass of Epsom Salts before rising, and afterwards by
							direction of <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntt</persRef>, an emetic, the operation of which was sluggish, and
							kept me for eight hours in a state of debility, qualms and faintness in
							which I could scarcely walk stand or even sit up.— I wrote a few lines
							in the morning; but found it impossible to continue; or to resume
							writing in the course of the day; which was at Summer heat— After noon
							there was a very heavy thunder gust, which lasted about an hour, and
							cleared off cooling the atmosphere partially— About Sunset this evening
							I was relieved by the operation of the emetic but found my weakness
							still upon me, so that I returned to bed just after the dusk. This
							single day of indisposition; almost without pain has brought sensibly
							home to my heart the multitude of enjoyments and blessings with which I
							am favoured by the giver of all Good, and for which I am not duly
							grateful— The loss of any one of them immediately makes its value felt—
							Health, next to conscious integrity is the greatest of them all—and in
							the loss of health how much is imputable to ourselves. I was able this
							day a little of Novels, and a little of Newspapers. </p>
