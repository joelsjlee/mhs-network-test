						<p>Heard <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef> from John 6.66.67. “From that time many of his
							disciples went back, and walked no more with him— Then said Jesus unto
							the twelve, Will ye also go away?” It was a continuation of the
							Discourse of last Sunday, upon the influence of Christianity; but with a
							different text— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow’s Sermon and his
							text, seldom have indeed much affinity to each other— He enlarged much
							this day upon the prevailing neglect of Christianity; and severely
							rebuked the Scoffer at religion—the Calvinist, and the Roman Catholic.
							He spoke with special indignation of the ignorant cavillers at Religion
							and said a man might be a great Statesman, and yet know nothing of the
								47<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> proposition of the first Book of
							Euclid. But who in such case would tolerate hearing him talk of
							Geometry. He was also very severe upon <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon’s</persRef> Old Age; and upon the Temple of Venus, and its
							1100 female worshippers at Corinth— His Sermon was near an hour long;
							and the subject is yet to be continued— <persRef ref="kirkland-john"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirkland</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef> sat with me. After the service I called upon
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>, whom I found sitting up, on his Sopha; but he
							has been again several days severely ill and confined to his bed— He
							looks ghastly and cadaverous; and I am exceedingly fearful that he will
							not survive the Winter. <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi

								Dickinson</persRef> with <persRef ref="southard-rebecca">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Southard</persRef>— In the afternoon
							I heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">Captain Hawley</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns read the Evening Service for
							Quinquagessima, or Sunday before Lent— He preached from Hebrews 5:5–10.
							It was a discourse upon the atonement— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley preaches none other. <persRef ref="hughes-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ball Hughes</persRef>; an English
							Sculptor, recently arrived in this Country, came and introduced himself,
							saying he had been a visitor to <persRef ref="coke-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Coke</persRef> of Norfolk; and had
							there taken a Bust of the Duke of Sussex. I attempted to pack up some of
							my books and papers, but found still much business on hand. I had
							evening visits from <persRef ref="wood-silas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Silas Wood</persRef> of Long Island, with <persRef
								ref="u">General Hunting</persRef> one of his Constituents— <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef>, who spoke of the
							resignation of <persRef ref="jones-william">W. Jones</persRef>,
							Collector of Philadelphia, which he requested me to retain till Tuesday—
								<persRef ref="strong-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>This day, <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef> of

							dispense with that formality. Very few therefore came out— <persRef

							and I rode on my horse, with Watkins into the City, and thence through

							turn of the Road, by which I returned over College Hill, back to the

								ref="u">Dulaney</persRef>, who first enquired whether I could inform
							him how he could see John Quincy Adams, and when I gave him my name,
							told me his, and that he came from Waterford, in Virginia, and was
							charged to ask of me a return of papers sent to me last Summer, and
							relating to the Post-Office at that place— He came with me to my House;
							and I gave him the papers which he took away— I resumed drowsily this
							Evening the writing of my reply to the Appeal of the Confederates— Wrote
							two short Letters, and received two from my Sons <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. I can yet scarcely realize
							my Situation— Hitherto I have prayed for direction from above, in

							The opposition to it has been altogether factious. The Bill passed the

							insisting that Tokay and Rhenish wine were much alike in taste, that I
							did not believe he had ever drank a drop of Tokay in his life. He had
							provoked this retort, by saying a few minutes before that he had never
							known a Unitarian, who did not believe in the Sea Serpent— As however it
							was at my own table, I made him some months afterwards through <persRef
								ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							employment— My Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Child</persRef> was suddenly taken with a

							was Secretary of State as Cook—and while we were in the President’s
							House, as assistant House-keeper— They married in 1819. and have no
							children. I could not afford to continue to them the wages I have given

							their remaining in the house in the same capacities which they have held
							while I was there— I gave them a certificate of excellent character
							which they well deserved, and President Jackson has retained them in his
							service. He told me that he had thought it necessary to tell the
							President’s nephew <persRef ref="donelson-andrew">Donnelson</persRef>
							that he was coming here, but that it was for the last time, as it had
							been represented to the President that he was a Spy of mine— But that

						<p><date>13. V:30.</date> Friday.— Ride— Call on R. Rush.</p>
						<p>The day was uninterrupted by visitors, and from an oppressive burden of
							business, I find myself transferred to a Season of total leisure; though
							with private concerns which ought already to occupy me with constant
							employment, but upon which I cannot yet prevail upon myself to engage— I
							have yet numerous Letters to answer, and my reply to the Boston
							confederates seems lengthening as I go. Before dinner I rode round by
							the Race-ground, and Capitol Hill into the City. In the Pennsylvania
							Avenue, I passed by <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, in his Carriage; on his way to
							Baltimore; and a last salutation passed between us— I stopped at
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard’s</persRef> house— <persRef ref="u">His nephew</persRef>
							told me, that he was this day a little better, but still confined with
							fever to his bed, and not able to see me— I then called upon <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> who
							told me that he had this day received the answer of <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Alexander Baring</persRef> to the enquiries
							addressed to him the last autumn concerning the negotiation of a loan
							for the Corporation of the City, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
							Company. The answer is rather encouraging, and the Corporation of the
							City have it in contemplation to employ M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush himself to go to England as an Agent to negotiate this loan— He
							says that <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> the
							President of the Canal Company told him that he was afraid from
							something that had fallen from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, that his disposition was adverse to the Canal;
							which if true will not promote his popularity here.— His appointments
							continue to contrast with his Speech to the Tennessee Legislature two
							years since— He then said that if Members of Congress continued to
							receive appointments to Office, corruption would be the order of the
							day— He has already appointed nearly as many members of Congress, as I
							did in four years— The last are <persRef ref="chandler-john">John
								Chandler</persRef> Ex-Senator from Maine, appointed Collector at
							Portland; and <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Thomas P. Moore</persRef>,
							member of the House from Kentucky, Minister Plenipotentiary to the

								H. Harrison</persRef>, superseded. An appointment carrying with it,
							the useless waste of a fresh outfit, Harrison having been appointed only
							last Spring; and having scarcely yet reached the place of his
							destination— Moore’s character and talents are inferior to those of
							Harrison— His integrity is problematical, and his only public service
							the servility of his prostitution to the cause of Jackson’s election,
							and the baseness of his Slanders upon me— <persRef ref="adams-abigail2"

							of <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">T. P. Moore</persRef>, as Minister

							could not give— His own title being only a lease for sixteen years— I
							took his note however and he is to bring me the assignment of his Lease.
							I walked before dinner, round the Square back of the College— The rain
							has made the walking very bad— I was called away from dinner to a man
							from Montgomery County Maryland who came to enquire whether I could lend
							him a few hundred dollars upon being made safe by a mortgage upon Lands—
							I had none to spare— I wrote to <persRef ref="plumer-william">W. Plumer</persRef>—proceeded with my reply to the
							Confederates; and finished reading the first Philippic of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>. I had already read the second—

							<persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef>, in which upon consulting
							this Evening the lives of Cicero and of <persRef ref="antony-mark">Mark

							motives for withdrawing from Rome, after the Death of <persRef

							which Antony was so incensed that he had threatened in open Senate to
							send men to destroy his house— The next day Cicero did attend, and
							delivered the first Philippic 2. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 709.
							Antony not being present, though the other Consul <persRef
								ref="dolabella-publius">Dolabella</persRef> was— The tone of the
							whole Oration is moderate—expostulating gently against the lawless acts
							which Anthony was committing and particularly at his giving out as
							manuscript acts of Caesar, his own violent and tyrannical deeds. It
							complains of the surrounding of the Senate by armed men, and of Antony’s
							threats of the preceding day. It approves the confirmation of Caesar’s
							acts and urges the restoration of the Republic— The composition is
							admirable; and the closing direct Address to the two Consuls Dolabella

						<p>A cold and blustering day. <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall</persRef> came out and brought
							back the part of my manuscript that I had lent him. He made a few
							judicious remarks, particularly advising me to leave out passages
							unnecessary to the controversy, and tending to multiply antagonists.
							This I told him was excellent advice, and I would avail myself of it—
							But how far must this be carried— The disunion project of 1804 cannot be
							fully exposed without developing the causes of dissatisfaction with
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> administration by which it was instigated.
							Most of those were well founded. I felt them deeply myself; and now on
							reviewing them, I think of them as I did in 1804. Shall I tell them— If
							I do there is another Hornet’s Nest that I shall disturb, and more
							controversy to be foreseen— If I leave it even for publication after my
							death, my children will be made to feel the resentments that it will
							kindle— They are feeling now the effects of those which have been
							stirred— Selfish motives admonish me to silence— On the other hand a
							great moral lesson to my Country may be taught by exposing the errors
							both of those federalists who conspired against the integrity of the
							Union, and of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson himself, and of
							his Administration— My present course is to write with the boldness of
							truth— I shall prune by the Counsels of Prudence. I replied to the

								<persRef ref="walsh-robert">R. Walsh jun<hi rend="superscript"

							very curious Letter of <persRef ref="vanrensselaer-jacob">J. Rutsen Van
								Rensselaer</persRef>, relating a Conversation of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">A. Hamilton</persRef>, in September 1800.
							the object of the Letter is to rescue Hamilton’s reputation from having
							participated in the disunion project of 1804. But it rivets upon him the

							should be killed by <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burr</persRef>— The Senate

						<p>It snowed nearly the whole Night, and this morning—the trees before my

								>Amos Kendall</persRef>, as fourth Auditor, of which he informed
							Watkins to avoid the inconvenience of his acting any longer in that
							capacity— It places him in a situation of deep distress for his family,
							which he deeply feels— He told me the circumstances of his conference
							with <persRef ref="branch-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Branch</persRef>, the Secretary of the Navy, on the day when Watkins
							was dismissed— Branch’s conversation was quite confidential; and all

							him particularly on the case of <persRef ref="phillips-isaac">Isaac
								Phillips</persRef>, whose recent appointment as Navy Agent, had
							given great dissatisfaction at Baltimore, and whose Commission, Branch
							said would probably be withheld— He asked Watkins what was to be done to

							should be done by a purser now there, which Branch approved— He desired
							Watkins to come to him at all times, when the business of the Department
							should require it, as freely as he had done with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard, and promised him every aid and facility for the

						<p>A man from Virginia by the name of <persRef ref="hove-francis"

							model of a bust of me— I rode my horse to the Capitol Hill and back
							before dinner—suffered much with the cold— In my conversation with
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> on Saturday, he said that he was in the Winter of
							1803 and 4. reading Law in the Office of <persRef ref="thompson-thomas"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, and full of all
							sorts of wild projects— That Plumer was a very weak man, without any
							steadiness of principle or solidity of judgment. I saw from this the
							soreness of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster’s feelings— His
							character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer is altogether
							incorrect— His feelings with regard to <persRef ref="otis-harrison"
								>Otis</persRef>, are not more favourable— He described as a man
							altogether selfish—without principle, and of very slender abilities;
							though he admitted that he had a certain kind of talent— He said that
							his great object was to tack the Hartford Convention upon the whole
							federal party; so that he might make them all responsible for his own
							acts— He added that he had no communion whatever with those who had
							subscribed the confederate Letter to me— In the National Journal of this
							day, there is republished from New-York Evening Post <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james">James A. Hamilton’s</persRef> Letter of the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

							in the Senate of New-York 31. January 1809. asserting almost in the same
							terms as I have used the projected dismemberment of the Union in 1804.
							the proposition to <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">General
								Hamilton</persRef> to take a part in it and his refusal of that
							proposal— I finished my Letter to <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, and resumed in the Evening the manuscript of my
							Answer to the Confederate appeal. This paper and the Letters I still
							have to write, leave me as yet scarcely time for reading more than half

							Sullivan’s Island near Charleston S.C. where he is to be stationed— He
							has been with us now these three Months, and is a very promising young

								ref="brutus-decimus">Decimus Brutus</persRef> in Mutina— <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> was urgent with the Senate to

							forbidding him to continue the Siege and commanding him to submit to the

							great emergencies of the Republic; especially in War, and most of all in
							civil conflicts” (10.) [“]Omne malum nascens facile opprimitur:
							inveteratum fit plerumque robustius.” He proposes honorary decrees to

								<persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>, on whom he
							proposes to confer immediately the rank of Propraetor: to <persRef
								ref="egnatuleius-lucius">Lucius Egnatulejus</persRef> Commander of
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Legion which had abandoned
							Antony—and to the Martian Legion which had done the same— The argument
							for giving Praetorian rank to Octavius Caesar is consciously feeble—the
							praise of him excessive, and it is not surprizing that it was blamed by
								<persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus Brutus</persRef> From a man of
							Cicero’s age and standing to a youth scarce out of boyhood it was
							ominous of the Catastrophe which soon followed— The boy betrayed him,

							measures of War— [“]Nam cum plerisque in rebus gerendis tarditas et
							procrastinatio odiosa est: tum hoc bellum indiget celeritatis”— The
							Sentiment with which he closes was flattering to his auditory, but it
							was half a century too late. Populum Romanum servire fas non est: quem

							Bray— Who begins by presenting his father and mother as odious and
							ridiculous characters and speaks of his own vices, and what he means to
							pass off for good deed, with equal indifference— The book is
							nevertheless interesting and abounds with keen observations, and
							ingenious reflections— Before dinner I rode to the Capitol Hill, and at
							the House where Congress held their Sessions, before they returned to
							the Capitol, I saw Persico’s Busts of <persRef ref="law-thomas">Thomas
								Law</persRef>, and <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Charles F.
								Mercer</persRef>, both finely executed, and excellent likenesses.
							After returning, and in the Evening I read the seventh Philippic of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> addressed to the
							Senate— There were subjects of debate proposed by the Consul <persRef
								ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>, and the tribunes of the People—
							But Cicero says they are small concerns, though perhaps necessary, and
							digresses from them immediately, to the War, which he wishes to be
							declared against <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef>— He
							censures the measure which had been adopted against his advice of
							sending to him a deputation— Calls it weak and dilatory, and very
							confidently foretells that it will be treated by Antony, with contempt
							and disobedience— After an exordium in which he expatiates upon his own
							interest in the preservation Peace, he declares himself against Peace
							with Antony as 1. dishonourable 2. dangerous. 3. impracticable. The
							oration consists of a discussion of those three topics. [“]Periculum
							minus est fugiendum quam turpitudo: tamen offendit animos majoris partis
							hominum magis.” He promises that he will not be backward; but give them
							all the aid in his power. Tamen etiam summi gubernatores in magnis
							tempestatibus a vectoribus admoneri solent.</p>

								Persico</persRef> was here, and took another sitting of about two

								ref="pelham-henry">Pelham</persRef>— The two Scenes of parliamentary
							canvassing, and the Letter by which the Hero announces himself a
							Candidate for the borough of Buyemall are perhaps well drawn. Very
							satirical; and no otherwise objectionable than as the writer represents
							himself in the transaction as a political cheat. The long dissertations

							and the deep solemnity of description applied to dinners and the

							Sections of the eighth Philippic of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>, which next to the second, pleases me the most
							both for composition and Sentiment of any of this Series that I have yet
							read— I proceed with my reply to the Appeal of the Confederates, and

							The Session of Congress at which the Embargo was adopted— There are two
							difficulties attending it; one to give an <hi rend="italic">impartial

							this day— <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> has sent me a set of the U.S. Laws and of the
							Journals of the Senate— I read over this morning the whole Journal of

							Senate, and one of the most important periods of my life— I read over
							also my own Diary during the same period—observe the feelings which
							agitated and distressed me at the time, and take satisfaction and
							comfort in the review— I find little to censure in what I did—nothing in
							what I intended— The Embargo and the case of <persRef ref="smith-john6">John Smith</persRef> of Ohio, were
							the prominent objects of the Session— <persRef ref="giles-william"

							of <persRef ref="pelham-henry">Pelham</persRef>, whose accomplishments
							at riding on horseback, and playing with Sticks are now exhibited—also
							at going through a drunken quarrel with the watch— I finished reading
							the Eighth Philippic— It is a general complaint against the feebleness
							of the proceedings against <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef>—
							The hesitation at declaring <hi rend="italic">War</hi> against him— The
							first deputation to him had failed. <persRef ref="sulpicius-servius"
								>Servius Sulpicius</persRef> the first of the deputies had died

							attempt to distinguish between a <hi rend="italic">Tumult </hi>and a <hi

							his friend—who had counsell’d ignoble ease, under a general commendation
							of Peace— To this Cicero replies with great force; and also to the

							passage contrasting the objects for which they are contending, with
							those of Antony— Liberty on one side— Robbery on the other. There is a
							sentence almost word for word the same with one of Jesus Christ in the
							New testament. “In corpore si quid ejusmodi est, quod reliquo corpori

						<p>I walked this morning to the Unitarian Church, and heard <persRef
								ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef> from Titus 2.11. “For the grace of God that
							bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.” A controversial discourse
							upon the scriptural import of the term <hi rend="italic">Grace</hi>—of
							which he explained five different significations— The word is not used
							in the old Testament— It is much employed by the Apostles, and
							especially by <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>— Its primary meaning is
							favour— The mystical meaning applied to it by the Calvinists, as a
							divine outpouring upon the elect is disputed by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bigelow, who commented earnestly upon the doctrine of his
							text that it appeareth to all men— He gave notice of the Communion day
							next Sunday— But from this time I give up my pew in this Church— On
							coming out from the Service <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>, told me he had a
							Letter from <persRef ref="conkling-alfred">judge Conklin</persRef> U.S.
							District judge for the Northern District of New-York, which he was
							requested to shew to me; and which he said he would send me. It is a
							defence of himself against some complaint of Official misconduct on his
							part— Walking home I found the weather oppressively warm. It is the
							first approach of Spring— I read the Ninth Philippic, which has a
							peculiar interest, from a variety of discussion introduced in it—
								<persRef ref="sulpicius-servius">Servius Sulpicius</persRef> the
							first of the three deputies sent by the Senate to <persRef
								ref="antony-mark">Mark Antony</persRef>, had died of sickness, on
							the way to Antony’s encampment— The Consul <persRef ref="pansa-gaius"
								>Pansa</persRef>, referred to the Senate the question of the honours
							to be paid to his memory, and Publius Servilius had proposed a
							Sepulchral Monument— <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>
							proposes the addition of a Statue of Bronze— The practice had been to
							vote Statue; only in cases where the Delegate had been killed, and
							Cicero cites a number of such cases from the Roman History, to which he
							always refers with a minuteness of memory as if it were to the incidents
							of his own life— He pronounces a splendid panegyric upon Sulpicious,
							mentions some interesting incidents of his illness and death and
							intersperses the discourse with philosophical reflections upon the
							honours conferred by the voting of monuments and Statues. He recommends
							a pedestrian Statue of Brass, rather than an equestrian, gilt— There is
							a fine moral reflection upon the comparative value of the monument and
							Statue in Section 6. and an energetic thought in the remark the life of
							the dead consists in the Memory of the living. “Vita enim mortuorum in
							memoria vivorum est posita.”</p>

						<p><persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef> came and finished the

							has taken infinite pains to finish it, and has laboured upon it with the
							enthusiasm of an Italian Artist. He has also the feeling of gratitude
							for the aid and encouragement I gave him, by employing him and
							furnishing him the design for the Pediment of the Capitol, which he has
							executed to universal Satisfaction, and for the subsequent contract
							which he has obtained for two Colossal Statues emblematical of Peace and
							War, which was authorised by an Act of Congress passed the last day of
							the late Session— The last Official Act that I performed was the
							conclusion with him of that contract— I am gratified at having a Bust of
							myself made by him, because he is a very superior Artist, and because it
							will be the most perfect resemblance of me, which my Children will
							possess when I am gone. I regret that there is no Bust of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> taken while he lived, and which
							I can admire as a work of Art— That of <persRef ref="binon-john"
								>Binon</persRef> now in Faneuil Hall is not bad; but it represents
							him in a high collar’d Coat, and looks as if he had no Neck. Persico
							asked leave to cast his bust of me here, to which I readily consented— I
							read while I was sitting to him, some further Chapters of <persRef
								ref="pelham-henry">Pelham</persRef>; the interest of which book is
							much sustained by the variety of the incidents and characters and the
							shortness of the chapters. But as in most of the modern novels there is
							a mysterious personage introduced, always in agony from a secret cause,
							and whose character and conduct are pictures not of life, but of
							imagination— I read also half of the tenth Philippic. Wrote to my Son
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and walked to the
							City before dinner— Was caught in a drenching Shower as I returned—
								<persRef ref="pumphrey-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pomphrey</persRef> our Coachman left us, and thus one by one the
							members of our Presidential family, are departing, to leave us in the
							solitude of Retirement— I wrote a few Lines for <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary Roberdeau’s</persRef> Album— There is
							nothing that brings home to me with such humiliating conviction the
							barrenness of my invention, as the calls of my fair young friends for
							these little pushpin contributions. I received also this Evening a
							Letter from <persRef ref="walsh-robert">Robert Walsh</persRef>, with
							remarks upon the epitaph I had sent him, and with some observations,
							which deserve reflection. And I wrote to <persRef ref="randolph-thomas2"

							of 17. February last.</p>

							and was musing as I rode upon the construction of half a dozen Elegiac
							Stanza’s to versify a Similitude upon Corinthian Brass— I accomplished
							it in part; and very much to my dissatisfaction— It is with poetry as

							and retirement to private Life— After fourteen years of incessant and
							unremitted employment, I have passed to a life of total leisure—and from
							living in a constant crowd to a life of almost total Solitude— I have
							continued as yet however to be much engaged with writing— Some Letters,
							and my Reply to the Appeal of the Confederates absorb my time. I rise
							between five and six— Write till nine— Breakfast— Read the Newspapers,
							the Philippics, Pelham, Senate Journals, Documents and my own Diary, and
							writing alternately till three or four. Walk or ride from one to two
							hours— Dine between five and six— Read, write or doze, from seven to
							eleven and then to bed— Here are my Stanzas upon Corinthian Brass—</p>
						<lg>
							<l>When Rome’s proud Eagles o’er the welkin sped,</l>
							<l>And bore her thunders through the fields of Fame</l>
							<l>They hurl’d the bolt at Corinth’s hapless head,</l>
							<l>And gave her Towers and Temples to the flame.</l>

							<l>Of Sage and Hero, bore the form sublime.</l>
							<l>And through the lapse of Ages, burnish’d still</l>

							<l>This in the furnace of affliction tried</l>
							<l>Sustain’d by dauntless Fortitude, the Mind </l>
							<l>Can unconsum’d the raging fire abide,</l>
							<l>Shed but her dross, and issue forth refin’d.</l>
							<l>Then by the hand of him who rules the Ball,</l>
							<l>From Virtues mould, receive her fairest form.</l>
							<l>Live through all Time, no longer doom’d to fall;</l>
