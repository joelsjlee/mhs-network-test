            <p>I was prepared to ride into Boston this morning at ten, but detained by a succession
              of visitors till after the Noon Bell of Quincy Meeting house had rung. <persRef
                ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis</persRef> first came
              with a bundle of papers, and his Letter-book respecting the Execution of <persRef
                ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. N. Boylston’s</persRef> Will.
              We went over together the abstract of the Will, which I had prepared and he mentioned
              the provisions of it which have been carried into Execution— He proposes one Exchange
              of a small strip of land at Roxbury, for an equal number of feet, with his brother
                <persRef ref="curtis-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph <pb type="ms"
                  n="226"/>Curtis</persRef>, for the mutual convenience of both Estates; and he had
              prepared a Deed to be executed by the Executors; but he had taken one of the printed
              forms of Deeds which will not suit the Conveyances to be made under this Will— I
              observed that there must be a form of Deed, adapted to the provisions of the Will, and
              to be used for all the Deeds which we may be called to execute— He proposed that my
              Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> should be employed to prepare it—
              The most essential point now to be accomplished is to draw from England the sum which
              has been received by <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">P. Vaughan</persRef>, for the sum
              recovered from the French Government on the claim of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2"
                >Thomas Boylston</persRef>— I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis my copy of
              the Will; to procure a copy of the probate upon it— The visitors who followed M<hi
                rend="superscript">r </hi>Curtis, came from motives of civility or of curiosity—
                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wick</persRef> is a foreigner from
              Gothenburg— <persRef ref="biddle-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                Keating</persRef>, daughter of <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">Judge
                Hopkinson</persRef>— It was so late when I reached Boston, that I had time only to
              leave a Card at <persRef ref="welles-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J.
                Welles’s</persRef>, to call at <persRef ref="cruft-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> E. Cruft’s</persRef>, and at the U.S. Branch Bank, where I received the
              last dividend upon my 6. per Cent Stocks, and gave the Check to Charles— I went with
              him and dined at <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.
                Brooks’s</persRef> at Medford. <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

                >Miss Phillips</persRef> were there. <persRef ref="brooks-ann">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brooks</persRef> much better, particularly in Spirits
              than this day fortnight— She urged me to stay over the Night, but I had promised to
              return home— She spoke of Charles’s Marriage, and requested that <persRef
                key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and I
              would then pass the Night there— Returning home I passed through Boston, and stop’d to
              pay a short visit to <persRef ref="hall-joseph">judge Joseph Hall</persRef>, who
              invited me to dine with him next Saturday. I got home about 8 in the Evening; wet with
              a shower and chilled with cold— Yesterday was at high Summer heat. The thermometer
              fell in the course of the last Night, about 30 degrees— I went to bed quite unwell</p>

            <p>Communion day. Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Whitney</persRef> from Ecclesiastes 5.1. “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the House
              of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
              consider not that they do evil” And in the afternoon from Philippians 4.4. [“]Rejoice
              in the Lord alway: and again I say rejoice.” The Communion was administered after the
              ordinary morning service; and the Sermon had reference to that Institution. It was
              upon the duties of a Christian in regard to his Deportment at Public worship— He said
              the expression keep thy foot, had allusion, to the practice in primitive times of
              putting off the Shoe, in communion with the deity; and referred to the command given
              to <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> at the burning bush— This may be questionable—
              The expression is in the figurative Style, peculiar to the writings of <persRef
                ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>. For the figurative language of Solomon, of <persRef
                ref="david">David</persRef>, of <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef>, and of <persRef
                ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>, all partaking of the general character of Eastern
              imagery have each a distinguishing mark of its own— And this difference it would be a
              suitable Sunday’s occupation to trace and mark out these differences. May I not
              undertake it?— I read this day <persRef ref="freeman-james">D<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r.</hi> Freeman’s</persRef> Sermons 3. and 4. of his new publication— On the
              character of a wise and amiable woman, and upon Old Age— This last gave me
              satisfaction—the other was too superficial— I began the Answer to a <pb type="ms"
                n="227"/>Letter from my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, but soon
              after returning from the afternoon’s meeting there came a succession of visitors, till
              the close of the Evening— <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">William Greenleaf</persRef>
              and <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price Greenleaf</persRef> were of the number—
              After a Night of severe Rhumatic pains, I was easier this morning, and recovering from
              them through the day.</p>

              here most of the day, but went towards Evening with <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth2">Elizabeth H. Foster</persRef> to a party at
                <persRef ref="marston-unknown3">Miss Marston’s</persRef>— We bathed at the wharf
              between one and two; and the Sun being out very warm the Lieutenant coming from
              Charleston S.C., observed that it would not be safe to incur such exposure to the Sun,
              there— The tide was coming up, but the wind was blowing fresh down the Creek— It took
              me 238 strokes of the arms to go down and 293 to come up from wharf to wharf. The
              effect of the wind therefore upon the water was much stronger than that of the tide— I
              this day removed for the purpose of my daily writing from the bed-chamber to the
              Library room in the farm-house; much less convenient and pleasant; but to which I must
              endeavour to accommodate myself. After dinner I took the Siesta of two hours; and
              answered my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> last Letter— Read part of
              the Correspondence of <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand’s</persRef> Letters, and of these three or
              four were interesting— The account of the dismission of the <persRef

              guards; and the criticisms upon <persRef ref="derabutin-roger"
              >Bussy-Rabutin</persRef>, and <persRef ref="derabutin-marie">Madame de
                Sevigné</persRef> were especially amusing; but I could not read without disgust the
              coolness with which this Lady tells <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Walpole</persRef>,
              that Bussy lived in habitual incestuous connection with <persRef ref="u">his own

            <p>There was a copious Thunder Shower this morning, and a light rain continued through
              great part of the day— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston
              and returned this Evening, and I was without interruption of Visitors— I commenced my
              daily occupation in the Library, and wrote there till dinner time— My task—Short
              Letters in answer to <persRef ref="lafayette">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La
                Fayette</persRef> and <persRef ref="lawrence-william2">W. B. Lawrence</persRef>; a
              minute in the Quarto Volume, Copy of the first Book of Braintree Town Records; and
              entries in my Cash Account Book— After dinner, returning to the Bed-chamber I read the
              remainder of the Correspondence of my Co-Executor <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel"
                  >Nath<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Curtis</persRef>, with <persRef
                ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef> and others— Charles brought me out one
              from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis, enclosing one just received from M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan— These papers have partly put me in possession, of

                W. N. Boylston’s</persRef> Affairs; but leave several questions still to be
              satisfied— I removed to the Library a part of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father’s </persRef>
              <pb type="ms" n="228"/>papers, and propose commencing to-morrow the arrangement of
              them. The work that I undertake must be pursued with steadiness and perseverance; and
              in its progress will require the exercise of other qualities—Prudence, Moderation,
              Justice, and an entire controul over my own feelings— Nor can it succeed without
              indefatigable Industry— These qualities, with continued health can be dispensed only
              from above; and all will be of little avail, unless my mind can be tempered to its
              subject; its vision cleared of obscurity—its weakness fortified with power, that the
              object of my affection and reverence may be known to future ages as he was; and that
              the narrative of his life, like his life itself may contribute to the welfare and
              improvement of mankind.</p>

              to Medford this Evening— I began upon the collection of minutes and memoranda
              preparatory to the biographical Memoir of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef>. I propose to devote henceforth three hours a day to that portion
              of my business— My brother reminded me that it is this day twenty years since I
              embarked at Charlestown, for Russia— I embark this day upon a more perilous, perhaps a
              more difficult expedition.</p>

            <p><date>6. IV:15.</date> Thursday.</p>
            <p>Proposing to write one page every day of the preparatory matter of my intended work,
              I began by collecting some of the Books which I possess relating to the first
              Settlement of New-England. Looking successively into them, matters of curiosity
              presented themselves, which absorbed the morning so that I was barely able to write my
              second page before dinner— The Volume, which I accidentally purchased at Berlin,
              contains three pamphlets, each somewhat rare, and all, relating to this subject—
                <persRef ref="morton-thomas2">Thomas Morton’s</persRef> Book, purports to be printed
              at Amsterdam in 1637. It is in three Books— The first giving some account of the
              Indian natives— The second a description of the Country, and the third is a disguised
              and mystified narrative of his own adventures with the Colonists. But it is told in a
              conceited and figurative Style, with interspersion of poetry, or rather of rhymes, <pb
                type="ms" n="229"/>and Satirical fictitious names applied to the principal persons
              of the Plymouth and Massachusetts Colonies— This Book is to be further examined, and
              compared with the other cotemporary publications, and with <persRef
                ref="winthrop-john2">Winthrop’s</persRef> Journal. I also looked into <persRef
                ref="mather-cotton">Mather’s</persRef> Magnalia, and read his Lives of the <persRef
                ref="shepherd-thomas3;shepherd-thomas2;shepherd-thomas4">three Thomas
                Shepherds</persRef>, the first of whom married the <persRef ref="shepherd-anna"
                >daughter</persRef> of <persRef ref="tyng-william">William Tinge</persRef>, and was
              my ancestor— <persRef ref="quincy-anne">Their daughter</persRef> having married
                <persRef ref="quincy-daniel">Daniel Quincy</persRef>, the father of <persRef
                ref="quincy-john">John Quincy</persRef> my great-grandfather, whose name I bear—
              Mather mentions several publications of the first and second Thomas Shepherd, probably
              not recoverable— He gives also an abstract of Instructions given by the second Thomas
              Shepherd to the third, upon his entering College, and says that he had received
              similar instructions from his father— They have much of the religious enthusiasm of
              the age; but are otherwise admirable— The quotation of Proverbs 14.23. is peculiarly
              impressive, and should be printed on the Memory of every man throughout life— After
              dinner, and the nap I read a few Letters of <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du
                Deffand</persRef>, and part of a book lately sent me by <persRef ref="erving-george"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Erving</persRef>, upon the antiquity and
              perfection of the Basque Language— I worked towards Sunset an hour with the Spade—

                Hardwick</persRef> came to speak of two strips of land which he wishes to purchase
              of me—one near his house which he has more than once mentioned heretofore; and one an
              angle of Saltmarsh upon the Mount Wollaston farm— He spoke also of the encroachment of
              the Sea upon part of the Beach of that farm, and advised me to have Stakes driven down
              to prevent it— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde</persRef> came to
              offer me three Acres of Saltmarsh for Sale and for which he asked 175 dollars, saying
              that <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> had been offered 200 for them. <persRef

              dig his Well in a dry time, September being considered the best Month for that

              joined her in the Indenture of partition of William Tyng’s Estate in 1661. by which
              the Mount Wollaston farm was assigned to her—and she gave it 48 years afterwards by

            <p><date>8. IV:15.</date> Saturday.</p>
            <p>I dined at <persRef ref="hall-joseph">Judge Joseph Hall’s</persRef> in Boston; and
              intended to have returned several visits there, but it was past eleven before I could

              was too late for visiting— At half past two I went to the Judge’s with Charles— The

            <p>A Hot Summer’s day, Heard <persRef ref="parkman-francis">D<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Parkman</persRef> of Boston; from Ecclesiastes 9.11. “I returned, and saw
              under the Sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,
              neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
              to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.” There is an excellent
              Sermon of <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne</persRef> upon this text, of which
                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman had perhaps unconsciously borrowed something
              in the composition of his Discourse. The text is one of those melancholy Truths, which
              abound in the Book of Ecclesiastes, and of which the experience of every age is the
              same as that of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>— But it is the exception and
              not the rule: and the Sentiment in this verse should be taken in connection not only
              with the next verse, but with all the remaining part of the Chapter— The moral
              conclusion from the whole is in the last verse— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Parkman’s afternoon Sermon was from Habakkuk 3.17 “Although the fig-tree shall not
              blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and
              the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there
              shall be no herd in the Stalls: 18. Yet, I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the
              God of my Salvation.” This Sentiment should be associated with the observation of the
              morning’s text— One is the Statement of a fact, constantly exemplified in the history
              of mankind, and if duly considered essential to the moral Government of the Universe—
              The other is the temper becoming the virtuous man, under all the visitations <pb
                type="ms" n="231"/>of Providence, to preserve a cheerful and rejoicing Spirit, and a
              firm reliance upon the God of Salvation. This is the duty of man, and it forbids
              yielding to despondency or despair— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman came home
              and dined with me; as did <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Degrand</persRef> who came out from Boston— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman

                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Parr</persRef>, which I have not yet seen— Degrand spoke
              of the Politics of State, and in the event of <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
                Lincoln’s</persRef> retirement, said the intention of the Republicans was to support

              of Hardwick’s <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>, and to whom he had given a Note for
              250 dollars— He said he had received no notice of the suit, and complained that it had
              been commenced in resentment against him, because he had advised his daughter to claim
              her thirds of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall’s Estate, instead of the provision
              he had made for her by Will which was limited to her widowhood— He thought a young

              demanded payment of the Note or a mortgage of his house for security; to which he had
              objected, without absolutely refusing it— His own Story made out an indifferent case
              against the Executor, and I advised him to settle the Note, and pay the costs of the

              Letters, among which one from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>.
              The morning was warm and sultry, but a North-west wind in the afternoon swept off all
              the clouds and brought a clear and cold Evening. I pursued my enquiries into the
              history of <persRef ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> family since their
              Settlement in this Country— I find them here, in respectable but subordinate standing,
              immediately after the first formation of the Town, but can trace them no further—
              Since then their births, marriages and deaths are ascertained: the old record book of
              the town exhibits them at various times in the municipal Offices, and the Will of the
              first <persRef ref="adams-joseph3">Joseph Adams</persRef> shews that he was a
              considerable brewer. The annals of the family are short and simple; but how much of
              human history; how much of happiness; how much of affliction has been enjoyed and
              endured by them in the century preceding my father’s birth of which nothing can
              henceforth be known. I shall collect all the little incidents concerning them that can
              be gleaned, and commit them to writing— They are records of humble life, but there is
              nothing in them of which a descendant need be ashamed. Cogita Majores, is the dictate
              of Virtue as well as of Nature— After dinner and the nap I read <pb type="ms" n="232"
              />a number of Letters from <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef> to
                <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>, which she has sent to me.
              Written from 1811 to 1815. and some of which deeply affected me— There are bundles of
              subsequent Letters till within a few days of my mother’s death—</p>

              me on Sunday at Meeting that his father was called unexpectedly to the State of
              New-York, and could not be here this day. M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Curtis came
              alone, but he had not received my Note of invitation, in which that to M<hi
                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston was enclosed— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
                M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Waterhouse did not come, whence I conclude my Note
              to the Doctor equally failed of reaching him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis
              brought out several papers, relating to the Execution of <persRef ref="boylston-ward"
                >W. N. Boylston’s</persRef> Will, and we attended the Probate Court, before and
              after dinner, at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> Tavern where it is held. I took
              out the Letter of Guardianship of <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward
                Nicholas</persRef> and of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas">Thomas Boylston</persRef>;
              but gave no Bond, the Will having directed that none should be required; and the boys
              having no property, until after the decease of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
              Boylston— The report of the Commissioners on the claim of <persRef ref="boylston-john"
                >John L. Boylston</persRef> awards to him 5000 dollars for his Services, from which
              is to be deducted the sum already advanced him by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Curtis— This award was received and approved by the Judge, who entered upon the award,
              an order for its execution, of which a copy was furnished to M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> Curtis— He also brought and we laid before the Judge an extract from the
              Will; concerning several bequests to the Inhabitants of Princeton to be paid after the
              death of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston— There is one of an Acre of Land, in
              perpetuity to be used as burying ground for himself and his descendants— There is some
              doubt whether they will accept this bequest; as it will impose some duties upon them,
              and perhaps an expence of keeping fences in repair; without corresponding benefit to
              them. The question was whether the Town could accept the bequests beneficial to them,
              and decline that which may prove burdensome. The judge advised that the copy of all
              the provisions in the Will relating to these bequests should be sent to the Selectmen
              of the Town, that the Inhabitants might be called to act upon them, as they shall
              think fit, and he said he thought they would accept the whole; so that there would be
              no question for him to decide— <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Petty Vaughan</persRef> in his last Letter to M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> Curtis, hints a proposal that the Executors of W. N. Boylston should take
              out here an Administration de Bonis non, upon the Estate of Thomas Boylston, that they
              may give him a full discharge for remitting to them the sum recovered from the French
              Government, in the name of T. Boylston— We mentioned this to the judge who declined
              issuing the Letters of Administration, and said he believed it was only Petty
              Vaughan’s wish to keep the money, of which he has got possession— M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis said this was rather a hard suspicion upon M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan, upon which <persRef ref="robbins-edward">Judge
                Robbins</persRef> said—Yes Sir, but the man has got no money; and he went <pb
                type="ms" n="233"/>away from here, three or four years ago, exceedingly embarrassed.
              Old <persRef ref="vaughan-benjamin">Benjamin Vaughan</persRef> would not do such a
              thing; but when a man is pressed for money— Here he stop’d; but the idea occurred both
              to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis and me that Judge Robbins’s thoughts were
              running upon Events nearer home, and other persons than the Vaughan’s— He said however
              that at all Events he could not issue the Letters of Administration; there being no
              Estate of Thomas Boylston, not administered upon in this County— Ward N. Boylston’s
              Letters of Administration with the Will of Thomas Boylston annexed were taken out,
              first in London, and then with an exemplification of the Will, in the County of
              Suffolk here; and the judge said, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Haven</persRef> the Register confirmed, that where an Administration was left
              incomplete by the death of the Administrator, the new Administration must be taken out
              in the same County, where it had been first granted.— Something was said about the
              property thus recovered, and the judge said he remembered having heard of the
              transaction in which it had originated—a Speculation in oil during the War of the
              American Revolution; in which <persRef ref="gill-moses2">Lieutenant Governor
                Gill</persRef> had been concerned, and which had been charged against him as
              unpatriotic— We met at the Court in the afternoon <persRef ref="loud-eliphalet">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Loud</persRef> of Weymouth, <persRef
                ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf</persRef> and <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel"
                >Lemuel Brackett</persRef>; who witnessed and took the acknowledgment of my
              Execution of the Deed of Exchange of a small strip of Land at Roxbury, with <persRef
                ref="curtis-joseph">Joseph Curtis</persRef>. The deed had been redrawn, according to
              the form I had proposed, and was already executed and acknowledged by Nath<hi
                rend="superscript">l.</hi> Curtis— I gave him an Account of a Charge of my Son
                <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, for drawing a Power of Attorney, which
                <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> had given me this Morning: M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Loud told me that he had received all his papers from

                  >Buren</hi></persRef> which he believed was in consequence of my having written to
              him. He said he would call some day and take the papers which he left with me. Charles
              came out this day before dinner.</p>

                Waterhouse</persRef> came and dined with us. He did not receive my Note of
              invitation for yesterday till yesterday afternoon. He has been spending several weeks
              at New-York, with <persRef ref="ware-elizabeth">one of his daughters</persRef>
              residing there, married to a <persRef ref="ware-henry2">Son</persRef> of <persRef
                ref="ware-henry">Professor Ware</persRef>. He visited <persRef ref="wolcott-oliver"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver Wolcott</persRef> at his Son in Law
                <persRef ref="gibbs-george">Gibbs’s</persRef>, and had much conversation with him on
              the Politics of former Times. He says Wolcott told him that all I had said upon the
              subject of projects of disunion, was true; but that he knew much more of the matter
              than I did. The Doctor told me also some of the particulars of the controversy now in
              progress between <persRef ref="holmes-abiel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Holmes</persRef>, and his Parish at Cambridge— He thinks the principal cause of the
              dissatisfaction given by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes to his people, is by
              the neglect of his appropriate Pastoral duties, by the devotion of his Time, to a new
              and enlarged edition of his Annals— A majority of the Society have dismissed him; and
              engaged others to preach in his place; but about one third of the Parish adhere to
              him, and he now preaches for them at the Court House— The controversy is breeding
              pamphlets— I lent D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse the manuscript of my reply
              to the Boston Confederates. <persRef ref="bussey-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Bussey</persRef> called with his Grandson <pb type="ms" n="234"/><persRef

              here; with whom M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bussey had much conversation concerning
              the Tariff, and his manufacture of broadcloth— I received an invitation from the
                <persRef ref="otis-harrison">Mayor</persRef> Aldermen and Common Council of Boston,
              to attend the annual Visitation of the Schools on the 19<hi rend="superscript"

              tax Bill for the year, amounting to 100 dollars and some Cents— He renewed his
              proposals to sell me three shares of the Quincy Canal, and also one of the Notes, but
              we could not agree upon the price— He said he had been viewing the ground of my fresh
              meadow to be brought over to English grass, and he thought it would cost 65 dollars an
              Acre, which for 20 Acres would make a sum of 1300 dollars; and startled me— He said he
              proposed to view it again with a man who had experience in reclaiming Land of the same
              kind, and would then see me again— <persRef ref="hobart-james">M<hi rend="superscript"

              and upon which there had been a difference of opinion between Stuart and me— Sully

              sleep, we should live together with him” and in the afternoon, from Matthew 1.18. “Now
              the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise”— Both these were controversial Unitarian
              Sermons, and that of the afternoon was an argument against the veracity and
              authenticity of the text— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney was not so dogmatical
              in excluding the first Chapters of Matthew and of Luke from the Canon of Scripture as
              I have heard the late <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

              gave reason to his hearers to believe that he concurred in the belief that these
              Chapters were spurious. There was a very boisterous child baptized by the name of

              Pictures on Canvas. He said they should be washed with a spunge of Chamois skin,
              dipped in tepid water every autumn; and covered with a black gauze in Summer: and
              should be suspended, so far from the Wall that the Air may circulate behind them— He
              mentioned also several precautions necessary at the time of painting upon Canvas and
              shortly after essential to the durability of the Pictures, particularly that one coat
              of Paint should not be laid over another till the first is dry, and that the picture
              should not be varnished till it has been at least six months painted— The Portraits at
              my house in Quincy have suffered already for want of some of these attentions, and
              unless better kept hereafter will soon perish— After finishing with M<hi

            <p><date>18. IV:30.</date> Tuesday— Charles 22.</p>
            <p>My Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> who was this day twenty-two
              years old went this morning to Boston, and came back to dinner— At four in the
              afternoon he went with the Carriage and Horses and <persRef ref="thomas-john3">John
                Thomas</persRef>, to meet <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
              who is coming from Washington— <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> is to come
              with her, as far as New-York, and Charles to go and join her there; leaving the
              Carriage and horses with John Thomas at Providence, and come from New-York there in
              the Steam-boat— A Heavy rain began about eight O’Clock this morning and continued the
              whole day— Charles went off in the midst of it—but it soon afterwards abated. I was
              confined all day to the house and Office; wrote two short Letters, and read a few
              pages of <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson’s</persRef> third volume, and
              most of the third book of <persRef ref="morton-thomas2">T. Morton’s</persRef>
              New-English Canaan. From the figurative Style in which it is written, I can but very
              imperfectly understand it. Why he wrote thus is not explained— The first of his three
              books is a very flattering description of New-England— The second an account of the
              Savage Inhabitants, and the third, a Satirical and Allegorical Account of the Plymouth
              and Massachusetts Colonies in which he gives an Account of their treatment of him. He
              represents it as very outrageous, but imputes it all to his revels and his May pole at
              Ma-reMount. All the other Accounts mention Morton has having been one of <persRef
                ref="wollaston-richard">Captain Wollaston’s</persRef> Company; but in his book not
              one word is said of Wollaston, nor is his name mentioned. The other Accounts all say
              that Wollaston’s Settlement was made in 1625. but Morton says expressly that he
              arrived in the Country in June 1622. and in the title page to his Book, first
              published at London in 1632 he declares he had ten years experience of the Country.
              Here is a historical problem to resolve, upon which much enquiry may be spent, much
              time lost, and after all, of what use would be the result? to confirm what <persRef

              small a hand that I have great difficulty in reading it— I did read about three

            <p>After breakfast this morning, I walked with <persRef ref="cony-daniel">judge
                Cony</persRef> to <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P.
                Whitney’s</persRef>; but he was gone to Cambridge and Boston, and <persRef
                ref="whitney-george2">his Son</persRef> told us that he was in the practice of going
              to Boston every Thursday when the weather was fair. Returning, we went into the
              Meeting House and afterwards into the burying yard. Judge Cony made an observation
              that the Wall pews should have been made to front the central aisles, the reason of
              which he explained. We descended into the Sepulchre where the remains of <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail"
                >mother</persRef> are deposited; and afterwards visited the Granit Tombstones,
              erected by my father to the memory of his Ancestors—<persRef ref="adams-henry"
                >Henry</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-joseph3">Joseph Senior</persRef>, and <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail3">Elizabeth Baxter</persRef> his wife, <persRef

                  ref="hall-susanna">Susanna Boylston</persRef> his wife— Upon this visit I
              observed, first that the marble slab fitted in to the Granit Stone over Henry Adams,
              and upon which the inscription is carved, is already broken at one corner. Secondly
              that the Stones of some of the other monuments are loosened, and call for repair—
              Thirdly that of all the old Granit Gravestones in the Yard, the inserted marble Slab
              upon which was the inscription is invariably gone. fourthly that those upon which the
              inscription is engraved on the Granite, the characters are so much effaced that they
              are illegible— The oldest grave stones in the yard are of Granite Those of the second
              age are of Slate Stone, and much thinner— There is an error upon the inscription of
              Henry Adams’s Stone, which says that the only one of his Sons who remained at
              Braintree was Joseph— There is evidence that <persRef ref="adams-peter4"
                >Peter</persRef> also remained here. <pb type="ms" n="239"/>Judge Cony expected that

                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale— It was then postponed on account of the
              weather, and this day I was engaged at home with my company. This also deterred me
              from going to <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">A. Spear’s</persRef> at Mount Wollaston, as
              I had promised— <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My brothers</persRef>

                Faxon</persRef> were here. I had examined all the papers of M<hi rend="superscript"
                >rs</hi> Thayer which her father <persRef ref="hardwick-adam2">A. Hardwick</persRef>
              had left with me—and found that although she had been treated very roughly in point of
              form by the Executor of <persRef ref="thayer-s">her husband</persRef>, the proceedings
              at the probate Office appeared to have been conformable to the Law. I found that while
              the Law gives to the widow when there are no children, one half the personal property
              in case of intestacy; and when there is a Will, allows the Widow to waive its
              provisions and claim her dower, it gives her with regard to the personal Estate
              neither the benefit of intestacy nor of the Will— This was M<hi rend="superscript"
                >rs</hi> Thayer’s case— Her husband had given her part of his real Estate during
              widowhood. She preferred taking her Dower—and thereby forfeited what the Will had
              given her of personal Estate. I bathed between four and five this afternoon, and swam
              from Wharf to Wharf and back in 15 minutes. <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Price Greenleaf</persRef> overtook me, but went to the
              beach to bathe— I walked over Mount Wollaston to <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">A.
                Spear’s</persRef>, but did not find him at home— Returned by the road— I finished
              the perusal of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> first manuscript
              Journal— It contains very few facts relating to himself— The most important of them is
              the notice of his contract with <persRef ref="putnam-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Putnam</persRef>, to read Law, under his direction two years— There are
              some metaphysical Speculations— Some self-examination and censure— Some vigorous
              Resolutions of study, and frequent complaints of dreaming away time. The Journal
              ceases immediately after he commenced the study of the Law— I wrote a single page of
              Memoranda, and find this work so irksome, that I almost despair of my own
              perseverance— I read also a few pages of <persRef ref="winthrop-john2"
                >Winthrop’s</persRef> Journal; <persRef ref="savage-james">Savage’s</persRef>
              Edition— Every step that I take in this progress, opens to me a new field of enquiry;
              introduces persons, merely enough to excite the curiosity to know more of them; and
              draws my attention to multitudes of Books, many of which I do not possess. The
              interest of Winthrop’s Journal is exceedingly increased by the Notes of Savage— But I
              perceive a necessity for drawing a boundary line around my pursuit—my time will else
              be all absorbed, in scrutiny and investigation without producing any useful result—
              After dinner I read some pages of the third Volume of <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas"
                >Hutchinson’s</persRef> History; and in the Evening, a few Letters of <persRef
                ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand</persRef>— I anticipated those relating to the

            <p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="cresson-elliott">Elliott Cresson</persRef>;
              accompanied by a young friend of his from Philadelphia by the name of <persRef ref="u"
                >Norris</persRef>. Cresson and <persRef ref="sully-thomas">Sully</persRef> are to
              depart next Monday from Boston, upon their return to Philadelphia— Cresson thanked me

              acknowledgment before— <persRef ref="niles-jacob">Jacob Niles</persRef> a
              tax-collector from Randolph called upon me with a tax bill of 33 Cents for the year
              1828 for a Swamp in that Town which he said belonged to <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef>. I paid the tax, and enquired where the Land was, but he could not
              inform me— He said he would ascertain and let me know—and gave me the names of the
              Assessors, from whom I propose myself to enquire— I received by express this afternoon
              a Letter from <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel
                Curtis</persRef> enclosing one received from <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty

                  >M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston</persRef>, Monday Morning, which I
              answered. <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef>, my Tenant upon the
              Mount Wollaston farm was here this Evening, and I promised to call down there again
              next Wednesday or Thursday. He complains of Trespassers who carry away Seaweed from
              the beach, and gravel, from the Half-moon, and who are such slim fellows, that nothing
              can be recovered from them at Law— He put one of them in Jail at Dedham, and after
              keeping him there a week was obliged to let him out, and pay half the charge and costs
              of taking and keeping him. I bathed between 5 and 6. and Swam from wharf to wharf and
              back in 15 minutes. I continued the examination of my fathers early Journals, which
              are scanty and few— Read some pages in <persRef ref="savage-james">Savage’s</persRef>
              <persRef ref="winthrop-john2">Winthrop</persRef>—wrote a page of Memoranda for my
              father’s Life— In the afternoon read part of a Chapter of <persRef

              Volume, and in the Evening several Letters of <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du

              the last moments of my life be free from self-reproach!— There was last Night an
              occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon— It happened from Midnight till one in the
              Morning; and having no Telescope here I did not sit up to observe it— But I rose this
              Morning, before four, and saw with the naked eye, Aldebaran emerged but close upon the
              borders of the Moon, and Sirius about an hour risen.</p>

              bear?” The Sermon was an ardent appeal in behalf of religious toleration illustrated
              by a history of the late Act of the British Parliament, for the emancipation of the
              Catholics of Ireland— The afternoon discourse was upon Justice, from Ezekiel 18.5.

            <p>I had a nearly sleepless Night, and this has been a distressing day— The fear of what
              is to come is still more oppressive than the memory of what has past— Let not my trust
              in God depart from me— I have no other trust— <persRef ref="humphrey-levi">M<hi

                ref="humphrey-zenas">Zenas Humphrey</persRef>, Surveyor of Highways in Braintree,
              and brought me a tax-bill for land of mine in that Town. I asked what land it was— He
              did not know. I supposed it to be land rented by <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey
                Field</persRef>, and for which he is to pay the taxes— But of this I am to enquire
              further. <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                Boylston</persRef>, came about nine this Morning, and passed great part of the day
              with me. We read over all the Letters from <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty
                Vaughan</persRef>, and I wrote a Letter to him which we all signed, and which M<hi

              consult with <persRef ref="towne-salem">General Towne</persRef>, respecting the Sale
              of part of the Lands there— Around the dwelling house at Princeton, there are near
              1600 Acres of land in continuity— The house with 600 acres, are bequeathed after the
              death of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston, in fee to the Grandson <persRef
                ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Nicholas</persRef>. The Executors as Trustees, think it
              advisable to sell part of the lands, and the 600 Acres adjoining the Mansion,
              bequeathed eventually to my ward, are to be laid off— I requested particularly the
              attention of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis, that they might be brought in the
              most compact form, and nearest proximity to the House, possible, with due regard to
              the quality and kinds of land to give the highest value to the Farm bequeathed; and he
              promised to give it. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston shewed me the account
              she had kept of the expenses of education, and maintenance for <persRef
                ref="boylston-alicia2">my two wards</persRef>— I desired her to continue the same,
              and to furnish me copies of the Accounts, which I as their guardian must settle at the
              Probate Office. We had Conversation upon all the other subjects to be acted upon in
              Execution of the Will— On most of which we cannot definitively proceed, until we
              ascertain whether we shall receive the funds in the hands of Petty Vaughan— M<hi

              with us, and left us about four in the afternoon— <persRef ref="harris-thaddeus">D<hi

              sell to Samuel Curtis, and upon which he proposes to build a house— I measured it also
              by my pacing, which I found to be three paces to the Rod—that is 5 feet 6 inches to a
              pace; precisely my own height. My measuring pace is however about 2 inches longer than
              that of my ordinary gate— I promised to execute the Deed as soon as practicable, but

            <p>Commencement day. I had received from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
                Quincy</persRef> an invitation to attend at the Exercises of the day and to take
              Coffee at his house; for which last Sunday I requested <persRef ref="quincy-josiah"

              occupied me to dinner time; so that I had no leisure to read. <persRef

                Father</persRef>— Of November 1755. I have it copied on the blank pages of a Book in
              which there is already part of his Journal—beginning with his Voyage to France in
              1778. After dinner I walked down over Mount Wollaston to the Farm, and had a long
              interview and ramble with my tenant <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus

              on the place, and which I believe would be judicious— He is anxious about the renewal
              of his lease, which has only a year from next Spring to run. I authorised him to make
              some slight repairs upon the barn, and to cut and bring me at his convenience some
              loads of wood—promising to take the other matters into consideration. I read a few
              pages of <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson’s</persRef> third Volume, and

              recovered from the accident from which he very narrowly escaped with his life— His
              daughter <persRef ref="greenleaf-mary3">Mary Ann</persRef> was with him, but was not
              hurt. My tasks absorbed the morning, but I could not write more than one page of
              Memoirs— I find myself sliding into digressions, which increase my necessary reading,
              and tend to swell my volume with extrinsic and superfluous matter— This propensity
              might be checked; but on the other hand the Life must not be a mere extract from
              Gazettes, or even from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> own writings—
              My plan will take its shape, if it pleases God as I proceed— <persRef

              information where or what the land was— There were two Assessments one upon me of one
              dollar, and one upon the Heirs of <persRef ref="quincy-norton">Norton Quincy</persRef>
              for 25 Cents— He said it was the practice to repeat the Assessments from year to year,
              without examining <pb type="ms" n="244"/>anew the location or value of Lands. That
              some years since the Assessment upon me had been for 25. Acres valued at 250 dollars,
              but he knew not where it was, and a dollar was more than three times too much for
              that, but he promised to make further enquiry, and let me know the result; and if I
              had been over-taxed to correct the mistake. I then went to Randolph, and found

                >Peter Turner</persRef> called upon me this morning, to speak about the lot of
              Woodland in question, which the Deacon thought it would be as well for me to give to
              the <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth4">widow</persRef> and <persRef

              of <persRef ref="adams-boylston">Boylston Adams</persRef>; but I told him it was not
              mine to give— We then spoke of having it resurveyed, the time for which will be in
              October or November— The Deacon advised me also to have the wood cut down, from some
              of my woodlots, and proposed to do the job for me himself; which I shall take into
              consideration— Finished bringing up the arrears of my Diary Index, from 2. May 1827.
              to this day— I went into Boston, and dined at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi

                >His partner</persRef> was there, and his men were at work upon a moulding of the
              monument, but they have not yet got the Tablet for the Inscription— I called upon
                <persRef ref="gray-francis">F. C. Gray</persRef>, with whom I had some conversation
              respecting the Historical Society and their Transactions. He gave me information
              respecting their Library, that of the Athenaeum, and the Ebeling Library at Cambridge—
              Met <persRef ref="webster-daniel">D. Webster</persRef> who said he was looking for

              At <persRef ref="watson-edward">Edward Watson’s</persRef> shop corner of Milk Street I
              purchased a Cameo-ring with hands joined, for a nuptial present, and two lamps for my
              morning writing— At <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office I left an
              answer to the invitation of <persRef ref="brooks-peter;brooks-ann">M<hi

              also came in and was going to Quincy. Miss Norton reminded me much of her mother when

              confined with a desperate cough taken last week, at the visitation of the Schools. He
              is eighty years of age, and bent almost double; but cheerful and pleasant in
              conversation— He shewed me in his bed chamber the Portrait of his Grand-mother and my
              Great-grandmother <persRef ref="edwards-abigail">Edwards</persRef>, whose maiden name
              was Fowle; mother of his father and of my Grandfather <persRef ref="smith-william4"
                >Smith</persRef>— He says she taught him to read, and he takes delight in looking at
              her Portrait. She died he says in 1761— He was quite concerned that his confinement
              had prevented him from sharing in the festivities of this Commencement week— At 6
              O’Clock I returned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster’s, where my Carriage

              was here— There was a light sprinkling of rain all the afternoon, and a steady copious
              rain at Night— I met <persRef ref="otis-harrison">H. G. Otis</persRef> this afternoon
              in the Street and saluted him by name in passing— Met also and spoke to James Savage;

            <p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas Bowes
                Whitney</persRef>, of the South Parish of Hingham, in the morning from Psalm 97–1.
              “The Lord reigneth; let the Earth rejoice;” and in the afternoon from Psalm 4.6.
              “There be many that say, who will shew us any good.” This M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> Whitney is a man of very good sense, and his Sermons are sensible
              discourses—but his voice is unmusical, his personal appearance is unpleasing, and his
              conversation is unpolished and almost rustic— There is however some pleasantry in his
              temper, and he is fond of relating anecdotes— He came and dined with us, and told me
              several, about <persRef ref="adams-zabdiel">Zabdiel Adams</persRef>, doubly <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> first Cousin; and long Minister of Lunenburg—
              After the afternoon service, I answered a Letter from <persRef ref="thornton-anna"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thornton</persRef>; began one to my Son <persRef

                7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the Sermons of <persRef ref="freeman-james">D<hi

              and one upon the advantages enjoyed by Christians over the antient Gentiles— I spent
              the Evening at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
                Greenleaf’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="greenleaf-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"

                >r</hi> Greenleaf gave me three Original Letters from my father, written to my
                <persRef ref="cranch-richard">Uncle Cranch</persRef>; the first dated 2. September
              1755— The earliest of my fathers writing that I have yet found—the two others in 1756—
              Also a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>, without date, but
              written before <persRef ref="cranch-mary2">my aunt Cranch’s</persRef> Marriage, and of
              course when my Mother was under eighteen— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf
              gave me two Letters from my father to <persRef ref="dawes-thomas">judge
                Dawes</persRef>, dated in 1813. and several Letters between my uncle Cranch, and
                <persRef ref="paine-robert">Robert Treat Paine</persRef>—and one from <persRef
                ref="quincy-samuel">Samuel Quincy</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Greenleaf came in possession of these Letters, excepting those to judge Dawes, as
              Administrator upon the Estate of my uncle Cranch. The three early Letters from my
              father, have to me a deep interest, as they relate to the perplexities of his
              situation, after he came from College, until he had finally fixed upon his profession.
              I read them, and most of the other Letters after I returned home. There is so little
              sympathy with my feelings, relating to all these memorials of my father’s life that I
              find myself called to distrust them, and to bear in mind the saying of the Grecian

            <p><persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> paid me
              a Morning visit, and I spoke to him concerning the obituary inscription, upon the
              monument to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail">Mother</persRef>. I thought it proper to consult him as the
              monument is to be at the side of his pulpit— He will call again to examine the
              inscription with which I am much dissatisfied, and in which I made this day several
              alterations and Additions— <persRef ref="adams-thomas">T. B. Adams</persRef> made a
              Copy of it, as it may be ordered on the Tablet— Notwithstanding the Critical Canons of
                <persRef ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef>, I
              have ventured upon a mixture, both of Latin and English and of Prose and Verse— D<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnsons objections to this union appear to me frivolous
              and pedantic— He might have been told that there is no more impropriety in the
              introduction of two Languages in an Epitaph, than in his affixing a Latin Motto, to an
              English Rambler. Nor is the purpose of Epitaphs, as Johnson considers them, solely to
              give information to the reader concerning the deceased— A higher purpose is to make it
              instructive to the reader himself— [“]And many a holy text around she strews, That
              teach the rustic moralist to die[”]— This is on common grave stones; the text is as
              extraneous to the name and years spelt by the unlettered Muse, as the Latin or the
              verse upon a Marble Monument— I propose to place over the obituary narrative, the
              Motto adopted by my father for his arms, from <persRef ref="tacitus"
              >Tacitus</persRef>—Hist: 1.16. Libertatem, Amicitiam, Fidem Retinebis; and to close
              the whole with four lines of English verse having reference to the same Motto.

                endeavouring also to give myself regularity of occupation by a distribution of my
                time as uniform as my present circumstances will admit. My task follows in this
                order— 1. Read 2 or 3. chapters in the Bible— 2. Write the Journal of the preceding
                day. 3. Write one Letter— 4. Write one page of Memoirs— 5. An hour of exercise. 6.
                Miscellaneous reading after dinner— This process is almost every day interrupted; by
                visitors, by visiting, or by small private business of my own. I guard as much as
                possible against the loss of the first and second points, and therefore take up them
                before breakfast— All the rest are continually broken in upon, and half the days
                thenceforth are lost—for every day that passes without the addition of a page of
                Memoir I account as lost— My reading is slow and unprofitable—my performance
                immeasurably below my purpose— I have only to implore Peace of mind—health—and
                perseverance.</p>
