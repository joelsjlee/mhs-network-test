						<p>The year begins in gloom— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> had a sleepless and painful Night—The dawn was
							overcast; and as I began to write my shaded lamp went out,
							self-extinguished; it was only for lack of Oil; and the notice of so
							trivial an incident may serve but to mark the present temper of my mind—
							But in every situation in which mortal man can be placed there is a line
							of conduct before him, which it is his duty to pursue; and the Season of
							Adversity, though depriving him of the means which in prosperity he may
							possess of doing good to his fellow men, is perhaps not less adapted to
							the exercise of virtues equally conducive to the dignity of human
							Nature— But in good or in evil fortune “It is not in Man that walketh to
							direct his steps”— Let him look to the fountain of all Good—let him
							consult the Oracles of God— I began the year with prayer—and then
							turning to my Bible read the first Psalm— It affirms that the righteous
							man is, and promises that he shall be blessed— This is comfort and
							Consolation—and points in general terms to the path of duty— May the
							light of this Lamp never forsake me!</p>

								White</persRef> the delegate from Florida, called and recommended

						<p>A man named <persRef ref="dutton-matthew">Matthew Dutton</persRef>

							crowded beyond all former example, and passed quietly off. From four to
							five I walked to the foot of College Hill and back; and witnessed the
							Cloudless setting of the Sun, with a feeling of hope and consolation—
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>, from 1. Corinthians
							10.16. “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
							the blood of Christ? The bread which we break is it not the communion of
							the body of Christ?” After the Sermon, the Communion service was
							performed, in which I participated— There is always something eccentric
							in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow’s Discourses— This day he
							supposed on enquiry why the propagation of the gospel, had not been more
							extensively successful: and answered in substance that it was owing to
							the internal dissensions among Christians themselves— But the form in
							which he exhibited this thought was bitterly satyrical— He supposed an
							assemblage of Heathens willing to be converted to Christianity, and
							enquiring what they must do to be saved? And then he introduced a file
							of sectarians one after another, Roman Catholic, or Episcopalian, or
							Presbyterian, and a Baptist, succeeding each other upon the Scene, and
							each expounding the peculiar doctrines of his own Church, and making
							them ridiculous— In the afternoon I heard <persRef ref="hawley-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s— He read the abridged Evening
							Service, for the second Sunday after Christmas omitting the Psalms of
							the day and the Lesson from the Old Testament— He preached from Psalm
							25.14. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will
							shew them his Covenant.” And he introduced his text with a very solemn
							admonition of the uncertainty of human life, and the moral certainty
							that of the very few of his hearers who had entered upon the new year
							there were some who before its close would be called to their great
							account— He gave out also to be sung the 129<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Hymn—</p>
						<lg>
								<l>Hasten, Sinner to be wise—</l>
								<l>Stay not for tomorrow’s Sun.—</l>
							</lg>
						<p>So be it!— <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> of New-York
							dined with us, and spent the Evening here— We had much political
							conversation— He is re-elected to the next Congress; but expressed some
							doubts whether he should come— He concurred with me that the two recent
							parties are both virtually dissolved— That of the Administration,
							irreversibly; and he Thinks <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> never can take a lead
							in the affairs of the Nation— In this I differed from his opinion and
							reminded him of the sudden and total vicissitudes of <persRef

							New-York—</p>

							and gave him some sheets of the first part of it— He said it would take
							a fortnight of time to print it, and I am obliged to precipitate the

							Memorial; but the Report and the Memorial have been laid on the table,
							on the motion of <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>18. VI—</date> Sunday— Snow-Storm—</p>
						<p>The Heaviest Snow Storm that I recollect to have witnessed here since
							March 1809. It began last Night and continued through this day till
							within an hour of Sunset when it cleared off and the Sun went down in a
							clear sky— I went to the second Presbyterian Church where I found six or
							eight persons assembled; but no Minister— I then went to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church which was also shut up; and
							I then returned home and read the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
								18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							and 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapters of Jeremiah— Also the
								15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 16<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Chapters of the second Book of Samuel and the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— I signed several hundred Land
							Patents and in the Evening began a Letter to my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>— I reflected further upon my
							determination to suppress my observations upon Brevet-rank— I have put
							too much temper in them; and instead of punishing <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef> must begin by punishing myself—
							They have provoked me to anger; but I have to remember the injunction
							“be ye angry and sin not.” There is so much of sarcastic bitterness and
							indignation in what I have written, that I come under suspicion of
							mistaking my resentment for patriotism— I lose two Months of painful
							labour, and perhaps the usefulness of a cool discussion upon an
							important subject of military administration. But I teach myself the
							lesson of treating the subject in a different manner, and perhaps spare
							myself some additional and unnecessary enmities— Of these I have already
							more than enough— Part of the Solitude of this day was occupied in the
							anticipation of that condition upon which I am about to enter— In
							fervent prayer that my heart and temper maybe accommodated to it. That I
							may be provided in it with useful and profitable occupation, engaging so
							much of my thoughts and feelings that my mind may not be left to corrode
							itself— I shall need a double portion of discretion, and of fortitude—
							“O Lord my God, in this do I put my trust: save me from all them that
							persecute me, and deliver me.”</p>
						<p>“The Lord shall judge the People: judge me O Lord, according to my
							righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. My defence
							is of God, which saveth the upright in heart”— Psalm 7.</p>

						<p>I should have mentioned yesterday that <persRef ref="lovell-joseph">D<hi

								Campbell</persRef>— He did not sufficiently explain to me why they

								ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef>, from Matthew 27.22. [“]Pilate saith unto them,
							What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say
							unto him, let him be crucified— 23. And the Governor said, Why, what
							evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, let him be
							crucified.”— This discourse upon the death of Christ was not equal to
							the subject, and not among the happiest of M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Dickins</persRef> called, and told me that it would be necessary to
							use a fac-simile for the signature of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							originally of Medford, who has come hither at this Season to obtain for
								<persRef ref="wyman-t">one of his Sons</persRef> an appointment as a
							Cadet at West-Point— He brought me a Letter from <persRef

								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef> the adjutant General of the Army brought me a
							Statement of the existing regulations respecting the claims of
							double-rations by brevetted Officers; and of the cases when their own
							certificates are admitted as evidence— I find upon examination of them
							that a regulation, excluding the receipt of their own declarations or
							certificates would be productive of great inconvenience— And as my own
							term of service is about expiring I concluded not to issue any new
							regulation— I received two days since, a Letter from three Ladies at
							Woodsfield, Ohio—requesting that <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> would name
							three female infants born there at a birth daughters of man named
								<persRef ref="sayre-mercer">Mercer Sayre</persRef>—himself one of
							the brothers also born at a birth in New-Jersey in the year 1793—and
							who, at the request of their Parents, <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>President Washington</persRef> then named Warren, Montgomery, and
							Mercer— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams in her answer proposes
							that the first of the three girls should be named <persRef
								ref="sayre-martha">Martha Washington</persRef>—the second <persRef
								ref="sayer-louisa">Louisa Catherine</persRef>, and the third, after
							the mother of the Children. I received also this morning from Baltimore
							the Lord’s prayer, very handsomely cut out in paper by a woman who says
							she has no hands. It snowed moderately part of the last Night and the
							whole of this day so that I was confined to the house— Before dinner I
							paced for half an hour the Entry that runs through the house lengthways.
							It is 36 paces or 160 feet long— I signed yesterday a pardon of <persRef
								ref="young-john2">John Young</persRef>, a boy imprisoned for
							Stealing; and last Evening and this morning 7. Missouri Lead Mine Leases
							from 146 to 152 inclusive and 4 licences from 56 to 59 inclusive— M<hi

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day—</hi></date> My rising hour has ranged from
							IV to VII:15— The average being about V:30. and the changes regulated by
							the time of my retirement to bed which has varied from X:30 to I. A.M.
							which happened only once— The day of the last Drawing-room— My usual
							time of retirement is XI:30— Giving six hours to the bed— On rising I
							light my lamp, by the remnant of fire in the Bed-chamber—dress and
							repair to my Cabinet, where I make my fire and sit down to writing till
							between nine and ten— After Breakfast I read the morning National
							Intelligencer and Journal; and from X. A.M. to IV. P.M receive visitors,
							transact business with the Heads of Departments, and send Messages to
							one or both House of Congress— My riding on horseback has been
							interrupted almost the whole Month by the weather, and the Snow and the
							Ice—from four I walk an hour and a quarter till half past five— Dine,
							and pass one or two hours in the bed-chamber or Nursery. Then write
							again in my Cabinet till the time for repose— This routine has now
							became so habitual to me, that it forms part of the comfort of my
							existence, and I look forward with great solicitude to the time when it
							must be totally changed, I never go abroad unless to visit a sick
							friend. But a large dinner party, once a week, a Drawing room once a
							fortnight, occasional company of one two or three to dine with us in the
							family, and the daily visitors, eight or ten, sometimes twelve or
							fifteen keep me in constant intercourse with the world; and furnish
							constant employment the oppressiveness of which is much relieved by its
							variety. This is a happy condition of life, which within five weeks more
							must close— The prosperous condition of the Country takes from the load
							of public care, all its pain and almost all its weariness— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was exceedingly ill
							the first days of the Month, but has been in better health and Spirits,

							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef> has kept her chamber till the
							last three or four days— <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Her
								daughter</persRef> is close on two months Old, and is a fine
							thriving healthy child. With deep gratitude for the enjoyments yet
							indulged, let me not despair of the mercy with which they are to be
							withdrawn, and above all prepared to meet the change of fortune, about
							to befall me— “As ever in my task masters eye.”—</p>
