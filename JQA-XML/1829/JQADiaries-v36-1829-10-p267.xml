            <p>My Servant-man <persRef ref="thomas-john3">John Thomas</persRef> was very sick;
              threatened with a pleurisy fever— I sent for <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi

              his Regimen— <persRef ref="withington-mather">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

              Withington’s Grand-son were with us; but the business was yet not completed— I
              produced my deeds and plans; but that which was taken in December 1826. when I was
              absent, I could not find. My Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> sent it
              to me at Washington, and I probably left it there— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Turner wished that the Lot should be measured crosswise, which was done; but before we
              had got near through the length of the lot, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington
              gave out, and said he could go no further. <pb type="ms" n="268"/>They agreed however
              that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington should project the plan from the
              undisputed bound, so as to make up the quantity of Land contained in the Deed to
                <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>.— I walked from Owen’s field home with
              Peter Turner, over the rocks and Hills— Found <persRef ref="litchfield-ward">M<hi

              after dinner, with an old deed from <persRef ref="bass-samuel">Samuel Bass</persRef>
              to my Grandfather <persRef ref="adams-john4">John Adams</persRef> dated 1716. and
              which he thought would settle the question of title; but it proved to be land in the

            <p>I changed my sleeping chamber; the painting of the Book-shelves in that which I am
              fitting up for my Library having given it an offensive smell— I took the upper,
              North-east corner chamber, and finding it very cold this Morning, made the fire in the
              dining room, and read there. Then worked an hour in the Garden with the Spade, finding
              that I could not write in the Office till after breakfast. <persRef
                ref="newell-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell</persRef> came with a
              subscription paper for the continuation of <persRef ref="silliman-benjamin"
                >Silliman’s</persRef> Journal, to which I put my name. <persRef
                ref="litchfield-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Litchfield</persRef> finished
              the reduction of my fire-place in my bed chamber, and made a brick back-log in the
              middle chamber and room— I resumed after several days of interruption the writing of
              the Memoir, but am yet unable to average with it a page a day. Towards Evening I
              walked to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>, and spent an hour with
              his family. After returning I read several Letters of <persRef ref="deffand-marie"
                >Madame du Deffand</persRef>—all in the same strain— They present a melancholy
              picture of human wretchedness arising from blindness, solitude, old age, and sleepless
              Nights. The singularity of her affectionate attachment to <persRef
                ref="walpole-horace">Walpole</persRef> is not more remarkable than its pertinacity.
              For a long series of years it continued in spite of constant harsh treatment, of which
              she constantly complains— The inferences most conclusively to be drawn from their
              collection of Letters are 1. The absolute necessity of a blind person to have some one
              person upon to concentrate all the affections of the heart— The absence of all
              affection in a blind person for any other than the special favourite— The total
              indifference towards all others; even to the most intimate acquaintance 3. The extreme
              anxiety to be well thought of even by those for whom nothing but this indifference is
              felt. 4. The misery of being without religious impressions. She is occasionally
              sensible of this, and says in one of her Letters that she knows Devotion would be her
              best resource if she could feel it— She seems to have had a dull unexamining, fixed
              and unalterable disbelief of a future State of existence; which she does not
              positively acknowledge; but which you distinctly perceive in all her Lamentations—
              Among the remarkable things in the Letters are the pains which she takes to suppress
              her dislike of <persRef ref="gibbon-edward">Gibbon</persRef>, and especially of his
              History, which she cannot endure and is yet unwilling to condemn, because it was much
              admired by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walpole. The correspondence flags after the
              commencement of the War between France and Great-Britain in 1778. but I perceive with
              some surprize, that both she and her correspondent appear to entertain doubts whether
              any serious War would arise, until after the battle between the fleets of 27. July
              1778.</p>

                  >r</hi> Wallace</persRef> called while we were at Breakfast— He had a Patent for a
              Quarter Section of Soldier’s bounty Lands in the State of Illinois, issued to <persRef
                ref="u">his brother</persRef> in 1818. and left as he says by Will to him. But there
              are some arrears of taxes due upon it; and he came to enquire what he was to do to
              save the land from forfeiture. I told him if he wished to know where the Land was to
              write to <persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
                Graham</persRef> Commissioner of the General Land-Office; and he would inform him to
              whom and where he must pay the arrears of taxes— The Lighter Sloop Flash, <persRef
                ref="u">Captain Bicknell</persRef>, arrived from Boston with 38 boxes, and 5 Trunks
              of Books belonging to me; which have been packed up, partly in England whence they
              were sent to Boston in 1817. and the rest since they were dismissed from the Boston
              Athenaeum in 1822. They were all brought up in <persRef ref="u">M<hi

              at the Canal, and were landed in my yard before one O’Clock P.M. Five boxes of them
              were brought into the Entry, and the rest placed for shelter from probable rain under
              the Woodshed— <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"

                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mills</persRef> was painting them. I

                Farrar’s</persRef> preparations to go in to Boston with his Milk; and upon lighting
              my lamp found it was only three O’Clock. I returned to bed and rose again at four. The
              weather continued warm but there was a heavy rain till noon. I answered my Son
                <persRef ref="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> Letter— Heard <persRef
                ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> this morning
              from Luke 14.18. “And they all with one consent began to make excuse.” It was
              communion day, and the Sermon was a Reproof upon those Christians who neglect joining
              in it. Considering successively all the topics of excuse, usually alledged by those
              who withhold themselves from the Church. The afternoon Discourse, was a continuation
              of the Commentary upon the things hard to be understood in the New Testament, and
              reviewed the Book of Acts— Most of his remarks were upon the Account in the second
              Chapter of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost— He
              appeared somewhat perplexed with the cloven tongues of which he gave no satisfactory
              explanation, and simply gave notice that Unitarians did not admit the personality of
              the Holy Ghost. From the single Condition upon which Philip baptized the Eunuch,
              merely the declaration of his belief that Jesus was the Son of God, M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney inferred with much plausibility that no other
              condition is necessary for the admission of any person to all the privileges of the
              Christian faith, and therefore that all Creeds were superfluous— Some very slight
              historical notices were given of <persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef>, <persRef
                ref="paul">Paul</persRef> and <persRef ref="barnabas">Barnabas</persRef>—but these
              Sermons do not fulfil the expectations which they raise— They solve no
              difficulties—they explain nothing— They do not even set forth the real passages hard
              to be understood— Those Subjects are indeed better suited to formal Dissertations than
              to popular Sermons. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney did not this day name his
              text. <pb type="ms" n="270"/>I had remarked at dinner that our Unitarian Clergymen,
              scarcely ever gave out for singing the hymn of <persRef ref="watts-isaac"
                >Watts</persRef> beginning “How beauteous are their feet”—taken from the 52<hi
                rend="superscript">d</hi> chapter of Isaiah; and said I supposed it was because it
              favoured the Doctrine of the Divinity of Christ— It happened that M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney gave out this afternoon that hymn, but he omitted
              the last two verses— I think it one of the most beautiful Odes in the language. I also
              read this day <persRef ref="freeman-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Freeman’s</persRef> Sermon 16. upon the fear of punishment and 17. upon content.
              This last is the best in the collection; although not with the best selected text.

            <p>The Severity of the cold not only continues, so as to disqualify me for writing
              without a fire, but has given me a severe Catarrhal cold— <persRef ref="curtis-noah"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Noah Curtis</persRef> was here this Morning; I
              gave him the Deed of the half-Acre of Land at the foot of Penn’s Hill for <persRef
                ref="curtis-samuel">his Son</persRef>; for which he paid me four hundred dollars— I
              told him I had not put it into the Deed as a condition but that the appraisers had
              fixed it that he should make the whole fence it being round his house and garden; and
              I understood such was the agreement between us. He said he was aware I could not at
              most be held to do more than maintain my part of what is called a lawful fence;
              perhaps of Posts and Rails; and his Son wanted something more close and permanent—but
              he thought as I had not agreed to the estimate of the appraisers; I did not mean to
              insist upon their conditions. I told him I understood the only difference between us
              was the price, and I had consented he should take two rods less in depth than he had
              proposed— He said it should make no difficulty between us. He also paid me two years
              interest to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> for the Note of 1400 dollars to the
              Executors of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and I paid him the second
              and third payments in full for the Gallery Pews N. 5. 13. and 16. which <persRef
                ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> had purchased and upon which he had made the
              first payment, and has now transferred them to me; and he gave me deeds of them all.
              Immediately after dinner I went with the Chaise with <persRef ref="thomas-john3">John
                Thomas</persRef> into Boston. Stop’d at the Stone Cutters, and found I was yet in
              time to change one word in the monumental Inscription, it had occurred to me
              yesterday, and I had great anxiety for the change. I then went immediately to <persRef
                ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> office, but he was not there—to his house
              where I found him with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> suffering
              under a much severer cold than mine— I told him I should send in for him to-morrow
              Evening—left with him the 400 dollars I had received this morning to be deposited in
              the Bank, to-morrow, and went to <persRef ref="brooks-charles2">Charles
                Brooks</persRef> Hard ware shop where I purchased a pair of Andirons, Shovel, Tongs,
              Brush, and Bellows, with a pair of Hooks and Screws— The only remaining Article wanted
              was a Fender, which he had not— I brought out my things and got home about seven
              O’Clock— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs </hi>Sampson</persRef> was here—
                <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Beale</persRef>

              highways. I sent my newly hired man, <persRef ref="dutton-william">Dutton</persRef>,
              but had no oxen to send. This Evening I finished reading the third Volume of <persRef

              close of the year 1779.</p>

            <p>I made the first Fire in my bed-chamber but it did not sufficiently warm the room to
              enable me to write, and my Diary and correspondence fell in arrear— I read the
              remaining Letters of <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand</persRef> to
                <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Horace Walpole</persRef> including the last before her
              death, <pb type="ms" n="271"/>and then went back to the Editorial notice of her life
              in the first Volume, which I read over again— She was 68 years old, and had been
              twelve years blind when she first became acquainted with Walpole— The correspondence
              extends through a period of 15 years— She died at the age of 83. Walpole was a man of
              rank, fortune and fashion, but of a timid character; fond of his ease, and of living
              in luxurious solitude at Strawberry Hill. He never was married; which for a person of
              his condition is conclusive evidence that all his sensibilities centered in himself—
              His Genius, his Elegance of taste his devotion to literary pursuits though not rare
              endowments to an Englishman of noble family gave him far greater dignity than the
              peerage that fell to him at the close of his life; but his fastidious and scolding,
              sometimes insulting, and yet generous friendship for Madame du Deffand, is a
              phenomenon; much less than hers for him; which is the strongest instance of the besoin
              d’aimer, that perhaps has ever occurred— What it was in Horace Walpole that fascinated
              her to such a degree it is impossible to tell. It was perhaps a conformity of
              indifference to all the rest of the world. Or perhaps the occupation of constantly
              dictating Letters produced a perseverance of attachment to him, and the continual Show
              of Sentiment without much of the reality— <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">William
                Greenleaf</persRef> came here this morning to assist me in unpacking and putting up
              my books, and taking a Catalogue of them. We unpacked five of the boxes; put up the
              books, and took the list of them thus far. I was gratified to find that scarcely any
              of them had taken damage, although they have been so many years packed up. Some of
              them were of the packages which came from England in 1817. and some, of those which
              were returned from the Athenaeum in 1822. <persRef ref="foster-james;foster-elizabeth"

              Surveyor from Weymouth came by appointment this morning with <persRef
                ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef>— I rode with my Son <persRef
                ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to the foot of Penn’s Hill, and commenced the
              survey of my farm there. We began with the lands round the two houses at the corner
              bordering upon <persRef ref="field-joseph">Joseph Field</persRef>, and went round the
              whole ground lying together, which took us from nine in the morning till half past
              three in the afternoon— We first found that <persRef ref="curtis-samuel">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Curtis’s</persRef> fence round the half Acre of
              ground which I recently conveyed to him has encroached about two links of the Chain
              upon the measure both in the length and breadth of the lot. I sent for M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis, and it was measured over more than once in his
              presence to convince him of the fact; when we came in our progress to the land
              bordering upon the Nightingale’s, <persRef ref="nightingale-josiah">Josiah
                Nightingale</persRef> came and observed our course— <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer2"
                >Deacon Ebenezer Adams</persRef> met us upon the borders of his territories, and
              went round with us. <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas B. Adams j<hi
                  rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> joined us soon after we began— William Spear
              and <persRef ref="baxter-elijah">Baxter</persRef> carried the Chain, and sticks and
              measured the ground. I took <persRef ref="dutton-william">Dutton</persRef> out with me
              at first; but soon dismissed him, finding he had nothing to do. Deacon Adams was
              plying me all the time he was with us to swop Lands, and to open Ditches. When we came
              to the <pb type="ms" n="272"/>swamp land bordering upon the fields we found, that
                <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> had built a Wall, for several
              Rods encroaching upon my lands eight or ten feet and all the buildings connected with
              the House of the Fields project several feet upon my grounds. Joseph Field, the old
              man, now eighty years of age came out, as we first were commencing to take the lines,
              and said something of an agreement of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>
              with him, that he should extend his shed over the line— When we returned Harvey Field
              was in his yard, and asked how we had found the line; I told him we thought his wall
              had encroached; at which he looked concerned, and said that it was parallel to a Wall,
              which an old Tenant of mine had set on the South side of his lot; and as to the
              buildings he said his father had told him he had a right to set them a foot farther
              North than he had done— I told him what his father had said of an agreement with mine,
              and said I should see how it would turn out upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Humphreys’s plan of our Survey. I spoke to him about his rent, a second Quarter of
              which is now due; and he after some chaffering said he would transfer his three Canal
              Shares and one Note for 270 dollars; to pay his full year’s rent, and receive twenty
              dollars from me— It was past four O’Clock when we got home— There was an invitation to

                Greenleaf’s</persRef> in the Evening to which <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa

            <p>The day was yesterday so warm that we had no occasion for fires, and I attempted this
              morning to write without one; but soon found the necessity for it, and made it in my
              bed-chamber— I still could write little before breakfast, and my writing for the rest
              of the day is suspended by the Surveys— It was past nine when we called at <persRef
                ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams’s</persRef>; and he with <persRef
                ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys</persRef>, <persRef

                >Baxter</persRef> were already upon the field. <persRef ref="dutton-william"
                >Dutton</persRef> went with us this day; but <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">T. B.
                Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> did not— We took this day the Rock
              Common Wood lots, or as they are described in <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                fathers</persRef> deed to me Pastures; one of 23. and one of 20. Acres, now lying
              together, with four acres; part of a pasture of eight of fresh meadow, for watering
              Cattle— Deacon Adams says this has always been called Lawyers Common. We were full six
              hours in going round them— Part of the boundaries are enormous ledges of rock,
              difficult to scale, and the sides of which are horrid with brambles and briars— The
              day was very cold and we saw only one Snake, and he of an inoffensive breed. We did
              not measure the four Acres of fresh meadow or swamp. We found this day, no perceptible
              encroachment of boundary, but numerous stumps of trees cut down and carried away.
              About three O’Clock we finished this and then proceeded to the Quincy Meadow described
              in my deed as of about six Acres. I had always thought it nearly a square, but it is a
              Trapezium of four unequal sides the Northern, being less than half the length of the
              Southern side— This plot being only four side, and open ground, I measured it by
              pacing, and find three of my paces regularly equivalent to a Rod; that is 5 1/2 feet
              to a Pace— The Chain is more accurate than my pacing, only as it gives the odd links
              which I cannot do. I shall make a projection of this Lot, upon my measurement of
              pacing to compare with that of the Surveyor— <persRef ref="bass-jonathan">Deacon
                Jonathan Bass</persRef> was harvesting his Indian corn, as we were running the line
              bordering upon his grounds. He proposed to me to purchase his place. He said there
              were nine Acres of it, the price he asked for which was 2500 dollars. We reached home

            <p>At nine this morning we met again at <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Josiah
                Adams’s</persRef>, and proceeded immediately to the Survey of three Woodlots on Pine
              Hill, conveyed to me by <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Deed of 8.
              August 1803—one conveyed to him by a Committee of the Town of Braintree in 1765, one
              by <persRef ref="crosby-joseph">Joseph Crosby</persRef> in    and the third by <persRef ref="thayer-elkanah">Elkanah
                Thayer</persRef> in 1793— The first of fourteen Acres, and the two others of fifteen
              each more or less. We commenced the admeasurement at a Stone-wall pointed out to us by
              Deacon Adams as the boundary, and pursued the Wall Southward as long as it continued.
              It ceased at a deep descent into a swamp, through which we were led by Deacon Adams
              and the compass, till on the ascent of another Ledge of Rocks the Stone wall
              recommenced. We followed it until it turned at right Angles, from which Corner,
                <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys</persRef>
              took the bearing of the Rail-way Tower, which was in sight— From this Corner, we had
              no direction excepting as the compass pointed to heaps of Stones from space to space.
              I had taken much of the morning to look up the Deeds of Conveyance to my father, and
              had found that of the Committee of the Town, and that of Joseph Crosby; but could not
              find that of Elkanah Thayer— Deacon Adams knew nothing of the bound, beyond the wall;
              nor did any other person present— We traversed rocks and swamps through briars and
              brambles till the descending Sun, warned us of the approach of Night, when we struck a
              Northern course till we met a Wall by which we traced our way back to the place whence
              we had started in the morning; and which we reached just after Sunset— After emptying
              the basket of refreshments which we had left there, we returned to Deacon Adams, and I
              there agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys that if the weather should
              be fair next Wednesday he should call again at my house at Eight O’Clock of the
              Morning. We reached home just as it was dark. The plans can only be completed, by
              consulting the Report of the Committee of the Town which sold the Lands in 1765. and
              if it exists the plans then taken— The day was fine, and the weather milder than
              yesterday— My Catarrhal cold continues with unabated severity; and I was this Evening
              worn out with fatigue.</p>

              my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in the Chaise. The morning
              escaped while I was engaged upon my searches for and into the old Deeds of <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> Estate; which will yet absorb many hours.
                <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> came
              before Noon, and we had conversation upon further proceedings to be had for carrying
              into effect the establishment of a Classical School in this Town— At the Meeting of
              the Supervisors of the fund on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July last M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy had been appointed a Committee, to prepare a plan,
              and Rules and Regulations for the School; he to consult with me— But he had forgotten
              this Commission, and to obtain a copy of it, and of the other proceedings of that
              Meeting, we walked to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> House— He was
              not at home, but we met him as we were proceeding to his Office— M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy took a copy of the vote— My brother took also the
              acknowledgment of the Release by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy and myself as
              Executors of my father’s Will, of the Mortgage of his homestead Estate, executed by
              me, 4 October 1826. to secure the payment of his bequests to <persRef

              They having since both come of age, and received payment of their bequests by my
              Notes. After returning to my house, I read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy
              the copy of my Letter to the Supervisors, of <pb type="ms" n="274"/>the 15<hi
                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July last, and he said he would draw up a plan with
              Rules and Regulations for the School, which he would take from the Academy at Andover—
              Of those Regulations he promised to send me a Copy. After dinner he spoke of some of
              the Ancestors of the Quincy family, and I shewed him the extracts I had made from the
              Braintree Town Records— We walked to the burying yard, where I shewed him the Tomb and
              Gravestones of <persRef ref="hoar-leonard">Leonard Hoar</persRef>—of <persRef

              Stone; lying on the ground, the Inscription upon it being lost, but which we both took
              to be the monument of the second Edmund Quincy— Between four and five in the
              afternoon, he took leave and returned to Cambridge. He told me that he had examined
              the Records of the Corporation of Harvard University to find accounts of my fathers
              and my donations of books but could find no trace of them— My cold is still very
              troublesome, and I made this Evening an unsuccessful attempt to read.</p>

              Kimball</persRef>, now of Needham; formerly the Preceptor at the Derby Academy in
              Hingham; when my Sons <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> were there at School. His morning Sermon was from
              Matthew 5.9. “Blessed are the Peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of
              God.” upon the benevolent, amiable, pacific character of the Christian Religion— His
              afternoon text was from Jeremiah 17.9. “The heart is deceitful above all things, and
              desperately wicked: who can know it.” Like almost all the younger preachers of this
              neighbourhood M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kimball writes better than he reads or
              speaks His voice is feeble and his delivery cold and lifeless— Moral Dissertations
              upon benevolence, and brotherly love, excellent in themselves are not suited to a tone
              of high animation. The tediousness of such discourses, is abridged by their brevity.
                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kimball dined with us I read the 18<hi
                rend="superscript">th</hi> Sermon of <persRef ref="freeman-james">D<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman’s</persRef> recent volume, and the charge, with
              which the Volume concludes— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman is Senior Rector of
              the Stone-chapel in Boston— He was settled in October 1782 and ordained by the members
              of his own Church 18. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1787. They are Unitarians with
              the Episcopal forms of worship— He has a Colleague settled with him. <persRef
                ref="greenwood-francis">F. W. P. Greenwood</persRef>. He is now very seldom able, to
              preach, himself: but to protract as long as possible the term of his usefulness he
              composed and printed this volume of Sermons, and sent copies of it round among his
              Parishioners— They are published without his name, and are adapted to the festivals of
              the episcopal Church, from the first Sunday in Advent, till the second Sunday after
              Easter. The last of the Sermons however is for Thanksgiving day. There is nothing
              remarkably appropriate, in most of the Sermons, to the several days specially affixed
              to them. The Christmas Sermon is upon Alms-giving— The Easter Sermon upon the extent
              of Christ’s Kingdom— The New-Years day Sermon is upon the divisions of the
              year—astronomical rather than theological— The Sermon upon Marriage is for the second
              Sunday after the Epiphany the same day as that of <persRef ref="bourdaloue-louis"
                >Bourdaloue</persRef>; and upon the same text—doubtless taken from the lesson of the
              day— These Sermons are all written in a plain and perspicuous Style; full of good
              sense and sound principle. The learning which they discover is quite superficial, and
              although they frequently allude to topics of controversy, there is scarcely a single
              reference to any other writer; excepting to the Scriptures themselves— In the Evening
              I read the Letters of <persRef ref="pope-alexander">Pope’s</persRef> Correspondence
              with <persRef ref="wycherley-william">Wycherley</persRef>, and with <persRef
                ref="walsh-william">W. Walsh</persRef>— They are monuments of Pope’s juvenile talent
              and ambition— Wycherly’s Letters are wretched.</p>

            <p>There came a man with a subscription paper from <persRef ref="blunt-edmund">Edmund M.
                Blunt</persRef> for six or seven Charts, and to the amount of 80 dollars. He brought
              a Letter from Blunt, but I declined the subscription— <persRef ref="field-harvey"
                >Harvey Field</persRef> brought me three Certificates of three Shares in the Quincy
              Canal transferred by him to me, together with a Note from the Treasurer of the
              Corporation for 70. Dollars, to <persRef ref="curtis-adam">Adam Curtis</persRef>, and
              endorsed by him—which I take in payment of his years rent, and give him a check for 20
              dollars— He pressed me for the payment of the Tax assessed upon me, which I declined
              until I should receive the explanation of the Assessors promised me by <persRef
                ref="souther-john">Captain Souther</persRef>, what the property is for which I am
              taxed. I unpacked two more boxes of my Books, and consumed much of the Morning in
              examining old Title Deeds— After dinner, I rode with <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">T.

                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Asa French’s</persRef>—the town Clerk of

              Town records; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French was not at home and my work is
              to do over again— They were Common Lands sold by a Committee of the Town in 1765. of
              which Committee my father was a member— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French’s
              <persRef ref="french-lucinda">daughter</persRef> shewed me the Town Record Books— I found the
              proceedings of the Town and the appointment and Report of the Committee; but they
              refer to Plans, of which French’s daughter knew nothing, and which are probably lost
              or destroyed. The records only led me into enquiries concerning the History of the
              Braintree Common Lands, which I had not time to pursue— After an hours examination of
              the Record, Sunset approaching I returned home, and found <persRef

              Saturday which I declined— The day was occupied in putting up books of my Library, and
              in examining old Title Deeds of Lands preparatory to the resumption of the Surveys
              with <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

              and Quincy. They were of so little value, that he did not pay for them all more than
              20,000 dollars— In 1803. after he had ceased purchasing he conveyed to me chiefly at a
              fair appraisement about one fourth part of those Lands, for 12812 dollars— He gave to
              my brother <persRef ref="adams-thomas">Thomas</persRef> about one fourth part— He gave
              me in 1819. one fourth part, conditioned for the payment of 1000 dollars a year to him
              during his life, and the remaining half has been or is to be sold for the benefit of
              his devisees by Will. I have purchased for about 20000 dollars what has been sold of
              that half, from which is to be taken a donation of nearly equal value which he made to
              the Town of <pb type="ms" n="276"/>Quincy— The Lands which he conveyed to me in 1803
              are those which I am now surveying— I have never known their bounds— Of those which he
              left, old deeds, and Wills; and scratches of Plans which I could not understand were
              all I had to discover them— I have this day been examining and making extracts from
              the Title Deeds of the Lands which I propose to Survey to-morrow—and no one can
              imagine the time which all such researches consume— The day was gone, and I had got
              not half through my enquiries, one leading to another. As the Sun was going down, I
              went to my Nursery and dug with the Spade about half an hour, immediately after which
              I was taken with a severe touch of Lumbago, which about nine O’Clock I took with me to

            <p>I rose this morning after a painful Night; suffering sharp pains of Lumbago, and with
              a remnant of Catarrhal Cold and Cough upon me—doubtful of the prudence of going upon
              fatigue duty; but unwilling to be disappointed in the completion of my undertaking—
                <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys</persRef>
              with <persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="baxter-elijah">Elijah Baxter</persRef>, came at 8. O’Clock, and I agreed to
              meet them at the School-house Lot— <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus
                Spear</persRef> came with his Quarters Rent, deducting an Account for Butter and
              Wood— I called round at <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> and took up
              his Son <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas</persRef> who accompanied us upon this
              day’s Survey— We began upon the School-House Lot, which I call so, because a small
              School-house has been erected upon it, with my brother’s consent, and an acquiescence
              of mine; we went round it proceeding from the School house corner Southward on the
              Plymouth road; and thence easterly from <persRef ref="hardwick-henry">Henry
                Hardwick’s</persRef> Corner— Hardwick shewed me about an Acre of the Land, which he
              wishes to purchase. About one third of this Land is covered with a good growth of
              wood, chiefly Oak and Walnut, with some birch, maple, red cedar, pitch pine and
              Sumack— The northern Line being open, I measured it by pacing, and found my paces
              again measuring exactly three to a Rod— On closing the circuit I found <persRef
                ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef>, who endorsed the Note of <persRef
                ref="brigham-josiah">Josiah Brigham</persRef>, which he transferred to me the day
              before yesterday. It was by <persRef ref="curtis-adam">Adam Curtis’s</persRef>
              endorsement made payable to him— I called at <persRef ref="curtis-samuel">Samuel
                Curtis’s</persRef> and he paid me a Quarter’s Rent, for the house which he occupies—
              His brother Adam, has already removed into the new house that he has built on the
              Eastern side of the Road— I asked Samuel when he expected to remove he said he
              supposed about the first of next September— I ought to take measures for letting the
              house from this time— I spoke of the excess of measure taken by Curtis in fencing out
              his half-Acre— He said he had taken nothing beyond French’s measurement and wished to
              have it measured again by him to which I assented— There is it seems a difference in
              the length of the Surveyor’s chains— We proceeded to the Penn’s Hill Orchard, <persRef
                ref="atherton-unknown">Atherton</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Virchild</persRef> lot, commencing
              at the corner opposite to Henry Hardwick’s House, and taking the direction of the line
              from East to West, bordering upon Field— We crossed the Atherton and Verchild
              Pastures, and came in to the Fresh Meadow, and followed the course of the Mill brook,
              which is the same that leads to the Canal and the town river— After finally crossing
              this we made our dinner under the shade of Trees on the side of a Hill ascending from
              it— About five in the afternoon we returned to the point of departure— I ascended the
              Wall at the same corner, which I had mounted on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
              of June 1775. on hearing the Cannonade of that day— We observed that the road had been
              recently widened by a new wall built eight or ten feet back of <pb type="ms" n="277"
              />where it had formerly stood— I was told it was done, by a former Tenant of mine,
              named <persRef ref="u">Green</persRef>— The last Lot which we measured, was that
              called the Goose Pasture, on the top of Penn’s Hill, on the East side of the Road the
              northern bound of which is the line between Quincy and Braintree— It is opposite to
                <persRef ref="curtis-noah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Noah Curtis’s</persRef>
              House; and he wants to purchase four rods in width from the South side of it— He
              thinks the whole Lot a barren rock, good for nothing, but said he would give thirty
              dollars an Acre for it. A <persRef ref="u">Captain Glover</persRef> joined us there
              who told me he was the person who in 1826. informed me of the encroachment of <persRef
                ref="brackett-james">Captain James Bracket</persRef> upon my Cherry-tree Salt-marsh
              lot— It was the dusk of Evening when I found my Carriage in Harvey Field’s yard at the
              foot of Penn’s Hill. I left T. B. Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> at home, and
              reached mine just at dark—after six— Weary, stiff and still sharply rhumatic.</p>

            <p><persRef ref="souther-john">Captain Souther</persRef> called upon me this morning,
              and gave me a paper explanatory of the tax assessed upon me; with the assistance of
              which and reference to the Statutes of the Commonwealth, I expect to understand the
              system of taxation established in the State, and its application to my own person and
              property— I had hoped to finish this day the Surveys of my Penn’s valley farm Lands,
              but was disappointed— <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Humphreys</persRef> was here between 8 and 9. in the Morning. I proposed to take
              this day the Saltmarsh. We began with the Penny-ferry Lot at Milton. Sold for 2 3/4
              Acres, by <persRef ref="nightingale-samuel">Samuel Nightingale</persRef> to my
              Grandfather <persRef ref="adams-john4">John Adams</persRef>. 10. April 1738. given by
              my grandfather’s Will, to his youngest Son <persRef ref="adams-elihu">Elihu</persRef>,
              and by him sold to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> 5. Oct<hi
                rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1769. and by him to me 8. August 1803. In the Will, and
              the two last Deeds, the quantity assigned to it is 2 1/2 Acres more or less. A young
              man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Pope</persRef> who has mowed it, and whose
                <persRef ref="u">father</persRef> has long had charge of it, shewed the bounds,
              which are a stake at each corner, and a creek, which the lot crosses. It is in the
              midst of an extensive marsh, overflowed at high tides, and where no other fence could
              stand. A man named <persRef ref="penniman-ezra">Ezra Penniman</persRef> owns an
              adjoining lot and has habitually encroached upon that. We came from it to the
              cherry-tree stump-lot which was surveyed by <persRef ref="withington-mather"
                >Withington</persRef> in August 1826. and which I now well recollected. It was sold
              to me for five Acres; but there are encroachers here on both sides—<persRef
                ref="fenno-jesse">Jesse Fenno</persRef> and <persRef ref="brackett-james">James
                Bracket</persRef>. Withington found it very little more than four Acres.— The tide
              came up and overflowed part of it while we were engaged upon the Survey— When we came
              next to the Town river lot it was almost wholly overflowed, and we could take only the
              line bordering upon the upland— <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef>
              there came to us, and told me a facetious Story of an old man at Germantown, who asked
              some laborious service of a young one, for which he promised to reward him by telling
              him something that would be greatly to his advantage: and when the work was done, and
              the reward claimed said “Jemmy, when you go clamming, take care to go at low water.”
              The Deacon’s joke was seasonable— We had gone out at low water, but time and tide had
              out run us, before we could finish the race— We took our scanty dinner on the field,
              and went to <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams’s</persRef> and thence with him
              on a second search for the Pinehill woodlots; in which search we were not much more
              successful than before. We traversed however the whole Hill, and came out just at
              Sunset, on the Southwest side of it, on land of <persRef ref="capen-samuel">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Capen’s</persRef>— It was dark when we returned to
              Deacon Adams’s, and too late to return to finish the Survey of the Town-river Marsh
              lot. <pb type="ms" n="278"/>I agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys to

            <p>I retired to bed about 8 last Evening and accordingly rose at half past three this
              morning— But my writing runs in arrear, and I could not entirely retrieve it— I found
              this Morning several old Plans of <persRef ref="bass-jedidiah">Jedidiah Bass</persRef>
              which may assist me in finding boundaries— Among the rest two of the Pine Hill lots N.
              5. and 6. and <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> had lent me the day

              on the field, at the Town-river lot where I met him this morning; and where we
              finished my intended Surveys of my Penn’s Valley farm and its appendages, between ten
              and eleven O’Clock— I agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys to go out
              with him again Wednesday the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month if fair,
              to resurvey the Lands belonging to my father’s Estate in the 600 Acres, and which have
              not yet been ascertained— I spoke to <persRef ref="baxter-jonathan2">Jonathan
                Baxter</persRef> who was ploughing upon his upland bounded on my Salt-marsh lot;
              which is not fenced— The lot needs ditching for which Baxter recommended to me a
                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Littlefield</persRef>— I took the

              spent the remainder of the day in my chamber, having my books unpacked, and putting
              them up— I have now ascertained with as much exactness as has been in my power the
              location and bounds of all the Lands in Quincy conveyed to me by my father in his
              life-time, and the search has made me acquainted with many circumstances relating to
              their Condition, which I ought to improve to useful purpose; but Patience and
              Perseverance only can effect what ought to be accomplished— My brother, and his Son

            <p>I was occupied all day, in examining my own papers, and the Title Deeds of <persRef
                ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Estate; and in unpacking and putting up my
              books; a work which seems to be lengthening as I go— My Library is l’embarras des
              Richesses; I have been half a century, as greedy of books as Helluo was of the
              Salmon’s belly. No such Library exists in the hands of any other individual in the
              United States; but I have never had the enjoyment of it; nor can I expect to have it
              now or hereafter for the remnant of my days. My father had the same passion, and
              finally gave his Library to the Town of Quincy. This ardent love of Literature was
              indissolubly knit with all the qualities in his character, which raised him to
              distinction, and signalized the usefulness of his Life— It has had not less influence
              upon mine— Adolescentiam alunt, Senectutem delectant— It is a costly passion; but pays
              its own way, with ten fold, and hundred fold increase. But to produce this result it
              must be associated with rigorous economy, with punctual accountability, and with
              judicious and untiring <pb type="ms" n="279"/>industry. The effect would be much
              increased by a skilful use of the Library itself. The want of a place in which a
              Library can be stowed is an inconvenience which nothing but wealth can escape— A large
              house; and a very large Apartment are indispensable. These I shall probably never
              possess, and must make up my mind to finish my days without them— I have yet upon my
              mind also a great burden of private business— My own Affairs—the Settlement of my
              father’s Estate— The trusts of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">W. N. Boylston</persRef>
              all tax me heavily for Time. I am endeavouring to bring them all into Order; but in
              the meantime the Memoir of my fathers life must be suspended— My Correspondence
              abridged, and well it were that I should add, this Diary curtailed— <persRef

              Pension— I told him to make affidavit of the loss before a magistrate and promised
              that I would apply for a new certificate for him— At the dusk of Evening I walked to

                Richmond</persRef> of Dorchester, this morning from Psalm 97.2. “Clouds and Darkness
              are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.” A
              copious theme— In modern English the term Virtue is used to express the idea conveyed
              in the English Bible by the word Righteousness—defined by <persRef
                ref="johnson-samuel">Johnson</persRef> Moral goodness— In the English Old Testament
              the word virtue is not used— The virtuous man is there the perfect and upright man— In
              the Hebrew system of Morals the primitive idea of human excellence was
              rectitude—straightness— Virtue was Right— In the Grecian code of Ethics the primitive
              idea of perfection was strength— Αρης was the God Mars, and Αρετη was Virtue. In the
              Roman language Vir was a man, and Virtus—manhood was virtue— Virtue was Power— The
              Hebrew system came from God— The Grecian system was the work of man. In M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Richmond’s text Righteousness and Judgment are the
              habitation of the throne of God. The word Judgment here is equivalent to Justice which
              is a word of Latin origin from Jus, derived from jubis to command— All the duties of
              men in the Jewish System are referred to the Will of God— Abstract virtue, the καλον
              και αγαθον is a conception of the Grecian Sages— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Richmond’s text in the afternoon was from Isaiah 5.4— “What could have been done more
              to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it should
              bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?” This was a discourse of reproof and
              expostulation which commanded attention, and would have searched the hearts of the
              hearers if it had been delivered with animation— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Richmond dined with us as did my nephew the <persRef ref="adams-thomas2"
                >Lieutenant</persRef>— Towards Evening I read <persRef ref="swift-jonathan"
                >Swift’s</persRef> Sermon upon Sleeping in Church, and part of that upon False
              witness— The former is a tissue of severe Satire from beginning to end— Such that I
              think there were no Sleepers when it was <pb type="ms" n="280"/>delivered— The second
              is more grave, but appears to have reference only to that species of false testimony
              which prevails in factious times and is instigated by party Spirit— He describes it as
              extremely common, and utterly profligate— And to escape it he advises his hearers to
              have nothing at all to do with that which is commonly called politics or the
              government of the world: In the nature of which he tells them it is certain they are
              utterly ignorant— This doctrine would not take at this time— He speaks also with
              contemptuous indignation— There is much discourse in this Sermon applicable to all
              heated party times. <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef>, with <persRef
                ref="harrod-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrod</persRef> and <persRef

              came out from Boston with a workman, and they began upon the work of adjusting the
              tablet bearing the obituary inscription to the side of the Wall in the Stone Temple— I
              had spoken yesterday to <persRef ref="wood-h">Henry Wood</persRef> to assist in the
              performance of the work— He was accordingly early at the house, with <persRef
                ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and
              they worked upon it the whole day. They marked out the space to be covered by the
              Tablet, from which they took off the plaistering, and cut away the Laths and firring
              which was of Plank. Wood and Adams were all the afternoon employed in opening holes
              into the solid Granite Walls, to insert the marble Trusses which are to support the
              monumental Tablet— Dickinson and his workman returned to Boston, early in the
              afternoon. I was there several hours of the morning; inspecting the work, and giving
              directions for the position of the Tablet. <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Greenleaf</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
                brother</persRef>, <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> and some other
              persons occasionally came in— I went with Henry Wood over to the burying Yard, and
              examined the Grave-stones there erected by <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef>, to the Memory of his Ancestors— A corner of the Marble tablet
              inserted into the Stone of the first <persRef ref="adams-henry">Henry Adams</persRef>
              is broken off—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood thinks by the effect of Snow or
              rainwater dripping in by the edges though soldered with lead, and swelling beneath by
              the frost till the marble broke— The first of these four Monuments built by my father,
              was to the Memory of <persRef ref="adams-john4">his father</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="hall-susanna">mother</persRef>— The foundation was of several Stones; with a
              table covering of one— The lower Stones were joined together by a cement of mortar,
              but the heaving of the frost has disjoined them and broken away all the Mortar. I
              desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood to replace the Stones, and to secure them
              as far as may be practicable— The yard itself is too accessible to children from the
              adjoining School, and even to Cattle. Brass and marble are frail memorials; destined
              to decay—but the preservation of them, as long as they can be made to endure is a duty
              of filial piety transmissible from generation to generation— I also told M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood that I desired a certificate signed by several of the
              persons present, at the removal of the remains of my father and mother, from the tomb
              in the grave-yard, to the Sepulchre under the Temple. Towards the dusk of the Evening
              I walked again up to the House, and found Wood and Adams yet at work, cutting <pb
                type="ms" n="281"/>the holes in the Wall for the Trusses— The part of the day that I
              spent at home was chiefly engaged in unpacking, and putting up books— My eyes
              threatened with inflammation disconcerted my reading and writing. I have at last got
              out my <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>; and in the Volumes of his
              General Correspondence found a number of his Letters to <persRef ref="deffand-marie"
                >Madame La Marquise du Deffant</persRef>— The first is of 1749. and gives an account
              of the Death in Childbed of <persRef ref="duchatelet-emilie">Madame du
                Chatelet</persRef>, with whom he was living in a sort of community of goods and of
              matrimonial rights, with <persRef ref="duchatelet-florent">her husband</persRef>—
              There is a mixture of burlesque in all Voltaire’s sensibilities. His Letter to Madame
              du Deffant, to which the first of hers in the collection subjoined to her
              correspondence with <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Walpole</persRef> is the answer, is
              so grossly and shamelessly indecent, that no virtuous woman would have answered it—
              But she was living with the President <persRef ref="henault-charles"
              >Hénault</persRef>, much in the Style of Madame du Chatelet with Voltaire.</p>

            <p>I have been so many years accustomed to keep copies of my Letters that I feel a great
              reluctance at discontinuing the practice— I am now reduced to the alternative of doing
              it or of employing a Secretary. This morning I wrote a short Letter to <persRef
                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and copied it myself; but I have so
              nearly lost the use of my right hand for writing that I cannot habitually copy.
                <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">William C. Greenleaf</persRef> was here this
              morning, and we made some progress in the Index alphabetical to my proposed catalogue
              of my books— I begin with a mere alphabetical index of names which when collected I
              intend to use for reference to the pages of the Catalogue— M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> Greenleaf brought me an original Letter of April 1764. from <persRef
                  ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to his <persRef ref="cranch-richard">Grandfather Cranch</persRef>; and promised to come
              again to-morrow Morning. I went to the Meeting House where I found <persRef
                ref="dickinson-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickinson</persRef>, and
                <persRef ref="wood-h">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> at work on the
              Monument. My intention was to have gone again in the afternoon; but <persRef
                ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> came and took tea
              here. <persRef ref="loud-eliphalet">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loud</persRef> of
              Weymouth also called and took back the papers he had left with me last July— He
              offered me compensation for the trouble I had taken, in this affair which I declined.
                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey mentioned the Manuscript of my Reply to the
              Boston Confederates; and expressed a strong wish that it might soon be published or at
              least some part of it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey spoke also of his own
              situation and prospects: he proposes taking his family with him to Washington this
              Winter— This is the fourth successive Congress in which he has been a member of the
              House of Representatives, and he foresees that there is little prospect of his future
              re-election. He wishes himself back in his office at the Department of State— We had
              some Conversation upon general politics; of which I am rapidly losing the thread. He
              promised to send me a copy of the marks and references made by <persRef
                ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> in his
              copy of my father’s Defence of the American Constitutions— I am making an abstract
              from the Title Deeds and Vouchers of Real Estate, left by my father, which occupies
              much of my Time— And I make slow progress in putting up my books— <persRef
                ref="turner-ruth">Ruth Turner</persRef> passed the day here, and stays to Night. I
              read a few Letters of the Correspondence between <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
                >Voltaire</persRef> and <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Defffant</persRef>—
              Her labours are much more laboured and less natural than those she wrote to <persRef
                ref="walpole-horace">Walpole</persRef>; and are therefore less pleasing. Voltaire in
              the midst of building Chateaux, a Church, a Theatre, settling a Colony, acting
              Tragedies, writing Histories, Epic Poems, Dramas and Letters, is always complaining
              that he is sick— Madame du Deffant teizes him to advise her what she shall read— He
              answers “the Old Testament, especially the book of Ezekiel, Ariosto, and Rabelais,[”]
              and promises to send her two Books of the Pucelle written in imitation of Ariosto— His
              criticisms are severe and Summary—particularly upon the English Novelists— He says
              there is not a good thing in <persRef ref="tomjones">Tom Jones</persRef>, except the
              character of a Barber; and that he was tired to death with <persRef ref="clarissa"
                >Clarissa</persRef> till in the tenth Volume, he met her in a bad house.</p>

            <p>The Night was cold, and the frost this Morning so sharp that I found myself unable to
              write in my Diary before breakfast— This throws an arrear upon the whole day— <persRef
                ref="greenleaf-william">William Greenleaf</persRef> passed the day and Evening here.
              I proposed to him to take up his residence with me until I go on to Washington and to
              assist me in copying papers and making a catalogue of my books, to which he agreed,
              and after copying two Letters, was engaged all day in making the Alphabetical index of
              names preparatory for the Catalogue— I went morning and afternoon to the Meeting-House
              where they were at work on the Monument— The making of the holes in the Wall to
              receive the Trusses which support the marble Tablet has been a laborious Work— The
              tablet was in the course of this day put up. I met <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf</persRef> there this morning.
                <persRef ref="wood-h">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> gave me a
              certificate signed by himself, <persRef ref="fisk-nathan">Nathan Fisk</persRef>,

              April 1828. from the family vault in the burying ground, to the Tomb under the new
              Stone Temple— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood informed me that <persRef
                ref="cary-alpheus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary</persRef> would come out
              to-morrow— <persRef ref="thaxter-anna">Miss Thaxter</persRef> dined with us— She had
              been to the Dedication of the new Stone-Meeting house in Milton, at the Railway; which
              was done this day. <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Brooks</persRef> of Hingham went with her, and dined with the dedicating party
              there. He called for her here after dinner on his return home. <persRef
                ref="turner-ruth">Ruth Turner</persRef> returned home also this Evening. I made very
              small progress with my abstract of Title Deeds, and not much more in putting up my
              books, though I have nearly filled my shelves. In the Evening I read a number of
              Letters from <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> to <persRef
                ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand</persRef>— There is something irresistibly
              ludicrous in the sportiveness of his Wit, though it is always disgustingly coarse. He
              appears to have been totally destitute of the Sentiment of delicacy. His indefatigable
              industry is one of the most remarkable parts of his character, and he tells Madame du
              Deffand, that his secret for rendering life supportable, is to keep himself
              incessantly occupied. He says too that with all his other engagements, and with the
              perpetual stream of visitors especially English and Russians whom he is compelled to
              entertain, he has to write ten or twelve Letters every day— But he had not lost the
              use of his right hand.</p>

                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary</persRef> came out from Boston, and carved the
              names of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> upon the Granite Stones under which they repose
              in the Tomb beneath the Porch of the Stone Temple. There was nothing on them to
              designate which was which— The Granite Stone, is so much more intractable than marble,
              to receive inscriptions that Cary and <persRef ref="wood-h">Wood</persRef> were at
              work the whole day in carving the two names. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary dined
              with us. I was three times this day at the Meeting-house, and this Evening found the
              bust of my father put up in its place. The monument is of perfect simplicity; and I
              hope suited to the character of the persons and the history of their lives— I hope
              also that it has been erected in a Spirit acceptable to our father who is in Heaven—
              Not of Pride or Vain-glory; but of filial gratitude, and veneration; and of pure
              Patriotism— The monument is neat and handsome; but the effect of its appearance in two
              particulars falls short of my expectations— It projects too much from the Wall, and
              the Bust which is of white marble, having a white plaistered Wall immediately behind
              it is seen to great disadvantage— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Smith</persRef> whom I
              met there immediately <pb type="ms" n="283"/>after the bust was up, spoke of it, and
              said he hoped I should do something further to give it relief— The visitors to see it
              are already numerous and their comments as various as the persons— There are few such
              monuments existing in this Country, and indeed very few Churches of durable structure,
              in which they could be placed— There are three in the Stone Chapel at Boston— All of
              ante or anti-revolutionary personages, in whose history no person now here takes any
              interest; except perhaps the immediate descendants of <persRef ref="apthorp-charles"
                >Charles Ward Apthorp</persRef>, one of the three— I wrote to my Son <persRef

              Soldiery to attend their anniversary celebration next Monday, which I declined— From
              the Correspondence of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> with
                <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand</persRef> I passed to <persRef
                ref="condorcet-marie">Condorcet’s</persRef> Life of Voltaire—the first thing in
              which that strikes me is the contrast of character between the biographer and his
              subject. The greatest charm of Voltaire is in his wit— Condorcet is an emphatic
              philosopher—always upon stilts— Voltaire to escape persecution for his Epitre à
              Uranie, gave out that it was written by the <persRef ref="chaulieu-guillaume">Abbe de
                Chaulieu</persRef>— Condorcet gravely affirms the right of lying to evade
              persecution; and yet is ashamed to justify Voltaire— Condorcet’s fate may mitigate
              criticism upon his Memory— He was a fanatic of Atheism, and sophistical politics—

              has granted me the ability to accomplish this work; and I pray for the blessing of
              Heaven upon it; that for many ages to come, it may serve as a solemn admonition to all
              their descendants to their townsmen, and to every one who shall read the Inscription,
              to devote the service of their God, their Country, and mankind— The key of the Tomb
              was returned to me this day. After dinner, I walked down to the Mount Wollaston Farm,
              and over it with the Tenants <persRef ref="spear-alpheus;spear-lemuel">Alpheus
                and    Spear</persRef>— They shewed me the eastern and Southern boundary of the
              farm, and a small piece of Saltmarsh adjoining it which they think is for Sale cheap,
              and which they wish me to purchase— I saw the trees they had cut down, to cart to my
              house for fire wood, and a large Oak tree, which <persRef ref="u">Taylor</persRef>,
              the man whom I first employed last June when I came here cut down, and then left the
              trunk there— It was an excellent and valuable tree for Timber, and should not have
              been cut down for fuel. It was an imposition practiced upon me by Taylor, and with
              several other incidents proves to me that a man must purchase dear the art of managing
              his own property when he has been bred to other occupations. The farm is leased to the
              Spears for five years which will expire on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
              April 1831. They are both anxious, Alpheus especially to have it determined whether
              the lease is to be renewed or to cease— They have it at a rent already reduced from
              1000 to 600 dollars a year; and their object is to reduce it to 500. They are good
              Tenants; punctual in their payments, and keep the farm in tolerable order. <pb

              accidentally there, and told me the farm would not pay a rent of more than 500 dollars
              a year. I promised Alpheus to give him my definitive answer before my departure for
              Washington— I pursued this Evening the abstract of title deeds, and had time to read
              only a few pages of <persRef ref="condorcet-marie">Condorcet’s</persRef> life of

                <persRef ref="humphrey-zenas">his Son</persRef> came this morning, and proposed to

              Saltmarsh seven; all in the vicinity of Lands I now own. As non-residents in the Town,
              the taxes fall heavy upon them— The land is taxed in the Quincy valuation, at 3000
              dollars; but times are so hard they are willing to take for them something less. I
              desired them to furnish me from the title Deeds a description of the boundaries, and a
              specific Statement of the quantities, and said I would then tell them in five minutes

            <p>This is the anniversary of the marriage of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>, and the first
              day of public worship at the Meeting House after the erection of the Monument to their
              Memory— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P.
                Whitney</persRef> preached, from Luke 16.27. [“]Then he said, I pray thee therefore,
              father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house: 28. For I have five
              brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of
              torment.[”] The Sermon was upon a future retribution, of rewards and of punishments.
              He noticed the doctrine of Universal Salvation, or of exemption from all punishment
              hereafter, said it was believed by many—but contradicted by numberless passages of
              Scripture; and a very pernicious opinion; so I believe it— The effect of the creed
              upon conduct is not altogether ascertainable: but according to the operation of reason
              upon my mind the belief of the immortality of the Soul can have no influence upon
              morals, unless men hold themselves responsible hereafter for the conduct of life here.
              If all the divine purposes of human existence are accomplished here on earth, there is
              no consideration physical or moral which warrants the expectation of continued
              existence after death. The general tenour of the New Testament countenances the belief
              that the punishments as well as the <pb type="ms" n="285"/>rewards of futurity will be
              eternal; but there are passages of milder aspect, and it is scarcely possible to
              reconcile the idea of endless punishment with that of divine omnipotence and Mercy.
              God is almighty— He has made man weak and frail. Transgression is finite— Infinite
              punishment would be disproportioned to the Offence— Evil cannot be the end of
              Creation— The afternoon discourse was of the regular Series from 2. Peter 3.16. upon
              the passages in the New Testament, hard to be understood, and took up the Epistle to
              the Romans without explaining all its difficulties to my satisfaction— <persRef

                Humphrey</persRef> brought some of the Title Deeds of the three parcels of Land;
              which he has for Sale. There are little short of one hundred Acres. 50 of which are

              the Deacon was discussing my Titles to the lots in the 600 Acres; as usual advising me

              from the Title Deeds of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Estates. After
              dinner I was going to <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef>, to give him
              notice of our intended expedition to-morrow, when he overtook me, and agreed to go

                <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef>, for the last Shares I had
              purchased of him— I told him he might answer that I would give 60 dollars for a share,
              or 130 dollars for a share and note, which was about the same I had given M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Field. He said <persRef ref="savil-samuel">Samuel

              Evening to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brothers</persRef>, but did not see him.
              Returned home after dark, and read a few pages of <persRef ref="condorcet-marie"
                >Condorcet’s</persRef> Life of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>—
              The cold and solemn Sophistry with which he defends the Pucelle, provokes indignation
              and contempt— The Pucelle is a work of the grossest and basest immorality that ever
              was composed— <persRef ref="joanofarc">Joan of Arc</persRef> as a Historical character
              deserves not ridicule but reverence— She died a martyr for her Country, and if her
              enthusiasm was fanatical it was from a pure and holy source— She rescued her Country
              from foreign Invaders— She suffered with heroic fortitude— She was condemned and
              executed, by the most infamous of trials— Much of the marvellous in her Story is
              doubtless fabulous, but all the authentic history relating to her, is honorable to her
              memory. That <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> should treat her
              with injustice admits of some apology— That Voltaire should degrade her is disgraceful
              to him as a Frenchman. The licentiousness of the Poem is scandalous, and his undying
              rancour against Christianity was the unworthy motive of his choice of the Subject— The
              cold blooded philosophical <unclear>Panderism</unclear> of Condorcet, is more
              detestable even, than the cynical profligacy of Voltaire. The Pucelle is fit only to
              be read in a brothel.</p>

            <p>The weather was so warm that I slept with an open window on Sunday night— There was
              last evening a very light sprinkling of rain, and this morning a Crystal sky,
              Northwest wind, and cold atmosphere— <persRef ref="withington-mather">M<hi

                >Daniel Greenleaf</persRef> came soon after eight O’Clock, and we went for the
              fourth time into the Woods, to survey and finally adjust the bounds of the lot
              bordering upon land that was my uncle <persRef ref="adams-peter">Peter Boylston
                Adams’s</persRef>, upon which lot his Heirs have encroached by mistaken information,
              received from an old blind man, named <persRef ref="bass-joseph">Joseph
              Bass</persRef>, to whom they gave forty dollars, for pointing out to them this lot of
              Land as theirs, which belonged in truth to <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef> There was in all this no design to encroach; and probably no
              fraudulent intention in Bass—but the consequence has been that <persRef
                ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef> sold the wood upon the land; and then sold
              the Land itself— The descriptions of the Old Deeds are so indefinite that it is
              impossible to ascertain where the real bounds were; and I have finally been obliged to
              take an extension of the line at the Western extremity; a swamp of which the land is
              not worth five dollars, instead of as much land at the eastern entrance of the wood
              where it is worth perhaps sixty dollars an acre— Thus much for Peace, and to avoid
              family dissensions, and exposures. We now set up bounds, marking out the exact
              Quantity of the Land, with the common consent of all parties— M<hi rend="superscript"

              large Owen lot at 22 dollars an Acre— Thus that question was settled— There remained
              the Beale small Owen and small Borland lots to be ascertained, but M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington was unable to proceed any farther— He left us

              home about five. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf went and returned

              hundredths. By the same measure <persRef ref="withington-mather"
                >Withington’s</persRef> Chain is rather more than 1 1/2 inch too long— It is
              apparent that they stretch by usage. He brought me three of the plans of our first
              Surveys which he has prepared; but he makes of the Penn’s Valley farm only 91 acres
              and 3/4 in which there must be a mistake of at least 16 Acres; and probably more than
              20. I told him I thought it impossible his plan should be correct, and he took it back
              to revise it— We went out to resurvey the Lots which we had failed of ascertaining
              correctly in 1826. We went first to the lot twice surveyed by M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> Withington, once <pb type="ms" n="287"/>on the mistaken supposition that it
              was the 4. Acre Owen lot 30. August 1826. and again on the 25<hi rend="superscript"
                >th.</hi> of September 1826. when it was taken for the 6. Acre Borland lot, though
              it did not well correspond in dimensions with that. It was sold at Auction under the
              first survey, and purchased by me— We resurveyed part of this lot now, but meeting
                <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George W. Beale</persRef>
              who bordered upon the other lot, and was impatient to go home, we proceeded to that—
              It is the one surveyed by <persRef ref="bass-jedidiah">Jedidiah Bass</persRef> in
              1785. and which by his plan of that time contains more than 20 Acres— Twice surveyed
              by Withington in 1826 he made it at first over eleven, and the second time less than
              14 Acres. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale went with us to the corner bounds which
              were ascertained by an indication on Bass’s plan that there were then there four Bass
              wood trees— Those trees have been cut down, but on the spot where they grew, and where
                <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams</persRef> had seen them standing there are
              now four young trees of the same wood, and seeming to proceed from one Root, growing—
              There is a heap of Stones five or six Rods distant from these Trees, by whom put up is
              unknown—but which now pass for the boundary. Deacon Adams said they were not there
              when he saw the old Bass-wood trees standing, and he advised me to remove the heap.
              But I declined removing any thing— We pursued the North western course, till we came
              to the line between the Towns of Milton and Quincy on the Western border of a deep and
              except at a dry Season impassable Swamp— We found one of the boundary heaps of Stones,
              between the towns, and on the top of which is a flat stone with a red cross painted on
              its nether side— Then changing the course and reascending the hill we returned by a
              series of old boundary heaps to the four bass-wood trees which we reached just at
              Sunset—in the mean time having lost <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef>
              and <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef>, who after finding another of
              the red crossed boundary heaps, made their way home. From our Bass wood trees we had
              now a walk of near two Miles till we came out at Owen’s field, and thence into the
              Babel pasture, where my Carriage and the basket of provisions were waiting— We made
              our dinner there; I took Deacon Adams near his home in my Carriage; and reached home
              myself, little before seven O’Clock. <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C.
                Adams</persRef> had dined and spent the day here, but soon returned with her brother
                <persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef>— <persRef

              came again this morning for my answer respecting the Land which <persRef
                ref="humphrey-levi">his father</persRef> and he were inclined to sell me; but which
              I now declined to purchase— I had found upon enquiry that this Pasture Land was of no
              value; and they had told me that they had wished to sell the whole at once— He now
              offered to sell me the Saltmarsh for 60 dollars an Acre, which I declined giving. The
              price is very low; but I hear there is question about the title; and not wishing to
              discuss that with him, I broke off upon the price— It is dangerous dealing with these
              men, and necessary to be versed in their ways, which I am not— <persRef
                ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> came
              this morning and I settled with him for the bookshelves he had made for me— I desired
              him to call again upon me in two or three days—as I must have more made. At nine we
              proceeded again into the Woods— We met <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon
                Adams</persRef> at Owen’s Field— We commenced from a corner boundary White Oak tree
              which <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef> and <persRef
                ref="bass-josiah">Captain Bass</persRef>, joking upon a blunder of some old
              proprietor call the tree of three halves—and went round the lot till we came again to
              the same tree— <persRef ref="nightingale-josiah">Josiah Nightingale</persRef> has a
              lot of six Acres bordering upon this; and met us there— Some difference occurred
              between him and Deacon Adams concerning some of the old bounds, and it is yet
              uncertain whether <pb type="ms" n="288"/>our admeasurement will not encroach upon
              other claims— We went again to the four bass wood trees corner, where Josiah
              Nightingale shewed the bounds claimed by him, and where the two short lines West and
              North were again measured— We returned to the white Oak tree about 3 O’Clock and there
              dined, after which we parted from <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Humphreys</persRef>, and I went with Deacon Adams <persRef
                ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> and <persRef ref="baxter-elijah">Elijah
                Baxter</persRef>, over to my large Borland lot to examine where it might be proper
              to sell off the wood— We passed over the Bunker Hill Ledge Railway which is deserted,
              and went through my Borland lot. We then returned through Babel pasture, and I parted
              successively from Deacon Adams, and from William Spear and Elijah Baxter— I had sent
                <persRef ref="dutton-william">Dutton</persRef> home before— I was walking home, when
              I met my Carriage, which I had ordered to come for me to the entrance of Babel Pasture
              at Sunset, and in which I got home about that time. Spent the Evening in my chamber;
              leisurely writing. I have finished my Surveys for the present, and having been
              uncommonly favoured by the weather they have been less tedious than I had anticipated.
              At this Season of the year the leaves have withered, and are falling from the Trees.
              There is no vegetation, and scarcely a sign of life in the forest. No birds— No
              beasts— Not even Snakes. What I have most remarked is the difficulty of remembering
              any track in the wood, and the time that is consumed in measuring very small tracts of
              Land—a comparatively easy lot of 8 or at most 10 Acres has been almost the whole work
              of this day— With a little more knowledge of the ground I could with great ease have
              measured in one day what we have barely got through in three.</p>

              lot—from one of which is to be deducted a lot of about ten Acres conveyed to me by his

              a Sale which will produce nothing—of the policy of which I am doubtful; but he will
              see me again before the sale. I rode with <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">W. C.

              of Braintree, and enquired of him for the plans of the Commons lots sold by the Town
              in 1765. but he had them not. He said he had seen one of them within these eighteen
              Months in the possession of <persRef ref="brackett-james">James Brackett</persRef>
              who told him it was partly destroyed; but French said that my Pine Hill woodlots were
              upon that plan. He shewed me the Record books of the Town Clerk and Treasurer. The
              Treasurer’s book had a statement of all the persons to <pb type="ms" n="289"/>whom the
              lots were sold, and of the sums due from them for the purchase; but the Report of the
              Committee of Sale, specified none of the lots sold, but by reference to the plans. I

            <p>I had the day before yesterday received a Letter from <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel"
                >Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, enclosing one from <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty

              mentioned that there would be an opportunity to write by the Amethyst to sail for
              Liverpool to-morrow. Taking up Curtis’s Letter this morning, which in the weariness
              after three days of surveying I had not marked with sufficient attention, I saw that
              the business must be despatched this day, or that this opportunity for writing would
              be lost. I wrote immediately to Petty Vaughan, and with a duplicate of my Letter of
              29. September went with <persRef ref="thomas-john3">John Thomas</persRef> in the
              Chaise into Boston, against a violent Northwest Storm— I applied at the probate Office

              non-administered Estate of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef>,
              which was furnished me, and which I took to the lodgings of <persRef

              Common-lands; from the Claimants in Boston, with whom they compromised in 1700 and
              1709— Both of them were found; and I requested copies of them to be made out which I
              was promised for Monday or Tuesday. <persRef ref="davis-john3">J. B. Davis</persRef>
              called twice at the Office of my Son Charles, and returned me the Manuscript of my
              reply to the confederate appeal, with an earnest wish that it might be immediately
              published—but I propose to wait yet some time— I had seen at <persRef

              Rules and went there to purchase one; but found them on comparing them with some

              one of them to the City Surveyor <persRef ref="u">Beale</persRef>, who told him that
              there was no State Standard; nor any authentic long measure in the State. I posted up
              at the old and the new Court-house notifications of my appointment as Administrator de

              after much hesitation, the Storm still continuing returned this Evening to Quincy— I
