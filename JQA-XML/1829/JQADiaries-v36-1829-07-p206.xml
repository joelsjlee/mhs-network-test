						<p>The weather continued showery all the morning, and confined me to the
							house— It cleared off in the afternoon, cold— <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							went to Boston, and returned in the Evening— I gave Charles a Power to
							receive dividends on U.S. Stocks standing in my name, sealed and
							attested by two witnesses, but not being acknowledged before a Justice
							of Peace or Notary, it was not received. By his power of transfer
							however executed yesterday; he did transfer all the six per Cent Stocks
							which remained standing in my name; and purchased 43. Shares of the
							New-England Marine Insurance Company, at 3. per Cent advance; the
							Certificate of which he brought out with him— John made also a purchase
							of some furniture. I was employed much of the morning with the
							inspection of my Chests and Trunks of Books and papers: and began taking
							a list of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> manuscript
							Letter and Account Books. I find the paper in some of the Books damp,
							and beginning to grow mouldy; and some appear to be missing. After the
							sky cleared away I went with the Spade for half an hour into my Nursery;
							and then rode in the Carriage to visit <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2"
								>General Dearborn</persRef> at Roxbury; but he was he was not at
							home; and <persRef ref="dearborn-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Dearborn</persRef> was ill, and could not see me. Returning I called
							for half an hour at <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bailey’s</persRef> at Dorchester— He purchased at the
							Sale of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> books, his copy of my father’s Defence of the
							American Constitutions; and shewed me the Volumes— There are no
							manuscript annotations, but there are penciled indexes at particular
							passages, in the first and third Volumes and at the close of each of
							those Volumes written references to those pages, with asterisks over
							some of the references— The passages are all those which speak of the
							natural aristocracy in human Society; of its tendency to be continued in
							families, and of the expediency, of constituting them one branch of the
							Legislature. There is nothing that indicates any particular attention
							given by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson to any other part of
							the Book— When I got home I found at the house a man who said his name
							was <persRef ref="u">Layton</persRef>, and who from his conversation,
							appeared to be insane. His object was merely to see me—</p>

							made my second attempt with the Spade in my Nursery, before dinner, for
							about half an hour which thoroughly fatigued me— I expect by practice to
							be able to work longer; and it will serve me for exercise. I am arrested
							in the assortment of my fathers books by missing two or three of them
							which <pb type="ms" n="207"/>are yet to be found— I commenced some other

									>r</hi> Degrand</persRef>— I rode with my Son John down to the
							Mount Wollaston Farm, and saw the tenant <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"

							enquire whether it would be advisable that the Legislature of

							answer was that the elections to the Kentucky Legislature next August
							would turn entirely upon the question of supporting him— That if his
							party should prevail the Legislature would nominate him; after which
							others might do as they should think proper. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand that I thought this good advice—
							He said that the manufacturers were urgent for the immediate nomination
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay; but he agreed that it would be

							as the circumstances of the time may render proper.</p>

								<persRef ref="curtis-adam;curtis-samuel">Adam and Samuel
								Curtis</persRef>, called upon me about the half acre of Land which
							Samuel wished to purchase of me, and upon which he proposes to build a
							house— The land was appraised at the rate of 600 dollars an Acre— I told
							Samuel last week that I should ask 400 dollars for a half Acre—eight
							rods in front and ten rods deep; and the father now said he wished it to
							be considered as settled, that he would take it— I told him that I
							proposed to have all my land upon and round Penn’s Hill surveyed and
							planned; and that this half-Acre might be measured off at the same time—
							He said the land itself had belonged to his Great grandfather, and that
							there had never been a time for these 160 years, without a Samuel Curtis
							in this Town. I worked with the Spade an hour and a half in the Nursery
							before dinner— I propose to substitute this exercise instead of riding
							on horseback; neither of my horses being suitable for the saddle. On
							turning my attention to the papers relating to the Execution of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> will I found there was much
							to be done by me, and I began the preparation of the papers to be
							executed. My bond of 4. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1826. requires
							a systematic continuation of performance by me for a series of years to
							come, which had almost escaped my recollection, but which I cannot
							forget with impunity— <persRef ref="humphreys-anne">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Humphreys</persRef> from Boston paid

							of the <persRef ref="codman-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi

								ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							Curtis had recommended a <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys</persRef> of Weymouth, and
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> a <persRef ref="u"

							principle remaining intangible by themselves, or by their husbands if
							they should marry— I recommended to them to have it placed in trust, in
							the Hospital Life insurance Company in Boston. They are to take it into

								<persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Easterly Storm— Rain all the morning Beclouded all the rest of the day.
							Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> this Morning from 2. Corinthians 7.2. “We have
							corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.” the latter part of the
							verse— The discourse was practical. The duty of all Christians to
							regulate their conduct so as to be enabled to affirm the same of
							themselves was enforced in plain language, and with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s usual earnestness of manner. The
							examples of corrupting others against which he directed his admonitions
							were adapted to his auditory and suited to making good impressions— His
							afternoon Sermon was from 2. Peter 3.16. part of the verse— “In which
							are some things hard to be understood.” This remark of <persRef
								ref="peter">Peter</persRef> which is made of the Epistles of
								<persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney considered as applicable to the Scriptures generally and
							especially to the New Testament. His particular object was to explain
							certain passages in the gospel of <persRef ref="matthew"
								>Matthew</persRef>, and he had preached a previous Sermon of which
							this was the continuation— He attributed the difficulties of
							understanding the Scriptures to the figurative language with which they
							abound, and said there was more of such language in the Bible, than in
							any other Book— The passages which he commented upon were however only
							two or three in S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Matthew and he did not
							go very deep for his explanations; but he observed that which must and
							ought to satisfy every searcher into the Scriptures, that the difficult
							passages are not those which are necessary to regulate the conduct of
							human life— That these are all plain and easy. Such is my own belief,
							although a man of mind disputatious with itself may find perplexities in
							every verse— The weather confined me to the house the remnant of the
							day, but <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> went into Boston, to
							put a Letter into the Post-Office; and brought me one out from <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>.

								Bass</persRef> came this morning and urged me again to take his
							Share in the Quincy Canal giving him for it a check for 70 dollars, and
								<persRef ref="bass-jonathan">his father’s</persRef> Note to the
							Executors of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> for forty
							dollars given 3. October 1826. with interest two years and nine Months,
							being 5:60. which was set off by a receipt from Jonathan Bass for a pair
							of Boots furnished me in September 1827. charged 5. dollars and upon
							which I allowed interest also from that time. Morning visit from
								<persRef ref="jones-t">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jones</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bicker</persRef>.— We dined at one and immediately after dinner I
							went to Dedham to attend the probate Court— I first took my Deeds to the
							Register’s Office— I found there a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Cobb</persRef>, who told me that <persRef ref="foord-enos">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Enos Foord</persRef> the Register was
							gone upon a short excursion for his health, and left him in charge of
							the Office. He took and minuted my Deeds; but observed that the
							discharge of <persRef ref="veazie-george">George Veazie’s</persRef>
							mortgage, though signed by him and witnessed on the back of the mortgage
							was not conformable to the Statute of the Commonwealth; because not
							sealed or acknowledged before a Justice of the Peace— On looking to the
							act I found that the Release must be sealed and acknowledged, or the
							mortgagee must repair to the Register’s Office, and there sign an
							acknowledgment of the discharge of the Mortgage, on the margin of the
							record— I took back the mortgage, to have Veazie’s discharge duly
							executed upon it— Leaving the Deed from <persRef
								ref="adams-ebenezer;adams-josiah">Ebenezer and Josiah
								Adams</persRef> to me, and Bass’s mortgage to me to be recorded— I
							found at the Probate Office, <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="boylston-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Lane Boylston</persRef>, and I signed with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Curtis, the first Account of the Administration, made out by
							him, to which we were sworn; I stating to the <persRef
								ref="robbins-edward">Judge Robbins</persRef> that my oath was given
							in confidence of the accuracy of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis’s
							proceedings— The judge proposed and directed an allowance of 5 per Cent
							to the Executors on the monies disbursed— I said I should receive no
							part of it hitherto: having taken until this time no active part in the
							Administration. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John L. Boylston has a
							claim upon the Estate for eighteen years of services to <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">his father</persRef> at 500 dollars a year— The
							Executors referred this claim to the judge, who declined deciding upon
							it by his authority, but proposed a reference of it, to <persRef
								ref="paine-nathaniel">judge Payne</persRef> of Worcester. <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goodwin</persRef> of
							Princeton, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> of that neighbourhood, to which all parties
							present assented, and the judge said a Commission should be made out
							accordingly— I spoke of my appointment as guardian of the two Grandsons
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston, <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Nicholas</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="boylston-thomas">Thomas</persRef>, and referred to the two
							passages in the will concerning it— But there being some question as to
							the extent of the guardianship intended by the testator, the judge
							deferred issuing the Letters of Guardianship till his next probate
							Court, which will be held at Quincy on the first Tuesday of next Month;
							when I told him I expected there would be an account of the Executors of
							my father to be settled— After leaving the Court I went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							John L. Boylston to <persRef ref="u">Bride’s</persRef> tavern; and
							looked over <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Petty Vaughan’s</persRef> Account with the <pb type="ms" n="212"
							/>Executors, and some questions occurring respecting the monies to be
							recovered from the Estate of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">T
								Boylston</persRef>, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis wished me
							to see and converse with <persRef ref="lowell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> John Lowell</persRef>, who was
							employed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward N. Boylston, upon the
							settlement of the Estate, and I agreed to call upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis to-morrow afternoon, and go with
							him to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell— I got home at Quincy
							between 8 and 9 in the Evening.</p>

							He had a book with him of engraved models of such monuments some of

								<persRef ref="shirley-frances">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Shirley</persRef> in the Stone chapel. I called on <persRef

							the certificate of the Share transferred to me by <persRef
								ref="bass-benjamin">Benjamin Bass</persRef>, to have one made out in

							a release on the back of it for Veazie to execute, and walked across the

							where at the door I saw <persRef ref="whitney-george2">George

									>r.</hi> Ward N. Boylston’s</persRef> Estate and a narrative of
							the principal transactions of his connection with the Affairs and Estate
							of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef>— It is the
							most complicated individual history that ever came to my knowledge, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward N. Boylston’s proceedings in it
							were managed with more success resulting from his industry and
							perseverance than I have ever observed in any other case. There are
							however some grave questions still pending concerning his rights and
							particularly concerning the rights and duties of his Executors with
							regard to the Estate of T. Boylston— From M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lowell’s statements I now understand how the legal advisors of <persRef
								ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef>, have perswaded him to
							call upon me for a release of my rights as representing one of his

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis to his house; there called at
							<persRef ref="bussey-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B—
								Busseys</persRef>, but he was not at home; and I got back to Quincy

								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W.

							60 dollars each— The appraisers of <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George’s</persRef> effects have this day appraised his share at
							that sum; and I have given Bass 110 dollars for his— I shall not pass
							for a close bargainer.    <persRef ref="foster-james">Foster</persRef>

						<p>My Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> went to Boston this

							with the spade between Noon and two O’Clock; bathed at 6. in the
							afternoon at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="whitman-benjamin2">Judge Whitman</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="whitman-caleb">his son</persRef>, with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf paid me an afternoon visit— The judge

							that he was at <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> at

							to the Hill, to-morrow morning.— I read this afternoon a few of the
							Letters of <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du

								<persRef ref="louis-xv">Louis 15</persRef>. in writing at ten
							O’Clock at Night to the <persRef ref="montmorency-louis">Bishop of
								Orleans</persRef>, for cotignac for the king’s daughters— The
							Letters are amusing; but the excessive fondness of the old Lady for
								<persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef> is inexplicable. It is too
							steady to place to the account of caprice; too warm from the heart, for
							imputing it to insincerity, too absurd for bringing within any line of
							reason. Such Letters should be read as they are received, only one at a
							time.</p>

						<p>I enter this day upon my grand climacteric, with a consciousness that the
							actions of my life, have not in gratitude to God, or in services to my
							fellow creatures been such as they ought to have been. I have no right
							to hope or expect so well of the future than I can think of the past. My
							life for the public is closed and it only remains for me to use my
							endeavours to make the remainder of it useful to my family and my
							neighbours if possible. To this I am directing my purposes, for which I
							find a great deficiency of energy. I pray that it may be supplied me
							from abroad— A person by the name of <persRef ref="chamberlin-ebenezer"
								>Chamberlin</persRef> came this Morning to offer me another Share of
							the Quincy Canal, for which he asked <unclear>20</unclear>0 dollars— I
							offered him 130 dollars for the Share and Note; the rate at which the
							Share I gave <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> was appraised
							in Boston, and at which <persRef ref="beale-benjamin2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef> estimates them. He
							declined taking this but <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							said he would come back— A man by the name of <persRef ref="williams-g"
								>Williams</persRef> who had much the appearance of a vagabond and
							rogue, sent me a Letter marked private, and begging a few minutes of
							private conversation— He pretended to be an Englishman, but his Speech
							was Irish— He told me a long Story of a Shipwreck, and of a Gentleman in
							New-York, who had five thousand pounds Sterling of his, in deposit and
							whose name he had forgotten, and he had now but a few Cents, and wanted
							Assistance; any that I was disposed to give him; which was nothing.
							Charles went to Boston <pb type="ms" n="214"/>and goes this Evening to

								Greenleaf</persRef> came, and I walked with him upon the Hill; I
							shewed him the place where I propose to build a House, if I find it
							practicable— I conversed with him upon the proposal for opening of the
							Square on which the School House is to be built; and of a plan to be
							prepared by the Supervisors of the Temple and School Fund— During the
							vacation at Cambridge, <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> will pass some time
							here, and we agreed that there should then be a Meeting of the
							Supervisors— It will be necessary for me to address to them in writing,
							all that I have to propose— Morning visits from <persRef
								ref="melville-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Melville</persRef>, late Naval Officer at Boston, and <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef>; with whom
							I had some conversation, about the treatment of the Crevecoeur breed of
							fowls, which I take to be the same as <persRef ref="leclerc-george"
								>Buffon</persRef> calls the Poule de Caux. Visits also from <persRef
								ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Silsbee</persRef>, of Salem, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi

									>r</hi> Artiguenave</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">his

							7.21. “Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
							kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in
							Heaven” and in the afternoon from 2. Corinthians 10.1 part of the verse
							“I beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.” Both the
							discourses were upon the peculiar Spirit of Christianity; humility,
							benevolence and Charity— They were well written and well read; perhaps
							rather too slow; but with good accent and emphasis and without cant— The
							auditory listened with great attention. <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"
								>Alpheus Spear</persRef> had a child baptised by the name of
								<persRef ref="spear-abigail2">Abigail Knapp</persRef>. The
							Deportment and appearance of this Congregation strikes me as very highly
							improved within a few years— The House writes elegance with simplicity,
							and has an evident moral influence upon the Society— There is a Choir of
							Singers male and female consisting of young persons in humble but
							respectable life, whose performance is creditable and improving; and
							amounting to about thirty in number. There is no Organ but a
							Violoncello, and Violin. <persRef ref="belknap-jeremy">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Belknap’s</persRef> selection of
							Psalms and Hymns is excellent, and the younger preachers shew their
							taste and judgment, in giving out for the singers those which are best
							adapted to the purport of their Sermons— The tendency of all this is to
							soften, to civilize, and to promote morals and happiness— Will the
							blessing of God continue upon these efforts? and may they be pursued
							with pure intention, and devout sincerity? After the second service
								<persRef ref="cranch-edward">Edward Cranch</persRef> called upon me;
							and afterwards a person by the name of <persRef ref="u">Chapin</persRef>
							from Providence— I drafted an Account for <persRef ref="adams-john">my

						<p>Saturday afternoon I rode alone with one of my horses in the Chaise to

							the old road from Weymouth over Penn’s Hill. This morning immediately
							after breakfast I spaded one hour in my Nursery, and believe this may
							answer for the exercise of a day. I finished my Letter to the

								>Russell Freeman</persRef> late Collector at New-Bedford, paid me a
							morning visit: being on his return from Boston with <persRef ref="u">his

								Rufus G. Amory</persRef>, who now resides at Stirling, but was now
							going with his Sister <persRef ref="mclean-ann">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. N.
								Boylston’s</persRef> foundations of Medical prize Dissertations.
							There was a bond and mortgage of the first, both in my hand writing, and
							acknowledged before me as a Justice of the Peace in April 1803. which
							had escaped entirely my recollection— There was a Bond also upon the
							Institution of the Elocution prizes; purporting to have annexed to it a
							Regulation for the manner of performing the prize declamations, but it
							was not so annexed, nor has any such paper been found among those of the
							late <persRef ref="kirkland-john">President Kirkland</persRef>. He filed

								Curtis</persRef> had put into my hands a Copy of this missing

							Harvard University, are of three separate sums of 1000 dollars each,
							besides three Portraits; and they seem to be additional to the sums
							which he had secured to the University by the two Bonds, and the

							whether the Legacies shall be paid during the life of <persRef

								>Harvey Fields</persRef>—but he was not at home—at <persRef

							pay the interest on both, and if I wished it the principal of the Note
							to the Executors by the first of October; when the second payment on the
							Meeting House Pews will become due. I asked M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tufts if he had the Will of <persRef ref="quincy-norton"
								>Norton Quincy</persRef>, of which <persRef ref="tufts-cotton2">his

							questions arising from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s Will,

						<p>The Summer begins to shew itself—my <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> was at 85. and I indulged
							myself in trifling indolence pleading to my self the heat of the
							weather— The high tide was marked in the Almanack at 10.47. I went to

							high tide at New and Full Moon at Boston is at Noon. I swam to the lower
							wharf, and was twenty minutes in the water— I wrote to my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> a Short Letter, and recommenced a
							copy of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W.
								N. Boylston’s</persRef> Will. I also resumed the observations upon

							but did not come out this evening. In the afternoon <persRef

								Charles Miller</persRef>, and her brother who lives with her
								<persRef ref="smith-w2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W.

							while I was there— <persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

							the matter and the manner are frigid— I read however a Sermon of

							“We walk by faith, and not by sight.” Cool and argumentative— A
							plausible answer to deeply perplexing questions— Why the Creator has not
							seen fit more clearly to disclose to man the certainty of his own
							existence, and of Man’s immortality. Human Reason, is sufficient to
							perceive the difficulty, but not <pb type="ms" n="219"/>to discover its

							outgrowing the grass. That it grew to a height of near five feet and
							seeded That from that seed he raised the next year an handful, the third
							year more than a pint, and this year he has near a bushel of the Oats—
							They have grown with his grass: he had with him a bundle of the Stalks
							which were nearly five feet high: he says they weigh 32 pounds to the
							bushel, and will yield ninety bushels to the Acre— Cattle and the fowls
							are greedy of the seed, of which he has exhibited a specimen to the
							Agricultural Society, and was advised by them to keep choicely every
							kernel of the seed— The original stalk though cut with his grass
							continues alive and yields seed every year. I gave credit to this
							marvelous tale, and took four Quarts of his seed at his own price to
							make an experiment with it. The day was the warmest there has been this
							Summer, and my thermometer in the house at 86. I did nothing but my

								<persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieutenant Adams</persRef> was here
							part of the morning— <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef>
							came and talked about butchering, farming, Quincy Canal Shares, and his
							Rent— He told me there were about twenty-Acres of my Land, under Lease
							to him, covered with bushes, and yielding nothing but fresh meadow
							grass, good for nothing which might be brought over to produce English
							Hay; which he had done with some adjoining land of his own— It is land
							formerly overflowed by the Mill-Pond; the privilege of which was
							repurchased some years since— I walked to the ground in the afternoon
							and viewed it with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Field— The Land has
							gone to Ruin by bad management, and now will cost more to recover than I
							can expect it will ever yield— Returning home I met a man named <persRef
								ref="hayden-elijah">Elijah Hayden</persRef>, who spoke to me about
							the same land covered with bushes, which he offered to cut down and burn
							on the ground for me at half a dollar a day. He is now going down to the

							“And his disciples asked him, saying, Master who did sin, this man, or
							his parents, that he was born blind?” and in the afternoon from Job.
							11.7. “Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
							almighty unto perfection?” The first introduced the enquiry into the
							cause of evil; and the second into the Nature of God— Both these are
							profound and prolific themes, and it indicates an active and
							enterprizing mind in so young a man to undertake to grapple with them.
							They are both beyond the depth of the human fathom; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s thoughts are not much matured.
							The existence of evil, is an objection either against the Power, or
							against the goodness of the Creator—to which human reason has no answer
							but ignorance—why it is so, we know not— To pretend to account for it is
							presumption. An agent, intelligent of cause and effect, is inferable
							from what we ourselves perceive of the invisible creation— We give the
							name of reason to the faculty in Man which discerns the relations of
							cause and effect and we suppose the exercise of the same faculty to be
							exercised by the Creat<unclear>or.</unclear> But cause and effect
							suppose a succession of Time; and to the Creator there is no
								Time<unclear>. Cau</unclear>se and Effect suppose change, and in the
							creator there is no change— Matter exists in space, and space is
							infinite; but how Spirit can operate upon matter, otherwise than by
							material agency is incomprehensible— We cannot reason because we cannot
							know— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quincy</persRef>, President of the University at Cambridge called on

							agreed with <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> T. Greenleaf</persRef> upon Tuesday; but consented to
							change the day, as I propose going to Weston on Tuesday— I shewed him
							the drafts of an Account, and of a Deed and mortgage to be executed by
							the Executors of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>. He
							approved the account and mortgage; and took the draft of the deed with
							him for examination. I spoke to him of the donations and bequests of
								<persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. N.
								Boylston</persRef>, to Harvard University, with regard to which he
							appeared to be not altogether correctly informed, and I concluded that
							our future arrangements of that concern should be in writing. He
							mentioned that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences had this year
							chosen <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bowditch</persRef> their President— They had for the eight or nine
							preceding years elected me— And he said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bowditch had desired him to say to me, that he had not accepted, and
							would not accept without my consent. I requested him to say to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch that I wished him by all means to
							accept. I have indeed been a mere nominal President of the Academy;
							never having been able to attend one of their Meetings in that capacity.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy said that if Bowditch did not
							accept there was danger that <persRef ref="farrar-john">Professor
								Farrar</persRef> would be elected, and Bowditch thought M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Farrar was now engaged upon other than his
							proper business. He said also that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Field</persRef> came to renew his advice to me to undertake the
							recovery of the Fresh Meadow of the old Mill pond; but was not prepared
							to give me an estimate of the cost of the work, nor to name a sum for
							which he would undertake it— He proposed to begin with five or six
							Acres; and to employ two workmen for three months at my expense for that
							purpose. I told him that before I embarked I wished to know where I
							should land. He proposed to hire the farm for five years, at 250 dollars
							a year the first three years and at 300 the last two, but we came to no
							definitive determination. <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">M<hi
