						<p>My Diary will henceforth be a record of thoughts rather than of facts—
							This day was a day of Showers—and in the Evening there was a long, Heavy
							Storm of Thunder, Lightening Rain and Hail— <persRef ref="persico-luigi"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Persico</persRef> was here all
							the morning, and took a final sitting for the mould of my Bust in clay—
							I walked an hour before dinner—and passed the remainder of the day and
							Evening with my family, or in my study reading and writing. I was
							suffering with a rhumatic head-ache, which dulled my faculties, and
							prevented me from finishing my Letter to <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Governor Barbour</persRef>; and also from making much progress in
							my Reply to the Appeal of the Boston confederates— I read two or three
							Chapters of <persRef ref="pelham-henry">Pelham</persRef>, among which
							that containing the Character of <persRef ref="clutterbuck-christopher"
								>Christopher Clutterbuck</persRef>, the twin brother as the <persRef
								ref="bulwerlytton-edward">author</persRef> acknowledges of <persRef
								ref="sampson-dominie">Dominie Sampson</persRef>; but he has given
							Christopher a Shrew and Slattern for a wife, and has degraded the
							Classical Studies, by representing them as destructive of health and of
							life, and as leading to no more useful result, than a voluminous
							Dissertation upon the Greek participle; with a self-conceit of the
							writer, as if it placed him on a level with Newton. Now that the
							tendency of Classical Studies, may be to absorb too large a portion of
							the mind, in the contemplation of language, may be true—but it is not
							necessary— The most important and laborious duty of a Protestant divine
							is the composition of Sermons; the weekly Instruction in Religion and
							Morality, of which he is the dispenser to his flock— To qualify him for
							the performance of this duty, Classical learning is no useless lumber—
							It is no unprofitable study to him; that which enables him to read the
							Scriptures in their original Languages—which acquaints him with the
							writings of the fathers—which makes him familiar with the Philosophers,
							the Poets, the Historians, the Orators of Greece and Rome— If the
							teacher of Religion, can use the knowledge of the language in which
							Christ spoke, and his apostles wrote to no better purpose than to
							compose a Dissertation upon the Greek participle; if the teacher of
							morals, can draw no available funds, from the language of <persRef
								ref="pythagoras">Pythagoras</persRef> and <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato</persRef>: if the Christian Orator can draw no shaft from the
							quivers of <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="quintilian-marcus">Quinctilian</persRef>, or of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>; the fault is surely not in his
							studies— If his Lamp affords no light, it is not for lack of Oil, but
							because he hides it under a bushel.— I began also to read the eleventh
							Philippic of Cicero.</p>

						<p>Cloudy Day. From three to five I rode my horse the ten mile square; by
							the College, the Race ground, <persRef ref="smith-samuel">S. H.
								Smith’s</persRef>, the Capitol Hill and the Pennsylvania Avenue—
							This is my favourite ride; so that I now scarcely ever take any other—
							The reasons for which are, that is just of the suitable length for a two
							hours ride— That I return, not by the same road that I go out— That the
							road itself is good—and that it gives an extensive prospect, opening at
							different places in various aspects— And then there is the natural
							propensity of treading over the same ground that one has trodden before—
							I observe this day almost the first appearances of vegetation— Spots of
							verdure, colouring upon the ground— But my mood was not pensive— At
							home, I continued writing upon my reply to the Appeal— Finished a Letter
							to <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>— Read
							Sections 6–10. of the eleventh Philippic; and a very few Chapters of
								<persRef ref="pelham-henry">Pelham</persRef>— The notes are changed
							to Tragic— The Chapter giving the account of the murder of <persRef
								ref="tyrrell-john">Sir John Tyrrell</persRef>, is written with great
							powers of description both of the Scenes of nature, and of the dark
							passions of the Soul. <persRef ref="scott-walter">Walter Scott</persRef>
							is the founder of this School of writing, and the <persRef
								ref="bulwerlytton-edward">author</persRef> of Pelham, is an imitator
							not inferior to his original— There is more of nature <pb type="ms"
								n="152"/>in the characters, more of variety in the dialogue; less of
							pedantry in the discourses and more frequent transitions in the
							narrative than in Scott— There is also more invention, the basis of
							Scott’s novels being historical; and this being altogether fictitious—
							All writing for the Public should have some moral purpose— This indeed
							is the intended purpose of most if not of all of the novels of the
							present age— There is a refinement of delicacy in them which renders
							them more suitable for youth, but which takes from their merit as
							pictures of manners— Pelham goes to Paris—but he paints only Duchesses,
							and Gamblers—Salons and Boudoirs. In England it is the same— High Life
							in London, and Palaces in the Country. Almack’s, or Newmarket—
							Notwithstanding this, he gives great interest to the Story, and abounds
							with wit, though he has very little humour— <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> went again to spend
							a week or ten days at <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge
								Cranch’s</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>3. V:30.</date> Friday.</p>
						<p>From three to five I rode my ten miles round; and the rest of the day was
							absorbed chiefly upon my reply to the appeal. I received a Letter from
								<persRef ref="romaine-benjamin">B. Romaine</persRef> of New-York
							with 12 Copies of a pamphlet upon this same controversy, and a Letter
							from <persRef ref="treadwell-oliver">O. W. Treadwell</persRef> at
							Baltimore, enclosing one from his female Correspondent; not yet signing
							her name, but he says he shall be at <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
								>Gadsby’s</persRef> to morrow, and offers to deliver her
							communication to me in person— I finished reading the eleventh
							Philippic— <persRef ref="dolabella-publius">Dolabella</persRef> in
							concert with <persRef ref="antony-mark">Mark Antony</persRef>, had
							murdered treacherously, <persRef ref="trebonius-gaius"
								>Trebonius</persRef> at Smyrna, and made himself Master of the
							Province of Asia, which had been assigned by the Senate to Trebonius—
							The Senate had thereupon declared Dolabella, to be a public Enemy; and
							the question now was to whom the command should be given to prosecute
							the War against him— He advises giving it by decree to <persRef
								ref="cassius">Cassius</persRef>, who with <persRef
								ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef> had levied an Army in Greece
							and Asia without authority and this was accordingly done— The Anarchy
							which followed upon the Death of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius
								Caesar</persRef>, seems wonderful. The Conspirators do not appear to
							have made any arrangements for any subsequent movement— They seem to
							have thought there was nothing more for them to do. Nothing but to kill
							Caesar— Here we have Mark Antony, <persRef ref="lepidus-marcus"
								>Lepidus</persRef>, <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius
								Caesar</persRef>, Brutus Cassius, Trebonius, Dolabella and others
							all levying armies without regular authority. In this case the whole
							weight of the Oration is to dissuade the Senate from assigning the War
							against Dolabella to the Consuls— There is much oratory in the praise of
							Brutus and of Cassius— The fine Sentiments in this Oration are Section.
							3. It is the duty of a wise man to premeditate every thing that can
							happen to him; to bear it with fortitude— There is more of wisdom in
							providing against the event: but not less of Spirit to bear it bravely
							if it happens— 4. For as much as the power of the soul exceeds that of
							the body insomuch the pains of the mind are severer than those of the
							body. 6. Whence you may judge that my differences are not with men, but
							with the Cause. 7. Dolabella himself is daring, rash, addicted to the
							gladiatorian form of Death. 11. In this great Revolution and
							perturbation of things, it is necessary, rather to yield to the times
							than to principles— Dolabella had been the husband of Cicero’s daughter
								<persRef ref="tullia">Tullia</persRef>. While I was riding this day
							I undertook to make a paraphrase of <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La
								Fontaine’s</persRef> Fable of the Plague among the Beasts— I found
							it fell naturally into a ten lined Stanza; of which two were fashioned
							during my ride. Neither Tale nor Fable is usually written in that form
							the tendency of which is to too great stiffness for their light and airy
							composition— Read two Chapters only of <persRef ref="pelham-henry"
								>Pelham</persRef></p>

							with <persRef ref="hamilton-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>— Of the new Administration he is the only person
							who has shewn me this mark of common civility— <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> had received from me
							attentions of more than a common character—besides obligations of a much
							higher order, which at the time when they were rendered he had expressly
							acknowledged, and declared he would remember. All the members of his
							Administration have been with me upon terms of friendly acquaintance,
							and have repeatedly shared the hospitalities of my house— I never was
							indebted for a cup of cold water to any one of them; nor have I ever
							given to any one of them the slightest cause of Offence— They have all
							gradually withdrawn from all social intercourse with me—from the old
							impulse “odisse quem laeseris.” They hate the man they have wrong’d—
								<persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef> is among the basest of
							my Slanderers— <persRef ref="branch-john">Branch</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">Berrien</persRef> have been among the meanest of
							my persecutors in the Senate— Among them all there is not a man capable
							of a generous or liberal Sentiment towards an Adversary, excepting
								<persRef ref="eaton-john">Eaton</persRef>, and he is a man of
							indecently licentious life— They have made themselves my adversaries,
							solely for their own advancement, and have forfeited the characters of
							gentlemen, to indulge the bitterness of their self-stirred gall. Van
							Buren, by far the ablest man of them all, but wasting most of his
							ability upon more personal intrigues, retains the forms of civility; and
							pursues enemity as if he thought it might be one day his interest to
							seek friendship— His principles are all subordinate to his ambition, and
							he will always be of that doctrine upon which he shall see his way clear
							to rise— Our conversation was about the weather and the climate, and
							upon the negotiation with the Porte, which from a late paragraph in an
							English newspaper, I fear is broken off. <persRef
								ref="warrington-lewis;warrington-margaret">Commodore and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Warrington</persRef> were here, and
								<persRef ref="raymond-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Raymond</persRef> of Baltimore, a writer upon Political Economy, and
							upon Politics— Ingenious but eccentric and extravagant— I rode my ten
							miles round, and while on my horse compos’d three Stanzas of my Fable. I
							had composed one at home this morning. On returning home I found
								<persRef ref="treadwell-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Treadwell</persRef> at the house. and he delivered to me three
							Letters from <persRef ref="u">Miss Whittlesey</persRef> of Middletown,
							in Connecticut, the correspondent from whom I had received former
							Communications— I read half the twelfth Philippic of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>—and answered a Letter from
								<persRef ref="gosman-robert">J. Gosman</persRef> Secretary of the
							Philoclean Society at Rutgers College, New Brunswick New-Jersey,
							accepting an appointment as an honorary member of that Society. The

						<p><date>5. V:15.</date> Sunday.</p>
						<p>The morning was foul, and I rode to the Presbyterian Church, where I
							heard <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> preach from John 3.18.— “He that believeth not is
							condemned already”— This is a part of a verse which separated from its
							context bears a different sense from what it has, taken with the
							context— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell considers unbelief as
							the great sin of the impenitent—and he thinks great numbers are
							unbelievers without being aware of it themselves— His Discourse which I
							think was not more than twenty minutes long consisted of an enumeration
							of all the causes of unbelief; and he particularly noticed the great
							delusion almost universal, of Sinners that they cannot controul their
							own belief— The doctrine is not congenial to my belief, and when I hear
							a very earnest oration, to show that which I do not believe, there is
							something irksome to hear it— I do suppose that thinking men cannot
							controul their belief; nor can I think them under a very heavy
							responsibility for a belief which I cannot command my <pb type="ms"
								n="154"/>judgment to be satisfied. After the Service M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell gave notice of an Agreement by
							which the second Presbyterian Church, and that in F. Street under
								<persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Laurie</persRef>, are to be united, and to form one Church— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie to preach only on Sunday afternoons
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell to perform all the others
							Services. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell gave notice also that
							he was going this week a Journey, to be absent about a Month during
							which his pulpit would be supplied— I saw the President at Church—the
							first time I had seen him since the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							March 1825— Coming out of the Church I met <persRef ref="slade-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef>, who told me
							that the rumours of five dismissions from the Department of State of
							which he was one, were not yet made as had been reported— I walked home—
							I finished reading the twelfth Philippic of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>— It was upon a proposal that he himself should be
							sent upon a deputation with <persRef ref="publius">Publius
								Servilius</persRef> to <persRef ref="antony-mark">Mark
								Antony</persRef>— The Argument is first against sending any
							deputation—secondly and specially against <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
							being sent— Yet he finally concludes by saying that he will go, if he
							can with safety to his life— Much of the argument against his going is
							drawn from the personal danger to his life; and the picture that he
							draws of the danger of his situation even at Rome is terrific— He
							repeats however his lofty Sentiments of Liberty; and declares that his
							caution to preserve his own life, is only for the service that he may
							still render to his Country— I finished also the fable of the Plague in
							the Forest, an imitation of <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La
								Fontaine’s</persRef> Animaux Malades de la Peste, of which I wrote
							this day five Stanzas.</p>

								Fendall</persRef> came out and I gave him five sheets of my Reply to
							the Appeal— I had a long conversation with him upon his projected
							history of my Administration; and upon my political Life— He has asked
							me repeatedly to furnish him some Notes for a preliminary political view
							of parties from the formation of our confederacy, which I have promised
							to give him; but which I have not yet had time to prepare— But he said
							he thought of making that the last Chapter, which he should write, which
							I told him I thought would be his best plan. He has not yet been
							dismissed from the Department of State, but expects it from day to day—
							He remarked upon the singularity of my fortune and history that I was
							perhaps the only man who had risen to the highest Office in the Union,
							by a course of action, independent of all parties— <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>
							of Newbury-Port was here—informed that he was going to Europe, intending

							Letters of introduction. This is a request always unpleasant to refuse,
							and seldom agreeable to comply with for persons who are totals
							Strangers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing is somewhat known as a
							public man; and was a tutor at Cambridge when <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2">my two elder Sons</persRef>, were
							Students there— I have no other acquaintance with him— While I was

							Turnpike-road, and thence round the Square, returning by the Race-ground
							and the College. An hour and a quarter’s walk. I attempted to compose
							part of a Fable; but failed— There certainly are times and Seasons for
							composition more favourable than others— My fable of the Plague in the
							Forest came almost of itself; and this day what I did is fit only to
							burn— On returning home I found <persRef ref="hay-george">judge
								Hay</persRef>, and his Son <persRef ref="hay-charles"
								>Charles</persRef>—who has been dismissed from his Office as Chief
							Clerk of the Navy Department, at which they are both indignant— The
							judge says that he visited the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef> twice; and spoke to him of his anxiety for his
							Son— The General told him he must not believe rumours and reports— They
							were without foundation— No person would be removed from office, unless
							he had abused it for electioneering purposes. The judge said he told
							this afterwards the same day to a gentleman who snap’d his finger and
							thumb three times and said the Generals promises were worth that— Judge
							Hay and Persico, both spoke to me of my Letter to the New-Jersey Rahway
							Committee which is published both in the National Intelligencer, and
							Journal of this Morning— The judge said he would call and see me again
							and mentioned that, at the advice of <persRef ref="rives-william">M<hi

							taught <persRef ref="moliere">Molière</persRef> the art of rhyming with
							difficulty— All composition for the public should be laborious. Ajoutez
							quelquefois et souvent effacez— I can add much to the force of my reply,
							from ideas collected by the perusal of these papers. But in the manner
							in which I am treating the subject I fall into numerous repetitions— In
							argument, perhaps such repetitions are useful and even necessary. In
							history or biography they should be carefully avoided. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey has clearly marked the three
							periods of the New England efforts to convene a Representative Assembly;
							and the occasions of the failures in the two first instances.— There is
							an abundance of vulnerable matter in the numbers of One of the
							Convention— The pains taken to obtain the consent of all the members of
							the Convention to his publications. The deposit with <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton</persRef>, of a certified copy of the Journal of the
							Convention, the incipient complaints of abandonment by the writers party
							and that others as bad as he, had been forgiven; meaning <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">Rufus King</persRef>.— Insinuations that he
								<persRef ref="otis-harrison">Otis</persRef> had been over-persuaded
							to go to the Convention; and admissions that he had discovered <pb
								type="ms" n="156"/>since, that these Conventions are very dangerous
							things, are all worthy of Note— The manifestations of public
							dissatisfaction at the appearance of those papers is very strong, and he
							finally desisted from the completion of the task he had undertaken, awed
							by the symptoms of impatience that they had excited— I rode before
							dinner the ten Miles-round; and composed a short fable imitated from
								<persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaine’s</persRef> Medecins
							Tant-pis and Tant-Mieux, a complete failure— All the wit of the original
							consists in the names of the two Doctors, which are not translatable—
							There is scarcely a single fable of La Fontaine, but has some exquisite
							expression so buried in the idiom of the French language that it cannot
							be rendered in any other— <persRef ref="butler-john">M<hi

								Whitaker</persRef> was a Journeyman at <persRef ref="gales-joseph"

								>Seaton’s</persRef> printing office— By the loss of the printing for
							Congress which they have sustained, in these political vicissitudes, he
							has been thrown out of employment, and wants the assistance of a loan of
							200 dollars payable in one and two years to make payment for a lot which
							he has purchased upon credit; and a house which he has been building
							upon it. <persRef ref="savage-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Savage</persRef> is the Consul of the United States at Guatemala,
							lately returned from that Country, and recovering from a severe attack
							of fever and Ague— He is a native of Barnstable Massachusetts, and was a

							paid me a morning visit, and is going to see <persRef ref="u">his
								father</persRef> at Barnstable— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> wrote to our Son
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, inviting him to come
							here, and accompany us home to Quincy— I took my ride at an earlier hour

								ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver
								Wolcott</persRef>. I continue writing also upon my Reply to the

							many men of influence and Power in this Country, that I find it
							impossible to pursue my own justification without the application of the
							Scourge to them— My attempt this day on <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean"
								>La Fontaine’s</persRef> Oak, and Willow failed, as had yesterday
							the Coach and the fly. La Fontaine varies continually the measure of his
							verse. There is only one of his Fables in Stanza’s— The Cock and the
							Pearl— Almost all are in lines of different length— Phaedrus is all in
							Pentameter— The narrative of Fables should approach as much as possible
							the Style of familiar Conversation; for which irregular verse is best
							adapted. La Fontaine mingles with this some splendid versification, and
							even lines of Sublime poetry and this is the perfection of Fable
							writing— The English fabulists <persRef ref="gay-john">Gay</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="moore-edward">Moore</persRef>, wrote all their fables
							in one measure—couplets of eight syllables— These are not well suited to
							the high flights of poetical expression, nor to the familiarity of
							dialogue for comic humour. There are a few Fables of <persRef

							Fontaine, and I think them among the best in the Language.</p>

								Whitaker</persRef> was here again this morning, with two Notes and a
							Mortgage, drawn by <persRef ref="hall-david">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hall</persRef>; but which was deficient as Security to
							me. I mentioned to him an addition to it which would be necessary, and
							he took it away for amendment. There were two heavy thunder showers,
							with hail, one in the morning and the Evening; but between the two I
							took a ride of an hour and a half upon my horse; reaching home only five
							minutes before the violent thunder-gust came on. While riding I
							continued my essay upon <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La
								Fontaine’s</persRef> Oak and Willow— Still a failure— Received and
							answered a Letter from <persRef ref="robbins-thomas">Thomas
								Robbins</persRef>, about writing a History of America— Received also
							a Letter from <persRef ref="hammond-charles">Charles Hammond</persRef>
							of Cincinnati Ohio— Finished reading the 13<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> and began the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Philippic.
								<pb type="ms" n="157"/>This is next to the second, perhaps the most
							remarkable of them all— The debate was upon a decree of the Senate,
							proposed, approving certain Acts of <persRef ref="pompeius-sextus"
								>Sextus Pompeius</persRef> the Son; and upon Letters from <persRef
								ref="lepidus-marcus">Lepidus</persRef> recommending Peace with
								<persRef ref="antony-mark">Mark Antony</persRef>. The Argument of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> is, that peace with
							Antony is impossible— It begins with a beautiful encomium upon Peace,
							and expressions of abhorrence to civil War. But contends that Peace must
							be consistent with Liberty, and that the guilt of War is chargeable upon
							those who would reduce their Country to Servitude. He names <persRef
								ref="sylla-lucius">Sylla</persRef>, <persRef ref="marius-gaius"
								>Marius</persRef>, <persRef ref="cinna-lucius">Cinna</persRef>, and
							alludes without naming him to <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius
								Caesar</persRef>— Half the Oration is devoted to an examination of a
							Letter from Antony to <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus">Hirtius</persRef> and
							to <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>, the whole
							of which Cicero reads and comments upon Sentence by Sentence— The Letter
							is well written, and shews the unfortunate position of all the parties
							who then supported the Cause of Liberty— The purpose which Antony
							declares is to punish the murderers of Julius Caesar— Hirtius was one of
							Caesar’s most devoted subordinate commanders. Octavius was his adopted
							Son— <persRef ref="brutus-decimus">Decimus Brutus</persRef> besieged by
							Antony in Mutina, was one of Julius Caesar’s assassins— <persRef
								ref="trebonius-gaius">Trebonius</persRef>, put to death by <persRef
								ref="dolabella-publius">Dolabella</persRef> at Smyrna, was another,
							and Dolabella, decreed by the Senate to be a public enemy had been the
							Son in Law of Cicero. Thus Cicero was obliged to turn his invective
							against his own Son in Law; to justify the murder of Julius Caesar, and
							yet to load with praises and Honours Octavius Caesar, and the Consuls
							Hirtius and <persRef ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>; while Antony to
							them appeared in the attitude of Avenger of the Death of their father
							and friend— His Letter which Hirtius had sent to Cicero sets off all
							these circumstances in a very striking manner, and is of itself
							sufficient to shew that the affair scarcely could terminate otherwise
							than it did; by the Triumvirate— Antony glories in the murder of
							Trebonius by Dolabella—offers Peace, if the troops of Decimus Brutus
							will surrender him up to be executed, and speaks with the most bitter
							and sneering rancour of Cicero— He reviles me, says the Orator as if his
							former reproaches had succeeded—but I will deliver him with the brand of
							foul and just reproache stamped upon him is the everlasting memory of
							mankind. There are several fine Sentiments expressed with great beauty,
							and a contrasted enumeration of individuals opposed to Antony, and of
							his partizans, in keen and indignant Irony. It is next to the second,
							the longest of the Philippics.</p>

								Whitaker</persRef> came this Morning with his amended mortgage,
							which was executed, with his two Notes— <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Connell</persRef> of Philadelphia
							was here. He has come upon the business of the Claims upon the Danish
							Government; in the prosecution of which he expects to embark shortly for
							Copenhagen— He mentioned that he had not seen <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, who had prepared Instructions to <persRef
								ref="wheaton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheaton</persRef>
							the Chargé d’Affaires in Denmark; but Connell thought them not
							sufficiently particular, and he shewed me a paper which he had written
							containing the particulars of the Instructions which he wished might be
							given. Their principal object was to exclude the cases which had been
							insured, and paid for in England— He goes upon his return to
							Philadelphia to-morrow— I returned to him <persRef ref="u">his
								Son’s</persRef> Album, which he had left with me last January. I
							rode my ten miles round before dinner, with a slight sprinkling of rain
							on my return— I finished much to my dissatisfaction the fable of the Oak
							and the Willow— Yet it might be amended to be readable. I also finished
							reading the fourteenth and last of the Philippics. It was delivered upon
							the accounts being first received at Rome of the Battle at Mutina, in
							which <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> had been defeated by
							the Consul’s <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus">Hirtius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>, and by <persRef
								ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>. The question was of
							the honours and rewards to be bestowed upon them and their troops—
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> proposes honorary
							rewards to the three Generals, and that each of them should be styled
								<hi rend="italic">imperator</hi>— That the surviving Soldiers should
							receive the rewards promised them, and that they should be extended to
							the Parents and brothers of those who had been slain— He speaks with
							great feeling of the <pb type="ms" n="158"/>consternation which had
							prevailed at Rome some days before, when there had been rumours of
							defeat at Mutina; and of the great joy with which the real success of
							the Consuls and of Octavius Caesar, had been received— He describes the
							joy which the defeat of Antony had occasioned, and defends himself
							against having suffered the fasces to be carried before him the day
							before when almost the whole population of Rome had escorted him to and
							from the Senate.— This was the last of his Orations; for very shortly
							afterwards the treacherous triumvirate of Antony, Octavius Caesar, and
								<persRef ref="lepidus-marcus">Lepidus</persRef> was formed, and
							Cicero was barbarously murdered— These fourteen Orations, were all
							composed, within about a year after the death of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef>— They exhibit the
							expiring agonies of Roman Liberty. And they carry with them a melancholy
							interest when read with a recollection of the Catastrophe which ensued.
							There are two ideas which form the basis of argument in the whole
							series— First that Servitude is worse than Death, and secondly that
							Liberty was a peculiar property of the Roman People— That other Nations
							could endure Servitude but that the Roman people could not— But the
							civil Wars of <persRef ref="sylla-lucius">Sylla</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="marius-gaius">Marius</persRef> and <persRef ref="cinna-lucius"
								>Cinna</persRef>, and the career of Julius Caesar had destroyed that
							character of the Romans. They were prepared for servitude, and nothing
							could save them from it— There is an ominous presentiment running
							through all these Orations, that the Life of the Orator is staked upon
							them—and is scarcely pursued in any thing else but to perpetuate this
							error— <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef> says that Cicero
							purposely polished these Orations more <unclear>thany</unclear> others
							that he had ever delivered before; but there is too much sameness in
							them both of form and Subject— But the noble sentiments contained in
							them will preserve them forever.</p>

								<persRef ref="jarvis-russell">Russell Jarvis</persRef>— He told me

							Boston, and that <persRef ref="boyd-john3">General Boyd</persRef> was
							appointed in his place— <persRef ref="henshaw-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Henshaw</persRef> is also the

							written at Sea and at Valparaiso, in Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>
							and Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1828. It gives her a very

							notices of <persRef ref="delamar-jose">La Mar</persRef> the President
							and <persRef ref="lunapizarro-francisco">Luna Pizarro</persRef> a member
							of Congress of Peru— And it speaks with great severity of <persRef

							been a very honourable one to himself; creditable to the Administration
							which appointed him and highly useful to the Country. He has obtained a

								<pb type="ms" n="159"/>concluded a Commercial Treaty, so
							advantageous that it has been ratified by the present President, by and
							with the advice and consent of the present Senate. Tudor unadvisedly
							asked and urged last Summer permission to return to the United States,
							which I gave him and which I am afraid he will now not be allowed to
							retract. His health has been much affected by living in tropical
							climates, and he was not aware how difficult it would be after getting
							out of the public service to get in again— – His mother and Sister

								Rush</persRef>, at whose house I also called, and then walked home—
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef> soon afterwards

							last—from <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>; and from
							<persRef ref="plumer-william">W. Plumer</persRef>, and I wrote to <persRef ref="hammond-charles">C. Hammond</persRef>. I read also the 14<hi

								>Atticus</persRef>— Those which immediately followed after the Ides
							of March when <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> was killed—
							I have neither Dictionary, nor translation, nor Index Latinitatis at
							hand; and I find the Epistles much more difficult to read than the
							Orations. There is a continual admixture of Greek words—sometimes whole
							phrases— There are numerous allusions to Letters from Atticus which are
							not given. Many idiomatic and proverbial phrases, which require a
							thorough familiarity with the language— An elliptic style leaving out
							half the words <pb type="ms" n="160"/>which would be necessary to make
							the sentences grammatical. Studied obscurity by the use of figurative
							words understood only by his correspondent— Sudden transitions from
							public to private affairs and vice versa, and fragments of thoughts just
							hinted at for the memory or imagination of his correspondent to
							complete, all require a Commentary which I have not, and which for
							reading the orations is seldom needed— There are 22 Letters written
							between the Ides (15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>) of March and the
							first of June—shewing the fluctuation of his feelings, his doubts, and
							alternate hopes and fears, in observing the conduct of <persRef

								>Dolabella</persRef>, <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus"

								<persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef>— The 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> encloses copies of a Letter from Antony
							to him and his Answer. Antony requests his consent to the restitution of
							the Estate of <persRef ref="clodius-publius">Publius Clodius</persRef>,
							for the sake of his Son <unclear>Sextus</unclear>, a tender minded
							youth; and pretends that it was so decreed in the Acts of Julius Caesar;
							but protests he will not do it without Cicero’s consent— The Letter is
							full of deference and complacency—and Cicero answers with equal courtesy
							and professed affection— But in the Letter to Atticus enclosing these
							copies, he speaks with execration of Antony and of his Acts, and says
							they sometimes make him wish Caesar back again— He adds as a reason for
							the facility of his compliances, that Antony having determined upon it
							in his own mind, would have done it, in spite of any opposition that he
							could have made— This is duplicity beyond the mark. This I presume is
							the Letter which Antony read to the Senate the day before Cicero
							pronounced the second Philippic—and upon the production of which he
							replies in the fourth Section of that Oration with such exquisite force
							and beauty— The 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> encloses a copy of a

							the Book he hints at the danger of his appearing in Rome, and of the
							certainty of destruction to Brutus and <persRef ref="cassius"
								>Cassius</persRef> if they should shew themselves there. The whole
							book is deeply interesting. I made a ridiculous imitation of <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cannon</persRef>, a
							stranger, called upon me this morning, and told me that he belonged to
							Richmond, Virginia—that he was transiently here at Washington, and came
							merely from curiosity to see a man, about whom so much was said both by
							friends and enemies. I had some conversation with him, upon topics of a
							general nature, and upon the projected Convention in Virginia, for the
							amendment of their State Constitution. <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef>, and <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							have consented to serve as members of it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cannon said nothing to me from which I could judge what his own opinions
							were upon any political subject. <persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> the Commissioner of
							the General Land-Office was here. He had written to me on Saturday, and
							sent me the papers relating to the engagement last Summer of <persRef
								ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph M.
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida as Assistant Counsel, and
							Compiler of Public Documents, for the trials upon Land-Claims in
							Florida— There is some question upon the extent of his engagement, and
							how far he is bound to argue cases, before the Courts in Florida, in Aid
							of the Attornies of the United States there, and before the Supreme
							Court in aid of the Attorney-General here— His engagement was upon a
							Letter from himself dated at Saratoga Springs the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> August last, to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Graham, of which he White, furnished me with a copy on the
								16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and the acceptance of the terms of
							which I authorised in a Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham
							of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Graham thought the engagement more extensive than M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White now admits it to have been—and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham appeals to my opinion I had
							examined all the papers this morning, and told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Graham that the extent of the engagement must be measured by
							the terms of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White’s Letter, for they
							were accepted. That I had understood the engagement as more extensive
							than he was said now to admit, but not so much so as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham insisted for— He was engaged to
							argue some causes, <pb type="ms" n="161"/>and I had supposed they would
							embrace most if not all of those which would be brought up from Florida—
							One of his express engagements was to argue all causes against which the
							Commission of which he was a member had reported as fraudulent— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham said the Law did not allow any of
							the cases excluded as fraudulent to come before the Courts— I said then
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White’s engagement was hardly fair,
							but I did not so understand it— There might be cases before the Courts,
							the parties to which were different from those reported against by the
							Commissioners, but whose titles might be contested on the same
							principles— I considered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White engaged
							not to be Counsel for any claim, excepting those of <persRef
								ref="forbes-john2">Forbes</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="arredondo-fernando">Arredondo</persRef>. To aid the District
							Attorney, and the Attorney General with his Advise, and to furnish them
							with all Documents in his possession to sustain the right of the United
							States; but if he was required to <hi rend="italic">argue</hi> cases
							other than those specified in his Letter, he would have a right to claim
							additional compensation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham told me
							that the Supreme Court at their late Session had decided against claims
							founded upon the grants to the <persRef ref="alagon-unknown">Duke of
								Alagon</persRef>, and <persRef ref="punonrostro">Count Puñon
								Rostro</persRef>; but that the Chief Justice had intimated that he
							and one other of the judges were of opinion, that the grant to <persRef
								ref="vargas-pedro">Vargas</persRef>, being of land in West-Florida,
							and excluded by name in the king of Spain’s explanatory ratification of
							the Treaty, other grants similarly situated if any there were, might
							thereby be confirmed— I told him, and shewed him by reference to the
							Treaty in the Volume of the Laws, that the grant to Vargas, was dated
							after the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1818. and
							therefore by the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the Treaty
							absolutely null and void—which he said he was surprized the judges had
							overlooked— I told him of the fourberie that the Spanish Minister
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>, attempted to pass upon me
							in this transaction, using the agency of <persRef
								ref="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, to deceive me, without letting him know his
							object, and the equivocal declaration which de Neuville extorted from
							him after his trick was discovered— Also the mistake I made in taking
							the date of the King of Spains Order to the Governor of Cuba, for that
							of the dates of the grants to Alagon and Puñon Rostro— I rode my ten
							miles round before dinner and mused upon <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean"
								>La Fontaine’s</persRef> fable of the Vultures and the Pigeons— And
							I read the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Book of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— Grievously needing a
							translation or Commentary— The interlarding of Greek is very annoying,
							but is explained by the Index Graeco-Latinus in the Clavis— The
							Geography is aided by the Index Geographicus, but wants antient maps—
							The word omitted in most of the Sentences is the verb, a practice
							admissible only in Letters of the most intimate familiarity— In the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter he first speaks of <persRef
								ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>, whom he had seen—
							Says he was intelligent, lively, and disposed towards the Heroes (the
							murderers of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef>, as
							they would wish[)]—but what reliance was to be placed upon his years,
							his name, his inheritance, and education, was for great advisement. Aye
							and these were the portents of what was to come— Cicero foresaw, but he
							could not foreclose. He speaks in the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of his Books of Offices, and in the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							a Book upon Glory. The Letters continue to the beginning of Quintilis;
							but have no dates either of time or place. <persRef ref="adams-abigail2"

								Gales</persRef> called this morning and introduced <persRef ref="u"
								>Major Baird</persRef>, of North Carolina, one of our friends he
							said who had a curiosity to see me— We conversed upon subjects of no
							present importance— Of the propensity that some of our distinguished
							military men, particularly <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General
								Gaines</persRef>, <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General
								Scott</persRef>, and <persRef ref="porter-david">Commodore
								Porter</persRef> have to fancy themselves the greatest writers of
							the Age.— The day was fine though still cool; and I rode my ten Miles
							ride, in which I finished my imitation of <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean"
								>La Fontaine’s</persRef> fable of the Vulture’s and the pigeons;
							which I did in couplets of eight Syllables; the measure of <persRef
								ref="gay-john">Gay</persRef> and <persRef ref="moore-edward"
								>Moore</persRef>— This is the easiest measure for such imitation,
							and I think I could paraphrase all La Fontaine in the same manner— Would
							I could employ my hours of idleness and relaxation to some more useful
							purpose— But in these versifications I never can satisfy myself— I read
							14 Letters of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> book of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, the greater part of which was
							unintelligible to me for want of a Commentary. His half-sentences with
							the verb omitted are provokingly obscure. He uses this Style, in none of
							his formal Letters to other persons. <pb type="ms" n="162"/>Every word
							of them is intelligible— These Letters through great light upon the
							Philippics. Those of this book contain the minute account of Cicero’s
							attempt to go into Greece the Summer after the death of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef>, with the intention of
							returning to Rome on the ensuing first of January when it was expected
							the new Consuls were to enter upon their Offices— But after embarking,
							and being twice driven back by adverse winds he concluded to return to
							Rome— The first and fourth Letters mention the horror which <persRef
								ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef> felt at the change of the name
							of the Month of Quintilis into July—which name Brutus positively refused
							to acknowledge— It is remarkable that the name of July should have
							prevailed to this day— In the sixth Letter he sends him his Treatise
							upon Glory— He had sent him before a Prooemium or preface, but it
							happened to be the same which he had sent before with the third Book of
							Academics—he now sends him another— In the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Letter he says Nemo doctus umquam (multa autem de hoc
							genere scripta sunt) mutationem consilii, in constantiam dixit esse— In
							two of the Letters he speaks of his Books of Offices, and remarks that
							that name also was new. And he asks Atticus to approve it or to give him
							another—</p>

								Persico</persRef> came, and finished a miniature Portrait of me in
							Crayon <unclear>dust?</unclear> which he has drawn as a present, to my

							half before dinner— The Rockville Turnpike or five Mile Square— I
							composed an imitation of <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La
								Fontaine’s</persRef> Fable of the two Cocks: 7.13. Another failure—
							I still prefer the Stanza, to the short couplet for the form of the
							Tale— I can embrace most of La Fontaine’s ideas by varying the
							phraseology; but his humour is inimitable by me— There is scarcely one
							of his fables, but has some stroke of this exquisite humour, but his
							morality is very loose, and sometimes very bad— He is always satirical
							upon women: often upon monks—upon Lawyers, Physicians, Courtiers and
							Princes—all which may be excused; but his continual scoffing upon
							marriage is pernicious— His Tales are excessively licentious and in the
							last years of his life he was so afflicted with remorse for having
							written them, that he performed penance for them by wearing a Cilice or
							Hair Cloth— This fable of the Cocks has two or three strokes of keen
							Satire upon women— I read also the remaining Letters of the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Letters to <persRef ref="atticus-titus"
								>Atticus</persRef> which come down only to the time when Cicero
							returned to Rome, before he pronounced any of the Philippics. I read
							also the Correspondence between him and <persRef ref="brutus-marcus"
								>Brutus</persRef> afterwards, down till after the second Battle at
							Mutina, when both the Consuls <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus"
								>Hirtius</persRef> and <persRef ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>
							were killed. Brutus complains with great severity, both to Cicero and to
							Atticus of Cicero’s compliances to and flattery of the boy <persRef
								ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>. The apology of
							Cicero is that the restoration of the Republic depended exclusively and
							entirely upon the course which Octavius would take; Cicero encloses to
							Brutus copies of two of his Philippics, to which he tells him he has
							given that name— There is no Letter to or from Cicero giving an account
							of the assassination of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>.
							In the last Letter of the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> book to
							Atticus, he mentioned his having entertained Caesar at supper on the
							third day of the Saturnalia, about two Months before the Ides of March—
							The first Letters of the next Book were written sometime after Caesar’s
							Death—but how long after does not appear. In the third he says he thinks
								<persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> is paying more attention
							to his banqueting than to the breeding of mischief— At the close of his
							sixteenth book are Letters to <persRef ref="plancus-lucius"
								>Plancus</persRef> and to <persRef ref="capito-gaius"
								>Capito</persRef>, and to <persRef ref="cupiennius-gaius"
								>Cupiennius</persRef>, explaining all the passages in preceding
							Letters relating to Buthrotum— In the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>

							upon the only subject which now furnishes materials for conversation at

							are effected a few at a time, and in such manner as to keep up a
							constant agitation and alarm among the Office-holders— Multitudes of
							applicants are kept in suspense, and now and then one goes off
							gratified. The appointments almost without exception are conferred upon
							the vilest purveyors of Slander during the late electioneering campaign,
							and an excessive disproportion of places are given to Editors of the
							foulest presses— Very few reputable appointments have been made and
							those confined to persons who were indispensably necessary to the
							office, such as <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef>
							to the place of Chief Clerk in the Treasury Department— Huntt says that
								<persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van Ness</persRef> of Vermont
							is to be appointed Minister to the Netherlands, and <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">C. Hughes</persRef> is to be recalled— The
							weather is warm, and I rode the ten mile round composing a Fable in
							imitation of <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaine’s</persRef> Crow
							playing the Eagle— The last line of this fable, contains one itself,
							like a crab in an oyster— This fable I put into irregular verse— I
							snatch about half the ideas of La Fontaine; mingle them up with about an
							equal number of my own, and through them into careless feeble verse— I
							received a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							and began one in answer to him but could not finish it. I return to the

							third— That had been completed by <persRef ref="posidonius"
								>Posidonius</persRef>: which Supplement Cicero says he has not; but
							has sent for it; and also for an abstract of the chapters— The word

							Kalorama out on the road to <persRef ref="adlum-john">Adlum’s</persRef>
							as far as <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Charles Nourse’s</persRef> and
							then return’d through Georgetown, and by the President’s house— A ride
							of two hour’s. I finished the fable of the Frogs praying for a king; and
							began that of the Fox and the Goat. This occupation is too easy; and my
							fables are too ill executed— I must attempt some thing more difficult,
							and finish it better; or return to doing nothing while I ride and walk.
							I finished reading the first, and read the second of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles of Cicero to his
							brother <persRef ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef>, then commanding
							as Propraetor in the province of Asia— He had been there already two
							years; and was continued much against his own inclination, and that of
							his brother a third year. The first Letter is long, kind and
							affectionate; and advisory, with regard to his conduct and Deportment in
							performing the functions of his magistracy— An admirable Treatise, full
							of principles applicable to every person vested with authority; even at
							this day— The most exalted and the most benevolent morality pervades
							every line of this Letter, which is a model of instruction given with
							the affection of a brother and the tenderness of a Parent— I would I had
							learnt it by heart thirty years ago— Quintus it appears had a harsh
							temper, and was subject to violent sallies of anger. He had hurt his
							reputation much by this in the two first years of his Government, though
							less in the second than the first. His brother exhorts him with the most
							persuasive eloquence to controul his temper altogether; though from the
							second Letter it seems he was not successful— I took out also the Volume
							of <persRef ref="maximus-valerius">Valerius Maximus</persRef> to look
							into it— I wrote to <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef>
							and enclosed to him a Letter of Introduction to <persRef
								ref="smith-john">John A. Smith</persRef>— And I began a Letter in
							answer to one from <persRef ref="condict-lewis">Lewis Condict</persRef>—
							The Spring is coming on very late. The Rosebushes are just putting out
							their leaves: the Poplars their Catkins; and the Peach trees are <pb
								type="ms" n="165"/>in blossom. <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail
								S. Adams</persRef> left us again, for another visit to <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Elliot</persRef>. The
							newspapers announce this morning the appointment of <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">Louis M’Lane</persRef> of Delaware, as Envoy
							Extraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary to Great-Britain in the place
							of <persRef ref="barbour-james">James Barbour</persRef> removed— This is
							the most painful incident to me which has occurred since the change of
							the Administration; and it proves the utter heartlessness of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef>— He, and M’Lane and
							Governor Barbour were all partizans of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> in 1825. M’Lane
							voted for him in the house, and thereby gave him the State of Delaware—
							M’Lane is utterly incompetent to the Mission to London; and if he does
							not disgrace the Country, will effect nothing for her interest. His only
							merit is the sale of himself and his Crawford Stock to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>— But he will give him and
							Van-Buren trouble— No Administration can make bad appointments abroad
							with impunity—</p>

						<p><date>19. V:15.</date> Easter— Anniversary of Lexington Battle.</p>
						<p>Warm day. Trees all blossoming or putting out their leaves. I walked to
							the Presbyterian Church, and heard a Stranger preach from John 1.29.
							“Behold the lamb of God; which taketh away the sin of the world.” It is
							painful to me to hear a Calvinist preach upon this text; and to witness
							the solemn and fervent sincerity with which they pour out absurdity and
							nonsense— The mind of man delights in Truth in the abstract, and is
							perpetually seeking falsehood in the concrete— Warned of the
							imperfection of my own reason, I distrust its conclusions as I do those
							of others, and when I consider what man is, whence he comes and where he
							goes physically, I wonder only at the degree in which he does possess
							the power of linking together cause and effect— That he should form the
							conception of God, of eternity, of a future State, of mind, independent
							of matter; and I cannot account for the Passion which I most intensely
							feel, for continued existence hereafter— The preacher told us to-day
							that it was all owing to curiosity, which he said was innate in man—and
							he illustrated it by reminding his hearers how anxious they were to see
								<persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>, when he was
							in this Country. He further said that if there was a great Military
							Commander who had saved his Country in War (<persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> was present) or if
							there was a Great Man in another line, who had rendered services as a
							Statesman, (God forgive me for my thoughts when he said this) there was
							a universal curiosity to see them—but how he got from this to his text I
							scarcely remember—he did however get there— After the Service I called
							upon <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, and found <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> C. F. Mercer</persRef> with him— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush has postponed his departure for
							England, in consequence of the dangerous illness of <persRef
								ref="rush-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rush</persRef>,
							who is recovering and out of danger— He expects to go about the last of
							this week— I congratulated M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer upon
							his re-election to Congress, and mourned sincerely at the removal of
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> and the
							appointment of <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Louis M’Lane</persRef> as
							Minister to Great-Britain in his place— I walked home, and after
							finishing very ill <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La
								Fontaine’s</persRef> fable of the Fox and the Goat, I thought I
							would try my hand upon <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef>— I took
							the Ode to Aristius Fuscus Book 1. Ode 22. but found Horace quite
							otherwise unmanageable than La Fontaine— I did nevertheless make out an
							Ode in three eight lined Stanzas and comprising in the main the ideas of
							the first eight and last eight lines of Horace’s Ode. I left out the
							wolf and Lalage, which constitute to be sure the body of that most
							delicious poem—and I gave it a more grave and solemn close; mixing up
							with it an idea, from the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Ode of the
								2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Book to Grosphus, and one from the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Ode of the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Book— The great fault of my Ode is that the first half of
							the third Stanza is feeble, and not in keeping with the last. In the
							evening I finished my Letter to <persRef ref="condict-lewis">Doctor
								Condict</persRef>, and read a few pages of <persRef
								ref="maximus-valerius">Valerius Maximus</persRef>, an author with
							whom I have never before been conversant. His Latin is not easy, and his
							Style not very clear— His book is a collection of memorable sayings and
							doings: a compilation of Anecdotes illustrative of certain principles of
							Religion and Morals, divided into nine Books, and classified under
							particular Titles— Tis a Common-place Book.</p>

							Quixotism enough to get his own party into all sorts of trouble. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s answer is guarded, and cautious— In
							his Letter to me he intimates his intention to decline an election to
							Congress— I read only two or three pages of <persRef
								ref="maximus-valerius">Valerius Maximus</persRef>. In the Chapter
							upon Auspices, he says that <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> being at the villa Cajetana, a Crow in his
							presence plucked off the iron hour hand of a Clock, and immediately flew

							Altogether his Letter shews that he is not willing to tell all that he

							each of eight syllables with alternate rhyme the best measure for the
							fable; no one measure indeed is good for a succession of fables, and
							indeed they are a species of Poetry of which only one should be read at
							a time— The very practice of composing them palls upon my taste, so that
							I become ashamed of wasting upon them even the time devoted to my daily
							exercise— It seems to me that I could employ it more usefully—but I seek
							in vain the means— This however, together with my reply to the appeal,

						</lg>
						<p>The whole Ode is full of charming philosophy; but these two Stanza’s
							strike me at this time as of exquisite beauty— <persRef ref="horace"
								>Horace’s</persRef> Stanzas are of four lines—mine are of six, and
							make rather a paraphrase than a translation— It is impossible to
							concentrate thought into single words in English as it is in the Latin—
							I have translated for example the single word Jupiter, by a whole line
							“Tis the same Being Good and Wise”— The thought is in Horace— It was
							Jupiter Optimus Maximus, who was Lord of the Air, and restored or
							discarded Winter— But the direct expression of the wisdom of goodness
							which preside over these changes of the Seasons, seems to me to add both
							to the Poetry, and to the Philosophy of the Verses: and the turn of
							piety which it gives to the whole Ode adds to its Pathos— I never
							understood the antithesis of the Lyre and the Bow of Apollo, till this
							day— The single thought running through the whole <pb type="ms" n="169"

						</list>
						<p>I received this morning a note from <persRef ref="seaton-william">Captain
								Seaton</persRef> of the Volunteer Companies of the City, informing
							me that this was the day of their first annual parade; and that they
							were desirous of paying their respects to me, previous to my departure
							from the District: and enquiring if I should be at home, at One O’Clock.
							I sent him for answer that I should be at home, and would receive the
							Companies— <persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef>, heretofore
							second Auditor of the Treasury, now dismissed from Office called to see
							me— He spoke to me with great feeling and disgust at the treachery and
							peculotion of <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">Watkins</persRef>, the
							bitterest drop in the cup of my afflictions; for although I am in no
							respect answerable for it, and no administration can escape from such
							defalcations, yet it will be charged as a stain upon the Administration,
							and actually proves the profligacy of one of its most earnest and active
							friends— The cause was that detestable vice of gambling. Lee says that
							his own official concerns are settled, and that his Successor <persRef
								ref="lewis-william3">Major Lewis</persRef> told him it was
							impossible that the Office should have been kept in more perfect order.—
							The proscriptions from Office continue; and independent of the direct
							misery that they produce, have indirectly tragical effects—a Clerk in
							the War Office named <persRef ref="henshaw-john">Henshaw</persRef>, who
							was a strong partizan for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson’s</persRef> election, three days since cut his throat form
							ear to ear, from the mere terror of being dismissed— <persRef
								ref="smith-linnaeus">Linneus Smith</persRef> of the Department of
							State, one of the best Clerks under the Government, has gone raving
							distracted, and others are said to be threatened with the same calamity—
							Lee told me in Confidence, that he was secure of an engagement which
							would yield him five or six thousand dollars a year, which I hope may
							prove true; but of which I fear he merely flatters himself— He told me
							he expected his son in Law, <persRef ref="maltitz-friedrich">Baron
								Maltitz</persRef>, and <persRef ref="lee-mary">his
								daughter</persRef> back from Europe soon.— That Maltitz had written
							the last four Acts of a German Tragedy, the first act of which had been
							written, and left a fragment by <persRef ref="u">Schell</persRef>. That it had been brought out at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg so successfully that it
							had a run of 38 Nights. Soon after one O’Clock, the four Volunteer
							infantry companies came out, and drew up in line in front of the Portico
							of the house— Captain W. W. Seaton who was at their head addressed me
							and said that they had been desirous of coming to pay their respects to
							me, and to assure me of their good wishes for my health and happiness
							before my departure— I answered him that I was very happy to receive
							them, and was glad to have an opportunity of returning my thanks to
							them, and through them to all of the Inhabitants of the District for all
							the kindness I had experienced from them in the twelve years that I had
							been residing here. The Officers were invited into the House and took
							some refreshments; which were also sent out to the men upon the ground—
							After which upon their resuming their arms I went out and passed through
							the line shaking hands with every individual among them— They then paid
							me a Marching Salute, and filed off after being here about two hours—
							Among the Officers were <persRef ref="u">Captain Burch</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fay</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poor</persRef>, and
							<persRef ref="u">Captain Hickey</persRef>— <persRef ref="elkins-jeremiah2">Jeremiah Elkins</persRef> was the
							Adjutant— Burch told me that he had named his seventh Son after me—
							After they were gone I rode my ten Mile round; and composed the Fable of
							the Cock and the Fox—badly— But I finished the imitation tolerably to my
							satisfaction of the Ode to Licinius— There is a spell of Versification
							upon me, but it brings forth nothing original—and I shall look back to
							it with a Nausea; as waste of Time— <persRef ref="adams-abigail2"

						<p>I walked to the Second Presbyterian Church, and heard <persRef
								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie</persRef>
							preach from John 6.56. [“]He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
							blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.”— The meaning of these figurative
							words he said was explained by Jesus himself, for which he quoted the
								35<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse of the same chapter “And
							Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall
							never hunger: and he that believeth on me shall never thirst”— So that
							he said to eat the flesh and to drink the blood of Jesus was to believe
							on him— To believe on him in his mediatorial capacity— To believe in
							short in the atonement— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie is an able
							man and a powerful preacher; and yet he has preached himself out of his
							vocation— He is the most unpopular preacher in the City. His argument
							this day was very closely connected together, and his manner most solemn
							and impressive— He read the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of
							Job with a power and energy which made it almost new to me— <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">The President</persRef> was there— After
							returning home I received a visit from young <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Krehmer</persRef>, who has just
							returned from England where he went some Months since as a Messenger. He
							is attached to the Russian Legation— Says he passed <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> between this and
							New-York. He told me of the Duel between the <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="finchhatton-george">Earl of Winchilsea</persRef>— I
							walked again an hour before dinner; and composed the Fable or Tale of
							the Star-gazer, falling into a Well— <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La
								Fontaine</persRef> tells it in four Lines; and then launches out
							into an argument in verse against judicial astrology— I expanded the
							Story into two Stanza’s, and then translated the moral reflections in
							five— Judicial Astrology is almost exploded at this day; but prevailed
							much in the time of La Fontaine— To reason against it now is to fight
							Shadows— But there was some pleasing imagery as well as good sense in
							the verses; and I imitated them by way of experiment: and I find no
							material difficulty in giving the thoughts of La Fontaine or rather
							equivalent ideas, for it often happens that the thought itself is
							inexpressible in English— I composed also one Stanza in imitation of
								<persRef ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Ode to Grosphus.— <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> dined with us— My Son
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">Johns</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef> is quite unwell, and <persRef

								Tyler</persRef> came to ask me to return him a paper signed by a

							me some months since, and which I referred him to my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> to find— Tyler has been ruined here
							in Lottery Speculations, and is now about removing to New-York— <persRef
								ref="cresson-elliott">Elliott Cresson</persRef> called upon me
							again. He has been these three or four Months in Virginia, and is now on
							his way returning to Philadelphia— He asked me again to write something
							in his Album, which I promised to do. I had not had Time when he sent it
							to me before, in January. He is of the Society of Friends and spoke much
							of the Colonization Society: of the success of which he has a very
							favourable opinion—with which in this respect mine does not agree— He
							has a profound horror of the condition of the Slaves in our Southern
							States— There is I believe in this respect some misapprehension and much
							prejudice— There are no doubt cases of extreme oppression and cruelty,
							and the impunity for them is complete; but I believe them to be very
							rare, and that the general treatment of Slaves is mild and moderate—
							Elliott spoke of some things relating to the present state of public
							affairs, with great severity, and especially of some Scandals in great
							circulation— The removals from Office are continuing with great
							perseverance. The Custom-houses in Boston, New-York, and Philadelphia
							have been swept clear; also at Portsmouth New-Hampshire and New-Orleans—
							The Appointments are exclusively of <pb type="ms" n="171"/>violent
							partizans, and every Editor of a scurrilous and Slanderous Newspaper, is
							provided for— My next visitor was <persRef ref="hamilton-james">James A.
								Hamilton</persRef> who began by telling me that he totally
							disapproved up a publication of his brother <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander Hamilton</persRef> in the New-York
							Evening Post. I had not seen this publication— James A. did not
							particularly describe the purport of this publication; but his object
							was to intreat, if I should think it necessary to reply to his brother’s
							publication; not to refer to anything that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has
							said to me in his conversations with me. He said that nothing he had
							said to me in our conversations was of a confidential nature, and
							nothing which he could object to my repeating; but that after this
							publication of his brothers if I should refer to what he had said to me,
							it would put him in a very awkward situation as respected his brother,
							and give him the appearance of not having equal zeal for the reputation
							of <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">his father</persRef>. He said he
							had come to say this to me, because there was an intimation in the
							pamphlet in which <persRef ref="plumer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer’s</persRef> Letter was
							published, that I should reply to the appeal— I said that not having
							seen his brother’s publication, it was impossible for me to say, whether
							it would require from me any notice of what he James A. had said to me—
							That my intention was to reply to the appeal— That he had said to me,
							what was confirmative of facts of which I had no doubt— That in our
							first conversation he had said there was a Letter from his father to
								<persRef ref="cabot-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cabot</persRef>, very strongly urging reasons against a division of
							the States— That at our second conversation he had said he believed he
							had been mistaken with regard to a Letter from his father to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cabot; but that it was a Letter from
								<persRef ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver
								Wolcott</persRef>, containing his father’s views on the Subject—
							That he had also read to me, two or three lines from a Letter to him
							from <persRef ref="hamilton-john">his younger brother</persRef> stating
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott had given or would give a
							full statement; and that it fully refuted Plumer’s charge— That he had
							also told me there was a Letter from his father to <persRef
								ref="sedgwick-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sedgwick</persRef> written not more than three days before his death
							also containing his views against the division of the Union— He said I
							had mistaken him in some particulars— He had thought there was a Letter
							from his father to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cabot—but it had not
							been found; he had afterwards believed it was a Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott to his father; but that had not
							been found— The Letter from his father to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Sedgwick had been mentioned to him by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sedgwick’s Son</persRef>; before these enquiries—but
							that also had been sought for in vain— He thought I mistook the purport
							of his brother’s Letter concerning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wolcott’s statement— I repeated what I thought were the words of his
							brother’s Letter as he read them; and he said he would bring and shew me
							the Letter itself— I told him there was other testimony than mine, with
							regard to the proposal made to his father and mentioned to him the
							statement made by <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef> in the Senate of New-York in January 1809— He said
							he had no more doubt than he had of his own existence, that the
							Statement made by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton was the fact—
							He repeated that he entirely disapproved of his brother’s publication,
							and would have prevented him from making it if he could—and he hoped I
							should not think it necessary to answer it—but if I should that I would
							let him have notice of what I should say, before publishing it— I told
							him I would readily do that; and would not introduce him or his
							information to me into the discussion, if I could with propriety avoid
							it— He also said he came to inform me that despatches had been received
							from <persRef ref="offley-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Offley</persRef>, and <persRef ref="crane-william">Captain
								Crane</persRef>—that nothing had been done— That when it came to a
							discussion of terms, the Turks had demanded two Ships of the Line; as
							the price of a Treaty; and that being declined, they had demanded one—
							Which being also declined, they had finally offered to take 50.000
							dollars—which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Offley had been disposed to
							accept at once— But Captain Crane would not assume the responsibility of
							drawing beyond the 20000 for which I had given him a credit. Hamilton
							asked if I had expected that the Treaty would be accomplished for 20.000
							dollars— I said No—but I had given the credit, as large as I could, from
							the fund of Contingent Expenses of foreign Intercourse— But that I would
							now if it were in my power not hesitate an instant to give fifty <pb
								type="ms" n="172"/>thousand dollars for the Treaty, if it could be
							obtained: and would assume the responsibility of the payment at once— He
							asked how the money could be commanded— I told him that <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Alexander Baring</persRef> would furnish it
							in five minutes; by an arrangement which the Minister of the United
							States might make with him—in the confidence of an Appropriation— He
							said he was extremely desirous it should be done, as probably if the
							present opportunity should be missed it would not again occur in many
							years— I fear it will be lost. <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> called while M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton was here— He and <persRef
								ref="preble-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Preble</persRef>
							are both here upon the Boundary question— He says they will remain here
							till about the middle of June; and a statement is to be delivered to the
								<persRef ref="vaughan-charles">British Minister</persRef> on the
							first of July— These Visitors occupied me from soon after Breakfast till
							near four in the afternoon— I rode to the Navy-Yard, and composed part
							of the Fable of the Wolf and the Dog. <persRef ref="adams-abigail2"
								>Abigail S. Adams</persRef> came home, and <persRef

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> I rise about five O’Clock. Write
							upon my reply to the Appeal till eight— Between eight and nine,
							breakfast— Two hours after are absorbed in reading the Newspapers— I
							receive occasional visitors, who occupy one two or three hours— Write
							the Journal of the preceding day, which as observed at the beginning of
							the month is now a Journal of thoughts, and not of action— From three in
							the afternoon till five, I walk or ride my horse— Dine, between five and
							six; and write again in the Evening Letters, or on the Reply till
							between ten and eleven when I retire to bed— In my rides and walks I
							compose imitations of Fables of <persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La
								Fontaine</persRef>, or of Odes of <persRef ref="horace"
								>Horace</persRef>—but this occupation encroaches also upon some
							other part of my time— When in the midst of the construction of a
							Stanza, I return from my ride, I muse upon it sometimes an hour or two
							afterwards— And sometimes it takes me half an hour to write what I have
							been composing.— This Life would be happier than I have ever enjoyed if
							it could continue. But I have yet duties to perform— The tempest against
							me rages without; and I must quit this Eden to go home— What awaits me
							there is known only to him who disposes of all— <persRef
								ref="stewart-dugald">Dugald Stewart</persRef> gave <persRef
								ref="cresson-elliott">Elliott Cresson</persRef> the original lines
							written by <persRef ref="burns-robert">Robert Burns</persRef>, on
							turning up the Mouse’s Nest; and I find it in his Album— The last lines
							are before me— “And forward though I cannot see, I guess and fear.” and
							although I prefer the philosophy of Horace’s Odes to Licinius and
							Grosphus, I cannot keep my mind up to their elevation— Before the close
							of the next Month we are to remove, and I hope to have finished my Reply
							to the Appeal; and pray for the perseverance of Fortitude to endure
							whatever of severity may yet be reserved for me— For Counsel to point
							out the best disposal of my Time for the remainder of the days allotted
							me on Earth, and for merciful dispensations of Providence.</p>
