              incline to take my house which he now occupies, for the whole year from the first of
              April next; he expects to enter his own new house, which he is about to build, on the
              first of September, and in the mean time, if I should lease my house from the first of
              April, he hopes to make his arrangement with my tenant so that he may remain in my
              house until his own will be ready for him— <persRef ref="faxon-benjamin"
                >Faxon</persRef> came with a blacksmith’s Account, and <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"

                  >r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Farrar</persRef>— My writing fell in

                >Grahame’s</persRef> History of the rise and progress of the United States— In
              proportion to the progress I have made in the reading of this Book, has the
              satisfaction which it gave me increased. It is incomparably the best History of the
              Settlements of the British on the Continent of America that has ever been published—
              The only one that does justice to the puritan Settlers of New-England. It strips
                <persRef ref="penn-william">William Penn</persRef> of his borrowed plumage; leaving
              him all that properly belongs to him, and treating his reputation with the utmost
              tenderness and delicacy. This work has supplied a great desideratum of American
              History and Literature. It has relieved me from a burden of obligation which I felt of
              exhibiting the same picture, and has performed the task better than I could have done—
              To this book if I have life and health, I hope hereafter to return.</p>

            <p>Soon after the Clock struck four I was roused by the Stageman, and took my Seat in
              the Carriage— The driver went to two other houses and took in two Passengers, entire
              Strangers to me. We rode about two hours in the dark, and reached Dedham about
              Sunrise. We were immediately followed by three other Stages of the same line entirely
              full. We breakfasted at Dedham, and I was recognized by <persRef ref="mcneil-john"
                  >Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> M’Neill</persRef> of the Army, who asked me if
              he had not some days since passed me in the Street in Boston— I said he had; and he
              apologized for not having noticed me at that time— I had no desire that he should
              notice me now; but received his civility with the same indifference as his neglect;
              accepting his apology exacting nothing from him, and returning in notice just what he
              gave— Among the Stage-passengers was also <persRef ref="seaver-ebenezer">M<hi

              Member of Congress <pb type="ms" n="313"/>Precisely at Noon we came to the lower wharf
              at Providence—called India wharf, where the new Steam-boat, President, Captain Bunker
              was waiting, and in ten minutes we had left the wharf— Among the Passengers in the
              Boat, were <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel

              Representatives of the United States from Massachusetts. At Newport where we touched
              two hours and a quarter after leaving Providence, <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">M<hi

              with whom I had made more than one passage as Master of a Packet, before the invention
              of the Steamboats, introduced himself to me as an old acquaintance I remembered well
              his name, and having sailed with him but not his person— He is now a Pilot in this
              boat— The weather was fine, but there was a breeze, almost a gale, blowing from the
              Northwest; a head wind for us; which scarcely seemed to slacken our motion; but so
              cold that I could not keep the Deck— In the Evening several Card parties were made up
              in the long Cabin. Hodges and Pearce were social as heretofore, but I found M<hi

              share in it when it arose— He had engaged a State-room for himself and me, and then
              perhaps in courtesy left it wholly to me— He had a <persRef ref="webster-julia"

            <p><date>4. V:30.</date> Friday— New-York— Philadelphia—</p>
            <p>I found my State-room N. 8. a very uncomfortable birth; the wind blowing in upon me
              the whole night, and no possibility of getting warmth— I was thoroughly chilled and
              had no sleep— But our voyage continued rapid and prosperous, and at six this Morning
              we landed at New-York— I asked <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Webster</persRef> when he should proceed on to Washington— he said he did
              not know— <persRef ref="hodges-james">Hodges</persRef> was quite unwell, with a severe
              cold taken yesterday— By advice of <persRef ref="u">Captain Bunker</persRef>, I took a
              Carriage, and drove to the wharf on the North-river; where I had just time to embark
              in the Steamboat Trenton <persRef ref="u">Captain Magraw</persRef> of the Union line
              for Philadelphia— We left the wharf at seven, and at half-past ten landed at
              New-Brunswick— In this Boat I met <persRef ref="sprague-peleg">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Sprague</persRef> a Senator of the United States from Maine, with <persRef
                ref="sprague-sarah">his wife</persRef>, and a <persRef ref="u">small child</persRef>— <persRef
                ref="cambreleng-churchill">C. C. Cambreleng</persRef>, a member of the House of
              Representatives from New-York, with a party male and female in Company. At M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng’s proposal, the Captain of the Boat put me into
              the Stage with this Company from New-Brunswick to the Landing on the Delaware seven
              miles below Trenton— There was <persRef ref="tucker-fanning">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Tucker</persRef> of Brooklyne Long Island, with <persRef ref="beck-ann2">his
                daughter</persRef> a lively and beautiful girl of nineteen or twenty; another young
              Lady whose name I did not ascertain, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                Wayne</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                Magruder</persRef>, and a young man of New-York named <persRef ref="u"
                >Hone</persRef>— The travelling was very rough, the roads having been deep, and
              frozen hard as marble; we had two or three races with Stages of another line in
              competition; and one of the proprietors of that line who was in one of their Stages
              took the trouble to leave it and to come to the doors of each of our Stages, ten in
              number, to inform us that our drivers would overset our Carriages and break all our
              Necks. We were four hours and three quarters on the way, and reached the Steam-boat
              Burlington at a Quarter past three— Miss Tucker had a large paper of Sugar-plums of
              which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng was the bearer for her, and which were
              distributed from time to time to the company, and the weariness of the way was
              beguiled by a succession of Conundrums and Puns, extemporised by M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hone for the
              amusement chiefly of Miss Tucker— My forbearance to share in this foolery was owing
              not to fastidiousness but to barrenness of invention. Arriving at Philadelphia at six
              in the Evening, I walked to the United States Hotel, <persRef ref="renshaw-benjamin"
                >Renshaw’s</persRef> and took a bed-chamber <pb type="ms" n="314"/>for the Night— I
              sent word to <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">Judge Hopkinson</persRef> that I was here
              and requested him to call and see me, which he did— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi

                <persRef ref="adams-joseph6">Adams</persRef> one of the Editors of the Boston

              appointment of his Successor. Hopkinson said he had no desire to receive the
              appointment himself; preferring much that which he now holds of District Judge. There
              is imminent danger that the appointment will be a bad one. <persRef

            <p><date>5. VI:15—</date> Saturday— Steam-boat to Newcastle. Stage to Frenchtown.</p>
            <p>There are now two Morning lines of Steam-boats and Stages; from Philadelphia to
              Baltimore; both of which depart at seven O’Clock— One going to the Delaware and
              Chesapeake Canal; through which the Passengers are conveyed in a Tow-boat; and the
              other is the old line, travelling in the Stage from Newcastle to Frenchtown— I
              intended to have gone by the Canal-line, and <persRef ref="thomas-john3">John
                Thomas</persRef> with my baggage went to that boat— There had been a fall of Snow
              last Evening, which was melting this Morning, and being slippery slackened my pace—
              After two fruitless enquiries for the Boat, I was directed to the wrong line; and
              found myself onboard the boat going for Newcastle— The Captain of which told me that
              the other Boat was gone, which was not true— On this false information however I went
              on shore and returned to the Hotel— John Thomas and my baggage were in the meantime in
              the Canal-boat from which after waiting for me several minutes they were landed, and
              he returned to me— This disappointment vexed me not a little; but it gave me a morning
              pleasantly employed at Philadelphia— I breakfasted at the common table, and
              immediately afterwards had a visit from <persRef ref="rutherford-john">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Rutherford</persRef> of New-Jersey who introduced
              himself and informed me he was here as a Commissioner on the part of that State with
              two others to adjust with Commissioners of Pennsylvania, arrangements for the use of
              the Waters of the Delaware river for the projected Canal, between the Delaware and
              Raritan— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rutherford was a member of the Senate of the
              United States from New-Jersey during <persRef ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef>
              Administration and is a worthy and respectable man. Soon after him, <persRef
                ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> came in,
              returning from attendance on a Court in Salem County, as Attorney General of the
              State— He has entirely recovered his health, and looks better than he had done for
              years— His Spirits are also good, and he says he has as much professional business as
              he can attend to with satisfaction to himself. He gave me many particulars of his
              attendance last Summer at Washington as a witness on the trial of <persRef

              determined to proceed in the Steam-boat line at Noon— I gave M<hi rend="superscript"

              the Bank of the United States, and received four dividends of the Stock which I hold

              the President invited me to dine with him, which <hi rend="strikethrough">he</hi> I

              />returned to <persRef ref="renshaw-benjamin">Renshaw’s</persRef> to go down to the

                Pearce</persRef> whom I had left yesterday Morning at New-York, and had reached
              Philadelphia this Morning. We went to the Boat together, and at Noon embarked in the
              Steam-boat for New-castle— There we arrived at four, and proceeded in Stages of which
              there were only four to Frenchtown— In the Stage with me were M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> and <persRef ref="pearce-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                Pearce</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degen</persRef> of

              of New-York, and others whom I did not know— At seven in the Evening we reached

              boat was no longer what it was in his time. He has retired upon his farm, and his
              laurels— He was one of the best mariners and Commanders with whom I ever have
              embarked— A dog and cat, and shabby people smoking Cigars, and drinking grog in the
              Cabin, immediately discovered that he was no longer the Commander.</p>

            <p><date>6. VI:30.</date> Sunday— Baltimore— Washington.</p>
            <p>At a quarter past one O’Clock this morning the Steam-boat reached the wharf at
              Baltimore. The passengers did not land till towards day-light.— I had no sleep, but
              did not rise from my birth till half past six— Time in the interval dragged on so
              heavily that my patience deserted me, and I fell to composing verses— Three Stanzas in
              honour of <persRef ref="beck-ann2">Miss Tucker</persRef> my travelling companion, of
              yesterday, and her Sugar-plum— As thus— Fair damsel, blessing shall the lot, of thy
              wayfaring partner sweeten; Who shares the Palace or the Cot, with thee, becalm’d or
              tempest beaten— For him shall little be enough, For him no tangled path-way dreary;
              Thy smile shall smooth his road when rough; And speed the sand of Time when weary—
              Fair damsel, may that Angel-form, Of which thy own is but the copy; Which shelters
              Virtue from the Storm, And steeps the ills of Life in Poppy— That Cherub, which to
              Fancy’s ken, Watches oer Innocence and Beauty, Chuse for thee from the Sons of Men, A
              proxy to perform his duty— And thou shalt weather many a wave, And put Life’s
              Steam-boat on low-pressure; Descend in honour to the Grave, And soar to reap a richer
              Treasure— Fair Damsel, Fare thee Well— my Eyes, on Earth again may never greet thee—
              But when thou shalt ascend the Skies— Be mine with welcome first to meet thee.”— At
              day-light I arose and went to <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> tavern,
              where I found <persRef ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                  >r</hi> Cambreleng</persRef> and most of the party with whom I had missed the
              Canal-line passage of yesterday Morning— I breakfasted at Barnum’s, and with <persRef
                ref="pearce-dutee;pearce-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
                  rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pearce</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Degen</persRef> took passage in a new line of Stages,
              called <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef>, or the Yankee line; in
              competition with Barnum’s; and so much to his annoyance that his bar keepers attempted
              to reduce us to the alternative of losing our passage or our breakfast— But the driver
              who was at Barnum’s door with the Stage, before we sat down, waited until we had
              breakfasted. We left at Baltimore, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Aspinwall</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Chauncey</persRef> of New-York, our fellow passengers yesterday, but who were going
              to Richmond— We left Barnum’s just at Nine O’Clock, and took in several other
              passengers, among whom was <persRef ref="u">Captain Northam</persRef> of Newport
              Rhode-Island a fellow traveller with me more than once heretofore; and also the <persRef ref="u">Son</persRef> of
                <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Asbury
                Dickins</persRef>— The roads were heavy and the weather warm— We stopped at neither
              of the Houses where the Stages heretofore have been accustomed to stop—but at <persRef
                ref="u">Drummond’s</persRef>, and in the Village of Bladensburg— My fellow
              travellers alighted at various houses and just after three O’Clock I landed safely,
              blessed be God, at my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> House on the
              North side of the President’s Square at Washington— There with feelings of just
              gratitude I found <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, my Son and
                <persRef ref="hellen-mary">daughter</persRef>
              <persRef ref="adams-mary4">their child</persRef>, and all the family in health
              improved, and with better hopes. Glory to God.</p>

              old Officers were all re-elected. The votes were 54 to 136. A still feebler attempt
              was made to put in a South-Carolina Speaker in the place of <persRef

            <p>Weather still warm, and fair, and my time still unprofitably spent. <persRef
                ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour</persRef> the Senator

              his house which is in the neighbourhood of ours. The house in which we now live is one
              built last Winter by my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>. Meridian Hill,
              where we resided from March last till June, and whence on the 10<hi rend="superscript"
                >th.</hi> of that Month I departed for Quincy, was sold in the Month of July, at the
              close of which month my family removed from it into this House. <persRef
                ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Brent</persRef> paid me a
              morning visit— And <persRef ref="conner-benjamin2">Captain Benjamin Conner</persRef>
              aged eighty two came to announce to me that he had discovered the Longitude, and to
              request me to examine his papers by which it was demonstrated— He proposed to come
              to-morrow, but I told him I feared I should not understand his papers. M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson dined with us. The first annual Message of
                <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> was this day transmitted
              to the two houses of Congress— It is as long as any of those of his Predecessors— As
              he is very illiterate there was some curiosity to know how the composition would
              appear— It is apparently the work of several hands—probably of all the heads of
              Departments—with interpolations from the Telegraph Newspaper, and some passages
              evidently of his own writing, and of which he suffered nothing but the spelling to be
              corrected— He recommends an Amendment to the Constitution with regard to the election
              of President and Vice-President, entirely different from that which he proposed to the
              Legislature of Tennessee in 1825, but adapted to his own situation now as that was
              then—equally shallow, and equally certain of not being adopted— He makes a furious
              sortie against the Bank of the United States; declares his opinion that it is
              unconstitutional, and recommends in its <pb type="ms" n="317"/>stead a Bank, to belong
              entirely to the Government, exclusively under its controul— He has a paragraph for,
              and a paragraph against the Tariff, a rap at the Circuit Court of the District for not
              convicting <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">Watkins</persRef> upon the Statute, and for
              convicting him upon the Common Law Jurisdiction: a recommendation to extend the Law
              limiting the tenure of Executive Offices to four years; and an argument against
              allowing Offices to be long held by the same persons— These and almost every other
              opinion in the message are ebullitions of time and occasion suited to popular fancies
              of the moment; all common-place without a single Sentiment worthy of a philosopher or
              Statesman— No good can come of them, much mischief may.— He earnestly recommends that
              the surplus revenue after payment of the debt should be distributed among the States;
              and packs off all the Indians beyond the bounds of any of the States— The whole
              message is upon a level with Captain Conner’s discovery of the Longitude.</p>

              of the American Revolution— The Life itself consists in a great measure of extracts
              from his Correspondence, and there appears to be a want of method, and especially of

            <p>How much of the regularity of life depends upon mechanical habits. I find already so
              much inconvenience in waiting till the Middle of the day for the day’s exercise that I
              resumed this morning my old practice of walking before Breakfast— I went round the
              Capitol Square, and was out precisely an hour and a quarter 38 minutes to the central

                <persRef ref="wyer-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wyer</persRef> brought
              some papers relating to the Settlement of his accounts which he wished me to examine;
              with a view to obtain a recommendation from me of certain charges which have been
              disallowed. I told him that I would readily examine them if I could be of any Service
              to him; but if <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
                Buren</persRef> wanted my opinion upon the charges to make up his own he must say so
              in writing; otherwise my recommendation if I should give it would be a decisive reason
              for rejecting the items of which I should recommend the allowance— <persRef

              District have yesterday adjourned their Session at Alexandria, and are now sitting
              here— The judge spoke of the insulting reflection in the Message upon the proceedings
              of the Court in the case of D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Watkins— I thought it was
              what might have been expected, but acknowledged with great pain to the judge my own
              impression that the decision of the Court, in convicting an Officer of the United
              States for official malversation under an assumed Common Law Jurisdiction was
              erroneous— He noticed the distinctions upon which the Court gave their Judgment— The
              Jurisdiction of the Court derived from the Laws of Maryland: and the fraud in the
              Transactions of the public officer which they considered as independent of his
              official character— But I could not comprehend those distinctions— The frauds were
              such as could be committed by no other than a public Officer, and the real motives to
              the prosecution were mere political malice and personal revenge— This the judge
              admitted, and said the rancour with which the prosecution was conducted was beyond the
              conception of any one who had not witnessed it— <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker"

              of that State— He said they wanted to raise 10,000 dollars. He had obtained
              subscriptions for 9200, and he was applying to make up the remainder; part of the
              actual subscriptions being conditional—provided that the whole sum shall be procured.
              I declined making any contribution—telling him that the multitude of applications of
              this kind from every part of the Country made it necessary to assume some principle
              concerning them— The principle I thought should be to contribute to them all, or to
              none— I had while in Office practised upon the former, and was now by my circumstances
              compelled to act upon the latter of these Rules— He asked me whether I thought
              Congress would grant any of the Public Lands to such an Institution; and what my own
              opinion was of the propriety of such a measure— I told him that my own opinion was in
              favour of the measure; and I knew of no better use that could be made of public Lands;
              but it was quite improbable that a Majority of the two houses of Congress were of the

            <p>The Sun rose this morning upon a perfectly clear horizon, an occurrence more rare in
              this Country more rare than any one would imagine—without long continued observation—
              It set also perfectly clear and it being close at the Solstice, I noted the position
              of its rising and setting from the windows at its extreme Southern Declination— At the
              Presbyterian Church I heard <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Campbell</persRef> from Hebrews 11.25. “Choosing rather to suffer
              affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.”
              He gave a succinct historical account of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, from
              his birth to the time of his choosing to suffer with the people of God— The historical
              part was handsomely told, and the inferences deduced from it as example and warning
              were well drawn. He enquired why the example, glorious as it stands is so rarely
              imitated by those who profess to be Christians and answered because practically they
              do not believe the Scriptures— This is a favourite conclusion of M<hi
                rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell’s which I have heard him draw before— He gave
              notice that he was to preach this afternoon at the Orphan Asylum, and that the Evening
              service at his Church would begin at a quarter before 7. Also that the funeral of

              sent for in the night— She was a little better this day; but is very dangerously ill—
              The morning was fine but cold— I walked round the Capitol Square and met <persRef
                ref="crowell-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> John Crowell</persRef> the
              Agent to the Creek Indians; who told me he arrived here yesterday— <persRef ref="brown-william10">William Brown</persRef> was
              here this morning, and promised to call again in the Evening to execute the
              Conveyances which he had promised me as security for the sum of 500 dollars which he
              borrowed of me last Spring. He told me that he had not been able to obtain employment
              at New York; and upon returning here in the Summer had got a small Clerkship of 400
              dollars a year in the Bank of Washington; that <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi

              containing documents exhibiting the political Sentiments of the late and present
              Collector of New-Bedford to prove his own republicanism, and the federalism of his
              Successor <persRef ref="williams-lemuel2">Lemuel Williams</persRef>. He says that the
                <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> and <persRef ref="ingham-samuel"
                >Ingham</persRef> told him that the appointment of Williams had been made by
              mistake, and that if they had known then what they know now, it would not have been
              made; but that they could not now dismiss M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams
              without cause; and that <persRef ref="troup-george">George M Troup</persRef> and

              of Williams— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman has however given up all hope of

              be at least a full week’s labour to arrange and label them if I had nothing else to
              do— They will I have no doubt take all my leisure time for a fortnight— They consist
              almost entirely of Letters written and received while my father was President of the
              United States—most of them during the last year of that time— A year of severe trial

            <p>Walking round the Capitol Square this Morning I met three Irishmen, one of whom
              enquired of me the way to Baltimore, which I pointed out to him, and then enquired
              whence he and his companions came. He said from working upon the Chesapeake and Ohio
              Canal— That they had been working there these six weeks and could get no pay— That it
              had been even refused to them yesterday, and they had determined to wait no longer—
              They were going to try their hands at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad—<persRef ref="brown-william10">W. Browne</persRef> called
              and left the Deeds of the Lands which he proposes to convey as security for the

              has been making a ridiculous dinner table Speech there— Rodgers appears to be much
              dissatisfied, with the present management of the Navy Department; and particularly
              with the projects for forcing down double quantities of Rice, for the food of the
              Seaman, and Cotton Sails and Cordage for the Line of Battle Ships; with which he
              declared he would not go to Sea— He laughed heartily at the proposal of the Report of

              the unprofitable Branches of the Service. Adams has just returned from Richmond, where

              for the Education of <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J. Hellen</persRef> while he
              was at Exeter and at Cambridge— This paper is full of errors too gross to be
              attributed to mere misapprehension, and it seems to me must have been written when the
              man was drunk— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye had written a paper refuting some
              of its most egregious misstatements; but I desired him to inform the Judge that if any
              thing like that paper was to assume the form of a decree; I should claim the privilege
              of being heard against it in my own vindication, and I desired him particularly to
              give explanations upon every item of the charges which the judge’s paper
              misrepresented; which was almost every one in the account— I am reading this day

            <p>A strolling Bookseller by the name of <persRef ref="u">M’Manus</persRef> came with
              several publications by subscription, none of which I inclined to take; and I had a

                Read</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts. I
              finished a Letter begun yesterday to my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
                >Charles</persRef>, and read some pages of the Correspondence of <persRef
                ref="lee-arthur">Arthur Lee</persRef>; the Article in the North-American Review upon
                <persRef ref="hall-basil">Captain Basil Hall’s</persRef> Travels in the United
              States and five Sections of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> first Book
              de Oratore— The Review of Captain Hall’s Travels is by <persRef ref="everett-edward"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett</persRef>, mild and moderate, but
              castigating— Hall’s Travels themselves are as from his deportment in this Country it
              was expected they would be libels upon it. If there be among us an undue portion of
              National Vanity, the splenetic effusions of these foreign travellers, are well suited
              to operate as wormwood upon it— A British traveller who should find any thing in this
              Country deserving of commendation, if he could find in England a publisher of his
              work, would not find readers to pay for the publication— Satire and Slander on the
              other hand are sure of meeting a welcome reception— They minister to the envious and
              rancorous passions which are felt by almost the whole Nation— They are sure of falling
              in with the current of popular feeling. This of itself will account for the temper of
              almost all the British Tourists in the United States— But Captain Hall was also an
              Officer in the British Navy; that portion of the Empire which <pb type="ms" n="323"
              />had suffered the deepest humiliation in their recent conflicts with ours; and he
              could lay no more flattering unction to the Souls of his Superiors than by feeding
              their vindictive passions with obloquy upon the Americans— Of all this no notice is
              taken in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s Review. There is not so much
              resentment in the Review as the Book deserves— There is more of concession and less
              severity of animadversion than there should have been—</p>

                <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>; from which it appears that my last
              Letter to him had been broken open before he received it— One of the Articles in the
              North-American Review which I read was upon historical composition, Spanish History,
              and <persRef ref="irving-washington">Irving’s</persRef> Chronical of Grenada— Another
              upon the never to be settled question who was the author of Junius— A new attempt to
              fit the cap upon the head of <persRef ref="germain-george">Lord George
                Germain</persRef>—or Sackville— There are two remarkable things in all these
              inquisitions after Junius— One that the known, and public writings of the suspected
              persons bear no comparison to the anonymous writings— The other that there is not a
              writer in the language whose style exactly resembles that of Junius— <persRef
                ref="burke-edmund">Burke</persRef> and <persRef ref="pitt-william">Chatham</persRef>
              have resemblances to him and both have been suspected; but there is a diffuseness in
              Burke, which it was impossible for him to discard, and Burke could not imitate that
              admirable variety in the Structure of his Sentences which constitutes one of the most
              attractive charms of Junius— Burke’s Sentences are almost invariably long. They always
              combine complicated thought— He is never laconic— Burke’s Model was Cicero— The Model
              of Junius was <persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef>, sublimated by a deep study of
                <persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef>— Junius had studied the antient theories of
              prosaic numbers— So had Burke—but Junius had adapted those doctrines to the
              composition of English prose more successfully than Burke— <persRef
                ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bollmann</persRef> proposed to
              some of the European Governments to use Platina for their coins, because from the
              specific gravity of that metal it could not be counterfeited— A coin of the size of a
              dollar of that metal, would press with nearly double the weight of silver upon the
              hand— The Style of Junius is to the Style of Burke, like Platina to Silver: and by the
              same analogy the Style of Lord Sackville would be no better than Tin, and that of
                <persRef ref="francis-philip">Sir Philip Francis</persRef> scarcely better than
              lead— Lord Chatham’s Speeches sometimes bear to it the comparative gravity of gold,
              but their colour is not the same. For profound philosophy Burke far transcends them
              all, but for keen penetrating misanthropical observation of human nature Junius is
              again unrivalled— The philosophy of Burke was tempered with the morals of
              Christianity— Junius was deistical and worldly minded— Junius was a principled
              duelist, and an encomiast of Suicide— Burke at least in principle abhorred them both.
              Junius was a splendid Genius and a bad man.— I think that neither Burke nor Chatham
              was a bad man, although in the corrupted currents of the world, their virtues were
              often tarnished by their interests and their Passions—</p>

            <p>The Succession of visitors occupied the greater part of the day. They were
              principally members of Congress friendly to the last Administration. Those of the
              other party have had the modesty to abstain, with a single exception— The Message of
                <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> is not only satisfactory
              to his party, but is puffed to the skies by his newspaper pack with one general howl
              of extasy— All the Reports of all the Heads of Departments are cried up with the same
              yell of admiration— They are all papers below mediocrity; but the Report of <persRef
                ref="eaton-john">J. H. Eaton</persRef> the Secretary of War defies all criticism— I
              meet with a parallel to it in a Letter from a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature,
              in the second Volume of the Life of <persRef ref="lee-arthur">Arthur Lee</persRef>,
              page 382— Many of my visitors speak of it with grave disgust, but I told one of them
              that I had not laughed so heartily at reading any thing since my first acquaintance
              with the expedition of Humphrey Clinker— <persRef ref="holmes-john">Holmes</persRef>
              said that his ex-Colleague <persRef ref="chandler-john">John Chandler</persRef> at the
              last Session of the Senate voted to put off the decision of my nomination to the
              Office of Collector at Portland, till the accession of the new Administration, that he
              might get the Office himself, as he did. <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi

              persons and appointing others to their Offices during the recess, the Offices being of
              those which require the Confirmation of the Senate, were a violation of the Spirit of

              respect to me the Society had reserved my old pew in their Church, for my use, if I
              should be inclined to occupy it— I desired them to present my thanks to the Society

            <p><date>20. V.</date> Sunday— Sun rose 7:24.</p>
            <p>The Sun rose clear and my Chronometer had gained 3 minutes and 25 seconds on the Sun
              since this day week, the last clear Sunrise before this. This is precisely what the
              Sun has in the same time lost upon the Clock; but the Sun really rose from one to two
              minutes later than it did last Sunday— That time my Chronometer has lost—about ten
              seconds a day: it sometimes loses more; sometimes less— The average since I set the
              hands two hours in advance the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of last June has been
              16. seconds a day— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> went with

                Campbell</persRef> at the Presbyterian Church, from 1. John 5.4. “For whatsoever is
              born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world,
              even our faith.” The Discourse was eloquent; and it was not possible to resist the
              impression that many of its allusions had reference to his own present situation— He
              baptised a female child— After the morning service I left Cards at <persRef
                ref="tayloe-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B. O. Tayloe’s</persRef> for
              him and <persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

              but met him in the street. In the Evening I heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
              Campbell again, from Acts 7.59. “And they stoned <persRef ref="ststephen"
                >Stephen</persRef>, calling upon God, and saying Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit”— And
              in describing the persecutions, the <pb type="ms" n="325"/>fortitude, the sufferings,
              and the triumphant death of the first Christian Martyr, his invincible adherence to
              the Cause of his Master, his inextinguishable contempt and scorn of all that the world
              could inflict upon him, the outrages of profligate power that he is himself enduring
              could not but occur to the minds of his Auditory.— His Lecture was short and spirited—
                <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
                Johnson</persRef> spent the Evening here— I finished reading the Memoirs of <persRef
                ref="lee-arthur">Arthur Lee</persRef>— The Correspondence discloses much more than
              the Life— A Letter from <persRef ref="dickinson-john2">John Dickinson</persRef> shews
              in clear relief the cause which arrested Lee in his career of honourable service
              abroad, and as a public man crippled him for life— It was his quarrel with <persRef
                ref="franklin-benjamin">Franklin</persRef> and the consequent influence of the
                <persRef ref="gravier-charles">Count de Vergennes</persRef> against him— This
              displaced him from the Commission to Spain and undoubtedly from the final Commission
              for negotiating the Peace— It made way both for <persRef ref="jay-john">Jay</persRef>
              and <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>— There is room for remark in
              this Correspondence which extends from 1765 to 1787. both on the different tones of
              the times, of the same writers at different times, and of different writers at the
              same times— Among the most remarkable Letters are those of <persRef ref="adams-samuel"
                >Samuel Adams</persRef>, among which there is one containing a backhanded blow at
              his fellow Patriot <persRef ref="cushing-thomas2">T. Cushing</persRef> which shews at
              once his opinion of Cushing, and a specimen of that quality which <persRef
                ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson</persRef> in his third Volume imputes to S.
              Adams— The very short fragments of Arthur’s Journals, and Memoirs are also deeply
              interesting. Most particularly that of his Indian Negotiation— He avows a profound
              contempt for the Indian character— The view of his own situation prospects and
              purposes given in the midst of the Journal of this Negotiation, would make a Scene for
              the Vieux Celibataire of <persRef ref="collin-jean">Collin d’Harleville</persRef>— Lee
              destroyed his own prospects, or at least turned the tide of his own Fortunes; by
              uniting with stern unaccommodating Virtue a certain asperity of manner. He was finally
              shooed off of the political stage, for his opposition to the Constitution of the
              United States; and did not live till it would have operated as a recommendation to
              bring him forward again— I wrote to <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi

            <p>Day of the Winter Solstice— The Sun rose clear again and my Chronometer had
              apparently gained ten seconds since yesterday. As the Sun had actually gained 30. my
              Chronometer had lost 20— <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Dickins</persRef> the Secretary of the Columbian Institute brought me a draught of a
              Petition from that <unclear>Body</unclear> to Congress for a grant of money to fence
              round their garden— He said that <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef>
              and he had been appointed a Committee to prepare the Petition— It had been drawn up by
              the judge, and as it was to be signed by me as President of the Institute, he offered
              to leave with me for consideration— I declined retaining it, and told him that as the
              annual Elections of the Officers of the Institute was coming in a few days, I would
              thank him to present my respects to the Society, and to request that the Petition to
              Congress might be deferred until after the election— And with my very sincere and
              cordial thanks to the Institute for the honour they had done me for a series of years
              in electing me their President to ask of them the favour now to confer that
              distinction upon another person— I said I had wished to avoid writing a formal Letter
              to that effect, and was glad to have this opportunity of communicating to the
              Institute my wishes and intentions in this manner through him— He said he knew that
              the Institute would wish me to reconsider this Resolution. That if I would consent
              merely to countenance the Institution by my name, my election as President would be as
              it always had been unanimous— That there was not a dissenting voice on the subject,
              and that the Society would earnestly regret my determination to withdraw from the
              Presidency if I should persist in it— I told him I was fully aware of and deeply
              sensible to the kind feelings of the members of the Institute in my favour <pb
                type="ms" n="326"/>but I had always been conscious of my inability to serve them in
              such manner as to justify their choice— While in the public service it had been
              impossible for me to devote the Time to the Society, as I should have desired— There
              were now other causes which deprived me of that power, and I was sure my name would do
              them more harm than good— He asked me, if I should be disposed to yield to a distinct
              expression of opinion by the Society on this subject?— I said I had such implicit
              confidence in the friendly feelings of the members of the Institute that I had no
              doubt of the opinion they would express— But my own mind was so fully made up, that if
              they should re-elect me, I should be compelled to decline accepting their favour which
              would be painful to me— I could not attend the meetings of the Society. It might
              perhaps not always be so— If a time should come in which I could serve the Society by
              attendance upon its Meetings, I should give it with pleasure. At present I was
              satisfied it would be best served by my absence— He took back accordingly the draught
              of the petition. I had also a morning visit from <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi

              sent here— I left a Card at <persRef ref="swann-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Swan’s</persRef>, and called at <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye’s</persRef>. Neither he nor <persRef
                ref="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> was at home; but
              as I was returning I met and spoke with him. <persRef ref="adams-john2"
                >John’s</persRef>
              <persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef> dined there, and <persRef
                key="adams-louisa-catherine">mine</persRef> with John spent the Evening with them— I
              wrote to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
              <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef>, and read nearly half the second Dialogue
              of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Oratore. This Treatise is
              altogether different form the usual works which treat of Rhetoric. It gives the
              subject a popular form; and discusses all the Secrets of the Art, under the appearance
              of contesting the pretensions of Oratory to be styled an Art— The book is addressed to
              his brother <persRef ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef>, who had requested him to
              give his opinions upon the general subject of Eloquence— In the first Section he
              laments in a feeling manner the turbulent and stormy times in which it had always been
              his fortune to live, and which had made it impossible for him to devote much of his
              leisure to literature and philosophy, as he would have wished— Yet he says that
              notwithstanding the harshness and distresses of his Times, he has devoted to writing
              every hour of leisure which the persecution of his enemies; the professional defence
              of his friends and the service of his Country had allowed him— An example which ought
              to be followed by every virtuous man— He then undertakes to set forth the opinions of
              the most illustrious Orators upon the art of speaking in general—and mentions the
              rhetorical Treatises published in his youth as mere undigested compilations,
              altogether unworthy of his riper age and more practised experience— He states a
              difference of opinion between his brother and himself—he considering eloquence as a
                <pb type="ms" n="327"/>Talent, acquired by the studies of profound philosophy; while
              Quintus thought it a gift of natural Genius, wrought up to perfection by practice— In
              confirmation of his own opinion Cicero starts the question how it happens that there
              have lived so very few masters of Eloquence— That among multitudes of eminent
              Statesmen, Warriors, Mathematicians, Musicians and even Poets, the great Orators are
              scarcely more than two or three—and he accounts for it by the assertion that the great
              Orator must be conversant with the whole circle of the Sciences— He then supposes that
              at a period not long preceding his own age, <persRef ref="crassus-lucius">Lucius
                Crassus</persRef> at the annual Season of the Roman Games, went to pass a few days
              of relaxation at Tusculanum, where he was visited by <persRef ref="scaevola">Quintus
                Mucius</persRef> who had been his father in Law; by <persRef ref="antony-mark"
                >Marcus Antonius</persRef>; <persRef ref="cotta-gaius">Gaius Cotta</persRef>, and
                <persRef ref="sulpicius-publius">Publius Sulpicius</persRef>— Between these the
              first Dialogue is held—the discussion being chiefly confined to Crassus and
              Antony.</p>

            <p>The consequence of my violent exercise yesterday Morning has almost laid me up— I
              rose in the Night and finding it only three O’Clock retired again to bed and lay
              without sleeping till five— I nevertheless walked round the Capitol Square, and
              returned to see the Sun rise clear the fourth day in succession. My Chronometer had
              apparently gained 20 Seconds since yesterday Morning; but the horizon was this morning
              not perfectly clear— There was a haze which probably delayed for 10 Seconds the
              appearance of the Sun— <persRef ref="gerry-elbridge2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Gerry</persRef> the Surveyor of the Port of Boston, called to see me; and said he
              was here to secure if possible his re-appointment to his office— His term of four
              years will expire next Month, and there are Cormorants abroad in search after it— He
              said the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> had promised to renominate
              him as soon as the Senate should be ready to receive his nominations; and <persRef
                ref="ingham-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham</persRef> had promised his
              influence in his favour. None of the nominations have been yet sent in the <persRef
                ref="tazewell-littleton;tyler-john">two Virginia Senators</persRef> being detained
              in the Convention; and <persRef ref="reed-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Reed</persRef> the Senator from Mississippi having died while on his way to this
              place. With these three vacancies, there is some doubt whether all the Nominations
              would be confirmed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gerry notwithstanding the promises
              he has received is under much anxiety, <persRef ref="gerry-ann">his mother’s</persRef>
              comfortable support as well as his own depending upon his place— He told me that while
              I was at the head of the Government, he took a pride in the public Service; but now he
              was obliged to pocket his Pride which I approved— <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker"
                  >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson</persRef> was here in the Evening. I
              retired after a footbath early to bed quite unwell. I am much engaged and consume much
              time in assorting papers— Those of the Trunk belonging to <persRef ref="adams-john">my
                father</persRef>, are not yet assorted, and this afternoon I took up those of
                <persRef ref="vaughan-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin
                Vaughan</persRef>— I made little progress with them being somewhat dispirited, a
              state of mind which I cannot entirely controul. I am drawing however towards the close
              of the second Dialogue of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Oratore—
              The discussion in the first Dialogue is between <persRef ref="crassus-lucius"
                >Crassus</persRef> who maintains that Oratory is an Art, and that the perfect Orator
              should be a man of universal Science; and <persRef ref="antony-mark"
                >Antonius</persRef> who considers it all as depending on Genius and practice— In the
              second Dialogue which the author represents as having taken place the next day; he
              introduces two new Interlocutors. <persRef ref="catulus-quintus">Quintus
                Catulus</persRef> and <persRef ref="caesar-gaius">Gaius Julius Caesar</persRef>, the
              father I suppose of the <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Dictator</persRef>— They join the
              party upon hearing of the discussion of the preceding day— The first part of the
              second Dialogue is discursive, and several of the Speakers alternately take part in
              it— In the latter part Caesar expounds very philosophically the whole theory of
              facetiousness and joking; as of great power in the practice of Oratory— There are also
              some remarks upon demonstrative Oratory, Panegyrics and funeral Eulogies which Cicero
              considers as scarcely belonging to the Art.</p>

            <p>After a very uneasy Night I rose at four, and again half an hour afterwards,
              suffering with an oppression of phlegm upon the lungs, which depresses the Spirits
              beyond the Power of Philosophy.— I began writing an Essay without any distinct
              purpose, which occupied me till my usual hour for walking— Received a Letter from
                <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef> which I answered. <persRef

                Brown</persRef> is in bad health and has been so ill that it was one cause of their
              returning home— They have taken up a temporary residence in Philadelphia— <persRef
                ref="currier-solomon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Currier</persRef> was nominated
              by me last winter as Collector of the Customs at Newbury-Port, and confirmed by the
              Senate— In June he was removed and a <persRef ref="phillips-samuel">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips</persRef> of Andover appointed in his place—
                <hi rend="strikethrough">He</hi> Currier had one of the largest lists of
              recommendation from the merchants of Newbury-Port that I ever received; and he says
              his friends could not conceive that he should have been removed without cause—
                <persRef ref="bartlett-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
                Bartlett</persRef> in particular he said had expressed that opinion, and advised him
              to demand what the cause was he therefore came here, and applied to the Secretary of
              the Treasury <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef>, who refused to assign to
              him any other reason, but that there had been a great political contest— I had never
              seen M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Currier before, but he said he called to return me
              thanks for my nomination of him. He had been the deputy of the preceding Collector,
              and the whole business of the Office, had been for some years transacted by him. I
              finished reading the second and began the third Dialogue de Oratore— The introduction
              to the third is an eloquent and pathetic lamentation, at the tragical end of most of
              the Interlocutors of the Work— He says that <persRef ref="crassus-lucius"
                >Crassus</persRef> died within ten days after the time at which he has fixed the
              Dialogues as held— Died of a fever occasioned by high political excitement; and that
                <persRef ref="catulus-quintus">Catulus</persRef>, <persRef ref="antony-mark"

                >Sulpicius</persRef> all afterwards died violent Deaths— And as if with a prophetic
              forecast of his own fate, he acknowledges that the advice which his brother <persRef
                ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef> had often given him to take warning from all
              these cruel Catastrophes, and abstain from exposing himself to the same calamities had
              been wise and good— But he says it is no longer possible for him to chuse his course—
              That his labours and dangers have been in some degree compensated by glory, and that
              in the midst of them he turns with delight to the studies and meditations of his
              youth.</p>

            <p><date>26. IV:45.</date> Saturday.</p>
            <p>Last Night precisely at the time of the New Moon, a great change took place in the
              weather from fair and warm, to storming and rain— It continued foul this Morning;
              notwithstanding which I took my morning pilgrimage round the Capitol Square; an hour
              and a quarter, in returning from which I was nearly drenched in rain— My hoarse cold
              has settled into a deeper seated cough; in no wise relieving the pressure upon my
              lungs and my Spirits— I wrote a long answer to a Letter, received yesterday from my
              Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. I read a few Sections in the
              third Dialogue of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Oratore— The
              principal Speaker in this Dialogue is <persRef ref="crassus-lucius">Crassus</persRef>,
              and it is evidently the purpose of the writer to raise the tone of his Discourse to
              the highest pitch of eloquence as it draws towards the close— His account of the
              Grecian Systems of Philosophy, and of their application to the purposes of Oratory
              from the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
              Section is magnificent— His exclusion of the Epicurean and Stoic doctrines is
              expressed with the greater force, because in terms of mildness and urbanity. The
              management of these dialogues is remarkable for the elegant politeness of the speakers
              to each other, and the easiness with which the conversation is distributed among the
              individuals engaged in it. The tone of conversation is preserved throughout, and the
              profoundest precepts of the art are interwoven into the conference, with such
              exquisite skill, that you seem to enjoy the amusement of a Comedy while you are
              insensibly <pb type="ms" n="330"/>learning the Science of Rhetoric, and if so endowed,
              the Art of Oratory. In the Evening I returned to the Manuscripts of <persRef
                ref="vaughan-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin Vaughan</persRef>,
              and read several of his Letters to the <persRef ref="petty-william">Earl of
                Shelburne</persRef>, afterwards Marquis of Lansdown written in the last half of the
              year 1782 and the first quarter of 1783. during the Negotiation of the Preliminaries
              of Peace between Great-Britain and the United States— They are deeply interesting
              Letters, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan has communicated them to me in the
              closest confidence, and has lately written to me requesting me to return them. They
              afford decisive proof of the liberality of Lord Shelburne’s Views, in the Negotiation
              of the Peace, and they have convinced me that his Merits as a Statesman have been and
              are yet generally much underrated. He rose indeed three degrees in the peerage of
              England— A reward splendid enough to indicate the estimation in which his services
              were held, by his Sovereign <persRef ref="george-iii">George the third</persRef>; but
              of all the Statesmen of the Time he appears to have stooped the least to the Idols of
              faction and to have been the least bolstered up by them— He was neither Whig nor
              Tory.</p>

            <p>Heard at the Unitarian Church a young man, named <persRef ref="lincoln-calvin">Lincoln</persRef>,
              from Fitchburg—Massachusetts: from John 15.13. [“]Greater love hath no man than this,
              that a man lay down his life for his friends.” the great doctrine of the Christian
              Religion, with reference to this world is benevolence and it is almost exclusively the
              subject of the Sermons of the Unitarian preachers— The doctrine is good, but by
              perpetual repetition, like the atonement of Calvinism palls upon the understanding.
                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln’s elocution is also very affected and
              disagreeable— After the Service I called on <persRef ref="brown-james;brown-nancy"

                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brown has been more than two years in declining health,
              but appeared lively and cheerful— I met <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah S. Johnston</persRef>, who spoke with
              commendation of a Methodist preacher he had been hearing named <persRef ref="u"
                >Durbin</persRef>. I went to <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
                  >r</hi> Campbell’s</persRef> Church in the Evening, but there was no preaching
              there. I came home and finished reading the third Dialogue of <persRef
                ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Oratore. It appears that Cicero himself
              considered this work as his masterpiece— In the 34<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
              Section of this dialogue mention is made of <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef> as
              the Instructor of <persRef ref="dion">Dion</persRef> of Syracuse. In Section 35 he
              thinks ineloquent prudence preferable to loquacious folly. From Section 38. Crassus of
              elegance of language and metaphorical expressions for the use of which he gives rules
              and numerous examples— In Section 44. He enters upon the collocation of words, and
              Oratorical numbers—which he says were first introduced into the discourses of the
              Greeks by <persRef ref="Isocrates">Isocrates</persRef>— The rule prohibited all
              combinations of words which would form a verse, yet required that they should be
              measured for rhythmical harmony— Instead of the dactyl and Spondee he recommends the
              first and second peon for oratorical numbers The first peon being a long syllable
              followed by three short ones, and the second three short concluding with one long; and
              he says that <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef> recommends the first for the
              beginning and the last for the close of a Sentence— In a few of the last Sections are
              comprized all the little elegances which illuminate the discourse concluding with the
              earnest recommendation of suitable action and the management of the eyes— He relates
              the Anecdote of <persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> attributing the first
              and second and third power of eloquence to action; confirmed by the Story that

              Rhodes, after reading his Oration against Cteriphon, was requested by his hearers to

              exclaimed, what would you have thought if you had heard the monster himself?</p>

              of the Articles in the last October number of the North-American Review— I read about

            <p>I made out a list of the manuscript Books and papers which were contained in the
              Trunk which had belonged to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>— The Books
              contain nearly all the Letters, public and private written by him while he was
              President of the United States and are essentially important to complete his
              correspondence scattered as it is over forty Folio Volumes, at Boston and Quincy. The
              loose papers in this Trunk are not of much value; excepting a number of Letters from
                <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>. and a few from my father to my
              brother <persRef ref="adams-thomas">Thomas</persRef>. a few from him, from my brother
                <persRef ref="adams-charles">Charles</persRef> and from myself, the perusal of which
              brought to my mind little else than painful recollections. Upon the Volumes of his own
              Letters I have not commenced, intending hereafter to read in regular Chronological
              order, all his Letters that I possess. Nor have I yet commenced upon his old Journals
              which I brought with me from Quincy— I had Morning visits from <persRef

              House of Representatives from a District in the State of New-York, and from <persRef

              with two young men from his State of Vermont— I received a short and ominous Letter

                <persRef ref="vaughan-benjamin">Benjamin Vaughan</persRef> at Hallowell— I resumed
              the Paper <pb type="ms" n="332"/>upon Parties in the United States which I left
              unfinished in the Spring, and which I could not bring myself to resume in the Summer
              at Quincy. It has a tedious aspect at present, and threatens again great prolixity
              before I can bring it to a close— I am reading an Article by <persRef

              history of Astronomy during the last century in the North American Review of April
              1825—continued upon <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Claris
              Oratoribus— He enumerates many Grecian Orators, whose works are no longer extant, but
              the number of Romans whom he mentions, and of whose Orations he speaks with high
              commendation is surprizing— The most eloquent of them all he pronounces to be <persRef

                Antonius</persRef> the two principal interlocutors of his dialogues de Oratore; and
              he describes the peculiar Style of Eloquence of each of them. He says they would never
              be surpassed unless by a Speaker profoundly versed in Philosophy, Jurisprudence, and

              about <persRef ref="eaton-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton</persRef>,
              wife of the <persRef ref="eaton-john">Secretary of War</persRef>; now the centre of
              much political intrigue and controversy— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton is the
              daughter of a man named <persRef ref="oneal-william">O’Neal</persRef> who some years
              since kept a Tavern and failed so that his house was sold to pay his debts. M<hi
                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton was wife to a purser in the Navy named <persRef
                ref="timberlake-john">Timberlake</persRef>, who being on service in the
              Mediterranean Squadron, his wife lived at her father’s, where M<hi rend="superscript"
                >r</hi> Eaton and General Jackson when a Senator were lodgers. When O’Neal’s house
              was sold it was purchased by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton— About a year and a
              half since Timberlake died, and very shortly after Eaton married his widow— Her
              reputation was not in good odour, and last Spring when Eaton was appointed Secretary
              of War, a grave question arose among the dignitaries high and low of the
              Administration, whether M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton was to associate with
              their wives— This question has occasioned a schism in the party some of whom have more
              and some less of moral scruple, the <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
                >Vice-President’s</persRef> wife <persRef ref="calhoun-floride">M<hi
                  rend="superscript">rs</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, being of the virtuous, and having
              then declared that rather than endure the contamination of M<hi rend="superscript"
                >rs</hi> Eaton’s company, she would not come to Washington this Winter, and
              accordingly she remains in the untainted atmosphere of South-Carolina— I told M<hi
                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rush that this struggle was likely to terminate in a
              party division of Caps and Hats. Settled my tax-bill with <persRef ref="billings-w">W.

              came, and prevailed upon me to subscribe for the Encyclopaedia Americana, edited by

                <persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor</persRef> paid us a

                Thomas</persRef> who comes from suttling for the troops at Holten Plantation and who
              gave me an Account of his intercourse, with the present <persRef ref="eaton-john"
                >Secretary of War</persRef>— He also gave me advice I fear too well founded, but
              which I cannot yet follow— I finished reading the Treatise of <persRef
                ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Claris Oratoribus, the closing paragraph of
              which is imperfect, although there seem to be only a few sentences, perhaps only part
              of one sentence lost. The last eighteen or twenty Sections are among the most
              interesting of all Cicero’s writings— They are introduced by a sarcastic remark of
                <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, upon the multitudes of Speakers whom
              Cicero had included in his list of Orators; many of whom Atticus insists were no
              Orators at all— Atticus laughs at him also, for comparing <persRef ref="cato-marcus"
                >Cato</persRef> the Censor, as an Orator with <persRef ref="lysias"
              >Lysias</persRef>; but Cicero very seriously maintains the position— He had declined
              saying anything upon the living Orators, but they prevail upon him to make an
              exception for himself, who he presents in parallel with Hortensius— The character that
              he gives of <persRef ref="hortensius-quintus">Hortensius</persRef> is in a strain of
              lofty Panegyric. He was an Orator of the florid, Asiatic Style— Among his
              extraordinary talents he mentions his method of dividing his discourses into parts—
              This same Talent Cicero had noticed in his first Oration for Quinctius and made it the
              occasion to shew that he himself was master of the same faculty— At the distance of
              thirty years he celebrates it again; and there is perhaps no more certain test of an
              accomplished Orator— The Account of Cicero’s preparatory Studies, of his indefatigable
              labours, and of his first appearance, opposed to Hortensius in a public Cause, the
              defence of <persRef ref="roscius-sextus">Roscius Amerinus</persRef>, is an excellent
              study for a youth of laudable Ambition— It is a rivalship of twenty years, during
              which they were engaged in an immense number of causes, each as he says preferring the
              performances of the other to his own—until says Cicero, his voice was extinguished by
              his own fate, and mine by that of the Public— I shall advert again to these works of
              Cicero upon Oratory.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic"><date>Day.</date></hi> I rise usually between 4 and 6. and on the
              average about 5. Read five Psalms. Write if there remains time till a few minutes past
              six— Walk round the Capitol Square, day-light dawning as I go; and return just before
              Sunrise. Read till our breakfast about nine— Allow two hours for that and for reading
              the Journals of the day— Read, write, receive visitors, and idle away the hours till
              four in the afternoon— Then dine— Two hours of idleness ensue, and two or three of
              reading or writing till about ten, when I retire to bed— My writing has been only this
              diary—a few Letters, and a few pages upon topics of political Speculation— Nothing
              useful— My reading, the Life of <persRef ref="lee-arthur">Arthur
                Lee</persRef>—<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Oratore and de Claris
              Oratoribus, and a few Articles of late Reviews— On the whole the Month has been
              unprofitably and wastefully spent— May the Account of the next be more satisfactory to
              myself.</p>
            <p>At the close of the year the only Sentiment that I feel to be proper is of humble
              gratitude to God, for the blessings with which it has been favoured— Its chastisements
              have been most afflictive; but I have experienced Mercy with Judgment— The loss of
              Power and of popular favour I could have endured with fortitude, and relief from the
              Slavery of Public Office was more than a compensation for all the privations, incident
              to the loss of place— Its varieties I despised; and its flatteries never gave me a
              moment of enjoyment.— But my beloved <persRef ref="adams-george">Son</persRef>!
              Mysterious Heaven! let me bow in submission to thy Will— Let me no longer yield to a
              desponding or distrustful Sprit— Grant me Fortitude— Patience— Perseverance; and
              active Energy— And let thy Will be done.</p>
