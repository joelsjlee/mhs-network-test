						<p>Bath and Swim in Potowmac</p>
						<p>A dead calm the whole Night with <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit</persRef> at 85. Between 5 and 6 I rode down to the
							banks of the river between the Tyber and the Bridge, and bathed and swam
							about 10 minutes— The tide had just turned, and a very light breeze just
							curled the surface of the water— On my return home I found <persRef
								ref="jagger-william">William Jagger</persRef> at my door— He comes
							now in search of evidence— This poor, ignorant, uneducated man some
							years since was smitten in his workshop with the fancy that he was an
							eminent politician and wrote and published sundry newspaper essays and
							pamphlets against <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van
								Buren</persRef>. Brought thus into notice, he was violently attacked
							in turn, and his moral character was brought into question till he
							commenced an action for slander against the publisher of a newspaper in
							which he was assailed— The suit is now pending, and his adversary’s
							lawyer has turned the tables upon him by a special plea, which puts him
							to the proof of his charges against Van Buren— He now comes to me to
							ransack the public documents for proofs when I have no time to spare— At
							the house a communication was received from the <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> relating to the
							census returns, but not the aggregate called for by my Resolution. There
							was a message from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>
							communicating a memorial signed by 3000 persons at New-York, praying for
							a bankrupt Law—and the Message cautiously recommends it— This process of
							petitioning Congress through the President is a novelty. Another message
							was also received enclosing copies of the President’s correspondence
							with <persRef ref="harrison-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Harrison</persRef> in communicating to her the Resolutions of
							Congress honorary to <persRef ref="harrison-william">her late
								husband</persRef>— The <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander"
								>M’Leod</persRef> Resolution was again skipped over this morning to
							go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="lawrence-joseph">Lawrence</persRef> in the Chair on the Land
							Bill— But the democracy had now got wind of this whig stratagem, and
							recalcitrated— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>
							sputtered against being gagged and called for the yeas and nays on the
							motion to go into Committee of the whole, but it was carried 106 to 69.
							I voted with the minority; disgusted with this perpetual establishment
							of rules perpetually to be suspended— On the land Bill <persRef
								ref="brown-charles3">Charles Brown</persRef> a democrat of the first
							water from Philadelphia, worried the whigs with numerous charges of
							inconsistency, which they endeavoured in vain to suppress by continual
							calls to order— He was followed by <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Governor
								Thomas W. Gilmer</persRef> of Virginia, a Hermaphrodite whig, and he
							by <persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin">Benjamin A. Bidlack</persRef> a
							slippery Pennsylvanian democrat, all against the bill— The floor was
							then taken by <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Francis W.
								Pickens</persRef> of South-Carolina the Committee rose and the house
							adjourned. <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here this
							afternoon— The intense heat of the last two days was succeeded this
							Evening by a heavy and copious thunder shower, which refreshed the earth
							but very little the atmosphere—</p>

						<p>Bath and Swim in Potowmac—</p>
						<p>Fifty minutes of the morning were consumed in riding to the river, ten
							minutes of bathing and swimming and returning home— <persRef
								ref="uzielli-r">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Uzielli</persRef> an
							Italian Gentleman from Leghorn brought me a very courteous Letter of
							introduction from <persRef ref="tocqueville-alexis">Alexis de
								Tocqueville</persRef> who says that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Uzielli travels in America from Scientific and philanthropic curiosity.—
							At 9. A.M. I attended a meeting of the select Committee on the currency.
							Present <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef>, Chairman,
							Adams, <persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef>, <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> and <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef>— It
							was within a quarter of ten, when the quorum was formed. We had still no
							distinct question before the Committee. There are two projects for a
							National Bank under consideration— A Bill reported by the <persRef
								ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, and a Bill
							reported by <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>, chairman of
							the Committee of the Senate to that body, and now in debate before them.
							Both Bills propose to locate the Bank in the District of Columbia— Both
							Bills propose the establishment of branches in the States, Ewing’s bill
							with the assent and Clay’s without the assent of the several States— To
							bring the deliberations of our Committee to a point I moved to take up
							the Bill now before the Senate, and to strike out from the first Section
							the words the District of Columbia, and insert the City of New-York—
							Sergeant observed that this would require a total change of the details
							of the Bill; which I admitted, but said that the whole question of bank
							or no bank was embraced in this small amendment— Details could easily be
							adjusted. There was no time to discuss the question, and the Committee
							agreed to meet at 5. to-morrow afternoon—but I expect to carry this
							motion for M’Kay and Rhett, who are against the Bill in any shape will
							vote for my amendment, and so I think will Pope and M’Keon—perhaps
							Botts— At the House— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
								<persRef ref="lawrence-joseph">Lawrence</persRef> in the chair on
							the land-Bill— <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, for
							nearly two hours disgorged <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							crudities, with his usual bawling, brawling pomposity, against the Bill.
								<persRef ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> of New-Jersey,
								<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef> followed in support of
							the Bill, and <persRef ref="dean-ezra">Dean</persRef> of Ohio, and then
							Habersham of Georgia against it— In the midst of his discourse, 3.
							O’Clock was approaching, the Committee rose— <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> from the Committee on the
							District of Columbia introduced a bill to provide for the maintenance of
							pauper lunatics. <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> moved to
							suspend the order for adjourning daily at 3 O’Clock— It would expire
							to-morrow, but they want to get the land bill out of Committee and
							through to-morrow— I objected that there was now no quorum and Stanley
							gave notice that he should renew his motion to-morrow morning.— I
							obtained permission from the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> to introduce M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Uzielli upon the floor of the house behind the Bar— He came and spent
							half an hour in hearing M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop’s maiden
							speech—a very good one— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholls</persRef> came this afternoon to urge his double suit for
								<persRef ref="romaine-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Bath and Swim in the Potowmac</p>
						<p>Total change in the temperature of the Atmosphere— Fair weather, a clear
							sky, warm Sun, balmy-breeze, and the Thermometer at 72— The repeated
							successive river baths, operate as friction upon the skin till it
							produces the excoriation of prickly heat— I called this morning at the
							Department of State, and saw <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>. I enquired
							concerning the aggregate returns called for of the census by Resolution
							of the house. <persRef ref="weaver-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William A. Weaver</persRef>, the superintendent in
							charge of this bureau, stated that this document was not yet complete
							and would not be for some time.— A general tabular aggregate has been
							returned in answer to a call from the Senate—in which one Slave is
							returned in the State of Massachusetts— I enquired how that
							happened—upon examination of the returns it appeared to come from an
							assistant marshal in Nantucket named <persRef ref="u">Worth</persRef>,
							and the slave is reported as forming one of 16 persons in the family of
								<persRef ref="barker-lydia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lydia
								Barker</persRef>— Observing that this must be a mistake I requested
							that a Letter might be written to the assistant Marshal, requiring an
							explanation of this point in his return; which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster directed— I enquired about the supplementary parts
							of <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist’s</persRef> correspondence,
							which have been all copied and are ready to be communicated— <persRef
								ref="derrick-william">Derrick</persRef> the Clerk who I have no
							doubt garbled the document communicated on the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> of March last, shewed some repugnance to furnishing these
							supplements, which he said were personalities— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster at first intimated a wish that I would look over the
							manuscripts to see if it would not be expedient to leave still some part
							of them out—but he finally concluded to send the whole— I named <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholls</persRef> to him as
							an applicant for the appointment of Consul at Havre at Hamburg or
							elsewhere. I said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster that the
							establishment of a National Bank was likely to fail; Upon which he said
							with some heat that he hoped if Congress should sit till next August
							twelve month, they would not adjourn with out establishing a national
							Bank— My detention at the Department belated me at the house, and they
							had been an hour and a half in session when I took my seat. <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanley</persRef> did not make his motion to
							supersede the adjournment at 3 p.m— The house on meeting went
							immediately into Committee of the whole on the land-bill— <persRef
								ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef> had finished his Speech
							on the land-bill, and I found <persRef ref="parmenter-william"
								>Parmenter</persRef> prosing to the same tune— <persRef
								ref="davis-richard">Richard D. Davis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mckeon-john">John M’Keon</persRef> spouted liquid fire of
							Democracy against it for about 2 hours, and <persRef ref="kennedy-john"
								>John P Kennedy</persRef> made a masterly Speech of about half an
							hour in its favour. <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>
							of Kentucky rambled about it and about it another half hour and just
							before 3, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> took the floor and
							the Committee rose— An attempt was made by <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> to adjourn over till Tuesday, defeated by <persRef
								ref="calhoun-william">W. B. Calhoun’s</persRef> motion to adjourn— I
							walked home dined and returned to meet the Committee on the Currency.
							All present—debate on my motion to strike out the District of Columbia,
							and insert the City of New-York—adjourned to next Friday afternoon—
							Heard the Music of the Marine band; and rode home with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>Independence day— 66.</p>
						<p>I attended public worship at the Capitol expecting that the preacher,
								<persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef>, Chaplain to the Senate would have taken both in
							his prayer and Sermon some notice of the day.— He took no notice of it
							whatever— He gave out to be sung the 100<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Psalm, and his text was from Acts 17.31. “Because he hath appointed a
							day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man
							whom he hath ordained.” The day of Judgment! The subject of the last
							discourse, delivered from that same chair, not five months since by the
							ever lamented <persRef ref="cookman-george">George G. Cookman</persRef>,
							who has since perished in the Steamer President, no one knows how—upon
							the deep— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Tustin alluded with some
							feeling both to the fact that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman’s
							last discourse as his predecessor was on this awful theme, and to the
							deplorable event which so shortly afterwards sent the preacher so
							prematurely into the presence of his maker, but it was not well advised
							in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin to select the same subject,
							with that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookmans valedictory
							discourse, the profound impression of which dwells deep in the memory of
							his hearers. An unusually large number of the Senators were now
							present.— Walking home-ward with <persRef ref="huntington-jabez">Jabez
								W. Huntington</persRef>, Senator from Connecticut he assured me that
								<persRef ref="rives-william">Rives’s</persRef> amendment to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">H. Clay’s</persRef> Bank Bill would be rejected by
							a large majority, which I can yet scarcely credit— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> attended Church at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s, and dined at <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye’s</persRef>— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the service for the fourth Sunday after
							Trinity and in reading the 45<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of
							Genesis, the recognition between <persRef ref="joseph3">Joseph</persRef>
							in his brethren was so deeply affected by it that he with great
							difficulty got through the reading and the tears gushed from his eyes.
							It was ludicrous— He preached from 2. Samuel 7.22. [“]Wherefore, thou
							art great, O Lord God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any
							God beside thee”— He gave notice that <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> would deliver a Lecture
							at the second Presbyterian Church, at 8 O’Clock this Evening upon the
							Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory.— I attended that Lecture, which
							followed the usual exercises of prayer and Psalm singing— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood’s text was from Matthew 7–16. “Ye
							shall know them by their fruits.”—and his argument was upon the immoral
							tendency of the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory— It was the second
							of two Lectures on that subject— The first had examined it historically;
							and had shewn that of the antient fathers only two, <persRef
								ref="tertullian">Tertullian</persRef> and <persRef ref="origen"
								>Origen</persRef> gave a countenance to it— He said the great proof
							of its immoral tendency was that it nullified the merits of the
							atonement, and transferred the power of absolving guilt from punishment
							from God to man— But this argument bears rather against the priest’s
							power of absolution than against the doctrine of purgatory itself.

									>r</hi> Wise</persRef> on his feet, bawling against the bill for

							This was carried by Tellers, and the motion to adjourn by yeas and

							Midshipman, and who wishes immediate employment; and if possible in the
							Mediterranean squadron now on the point of sailing— M<hi

							he said he wished the Officers of the Navy, who had any application to
							make to the Department, would make it themselves. I mentioned again to
							him the names of <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">Kavasales</persRef>,
							and as usual he spoke of him in the most favourable terms, but with
							obvious determination not to appoint him— His reason is that Kavasales,
							being a foreigner, a Greek of diminutive stature of meek and humble
							deportment, a foreigner, a Greek would be contemned by the Sailors, and
							therefore could not render useful service At the Pension Office, I spoke
							to <persRef ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							a Soldier of the last War— I found the house in debate on a rule
							reported this morning by the Committee on the rules— A new screw, to
							take bills out of Committee of the whole house at the pleasure of the
							majority— This rule after a convulsive struggle of the opposition, was
							adopted, first with a limitation of 6 days moved by <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> and then by reconsideration,
							without limitation— It was immediately applied to the land bill—a
							Resolution was driven through by previous question and yeas and nays:
							that at 7. O’Clock this evening the debate in Committee of the whole
							should cease and the question should be taken upon all the amendments
							proposed, and on the bill— The house then between 2 and 3 went into
							Committee of the whole on the Bill. <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth"
								>Rayner</persRef> made a speech of nearly three hours in favour of
							the bill. Then <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F.

							reported to the house—the amendments including mine adopted—passed to be
							engrossed and passed. Motion to reconsider the vote on the bill moved

							89.— Clark offered his resolution for a daily recess, but <persRef

							and the explicit and unqualified averment of the head money, received by

							Clerks who made the copies, seemed shocked at the idea, that the direct

							gentle, wary in discourse and conduct, and priding himself upon

							to day, was an error in a document reported by him recently to the

						<p>My birth day happens this day upon the Sabbath— Every return of the day
							comes with a weight of solemnity more and more awful. How peculiarly
							impressive ought it then to be, when the annual warning of the
							shortening thread, sounds in tones deepened by the Church bells of the
							Lord’s day? The question comes with yearly aggravation upon my
							conscience—what have I done with the seventy-four years that I have been
							indulged with the blessing of life? and following close upon it, another
							what can I do, what shall I do with the scanty and perilous remnant of
							life before me? The decay of body and mind, is gradually but with
							quickening pace gaining upon me— The time has come when I cannot with
							rational probability flatter myself even with one other return of the
							day. May I supplicate the father of Spirits, for the will and the power,
							to improve my last days in conformity to his will, for the good of my
							own family and the family of man, and in preparing to appear before his
							presence to plead for mercy?— And for his protecting arm to shield and
							sustain the helpless whom I leave behind?</p>
						<p>I attended the morning service at the second presbyterian church; where a
							stranger named <persRef ref="u">Lipscomb</persRef> preached from
							Revelation 1.4. [“]John to the seven churches, which are in Asia: Grace
							be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is
							to come: and from the seven Spirits, which are before his throne; 5. And
							from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten
							of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that
							loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood. 6. And hath made
							us kings and priests unto God and his father: to him be glory and
							dominion forever and ever. Amen,”— A harsh, grating, bursting unmanaged,
							voice, a drawling intonation, and vulgar pronunciation, cast some
							disfavour upon a discourse interesting by its originality and ingenuity,
							and by the fervour of the zeal with which it was delivered— The analysis
							of the text marked a thinking mind— The remarks upon the form and
							substance of the salutation—upon the manner of expressing the eternity
							of God—upon the seven Spirits, and upon the attributes ascribed to Jesus
							Christ, were all fruits of genuine meditation, and not scraps from a
							commonplace book—but all marred, by an ungracious delivery— Morning
							visit from <persRef ref="howe-joseph2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Joseph Howe</persRef> of Halifax, Nova-Scotia, from whom I received
							so many kind attentions and so much hospitality last September— He is
							now Speaker of house of Assembly of that Province. He has been traveling
							into Canada, and thence down through the State of New-York. He proposes
							to stay here only two or three days.— After dinner at S<hi

								>Speaker’s</persRef> chamber, and to <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">C.

							introduced him to the Senators <persRef ref="wright-silas"
								>Wright</persRef>, <persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Buchanan</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="walker-robert">Walker</persRef>. we then returned to
							the house at the meeting of which the <persRef ref="french-john">Rev<hi

								French</persRef> made the prayer. I offered a Resolution, requiring
							of the Secretary of the Treasury a report at the commencement of the
							next Session: which was received, but <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> objected to its immediate passage, and it lay over
							for the day— The house then went immediately into Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union upon the loan Bill; <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef
								ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> occupied his hour against

							and while he was speaking I went into the Senate chamber, with <persRef
								ref="howe-joseph2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe</persRef>,
							and found them in hot debate upon the bank bill— I introduced M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> of Kentucky, who was
							however in conflict of eloquence with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Buchanan— I left M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe, and returned to
							the house where <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Charles G.
								Atherton</persRef>, a cross-grained numskull from New-Hampshire was
							snarling against the loan bill; when he closed there was little more
							than half an hour left till 2 when the questions were to be taken—
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> had this time by
							the consent of <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, who had
							obtained the floor, but yielded it.— Fillmores reply was chiefly to John
							W. Jones— At 2 the debate ceased— Fillmore moved to strike out the first
							section and insert a substitute— <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"
								>Gilmer</persRef> moved an amendment for a new issue of Treasury
							Notes instead of a loan—lost 82 to 119— <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> moved an amendment, to strike out part of
							Fillmore’s new Section, and insert other matter— Chairman decided that
							this was not in order, the rule of the house that a motion to strike out
							and insert is not divisible— But the Committee reversed Briggs’s
							decision, and then rejected M’Kays amendment 91 to 108. sundry other
							captious amendments were moved and rejected—but Fillmore’s substitute
							for the first Section was adopted— The bill was then reported— <persRef
								ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> immediately moved the
							previous question, which was carried. <persRef ref="clifford-nathan"
								>Clifford</persRef> called the yeas and nays on the main question

							93. <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> then moved to go into

							for <persRef ref="shaw-lemuel">Chief Justice Shaw</persRef>; who was

						<p>I found the house in Session, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>
							had enquired whether the Resolution offered by me yesterday of enquiry
							respecting the State debts had been received— The <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> had answered him that it was.
							When I came in, I asked the consent of the house to take it up; but
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> insisted that he
							had a Resolution of prior date, of the precedence before mine he would
							not relinquish the claim— So the <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander"
								>M’Leod</persRef> Resolution was taken up, and the morning hour was
							wasted by <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Samuel S. Bowne</persRef> of
							Otsego, New-York, a Bombastes furioso all froth and venom against the
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef>. He said
							he was of a Quaker family, but was full of fight and was for taking John
							Bull by the horns at once. When he closed, <persRef ref="young-john3"
								>John Young</persRef> of Genesee took the floor; but the hour was
							out— Wise moved to go into committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union upon two of the three bills reported from the Committee of Naval
							Affairs— But he yielded to <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef>, to take up the bill making further provision
							for pauper lunatics in the District of Columbia which with little
							grumbling opposition and by the previous question screws was passed for
							engrossment and passed— The house then went into Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union and the Speaker called me to the Chair— The
							first bill was a mere appropriation of 139666 dollars and 6 cents to pay
							the navy pensions, on the first of this month, and the first of next
							January.— I had prepared, and intended to move a second Section,
							restoring the fund of more than eleven hundred thousand dollars which it
							owned on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1837— But Wise
							came to my seat and urged me to forbear encumbering the Bill; saying
							that the Committee were all for restoring the fund, but intended to
							revise the whole system at the Winter Session. I accordingly suppressed
							my second Session but <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> and
							Cave Johnson, started a debate of nearly four hours upon motions to
							amend, all having in view to repeal the act of 3. March 1837—and they
							carried their point in Committee of the whole. The second Bill contained
							an appropriation of 600000 dollars for the purchase of Ordnance and
							making experiments in Gunnery— M’Kay cavilled at this too and moved to
							reduce the appropriation to 300000 dollars but fail—one bill was
							reported with two amendments—the other without amendment— I opposed the
							amendments in the house and one of them failed—the bill then passed for
							engrossment and passed— The house adjourned about 4. I walked home in
							the blaze of a dog-day Sun. I was much over-heated— Company to dine as
							in the margin, except <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> who was here this Evening. Heat of the weather
							intense.</p>

						<p>The heat of the night was so oppressive that I was sleepless—and twice up

							season that this has happened— And I had in addition, last night a
							constant spasmodic affection, threatening cramps, and prickly heat over
							my whole body. At the house, several petitions, and memorials were
							received before I reached the Hall.— <persRef ref="floyd-john3"

							<persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> Resolution was then
							taken up, <persRef ref="young-john3">John Young</persRef> of Genesee a

							inflammatory, censuring both the late and the present administrations,
							for not obtaining satisfaction from Great Britain for the burning of the

							one-sided, as between the United States and Great-Britain— He spoke with
							some fluency and with appearance of candour, but carefully avoiding all
							the weak points of our cause in that controversy— The decision of the
							Supreme Court of the State of New-York refusing to discharge M’Leod upon
							Habeas-Corpus, and remanding him to Niagara County for trial, was this
							day received— When Young closed <persRef ref="morgan-christopher"
								>Morgan</persRef> took the floor; but as a few minutes only of the

								>Clifford</persRef> that nothing was proposed for Maine—then upon a
							contingent appropriation for the pea-patch, the title to which an
							individual has recovered at Law against the United States— This item of

							dollars for forts in Maine and after some discussion the Committee rose,
							and the house adjourned— <persRef ref="reeves-robert">Robert

						<p>The lightning rod above the Capitol, was struck by one of the
							thunderbolts last evening, and the Union tavern at Georgetown was struck
							with another— The two explosions occurred within the space of four or
							five minutes while the clouds were passing directly over our heads— The
							heat of the atmosphere was not sensibly abated by the storm of last
							evening, which was succeeded by a flat and sultry calm, freshened
							however by the copious fall of rain. A quiet sleep of five hours,
							restored part of my strength and from 5 to 6 this morning, I took my
							bath in the Potowmac— At the house, <persRef ref="morgan-christopher"
								>Morgan</persRef> of Cayuga, New-York, had the floor on <persRef
								ref="floyd-john3">Floyd’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> Resolution; but
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>, Chairman of the

							Committee of <hi rend="strikethrough">the whole on</hi> the state of the
							Union to take up the fortification Bill— Morgan readily consented; but
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> now the nuisance
							of the house, made a fruitless struggle for the morning hour; and
							complained piteously of the gag upon the minority.— He was not heeded,
							and deserved not to be. I do not approve and have voted against the
							restrictions upon the freedom of debate, but when a tyrannical majority
							fall into a minority they cannot chuse but to abuse the privilege of
							which they have deprived others— The house went into Committee of the
							whole, <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C. Winthrop</persRef> in
							the chair, as he had been yesterday; and took up the fortification
							Bill.— An appropriation was again moved for the pea-patch, and the
							debate became desultory. The absurdity of appropriating money to be
							wasted on a spot where by verdict of a jury and judicial sentence the
							public has no title, and where the owner claims a most extortionate
							price for a worthless mud bank forms no sufficient obstacle to this
							motion, and half the day was consumed in discussing it— When that was
							past <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> of Kentucky
							started an enquiry, why so much money should be appropriated for repairs
							upon Fort Warren and Fort Independence in Boston harbour. He ransacked
							all the fortification Bills from 1836 down to the present time, to prove
							that the appropriations now proposed could not be necessary. He said the
							same remarks would apply to all the others but he named those of which
							he complained only in Boston Harbour. <persRef ref="parmenter-william"
								>Parmenter</persRef> and <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett"
								>Saltonstall</persRef> answered him, and <persRef

							who has been many years a Missionary to the Sandwich Islands— He brought
							with him a Bible in the language of that Country printed and bound by
							natives—about one fifth of the population are converts to christianity,
							and have churches and schools, and wear cloathing after our own fashion.
							There are five islands in the group with a population of about 40000— A
							year or two ago the french frigate L’Artemise <persRef
								ref="laplace-cyrille">Captain La Place</persRef>, laid these islands
							under a contribution of 20000 dollars, and compelled them to admit a
							Roman Catholic establishment of Jesuits in competition with the American

							the Government of the United States to interpose for the protection of
							the American Missions by remonstrance to the French Government, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bingham is now here for that object— At
							the House, the morning hour was consumed in debating a foolish set of
							retrenchment Resolutions offered by <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett
								Davis</persRef>, with an amendment offered by <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, and an amendment to the
							amendment offered by <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanley</persRef> moved to lay the whole subject

							pretended that the reading of some paper recently called for by him had
							been refused. <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> demanded a
							division of Botts’s amendment. The first part was adopted with only four
							opposing votes and the other part was rejected 34 to 145.— Cave
							Johnson’s Amendment and Garrett Davis’s Resolution—were all adopted. 128
							to 78. all to no earthly purpose. <persRef ref="proffit-george"

						<p>Bath and swim in the Potowmac.</p>
						<p>The coolness of the weather diminished the pleasure of the bath, and the
							effect of my repeated baths with the excessive and almost incessant heat
							of the last fortnight has been to throw the internal heat of my body out
							upon the skin, in a rash, amounting almost to excoriation. At the
							meeting of the Currency committee last evening all the members except
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. B.
								Rhett</persRef> were present; but two of them were engaged for
							parties and no sooner was the quorum formed than there was a motion to
							adjourn— This was not immediately carried—but the sitting was not of
							more than one hour, and half that was absorbed in discussion, when and
							how we should meet in future— We took up the bill now pending in the
							Senate, and which has there been laid upon the table from inability to
							carry it through; our Chairman read six Sections of it, and sundry
							amendments were proposed discussed and adopted. Before 7. O’Clock we
							adjourned to 9 this morning— I was there to the minute— I found <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> there, but it was more than
							half past 9 before a Quorum was formed, and then we had to settle when
							we should meet again—at 5 this afternoon or at 9 Monday Morning— At last
							Sergeant proposed to ask leave of the house after this day to sit during
							the sitting of the house and this was carried against the remonstrances
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhett and of me— In the house,
								<persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> of Tennessee moved a
							reconsideration of the resolution adopted yesterday to take the
							fortification bill out of Committee of the whole this day at two
							O’Clock. Arnold gave as his reason that he has last Evening had an
							interview with a person of the first distinction in this Government, and
							had ascertained that all the great measures of relief to the People for
							which this special Session was called will fail—all founder in the gulph
							of Virginia abstractions— He dilated upon this oracular giving out,

							offered a joint resolution to adjourn the two houses next Thursday the

							The gloating joy and Sardonic grin of the opposition gang was sickening—
							Mason’s resolution was not in order nor received, but the vote to take
							the bill out of Committee at 2 O’Clock this day was reconsidered by yeas
							and nays— The Committees were called for Reports. leave was given to the
							Committee on the currency to sit during the sitting of the house— An

						<p>I attended this morning with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> at the Capitol, and heard
								<persRef ref="bingham-hiram">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bingham</persRef>, the Missionary to the Sandwich Islands, who
							preached in the Hall of the house of Representatives, from Nehemiah
							2:20. “Then I answered them and said, unto them— The God of heaven, he
							will prosper us: therefore we his servants will arise and build.” Of the
							history connected with the text, the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and of the
							Temple, on the return of fragments of the tribe of Judah from the
							Babylonian captivity, he said little—there are analogies between the
							circumstances under which that undertaking was accomplished, and those
							which have attended the mission to the Sandwich Islands, sufficiently
							marked to justify the application of the text to the religious
							enterprize which in the compass of the last quarter of a century has
							been with so much encouraging prospect of success in converting, the
							canibal Savages of the Southern Ocean, into a civilized, intelligent,
							pious Christian community— The Mission to the Sandwich Islands was first
							instituted in 1819. and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bingham was the
							first missionary.— There are now 19 churches and 20000 worshippers on
							the five islands.—Schools in proportion— Trade, commerce, agriculture,
							arts, manufactures, Christian apparel have followed as a consequences—
							Christian wedlock is taking the place of promiscuous intercourse— Family
							affections have superseded infanticide— A limited monarchy, brutal
							despotism. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bingham presented a multitude
							of details.— He read two or three verses from the Book of Psalms in the
							Sandwich Islands Bible, which he proposed to present to Congress, and he
							sung very sweetly in that language a version of one Stanza, of <persRef
								ref="heber-reginald">Bishop Heber’s</persRef> beautiful hymn— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bingham is not eloquent but his
							exhortations to spread over the whole surface of the globe the
							missionary cause were fervent and sincere— <persRef
								ref="buchanan-robert">Captain Buchanan</persRef> dined with us.— I
							received a Letter dated last Tuesday the 13<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my dear and
								suffering wife</persRef> at Quincy, where she arrived safely as she
							had proposed— Mary received another, dated Wednesday the 14<hi

								>t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity and preached
							from Romans 14.13. “Let us not therefore judge one another, any more:
							but judge this rather; that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion
							to fall in his brother’s way.” what an admirable text! how appropriate.
							How seasonable! how fruitless! After church I visited <persRef

						<p>I attended the Committee on the Currency precisely at 9 this morning.
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">J Sergeant</persRef> the chairman and
								<persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> were there. About half
							past 9. a quorum was formed and <persRef ref="habersham-richard"
								>Habersham</persRef> renewed a motion which had been rejected on
							Saturday, to suspend the discussion on the Bank Bill, and take up to
							report to the house, the bill from the Senate to repeal the
							sub-treasury— Chairman pronounced this motion not in order— Then M’Kay
							moved a reconsideration of the Saturday’s vote— Chairman said the House
							had decided last Session that Committees could not reconsider, and he
							must so decide though against his own opinion— M’Kay appeals—tie vote,
							four and 4. <persRef ref="mckeon-john">M’Keon</persRef> absent. Still
							Habersham renews his motion. Chairman decides it not in order.— Appeal,
							and tie vote again. Thus passed the time till ten, when the house met.
								<persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> made a thrust at the
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> by moving an amendment
							of the Journal of last Friday, in stating the Speaker’s decision,
							confirmed by the house of my right to call for the reading of a
							resolution upon which I was required to vote, when Turney had objected
							to the reading. The entry upon the journal was that the Speaker had
							referred the question to the house— Turney insisted that he had not—
							After some altercation, <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> moved
							to lay Turneys motion to amend the journal on the table— I obtained
							leave to explain, and took the whole blame of the difficulty upon
							myself, for not having been in my seat when the Resolution was first
							offered, and therefore obliged to ask that it might be read, when called
							to vote upon it— Botts’s motion to lay Turney’s motion to amend the
							journal on the table was then carried by yeas and nays 100 to 80. It was
							petition day, and I moved and urged that the States should be called for
							petitions—but <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved
							to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up
							the fortification bill—carried by 120 votes— No Petitions— <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> took the Chair and M’Kay
							commenced a Speech against the fortification Bill— The other members of
							the Currency Committee, returned to the Room of the Committee of
							Commerce, and debated the details of the Bank Bill, till half past 3 and
							adjourned till 10. to-morrow morning. When M’Kay finished his speech in
							the house he joined the Committee— For a few minutes all the members
							were present, and then it was settled to report the Section authorising
							the establishment of branches without the assent of the States— Botts
							offered a compromise amendment, scouted by <persRef ref="rhett-robert"
								>Rhett</persRef>, and not received. Several members were coming and
							going all the time— Numerous amendments great and small were moved— Some
							carried—others failed— <persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef> and

						<p>An almost sleepless Night, and tormenting restlessness from heat between
							flesh and skin all over the body— <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kavasales</persRef> came this morning
							to intreat me, as he said he had been advised by members of Congress to
							solicit of <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef> himself
							the appointment of chaplain in the navy for him, which I positively
							declined. He was importunate though meek and gentle but I was
							inflexible— I cannot countenance an appeal from a head of Department to
							the President upon a question of appointment, unless in a case of clear
							injustice— <persRef ref="badger-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Badger’s</persRef> reason for excluding Kavasales is not
							satisfactory to me; but I am not sure he is wrong.— There were two
							messages received yesterday by the House from the President, and
							presented by the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> this
							morning— One recommending a revival of the supplementary neutrality act
							of March 1838 which expired in March 1840. and the other in answer to a
							call for correspondence relating to American Citizens banished from
							Canada, and prisoners in Van Diemen’s land— Of whom it seems there are
							none— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> in the chair on
							the fortification Bill— <persRef ref="jones-isaac">Isaac D.
								Jones</persRef> of Maryland took the floor, and the Committee on the
							Currency, met in the room of the Committee of Commerce. All the members
							of the Committee were there part of the time; but <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> took no part in the
							discussion, voted occasionally, and finally went away before the final
							questions were taken, leaving with me a request from two ladies,
								<persRef ref="bruce-ellen">Miss Ellen Bruce</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bruce-sally">Miss Sally Bruce</persRef>, for my autograph— At
							twelve, the time fixed for taking the fortification Bill out of
							Committee we returned to the house— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> had moved to strike out the first section of the
							Bill which was rejected— In the house, <persRef ref="toland-george"
								>Toland</persRef> obtained an appropriation contingent for the pea
							patch of 50000 dollars from whig sympathy— Five or six of the Kentucky
							members, disgusted and alarmed at the late demonstrations of the Tyler
							party against <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, finally voted
							against this bill after repeated motions to postpone it for a fortnight,
							and to lay it on the table— It was at last passed by yeas and nays 148
							to 66. a majority of which no one had a conception; Wise having opposed
							it tooth and nail, from its first introduction— Wise gave notice that he
							should to morrow call up the Navy Ordnance Bill, and the house adjourned
							soon after two— The Currency Committee returned to their room, resumed
							the Bank Bill, went through with it making sundry Amendments as they
							proceeded, agreed to report it, and the Senates Bill to repeal the
							sub-treasury to-morrow morning, and adjourned without day. <persRef
								ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> had offered what he thought a
							compromise section about the establishment of branches with the assent

							him there— I barely screwed time to write to <persRef

						<p>I find it scarcely possible to reach the Capitol before the Meeting of
							the House— This morning I found them in debate upon a Resolution,
							reported by <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">R. C. Winthrop</persRef> from
							the Committee of Commerce, for the appointment of a Committee of nine
							members, to sit during the recess of Congress, and collect information,
							concerning duties on imposts and drawbacks to be reported preparatory to
							the revision of the tariff, and it had roused all the black bile of the
							South, and all the stupidity of the North, against protection— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
								>Pickens</persRef> mounted their nullification and State right
							coursers—spurred their sides and darted off.— They debated it through
							the morning hour, when Wise moved to go into Committee of the whole on
							the Union— But he allowed <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> Chairman of the Committee on the District to
							report a Bill for rechartering the District Banks— <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef> to report from the
							Committee on the Currency the fiscal Bank Bill, and the bill from the
							Senate to repeal the sub-treasury, with amendments—read twice, referred
							to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and ordered to
							be printed, and <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef>,
							Chairman of the judiciary Committee, reported a Bill to establish a
							Bankrupt Law, which was also twice read and referred— He reported also
							by direction of the Committee a Resolution that it is inexpedient that
							Congress should act upon a bankrupt Law at their present Session; but he
							said that was not his opinion but the reverse. He thought Congress might
							discuss and adopt a bankrupt Law, at the present Session— A motion was
							made to lay the resolution on the table, and carried by yeas and
							nays—118 to 81. Wise then moved again to go into Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union; which moved again to go into Committee of the
							whole on the State of the Union; which was done— <persRef
								ref="gilmer-thomas">R. W. Gilmer</persRef>, late governor of
							Virginia, in the Chair— The Home Squadron Bill was taken up—a mere
							appropriation of more than 700000 dollars to maintain and man and
							victual a home squadron of 2. Frigates 4 smaller sailing vessels and 2.
							Steamers. Wise moved an amendment that the <persRef ref="badger-george"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef> might in case of need substitute
							other vessels instead of the Steamers; but I remonstrated earnestly
							against it; and after some verbiage, Wise withdrew his amendment.— There
							were half a dozen venomous part speeches made by the New-York Mobocracy,
							to apologize for voting for the Bill, which was reported to the house
							without amendment; passed to the third reading and passed by yeas and
							nays 184 to 8. The House adjourned at 2— I went into the Senate chamber,
							and found them debating on amendments proposed to the Bank Bill— After
							these <persRef key="clay-henry">H. Clay</persRef> moved that the Bill
							should be reported with the amendments and printed— <persRef

							call at my house this morning—she came, and I subscribed for the book,
							not worth 6. cents— The man has laboured hard in his day and generation;
							and for several years was editor of a monthly Magazine at Philadelphia
							now forgotten— His mother and <persRef ref="fairfield-jane">his
								wife</persRef> were then his recruiting officers for subscribers,
							and these <hi rend="italic">works</hi> are the rakings and scrapings
							from that miscellany— At the house <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">R. C.

								>Fillmore</persRef>, pro forma moved to go into Committee of the

							there was a document from the Treasury Department not yet printed which
							would be necessary in the consideration of the Bill— So Winthrop’s
							Resolution was refused— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost

							malignant attack upon <persRef ref="nisbet-eugenius">Eugenius A
								Nisbett</persRef> of Georgia, a very handsome speaker and
							intelligent man, but mild, gentle, inoffensive and no duelist— Wise
							fears that the whole Georgia delegation, will flinch upon the Tariff
							subject, and he selected this man whom he knew he could bully and
							browbeat with impunity, to whip them all in— At the moment when Wise’s
							hour was out, Nisbett sprung up and said so, but <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> at the same time addressed the
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> and got the floor.
							Nisbett asked him to yield it, and many voices urged him to yield it—
							But Cushing was not to be diverted from hearing himself, and he
							controverted some of the weak points of Wise’s argument, while the house
							was all on tiptoe for Nisbetts counter personalities— When Cushing
							finished Nisbett replied to Wise—with some show of Spirit, and saying
							some severe things, but evidently cowed and overawed by the domineering
							and insulting tone and manner of Wise; who rejoined with tenfold
							bitterness and malice— Nisbett surrejoined almost supplicating
							forgiveness— Wise completely carried his point of breaking down Nisbett,
							and we shall see its effect on the whole Georgia delegation— This foray
							lasted till half past two O’Clock, and immediately after it closed the
							house adjourned— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript"

							said to me rather crustily, that appointment is made— I believe the name

							>Allen</persRef>— I asked him upon what terms he expected to negotiate
							his loan. He said he hoped at 5 per cent.— I asked him if he would not
							want more— He thought he should— The revenue from impost yields now
							short of a Million a Month— They were so long in making out my warrant
							for payment of Treasury Notes payable this day 2260 dollars with 113.
							for interest, that I requested them to send it when made out to my
							house— A feeble effort was made by <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef> in the house to go into Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union, upon the Bill relating to impost duties and
							drawbacks. But his document tables were not yet ready, and the house

							ranted out his hour against the Resolution, and against all revenue by

							made a half way speech, and <persRef ref="kennedy-john">John P.
								Kennedy</persRef> of Baltimore a spirited and ingenious speech upon
							the tariff topic— There was a call of the house to which 179 first
							answered, and on the call of absentees 202. proceedings were then
							superseded; and there were 16 whigs absent, and 6 democrats.— King moved
							the previous question. <persRef ref="meriwether-james2"
								>Meriwether</persRef> of Georgia moved to lay the Resolution on the

							previous question; but on the vote shall the main question be now put
							the yeas and nays were 101 to 100. and this was only because 4 whigs who
							had voted against it changed their votes— The Resolution passed by 106
							to 104. and <persRef ref="mckeon-john">John M’Keon</persRef> of New-York
							immediately moved a reconsideration, upon which he hoisted an
							anti-tariff hour speech. <persRef ref="pickens-francis">M<hi

						<p><persRef ref="southwick-edward">Edward Southwick</persRef> the man who
							visited me yesterday told me that he was a native of Massachusetts but
							now resided in the western part of New-York—that he was an abolitionist,
							and was now going to the South, to discuss the matter with them there.
							He asked me what I thought of it— I said the best thing he could do, was
							to turn round and go home— He asked if I thought there would be danger
							of harm to him— I said the least he could expect to get was a ducking.
							He said the late Governor of North-Carolina, had written to him that
							there was not the slightest danger for him in that State— I said
							North-Carolina was not so fanatical as some other Southern States, but
							he had better not trust himself even there.— I would advise him too to
							be very cautious in his conversation here, and to go home as soon as
							possible— This morning I called on the <persRef ref="granger-francis"
								>Postmaster general</persRef>, concerning certain Post-Offices and
							Mail Routes— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jones</persRef> called me out from my seat yesterday to complain of
							the discontinuance of a daily mail from Boston to Randolph, Stoughton
							and Bridgewater, and the substitution of a mail three times a week— He
							wanted me to sign a remonstrance against it, but I preferred speaking to
							the Postmaster general— He did not appear to be fully acquainted with
							the reasons for the change, but directed an examination, and will
							restore the daily mail if he can. I gave him a Letter from <persRef
								ref="bicknell-lovell">Lovell Bicknell</persRef> of East-Weymouth
							resigning the Office of Postmaster there and recommending <persRef
								ref="randell-dean">Dean Randell</persRef> for the appointment—with

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger said another person had already
							been appointed— I read the Letter of <persRef ref="kingsbury-fisher"
								>Fisher A. Kingsbury</persRef>, urging that if he should be removed

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 90— Thunder
							Showers.</p>
						<p>The Thermometer in my chamber was at the highest point that I ever knew—
							At <persRef ref="gunton-william">Gunton’s</persRef> in Pennsylvania
							Avenue it was at 99. I never suffered so much from the heat of the
							atmosphere, and am absolutely an invalid— Going to the second
							Presbyterian Church this morning with an umbrella over me, the rays of
							the Sun pierced through it, and felt like coals of fire upon my head.— I
							came near to fainting in church— The preacher was a stranger, and his
							text was from Isaiah 45.22. “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends
							of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.” A minatory
							calvinistic discourse upon the usual platform, and in which I heard
							nothing worth remembering. There was a corner of a distant thunder
							shower, that passed over towards the close of the Sermon, after which
							the Sun came out again as intense as before. <persRef
								ref="buchanan-robert">Captain Buchanan</persRef> dined with us.
							After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after
							trinity, and preached from Romans 2.28. [“]For he is not a Jew, which is
							one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward, in the
							flesh— 29. But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly: and circumcision is
							that of the heart: in the spirit, and not in the letter: whose praise is
							not of men, but of God”— Spirituality is the exclusive attribute of the
							Christian Religion— Circumcision, was of all religious institutions, the
							most physical and the most remote from spirituality— But <persRef
								ref="paul">Paul</persRef> writing to the Romans to whose conversion
							to Christianity, the necessity of submitting to the operation of
							circumcision, was an insuperable obstacle, spiritualizes circumcision
							itself— He had quarreled with <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, by
							insisting that the gentile converts should not be required to submit
							their persons to that rite, and in this epistle to the Romans, he points
							out the difference of motives for conversion to the gospel of the Jews
							and the Gentiles— In the first chapter he gives a hideous picture of the
							vices into which the heathens had fallen for want of a moral law.— And
							he dwells particularly upon the brutal vices of self-pollution— These
							vices were prohibited upon the severest penalties by the Jewish Law, nor
							is there a trace of the practice of them among the Jews, since the
							destruction of Sodom by fire from Heaven— The second eclogue of <persRef
								ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> is a burning commentary upon the first
							chapter of Paul’s epistle to the Romans— The motive for their
							conversion, was moral principle— That of the Jews was because Jesus was
							the Messiah— The Son of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> and of
								<persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>, in whom all the families
							of the Earth were to be blessed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley
							generalized the doctrine of his text, and descanted upon the familiar
							topic of the inefficacy of all religion of mere formality— There was a
							second thunder shower this evening, which approached nearer to us than
							that of the morning, but was still too remote for a saturating Shower—
							The excessive heat disqualified me for all useful labour— I barely
							collected a statement of the amount of duties of impost collected
							annually and of the annual expenditures from 1833 to 1840 inclusive.</p>

						<p>The atmosphere has been again purified by the process of the thunder
							showers, and with <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef>
							at 78 and a fresh breeze the air feels delightfully cool— I called at
							the Department of War, and delivered to the Secretary, <persRef
								ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> a
							Letter from <persRef ref="derby-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Derby</persRef>, daughter of my deceased old friend <persRef

							warrant of Cadet at the West-Point Academy for her son <persRef
								ref="derby-george">George H. Derby</persRef>, and several sheets of
							recommendations, to which I added a very warm one of my own. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell enquired if the young man resided in
							my district, I said he did not, but in that of <persRef
								ref="hastings-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hastings</persRef>, who, the mother supposed was precommitted in
							favour of another person. Under the new census however, there would be a
							new organization of Districts, and then young Derby might be in a
							different District— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell said he would
							have his name for a positive appointment next June, as one of the ten
							supernumeraries, if he should remain in the Department— I presented also
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell the Letter of <persRef
								ref="weld-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William H.
								Weld</persRef> of Boston, soliciting a Cadet’s Warrant for his Son,
								<persRef ref="weld-john">John Barrett Weld</persRef>, whose name he
							said should be entered upon the files of the Department as a candidate.
							Going to the Capitol I stop’d at <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major
								Nourse’s</persRef> Office, and desired him to procure for me
							Cincinnati City 6. per cent bonds at 85 per cent I found the house in
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> in the Chair, upon the bill
							relating to duties and drawbacks. <persRef ref="lawrence-joseph"
								>Lawrence</persRef> of Pennsylvania, had moved to strike out Tea and
							Coffee from the Articles to be burdened with a duty of 20 per cent ad
							valorem, and was supporting his amendment with a speech of not much
							power— <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> then moved to
							strike out the enacting clause of the Bill, and distilled off an hour of
							wormwood and vinegar upon the bill, and upon the administration.
								<persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South Carolina
							followed and offered an amendment to the bill, which was to repeal the
							specie paying sections of the sub-treasury— <persRef
								ref="halstead-william">Halstead</persRef> of New-Jersey answered
							Atherton, and <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef> of New York
							replied to Halstead— Ward gave a totally perverted and deceptive history
							of the compromise act of 1833, and that roused me— I rose to speak for
							five or ten minutes, and at the expiration of the hour was arrested by
								<persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> of South-Carolina
							starting up and claiming the floor— Many of the members called upon me
							to go on, but I declined and took my seat— It was close upon 3 O’Clock
							the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— When I got home an old man
							of 75 named <persRef ref="white-john3">John M. White</persRef>, keeper
							of Smith’s island light-house in Chesapeake-Bay, came weeping and
							wailing that they threaten to turn him out— <persRef ref="mease-james"

						<p>My warm bath, Spirits of Nitre and Cream of Tartar have had little or no

						<p>I was obliged this morning to hasten to the Capitol, to be there at the
							meeting of the house— As soon as the Journal of yesterday had been read,
							I rose to present the residue of the Petitions which I had on hand. The
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said there was an
							appeal from his decision that I had the right to present them— He took
							the question whether the decision of the Speaker should stand as the
							judgment of the house, and nearly all the members present rose in the
							affirmative—not ten in the negative— I presented them accordingly—one
							for a bankrupt Law was received and referred to the committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union— One from Wheeling, signed by 130
							Citizens of Virginia, praying Congress to enact Laws that all the free
							coloured population may be sold as Slaves, or expelled from the Country—
							I said I had long hesitated whether I would present this petition; to
							the prayer of which nothing could be more abhorrent to my disposition—
							My respect for the right of petition was my only motive for presenting
							this— I asked the Speaker if this was one of those, which would be
							suspended by the rule of this Session— he said it would— <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanley</persRef> objected to its being
							received, and said it was as inhuman and unjust as would be the general

								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> moved to strike out Friday and
							insert Saturday upon which there was long debate, but the amendment was

							for a bankrupt law which he said he was extremely anxious to present,

								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, and then another member

							his intention to submit for consideration some foolish amendment of the

							whig—he read and spoke out his hour and was followed by <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> and he by <persRef

								ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> of New Jersey came next and

							and against the compromise, and for and against almost every thing else;
							all in mysterious whispers, addressing sometimes the South, and

						<p>The excessive heat has for some days subsided, but my parched skin and

								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> spoke his hour out, feebly, and in a
							tone greatly subdued, against the Bill. There were but forty minutes
							left which Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
							occupied with sound argument in reply to objections against the
							Bill—from Noon till 3. the questions were taken upon amendments, almost
							all frivolous, and rejected counting by tellers.— One amendment
							insidiously offered by <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> to repeal the exemption from duty on Rail-road
							iron, was carried in Committee, but rejected by yeas and nays 93 to 119.
							in the House. When the Committee rose and reported the Bill, <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> moved the previous question.
							Cave Johnson moved to lay the Bill on the table. lost by yeas and nays
							92 to 123— Yeas and nays on taking the main question 113 to 96— The bill
							passed to be engrossed without yeas and nays— There was loud call to
							take the question on the bill now, but it was not engrossed, and a
							motion to adjourn was made and carried— <persRef ref="buchanan-robert"
								>Captain Buchanan</persRef> was here this Evening— I received a
							Letter of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> from <persRef

						<p><date>31 IV:30. </date>Saturday</p>
						<p>The excessive heat has passed off and the temperature of the atmosphere
							is genial and delightful: but my thorn in the flesh is not extracted nor
							are its symptoms mitigated— I reached the house again this morning in
							time to hear the prayer of the <persRef ref="french-john">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								French</persRef>— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>
							called the Committees for Reports— Then <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D.
								D. Barnard</persRef> called for the orders of the day— The Bankrupt
							Bill from the Senate was taken up, and after a motion by <persRef
								ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> to lay it on the table,
							rejected by yeas and nays 91 to 123 was referred to the Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union and ordered to be printed; but a motion
							to print 5000 extra copies of Barnard’s Report failed.— The Bill
							relating to duties and drawbacks, otherwise called the revenue bill was
							read the third time and passed— <persRef ref="proffit-george">George H.
								Proffit</persRef> of Indiana, a high-toned but humoursome whig was
							quite obstreperous against it yesterday, because it includes tea and
							coffee among the articles to pay a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem, and
							because he had not been allowed to make a speech on sundry amendments
							which he had intended to propose— He had offered a Resolution for the
							adoption of a rule to take the yeas and nays, upon questions in
							Committee of the whole—one of the worst alterations that could be made;
							and now he broke out into a violent attack upon the precipitation with
							which this revenue bill has been driven through the house— <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> answered him, somewhat in his
							own temper, and moved the previous question— The second to the previous
							question was taken by tellers and carried— On putting the main question
							the yeas and nays were 117 to 95 and the bill passed 116 to 101.
								<persRef ref="borden-nathaniel">Borden</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> voted against it— I
							hesitated much, before making up my mind to vote for it; but the
							necessity of providing the means to replenish the Treasury, to restore
							credit and to pay the public debt, outweighed all other considerations,
							especially as the Winter Session is close at hand, when any necessary
							modification of the act may be made— Proffit voted for the Bill,
							intending to move a reconsideration and then make a speech; but <persRef
								ref="clark-john">J. C. Clark</persRef> was too quick for him, and
							moved at once a reconsideration and the previous question—the
							reconsideration was rejected 99 to 105— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> then moved to amend the title and call it an act to
							violate the compromise of 1833. Made a speech of half an hour, and then
							withdrew his amendment— <persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin"
								>Bidlack</persRef> the Jackass mimic of the lapdog made the same
							motion to amend the title; but his amendment was insulting to the house
							and he was not allowed to drone out his half-hour— The previous question
							was called and carried; and at 2. the house adjourned. I waited till 3.
							and then went to the top of the Capitol, and witnessed the communication
							by Telegraph of a Frenchman named <persRef ref="gonon-e"
							>Gonon</persRef>— The other station was five miles distant, at
							Bladensburg— To my question who was <persRef ref="victoria">queen
								Victoria’s</persRef> prime Minister, they answered—<persRef
								ref="temple-henry">Lord Palmerston</persRef>. [symbols]</p>
