						<p><persRef ref="lincoln-jotham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jotham
								Lincoln</persRef> of Hingham, called here, this morning, being on
							his way to Brookline upon business. He was an Inspector of the Customs,
							when I was President, and <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General H. A.
								S. Dearborn</persRef> Collector at Boston— When <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> became President, he
							dismissed Dearborn from the Office of Collector and appointed <persRef
								ref="henshaw-david">David Henshaw</persRef> in his place— Henshaw
							displaced Jotham Lincoln, and appointed in his place, I know not whom—
							Henshaw a patriotic democrat ruled the Jackson party; filled his
							pockets, with the emoluments of the Collectors Office, speculated upon
							the Commonwealths Bank till it broke; ratted from that in time to save
							himself; and by the political jugglery of getting whig lawyers to settle
							the Accounts of the broken Commonwealth’s bank, sunk some hundreds of
							thousands of dollars, for the Treasury of the United States, and holds
							his head up like an honest man, with an investigation, in Congress,
							which like all other such investigations will end in smoke— When
								<persRef ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> and the whigs
							came in, Dearborn and Jotham, and numberless others, turned out of
							Office by Jackson and his Satellites, expected to be restored to their
							Offices— All, I believe without one exception have been disappointed—
							Jotham is in great want of a place because he says a partner of his in
							trade has swindled him out of all his property, and he thinks hard of
							me, because he knows so little of the world as to believe that my
							recommendation would restore him— I have been chary of recommendations,
							and not one that I have made has succeeded— <persRef ref="robbins-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robbins</persRef> of Milton,
							with <persRef ref="robbins-frances">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Robbins</persRef> called this afternoon, to repeat the invitation to
							me to deliver a Lecture before the Milton Lyceum— My catarrhal cough is
							now complicated with a touch of the lumbago— I know not how long I shall
							have the free use even of my limbs— Without positively declining, I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robbins I feared it would not be in
							my power to lecture again this Season— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Robbins is a Son of the late <persRef ref="robbins-edward">Edward
								Hutchinson Robbins</persRef>, sometime Speaker of the House of
							Representatives of the Commonwealth. Afterwards Lieutenant Governor, and
							at last judge of probate for the County of Norfolk.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Robbins is, or rather has been for the
							present year a Senator for the County in the State Legislature. He is
							now a candidate for re-election, but without prospect of success— The
							weather was this day so warm, that I had no fire in my chamber— I
							planted some shagbark nuts and Acorns in the Seminary. Wasted great part
							of the day in unsorting and assorting pamphlets and papers, and the
							range of my exercise, was a visit to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								son’s</persRef> house on the hill. He was here this evening</p>

						<p>It is impossible for me to enumerate or to foresee the calls upon my time
							from breakfast for the remainder of the day. I completed within four
							lines my record of yesterday before breakfast; and then by calls of five
							or ten minutes at a time ran down the morning so that I barely could
							finish the page before dinner.— I was desirous of referring to a
							congressional document of the Session of 1829 and 30. and had a search
							for it of at least two hours at the farm house, without success— But in
							a fruitless search for one thing I sometimes find another— I had been
							wanting to look into a small volume of poems of <persRef
								ref="parnell-thomas">Parnell</persRef>, without knowing where to
							find it. This time it fell under my hands, as I was seeking for public
							documents— I found the words which had remained many years on my memory—
							My impression was that they were <persRef ref="prior-matthew"
								>Prior’s</persRef>—but they are in a Letter from <persRef
								ref="arbuthnot-john">Arbuthnot</persRef> to Parnell— My search for
							them was to enliven a Letter to <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William
								Cost Johnson</persRef>— With no small difficulty and by borrowing an
							hour of the evening by lamplight— We had visits this afternoon from
								<persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook</persRef>, and his daughter <persRef ref="robinson-polly"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Robinson</persRef>, who said
							she had come on purpose to see me, never having seen me before. The
							Doctor is 85 years of age, and until within the last few months has
							enjoyed very good health— He is now drooping, but still cheerful— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Robinson uses an ear trumpet— <persRef
								ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Angier</persRef> were
							also—from Medford this morning and return thither this evening. <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston and returned
							home to dinner. <persRef ref="hardwick-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Joseph Hardwick</persRef> was here, a second time with
							my annual parish tax bill but I was obliged to refer him over to my Son—
							At evening twilight I went up the hill for a quarter of an hour, and
							Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife </persRef>passed part
							of the evening here— We had nearly concluded, upon a general departure
							from this place the day after to-morrow— Charles and his family to take
							up their abode for the winter in Boston—<persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and family to proceed
							immediately to Washington, and I myself to pass three weeks in Boston,
							and then go on to attend the Session of Congress— But Charles’s wife,
							whose health is somewhat impaired has thoughts of going to spend the
							winter, or part of it with us at Washington—</p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>. My daily mode of life here has been to rise
							between 4 and 5. and it takes me an hour to wash, dress and make my
							fire. When the Sun rises clear, I visit the S.E. corner of Charles’s
							house— Yesterday the Sun rose from that corner in a line with the
							Universalist Meeting house— I write, or read, Letters received by the
							Mail, and Newspapers till 8. then breakfast, read with my <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Granddaughter</persRef> two Chapters in the Bible,
							French and English—dawdle till two—dine—dawdle till Sunset— Up the hill
							and down again. Eve with my family.</p>

						<p>Arcturus and Venus rose together with me, the fixed star gaining daily
							upon the planet— Part of the avocations of this day consisted of
							accounts and bills to be settled, before our departure. <persRef
								ref="bean-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jonathan
								Bean</persRef> of Mountville in the State of Maine came to see me,
							and he said for no other purpose; being in this town, merely on a visit
							to relatives of his own name— He was very inquisitive of my opinions
							especially upon political topics; and I freely gave them— I had received
							two Letters from <persRef ref="seward-william">Governor Seward</persRef>
							of New-York, of great civility; one of them inviting me to lodge at his
							house in Albany. He had sent me copies of his Messages to the
							Legislature, particularly concerning his controversy with the Governors
							of Virginia. I had sent him a copy of my Speech in H.R.U.S. upon the
							case of <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef>, in
							acknowledging the receipt of which, he had intimated his dissent from
							some of the opinions expressed in it— I had now to reply to his
							kindness, his courtesy and his dissent, in one Letter, and it took me
							half this day to write it to reciprocate benevolence without simulating
							or dissimulating opinion, to maintain perfect sincerity, without
							wounding sensibility, requires so much caution in the use of words, and
							in the expression of sentiment, that it takes almost as much time to
							write such a Letter, as to compose a dissertation. <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> in such cases wrote
							flattering Letters to their correspondents, and Letters, censorious of
							the same correspondents to others— This is the quintessence of
							duplicity— There is great danger of falling into this practice. There is
							no surer test of a double-dealer than to compare his Letters of opinion,
							with one another— I went with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> this Evening to the town-Hall, where he delivered
							the Lecture before the Quincy Lyceum. It was a critical disquisition
							upon <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>, and a
							comparative analysis of his Tragedy of <persRef ref="hamlet"
								>Hamlet</persRef>, with the Electra of <persRef ref="sophocles"
								>Sophocles</persRef> and the Semiramis of Voltaire— He had delivered
							this Lecture, last Winter, before the Society for the diffusion of
							useful knowledge at Boston, and doubted whether it would be suitable to
							his auditory here— But the Hall was as crowded as it could hold—two
							thirds at least of the company being women— The lecture occupied an hour
							and a half, and the profoundest silence, with the most intense
							attention, proved the deep interest taken in it by the auditory— I read
							this Lecture last Spring; and there is another forming a sequel to it
							and containing a similar comparative analysis of Shakespear’s <persRef
								ref="macbeth">Macbeth</persRef>, which I have not read. Charles’s
							estimate of Shakespear’s genius is lower than mine. There is less of
							enthusiasm, and more of judgment in his composition than in mine— When
							we returned from the Lyceum Meeting, <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> had gone home.</p>

						<p>Arcturus and Venus, beamed upon my sight this morning as I entered my
							Library, neither of them five minutes risen, but Arcturus first— They
							ascended the skies in a parallel line, like two dancers of a minuet,
							till the broad dawn of morning twilight had trim’d their lustre down to
							a pin’s point when suddenly a curtain of vapour was drawn before them,
							and a thick fog, veiled the rising of the Sun, with a chill
							North-eastern wind which continued through the day. <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> has concluded to
							postpone her departure for Washington till next Monday; and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> moved with his family into

								ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel T.

								ref="adams-charles7;adams-john17;adams-louisa3;adams-henry4;adams-arthur"
								>children</persRef> came in afterwards in the Carriage— As I was
							walking from the livery-stable to Charles’s house, I met <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">Richard H. Wilde</persRef> of Georgia, with a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason</persRef> in
							the little Mall— Wilde said he had been only a few days in Boston, and
							was going for the South this afternoon— At <persRef
								ref="mitchell-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mitchell’s</persRef> shop, I took the seal of the Johnson arms,
							which he has engraved for me. And in <persRef ref="robson-thomas"
								>Robson’s</persRef> British heraldry, a book in three quarto volumes
							which he has, I found the heraldic technical description of those arms,
							and of the Adams arms, as on <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> seal, and of the Boylston arms, as used by him in
							the Seal which he affixed to the Treaties with the Netherlands, Prussia,
							and Morocco, and the Preliminary and definitive Treaties of Peace of 30.
								Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1782 and 3. Sept<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1783.— I note here, that the flower de
							Luce, between two Lions, on the three pellets of the Boylston arms, were
							inserted by my father immediately after the Peace of 1782. and were
							significant of his Missions to France, the Netherlands and
							Great-Britain— The most beautiful emblem of the Boylston arms—the
							crest—the Lion bearing the cross, is not given in Robson’s book— There
							are in that book 28 different shields by the name of Adams and I
							think<space/>by the name of Johnson— I called at <persRef ref="bond-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond’s</persRef> shop, and took
							my Chronometer—then at <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft’s</persRef>, but he was not
							at home, and at <persRef ref="loring-ellis">Ellis Gray
								Loring’s</persRef> Office, but he was not there— I met there
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Josiah Quincy jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> Returning to Charles’s house just before we

								<persRef ref="deming-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							City, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan renewed the invitation
							to me to attend and address them at a public exhibition, which I again
							declined. At half past 4 I went and dined at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Samuel T. Armstrong and a company of 20—<persRef

						<p>Having taken my diary with me to the city, with the help of a friction
							match, a lamp, and a warm chamber, I was enabled to occupy the hours
							from my usual rising time till breakfast; and to avoid arrearage— There
							was heavy rain in the night which continued through part of the Morning.
							After breakfast, I called on <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef>, and had an
							hour of conversation with him upon the electioneering politics of the
							day.— The whig party, as they call themselves is splitting up into a
							thousand fragments— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence is
							struggling to sustain it, and <persRef ref="choate-rufus">Rufus
								Choate</persRef>, and <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef>, and <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Leverett
								Saltonstall</persRef> are haranguing whig caucus-meetings throughout
							the State in vain to support it— The general expectation is that
								<persRef ref="morton-marcus">Marcus Morton</persRef> will again be
							elected Governor of the Commonwealth, and that democracy will ride rough
							shod over the whole Country— The ambitious politicians are trimming
							their sails to the breeze— <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef> has been spending several weeks at Marshfield,
							fishing, shooting, ut olim, leaving his son <persRef
								ref="webster-fletcher">Fletcher</persRef> to <hi rend="italic"
								>act</hi> the Secretary of State, and affecting the Stoic to the
							still recurring rumours that he is to be discarded, or hoisted out of
							his department into some foreign mission— He has avoided and evaded all
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence upon the
							thorny questions of Bank, Tariff and negotiation with England, and
							Lawrence has lost all confidence in him— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Caleb Cushing</persRef> has taken a Lover’s leap over to the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> territory, and makes his
							court (fait sa cour) to the Lady Elizabeth— This as <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> says is a curious show, but
							unsafe to stand upon— The prospects of the Country so far as government
							is concerned are dismal, but its prosperity continues unabated and
							increasing.— God and Nature are still bountiful; but Providence as if to
							reserve to itself its supremacy of beneficence, and to baffle and
							disconcert all human exertion to promote its purpose, scattered to the
							winds of Heaven all the plans of improvement in the condition of the
							Country, by clipping the thread of <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>Harrison’s</persRef> life at the very moment when he had been
							raised to the summit of power, and when all the hopes of a liberal
							administration of the National Government were concentrated upon him— I
							called at <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office, and
							then with him at <persRef ref="poole-lott">Pool</persRef> the Taylor’s,
							where I ordered a winter waistcoat and pair of Pantaloons.— Returned to
							Charles’s house, and he brought me in his Gig home to Quincy. He dined
							with us, and then returned to Boston— At 7 this evening I went with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and my
							Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, to a
							concert at the Hancock house, by the <persRef ref="rainer"
								>Rainers</persRef>, A German Swiss family of itinerant musicians—
							There were this evening four men, and one woman—dressed in the costume
							of their country— They sang 12 popular songs and duets, the woman
							accompanying with a Guitar; and two of the men, accompanied one of the
							songs with Zitterns— Small rooms, and a crowded auditory.</p>

								>Elizabeth’s</persRef> mentioning that Louisa C. Smith, was at her

							from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s, and Louisa C. Smith
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Greenleaf’s— Now came the

							Greenleaf’s, and did not go there for her. He brought Mary home, and

							Greenleaf’s, where she had been waiting on tenter-hooks for hours, and
							he at last brought her home— The solution of the mystery was that before
							she got to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf’s house, Mary Dawes
							had walked out— They dined about Noon. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> paid us an evening

							There are 702 hymns and 6 doxologies—of the hymns 22 are of my

									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached from Matthew 25.29. [“]For unto
							every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance; but from
							him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” This is
							a passage in which minute criticism detects an inconsistency— But no
							part of the holy scriptures was written for captious readers; nor is
							moral truth ever to be taught by mathematical precision of language—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did not notice the arithmetical
							impossibility of taking away from nothing, but discoursed upon the text
							as containing a moral principle and affording instruction for the
							practice of Christians— The text is the conclusion form the double
							parable, and of the two Stewards, and the lesson is not with reference
							to the possession, but to the employment of talents— The steward who <hi
								rend="italic">had</hi> the ten talents had received only five, which
							he had by diligent employment of them increased to ten. He who had
							received one, had not wasted or lost it; but having neglected to employ
							it— He had nothing of his own acquirement then, and so that which he
							had, the original deposit was taken away from him— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt read a notice of the parish meeting
							to be held, immediately after the afternoon service. <persRef
								ref="angier-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Angier</persRef> of Milton preached this afternoon from Hebrews
							13.18. “Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
							things willing to live honestly.” The middle part of this verse—for we
							trust we have a good conscience,—is the text of the sample Sermon in
								<persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef> Tristram Shandy— A
							Sermon so strangely introduced to the world—so excellent in itself, and
							so generally read as the pioneer of 45 sermons of <persRef
								ref="parsonyorick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Yorick</persRef>,
							among the best in the English language, makes it dangerous for any
							preacher of later days to discourse upon it.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Angier committed no plagiarism upon Yorick— It did not
							appear from his discourse that he had read the Sermon of Sterne, and I
							scarcely know that I had a right to be reminded of it, as I was.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier read again the notification of the
							parish meeting to be held immediately after the service, and it was held
							accordingly— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brigham</persRef> read the report which was unanimous for the
							adoption of the book, for the Sunday singing of the Society— After some

							concluded to postpone her departure for one day more, and after entering
							the record of yesterday upon the diary before breakfast, the remnant of

							majority of 50— for the democratic ticket—but a few votes were wanting
							to accomplish the election of a representative of the town in the State
							Legislature. The candidates were <persRef ref="richards-lysander"

								>William B. Duggan</persRef> the vote 280 to 304—but about 35

							Weymouth; with the aid of 30 or 40 abolition votes— I called at the
							Quincy Patriot Office, and had an error of the press corrected, in the
							Canzonet to <persRef ref="bruce-sally">Sally</persRef>, which I
							overlooked yesterday— I have an enormous accumulation of pamphlets among
							my papers, upon an infinite variety of subjects, great numbers of which
							are well worthy of being preserved; but they are in such confusion, that
							in a series of years I have never had time to select and those which I
							propose to have bound in volumes.— In the last fortnight I have snatched
							every moment I could spare to commence the collection, and took to
								<persRef ref="gill-caleb">Caleb Gill</persRef> the Stationer and
							book-binder the first volume, of the assemblage, to which I give the

							hundred volumes, so scattered and dispersed, that whenever I want any
							one pamphlet, it is worth a weeks search to find it; and yet they swarm
							upon me, so that I can never keep them out of sight— The first volume of
							the Omnibus, consists of the pamphlet documents relating to the Amistad
							Captives, and to the cases of the Encomium, Comet and Enterprize— The
							second and third to Texas and Mexico, and the fourth to Defaulters.
							These I want to take with me to Washington— I have seven volumes more in

							Uranographia— He now brought me a recommendatory Letter from <persRef

							a picture of <persRef ref="sargent-henry">Henry Sargeant’s</persRef>;
							but she came this morning and said he wished us to wait for a Sunny day.

							for 1839. and 1840. and a Report of the Engineer upon the several
							definite locations for the Hartford and Springfield Rail-road, with the
							Acts of incorporation in Connecticut and Massachusetts— He said he had
							sent a copy of his own statement to <persRef ref="seward-william"
								>Governor Seward</persRef> of New-York, and had received from him an

							subject is too vast for my faculties, and too oppressive for my

							capacity, and seventy-five winters upon my head, all admonish me to
							abstain from an undertaking which must break me down body and mind,

							return to my projected Article upon the War between Great-Britain and

						<p>A sound sleep of 7 hours from half past ten last Night till half past
							five this morning afforded me some relief from the depression of
							Spirits, and nervous agitation of the two preceeding almost sleepless
							Nights— But the pustulous eruptions upon my head, face and neck
							continue, increase and put my patient endurance to the trial of <persRef
								ref="job">Job</persRef>— <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> paid me a
							morning visit, and while he was here <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> came, and anointed
							my head afresh with the two ointments and promised to return to-morrow
							morning and perform again the same operation— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frothingham spoke to me of <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef> Christian Psalter,
							and said that the Committee of his church, consisting of himself,
								<persRef ref="sprague-charles">Charles Sprague</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="bancroft-george">George Bancroft</persRef> after
							examining the Book had unanimously agreed to recommend the adoption of
							it, as the hymn-book of the first congregational church, from and after
							the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January next. I told him that
							the parish at Quincy had unanimously voted to adopt it as their
							hymn-book; without fixing the time as there was not a supply of the
							books yet bound, and that I had been happy to furnish M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt with a small portion of his
							Selection— <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Miss Harriet Welsh</persRef>
							came, and I went with her and saw <persRef ref="sargent-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Sargeant’s</persRef> picture of
							the Crucifixion— He said he painted not for money; but he must paint,
							and he had made a present of this picture, for an altar piece to a new
							Roman Catholic Church at Charlestown— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sargeant is a painter of very considerable merit, and this picture is
							well adapted to its destination— I visited several shops seeking for a
							cap which I may wear at home and in public, but could not suit myself.
							Also for a Bible to give to my Grandson <persRef ref="adams-charles7"
								>Charles Francis</persRef> which I did find— Towards evening I had a
							visit from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Bancroft who had a long
							conversation with me, concerning our revolutionary history, and
							particularly the agency of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							in the origin and management of it— He read to me the copy of my
							father’s Letter to <persRef ref="adams-samuel">Samuel Adams</persRef>,
							introducing me to him when I returned from France to this Country in
							1785 when my father was going as Minister to England— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft repeated his request for a
							confidential inspection of my father’s papers, spoke very respectfully
							of his correspondence with Samuel Adams which he had seen, and professed
							a full determination to do entire justice to his character.— I called
							before dinner at <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Abbott Lawrence’s</persRef> house, but he was not at
							home— He sent me a note inviting me to come and take tea, and spend the
							Evening with him and his family which I did— I had a long talk with him
							upon politics, and he gave me his unvarnished opinion of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>— While I was out, <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks</persRef> came and spent an hour with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, but was gone before I

						<p>No relief from my affliction. <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> was here this
							morning, and anoints me again; but patience and resignation are my only
							remedies. Heard <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> this morning
							from Matthew 14.19.— [“]and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake;
							and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the
							multitude”— There is always a refined ingenuity in the application of
							the Doctors Texts to his discourses.— Of this stupendous miracle, I was
							curious to know what he would make— He spoke of it first as of a miracle
							intended to operate as evidence upon the minds of those by whom it was
							witnessed; but he said that in this as in other miracles of Jesus there
							was something typical of the great objects of the mission of Christ upon
							earth—he came to feed mankind with the bread of life; and one of his
							purposes in the performance of this miracle was to shew that there was
							in beneficence a self multiplying power.— That in the maxims of the
							world a benevolent man seeks riches to enable him to distribute
							bountifully, but it was the property of this expansive benevolence to
							reverse that order of things, and to distribute freely thereby to become
							rich— To this principle he applied several other passages of the
							Scriptures, and from it he deduced a persuasive exhortation to
							liberality—beneficence, brotherly kindness, charity— The afternoon text
							was from Revelation 2.17.— [“]To him that overcometh will I give to eat
							of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a
							new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.” This
							is a highly mystical text, the full meaning of which is subject to a
							great variety of conjectures.— About sixteen years ago I heard the late
								<persRef ref="bedell-gregory">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bedell</persRef> of Philadelphia, preach at Washington a sermon upon
							this text which stamp’d it indelibly upon my memory. There was in that
							Sermon a classical history of the practice of exchanging white stones
							with a reciprocal inscription of names upon them, as talismanic tokens
							of friendship and mutual hospitality which greatly excited my curiosity,
							but to which D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham did not
							specially allude— <persRef ref="curtis-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas B. Curtis</persRef> was here with a Letter from
								<persRef ref="paulding-james">James K Paulding</persRef> late
							Secretary of the Navy, remonstrating against a project which he says
							there is of employing <persRef ref="pettrich-ferdinand"
								>Pedrich</persRef> to carve bas relief’s for the statue of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> still to be set up on a
							pedestal in the Rotundo of the Capitol at Washington. He calls upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis and the conoscenti here to
							interpose and save the Statue from profanation M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Curtis asked my advice, and it was to ask <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> to write to <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef> and represent that
							bas-reliefs by Peddrich to a Statue by <persRef ref="greenough-horatio"
								>Greenough</persRef>, would be a sculptural incongruity; and said I
							would cheerfully say the same thing to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tyler on my return to Washington— Paulding is snarlingly bitter upon
							Peddrich and <persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef>— <persRef

						<p>After an uneasy and suffering Night my complaint was more harassing and
							irritated this morning than it had been yet, and with this thorn in the
							flesh, I am tortured with the task of finishing a Lecture to be
							delivered this day week before the Massachusetts historical Society upon
							China— <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef> was here and dressed the wounds upon which I had
							afterwards some partial relief— I must arrest and close my lecture,
							before I have explored even the threshold of my subject. It would
							require at least three Lectures at least as that which I am now about to
							cut short to fill up the outline that I have drawn. And I have not now
							time, even to prepare a second. <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Miss
								Harriet Welsh</persRef> was here, and afterwards <persRef
								ref="paine-robert3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Treat
								Paine</persRef> who told me that he had no encouragement to expect
							the appointment which he has been so solicitous to obtain of Secretary
							of Legation, at some one of the European Courts, but that he has
							determined to go to Europe, with the aid only of his own resources, and
							to visit London, Paris, Vienna and Saint Petersburg, in the pursuit of
							his astronomical studies— He offered his services to me as a
							correspondent or otherwise; for which I thanked him, without positively
							knowing whether I should need them, or could with propriety employ them—
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went to Quincy and
							returned to dine. My time was hurried away in reading the Correspondence
							relating to China, communicated to Parliament by the British Ministry in
							1840. and a few pages of a small Volume called Six Months with the
							Chinese expedition, or leaves from a Soldier’s Note Book, by <persRef
								ref="jocelyn-robert">Lord Jocelyn</persRef>, late Military Secretary
							to the China Mission— The time consumed in reading is lost for labour— I
							skimmed the surface also of the Messages to H.R.U.S. of 25. February
							1840. and of 25. January 1841. concerning our relations political and
							commercial relations with China. Towards Sunset I walked out and stop’d
							at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s</persRef>; met there <persRef ref="prescott-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William H. Prescott</persRef>,
							the historian of <persRef ref="ferdinandofaragon">Ferdinand</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="isabella-i">Isabella</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="prescott-susan">his wife</persRef>— I had much conversation
							with him upon historical topics, and enquired if the rumour in
							circulation was well founded that he was preparing for publication a
							history of Mexico— A history he said of the Conquest of Mexico; and that
							he had received from the Academy of History of Mexico a great mass of
							original documents not known to exist when <persRef
								ref="robertson-william3">Doctor Robertson</persRef> wrote, and
							highly valuable to elucidate many events and characters of that time— We
							talked much of Isabella and <persRef ref="ximenes-francisco"
								>Ximenes</persRef>, and <persRef ref="catherineofaragon">Catherine
								of Arragon</persRef>, and <persRef ref="mary-i">bloody

							Boleyn</persRef>, and <persRef ref="elizabeth-i">Queen
								Elizabeth</persRef> and <persRef ref="cordova-gonzalo">Gonzalvo de
								Cordova</persRef> and others— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Prescott soon departed— I remained
							took tea and spent the Evening with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham, with whom I had long conversation upon undry biblical
							topics— Charles came in, and spent the latter part of the Evening with
							us.</p>

						<p>I brought this morning to an aukward and abrupt conclusion the Article
							upon China which, I began about this time last year, and which I have
							never yet found time to finish. This article, I propose to deliver next
							Monday before the Massachusetts historical Society, if the State of my
							health should be such as will enable me to speak in public at-all. The
							importunities besetting me for the delivery of these Lectures are
							distressing. It is not in my nature to reject them rudely: to comply
							with them becomes from week to week more precarious of possible
							accomplishment. From this uncertainty result uncertain and
							procrastinated answers and finally no answers at-all— I had last
							Wednesday promised to deliver a Lecture at Lynn, next Thursday evening,
							if my health should permit— Until this day that has been uncertain, but
							this afternoon I wrote to <persRef ref="oliver-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen Oliver</persRef>, informing
							him that it will not be possible.— Whether I shall be more able to speak
							next Monday begins to be problematical. <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> dressed my
							head again this morning, and spoke encouragingly though not undoubtingly
							of the healing aspect of the disease. He hopes I may be able to proceed
							the week after next for Washington. In the mean time, I am much disabled
							for writing, and the shaking of my hand makes it irksome in the extreme—
								<persRef ref="curtis-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								B. Curtis</persRef> was here this morning; with a Letter from
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Levi Lincoln</persRef>, now Collector
							of the Customs at this port, to the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President
								of the United States</persRef>, in the most respectful terms
							remonstrating against the employment of foreigners, upon bas-reliefs to
							the pedestal of <persRef ref="greenough-horatio">Greenough’s</persRef>
							Statue of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> in the
							Rotundo of the Capitol. Governor Lincoln, wished that I should see the
							Letter before it was despatched, and I approved of it altogether. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis read to me also a Letter from the
							Committee on the fine arts, of the Boston Athenaeum to the <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> on the same
							subject— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis invited me to a party at
							his house to-morrow evening at half past 8. where <persRef
								ref="sloman-jane">Miss Sloman</persRef> is to perform on the Piano.
							While he was here <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy</persRef> of Harvard University came in, to join in the
							remonstrances against the employment of <persRef
								ref="pettrich-ferdinand">Peddrich</persRef> for tawdry appendages to
							Greenough’s Statue. <persRef ref="clark-henry2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Henry Clark</persRef> was here about a claim against the
							Government of Spain, under a Treaty of 1836. of indemnity for some
							spoliation in the Island of Porto-Rico.— The claim was at first of
								<persRef ref="clark-william5">William Clark</persRef> an intimate
							acquaintance of my early years, and of whom this Gentleman is the
							youngest brother. He tells me that his brother William was finally
							settled and died in the Island of Porto Rico— He says that <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> informed him they were in negotiation with Spain
							to obtain payment of the interest and principal of this claim by orders
							upon the revenues from the Island of Cuba. I spent the first part of
							this Evening with my old friend <persRef ref="hall-joseph">Joseph

								Sister</persRef>, and the latter part at <persRef
								ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> George

						<p>I slept this morning two hours later than my usual time, but with little
							apparent improvement of my condition. My discouragements in regard to
							health are oppressive. Besides the eruptions on my head and neck I have
							now a pimple at the joint between the fore and middle finger of my right
							hand the very spot on which I am obliged to rest the handle of my pen in
							writing.— The appearance of this page may be the best record of the pain
							and difficulty with which I write.— This morning there was for three
							hours a flight of snow. <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> was here with a
							dressing, and with such cheering as he could give and <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Miss Welsh</persRef> brought me a white cotton
							cap which is yet to be fitted to my head— After the snow was over I
							sallied forth to the Barbers, at the Tremont house, and on my way met
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="davis-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac P.
								Davis</persRef> who were coming to pay me a morning visit. After
							being shaved I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis to
								<persRef ref="u">Daggett’s</persRef> shop, and saw several pictures,
							among which two by <persRef ref="copley-john">Copley</persRef>, perhaps
								<persRef ref="boylston-nicholas">Nicholas Boylston</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="boylston-sarah">his wife</persRef>. Also a <persRef
								ref="mary">Madonna</persRef> and child, copied from <persRef
								ref="murillo-bartolome">Murillo</persRef>, and of which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis said he had made a present to
								<persRef ref="webster-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— The rest of the day I lounged away at home,
							reading <persRef ref="jocelyn-robert">Lord Jocelyn’s</persRef> leaves
							from a Soldier’s notebook, containing a very light and unsatisfactory
							account of the occupation of the Island of Chusan by the British
							expedition in 1840.—and of the partial negotiation for a suspension of
							hostilities between <persRef ref="elliot-charles">Captain
								Elliot</persRef> the Chief Superintendent and the <persRef
								ref="qishan">Chinese imperial Commissioner Kea-shen</persRef> on the
								30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August of that year—at the
							mouth of the Peiho river— This writer calls Chusan the most beautiful
							Island of the celestial Empire— I read also further in the two Messages
							from the President concerning our relations with China, and a few pages
							of another small duodecimo called China, and its resources and
							peculiarities, physical, political, social, and commercial, with a view
							of the opium question, and a notice of Assam—by <persRef
								ref="mudie-robert">Robert Mudie</persRef>, I suppose a Scotchman;
							published at London, April 1840— This man supposes that the War, will
							break up forever the British trade with China in tea, and proposes to
							transfer it together with the cultivation of the tea-plant itself to the
							kingdom of Assam, adjoining upon China, and now in possession of the
							British.— Early this Evening <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef> went out and delivered an introductory Lecture before
							the Lyceum at Brookline— While he was gone I wrote a short Letter to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and had
							visits; first from <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Parkman</persRef>, notwithstanding his

								Degrand</persRef>, and finally from <persRef ref="brooks-edward"
								>Edward Brooks</persRef>— Degrand is a walking library of
							information upon the subject of Steamboats and Railways— Between 9 and
							10. my son came home from his lecturing expedition to Brookline, and
							went to the musical party at <persRef ref="curtis-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thomas B. Curtis’s</persRef>, where
								<persRef ref="sloman-jane">Miss Sloman</persRef> was to perform on

							entitled the Chinese, a general description of the Empire of China and

							of the British trade in China, after the expiration of the exclusive

							meeting of the Massachusetts historical Society which I attended— It was
							the monthly meeting, one week in advance of the usual day, the last
							Thursday of the month— Next Thursday being the annual Thanksgiving day.—
							The meeting was unusually numerous, about 25 members being present—
							Among them was <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Francis C. Gray</persRef> just returned from a 6 months

								<persRef ref="tyler-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>— Some curiosity

						<p><persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> came this
							morning in from Medford, where her mother <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams</persRef> is now residing
							with her Sister, <persRef ref="harrod-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Stebbins</persRef>. She has within these few days given
							up her house in Quincy, and intends to reside henceforth at Medford.
							Elizabeth brought me a Letter from her mother respecting the house and
							farm in Braintree, which was my brother’s and which he conveyed to me;
							but which I hold for the use of his widow during her life, and of his
							children as Joint-tenants after her decease. At her request I gave a
							power of Attorney to <persRef ref="angier-luther">Luther
								Angier</persRef> to manage the property for her benefit— He now
							finds this agency inconvenient, and she wishes to have it transferred to
								<persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon William Spear</persRef> of
							Quincy. I went out with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							this morning to Quincy, with the hope of seeing Deacon Spear, but was
							disappointed.— We were obliged to return to Boston before dinner, and my
							chamber was scarcely warmed before I was compelled to leave it, with my
							papers in disorder ineffable as they were.— My disease deprives me of
							the opportunity of spending two days at Quincy as I intended for the
							sole purpose of arranging my papers in some order;—but I must leave them
							at least for eight months more—who knows but for A<unclear>ye</unclear>?— As an
							indication of the state of the weather we saw near Neponset bridge a
							number of boys skating on a solid salt pond— We returned to Boston
							bitterly pinched with cold— <persRef ref="foster-james">Deacon
								Foster</persRef> called here this afternoon and told me that
								<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> was confined
							to the house with a severe catarrhal cough— I spent the Evening after
							tea, with <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Abbott Lawrence</persRef>. Met there <persRef ref="gerry-elbridge2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elbridge Gerry</persRef>.
								<persRef ref="lawrence-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> scarcely able to speak, for a hoarse cold.
							Between 9 and 10— I came home. while I was out <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks</persRef> had been here— Also <persRef ref="degrand-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="phelps-abner">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phelps</persRef>

							and <persRef ref="vaill-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Vaill</persRef>, agent for the Trustees of Amherst College, who came
							to solicit a contribution for that Institution.— I received last week a
							splendidly bound quarto bible presented to me, with an address in
							manuscript, fronting the title page, signed by <persRef ref="cinque"
								>Cinque</persRef>, <persRef ref="kinna">Kinna</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kale">Kale</persRef> for the 35 Mendian Africans of the
							Amistad. <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lewis Tappan</persRef> has been extremely desirous of having this
							done by a public exhibition and ceremony, which I have repeatedly and
							inflexibly declined, from a clear conviction of its impropriety, and an
							invincible repugnance to exhibiting myself as a public raree show—but as
							in common civility, an answer was due to the present and the address.— I
							wrote one this day to the address, and one enclosing it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan. There was last night, a Northern
							light of surpassing Splendor. This morning was clear, but the clouds
							were gathering all day and a copious rain came on at night.</p>

						<p>Rain all night and part of this day— The remainder dull gloomy and
							cheerless— <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef> was here; but the progress of my convalescence is
							slow and uncertain— <persRef ref="vaill-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Joseph Vaill</persRef> was here as a solicitor of
							contributions for Amherst College; an institution which cannot support
							itself, runs constantly in debt and from time to time sends round
							mendicant agents to levy contributions—upon the charitable— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaill is a Clergyman and has left his
							congregation to pursue this life of itinerant beggary. His argument of
							appeal to the benevolent is that Amherst College has been established
							about twenty years, and has in that time educated upwards of 800
							students, more than half of whom have been and are, ministers of the
							gospel—and that the Legislature of the Commonwealth have been inflexibly
							deaf to all their supplications, though often liberal to other
							institutions, and especially to the University at Cambridge. I
							subscribed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaill’s book for a small
							contribution— I walked out before dinner, and called at the Office of
								<persRef ref="loring-ellis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis
								Gray Loring</persRef>, with whom I had about an hour’s conversation—
							He is under no small concern, from apprehension upon two points at the
							approaching Session of Congress, one the rule, excluding the reception
							of all petitions, resolutions and papers relating to Slavery— And the
							other upon a revived project of annexing Texas to the United States—a
							project, of which formal notice has been given in newspapers devoted to
							the interests and aspirations of <persRef ref="tyler-john">President
								Tyler</persRef>. I look forward to both these designs with alarm and
							anguish—not for the power of the South which can effect nothing by
							itself; but from experience of the treachery of the Northern
							representation both to Northern interests and principles. I spoke also
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring of the Letter purporting to be
							from <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="adams-samuel">Samuel Adams</persRef> of which he sent
							me a copy, and the genuineness of which is very problematical. I asked
							him if access could be obtained to Samuel Adams’s papers— His Grandson
								<persRef ref="wells-samuel">Samuel Adams Welles</persRef> had issued
							a prospectus of a Memoir of his life, and writings in six Octavo
							volumes, but could not prevail upon any book printing establishment to
							undertake it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring said he would make
							enquiries whether among M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Adams’s papers
							any trace can be found of a letter from him to Jefferson, to which this
							purports to be an answer.— From dinner time for the remainder of the day
							and Evening I was confined to the house; but could make no progress in
							writing—the fingers of my right hand being crippled— I got through the
							reading of the Parliamentary papers relating to China, a ponderous folio
							of nearly 500 pages—and glancing again over the Message from <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef> to H.R.U.S. of
							25. February 1840. found in it sundry documents once, twice and even
							thrice repeated— They all confirm me in the view taken in my lecture of
							the issue between Great Britain and China in their present War, which is
							so adverse to the prevailing prejudices of the time and place, that I
							expect to bring down a storm upon my head worse than that with which I
							am already afflicted—</p>

						<p>I awoke and rose this morning with a head ache, and sore throat; doubting
							if it would be possible for me to deliver my lecture on Monday, and
							hating to think of it— My head ache afterwards passed away—the
							sore-throat was less troublesome, and <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob"
								>Doctor Bigelow</persRef>, who visited me after the morning service
							dismissed one of the bandages on my head— Heard <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> from Isaiah 5.20. “Wo unto them that call evil
							good and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness:
							that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. 21. Wo unto them that
							are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight.” This
							perversion of principle the Doctor remarked was applicable to three
							different classes of men— 1. To those who have been educated under
							vicious or imperfect systems of morals—false religions, or inveterate
							national usages and prejudices. 2. To wicked and perverse individuals
							and 3. To speculative visionary enthusiasts who promulgate their own
							fancies for new discoveries in religion and morality. Of this class
							there is at this time a school very busy and mischievous in this region.
							German mystification, French Atheism, and English Pyrrhonism are all
							combined in producing this half religious half infidel vagary, which has
							penetrated deeply into the theological school at Cambridge, and even
							into that of Andover. It is called transcendentalism, and the main
							object of it is to undermine the Christian religion by discrediting the
							scriptures both of the old and new Testament. This new sect has taken
							the place of a school of avowed atheism, broken up a few years since by
							the conviction of its high priest, <persRef ref="kneeland-abner">Abner
								Kneeland</persRef> upon an indictment for blasphemy.— The present
							heresies are of a more dangerous character because the propagators of
							them are ministers of the gospel of good reputation and blameless
							lives.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham remarked that such
							had been the founders of the greatest and most pernicious errors which
							have afflicted mankind; as an instance of which he mentioned <persRef
								ref="peterthehermit">Peter the hermit</persRef> the first preacher
							of the Crusades. After the morning service, and before dinner we had a
							visit from <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>. After
							dinner at the first Church, <persRef ref="young-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander Young</persRef>, Minister of
							the new South Church preached from Luke 8.25. “And he said unto them,
							where is your faith?”— Without further allusion to the occasion upon
							which these words were spoken by Jesus, the argument of the discourse
							was to shew that there was great reason for us all to address this
							enquiry to ourselves; and he complained of a great decay of faith in our
							country at this time—glancing at the same heresies against which D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham had remonstrated this morning—
							I spent the latter part of this Evening, with <persRef

						<p>On Saturday Morning between 3 and 4. O’Clock I was roused from sleep, by
							the ringing of bells which continued nearly an hour, and was renewed at
							5. It proved to be a fire at Charlestown by which five houses were
							destroyed. This morning <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon
								Spear</persRef> was here from Quincy. I have totally neglected my
							property there this Season, and not once visited either the Mount
							Wollaston, or the Penn’s valley farm— I told him that <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams</persRef> wished to transfer to him the power which I have
							given to <persRef ref="angier-luther">Luther Angier</persRef> for the
							management of the house and land in Braintree, the rents and profits of
							which I have given to her for her life, intending the remainder for her
							surviving children as joint tenants— That I have sent to ask the return
							of Luther Angier’s power, and should then make out one to him— I spoke
							also about the sale of the Quincy Woodlot which <persRef
								ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemuel
								Humphrey</persRef> surveyed for us last year; and of which there are
							so many proprietors that we can scarcely ascertain who they are.— I must
							leave this to him, and <persRef key="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>—
							He told me that they had received a supply of <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef>
							Christian Psalter, at Quincy, and began the use of it as a hymn-book at
							meeting yesterday— <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Parkman</persRef> called this morning, and found
							me reading to myself my lecture upon the British and Chinese War. At his
							request I read it through to him. It took me upwards of an hour and a
							half, and for fear of becoming insufferably tedious to the auditory I
							struck out as much as abridged about a quarter of an hour of the
							delivery— <persRef ref="felt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Felt</persRef> who is one of the lecture committee of the historical
							Society came before dinner and proposed to me to go to the Masonic
							temple this evening in a carriage, which I declined— It was then
							raining, but I thought it would hold up before night— The rain instead
							of subsiding increased after dinner. <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis C. Gray</persRef>, another
							member of the lecture Committee came, and urged me to go with him, in a
							Carriage with which he would come for me at ten minutes before 7. to
							which I consented. He came accordingly and I went with him and my Son;
							the rain coming down in floods. The Masonic hall was crowded to
							overflowing. I delivered the lecture, curtailed as it had been, in one
							hour and twenty-minutes— After I finished, <persRef ref="perkins-thomas"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> T. H Perkins</persRef>
							<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence</persRef>, <persRef ref="parkman-francis">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Parkman</persRef>, and several
							others came and greeted me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence said
							that <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> was so much indisposed with her cold that she had
							not been able to come out, and wished to borrow it for the opportunity
							of reading it, and accordingly I put the manuscript into his hands M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> F C. Gray returned with us to my Son’s
							house, the rain still falling copiously, and there left us— From my
							first great anxiety respecting this lecture, I am now relieved— It was
							heard without manifestation of disapprobation; but it runs directly
							contrary to the strong current of popular opinion in this Country and
							will be handled without mercy by political antagonists.</p>

								Parkman</persRef> called here early this morning, and proposed to me
							to visit an English artist by the name of <persRef ref="u"
								>Howorth</persRef> who practices the art of transferring old
							pictures from one Canvass to another— He came again an hour after and I
							went with him— Howorth himself is a portrait painter—we saw several old
							pieces of canvas from which pictures had been transferred, but only one,
							on the new canvas, an old fragment of the Venetian school, the
							appearance of which was in no wise commendatory of the art. There was a
							full length portrait of <persRef ref="sargent-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sargent</persRef>, the mother of
								<persRef ref="sargent-daniel">Daniel</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="sargent-henry">Henry Sargent</persRef> and their
							brothers—painted by <persRef ref="copley-john">Copley</persRef> in 1763.
							when he was but 19 and the Lady only 17 years old— One of the best of
							Copley’s pictures painted before he went to England. Dressed in a blue
							satin robe much embroidered, with arms bare to the elbow, but shadowed
							by deep lace ruffles gathered round the arms, and coming down almost to
							the hands.— I knew this Lady when she was from 45 to 50 years of age,
							and she had several grown up sons.— The canvas had taken some damage,
							and has been repaired and new varnished by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Howorth— The colours are as fresh as if painted yesterday. I
							called next with D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Parkman at the house of
								<persRef ref="forbes-ralph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ralph
								Bennet Forbes</persRef>, but he was not at home.— I visited <persRef
								ref="ticknor-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Ticknor</persRef> and had half an hour’s conversation with him on
							indifferent topics, but found it his opinion that the education of women

						<p>Thanksgiving day.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="ripley-james2">Major Ripley</persRef> came at 9 this

								>Chase</persRef> and <persRef ref="tyler-daniel">Tyler</persRef>, to
							the <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, on the
							condition of the armoury at Springfield which he had yesterday left with
							me— It discloses some gross abuses in the management of that
							establishment for the discovery of which the major seems to apprehend
							that he will receive small thanks, and that there is a weight of
							influence operating against him and against all reform of these
							abuses—an influence—not confined to one party, and from which he did not
							consider either <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef>, or
								<persRef ref="calhoun-william">W. B. Calhoun</persRef>, the
							Representative in Congress from Springfield as exempt— He spoke of an
							extraordinary and altogether unnecessary number of sinecure appointments
							of Military Store keepers, among whom is <persRef ref="cooper-thomas2"
								>Cooper</persRef> the superannuated Stage player, ill qualified as
							he may be for the performance of duties involving a public trust. Major
							Ripley doubts the legal authority of the Secretary of War to make these
							appointments, and gave me a paper containing references to the acts of
							Congress on the subject— The report concerning the Springfield Armoury
							will come before Congress— <persRef ref="espy-james">Professor

								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> after an admirable occasional prayer, preached
							from Job. 22.17. [“]Which said unto God—what can the Almighty do for

							an exhortation to universal gratitude, for the enjoyment of blessings
							bestowed alike upon all— Professor Espy’s visits, were to urge me to
							bring forward in Congress his discoveries in the Science of Meteorology,
							and his philosophy of Storms. He has been lecturing on this subject with
							various success in England, France, and here at Boston, where he fares
							better than any where else.— I dined and spent the Evening at <persRef

						<p>At 10 this morning, <persRef ref="forbes-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forbes came</persRef> with a
							Carriage, and took me out to visit <persRef ref="cushing-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. P.
							Cushing</persRef>, at Watertown— This Gentleman went out on commercial adventure
							to China some thirty years since or more. After a residence of 22 years
							there he returned about ten years ago with a burdensome load of wealth,
							which he has dispensed according to the influences of his own fancies,
							and the stream of which has not yet failed— After residing a year or two
							in Boston, he married a <persRef ref="cushing-mary">daughter</persRef> of the <persRef ref="gardiner-john2">late Rev<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Doctor John Sylvester John Gardiner</persRef>; purchased this estate
							at Watertown and has expended upwards of 100000 dollars in building,
							demolishing, rebuilding improving and embelleshing the place.— He is now
							building upon it a dwelling house, at a cost, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Forbes says of more than 60,000 dollars.— In the mean time
							he lives in a small one story cottage— After a conversation with him of
							about an hour, I visited with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forbes, the
							piggery and the Green house, establishments adjoining to and somewhat
							contrasting with each other. He has some hundred of swine and pigs kept
							in convenient pens, and a magnificently filthy barn-yard, for the
							purpose of making manure. One of his swine was said to weigh 500 lb.
							many of them weigh upwards of 400— The green house of which he has 516
							feet is at this time drooping with a very scanty show of flowers, will
							be in full bloom in February.— The gardener told us that the green house
							had been stripped of its flowers for the Ball given on Wednesday night
							at Faneuil and Quincy Halls to the <persRef ref="francoisdorleans">Prince de Joinville</persRef>— We returned to
							Boston before dinner; and after it <persRef ref="kelley-hall">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall
							J. Kelly</persRef> came to bespeak my assistance to obtain for him a grant in
							reward for having contributed by an expedition to the Oregon
							Territory—and a residence there several years to secure the possession
							of it to the United States.— He has a Memorial setting forth his claim,
							before Congress— presented two years ago to the Senate, and upon which a
							favourable report was made to that body by <persRef ref="linn-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Linn</persRef>— A quarter before 7. <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham</persRef> came, and I went with him to the Masonic temple, and
							delivered before the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge, the
							lecture on the War between Great Britain and China. Immediately before,
							<persRef ref="smith-thomas10">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Smith</persRef> had called, and intreated
							me to deliver it again to morrow evening before the Boston Lyceum, at
							the Marlborough chapel— I told him that I had an engagement for
							to-morrow evening; but asked him to call to-morrow morning at 9. for a
							definitive answer— The temple this evening was not crowded; and scarcely
							filled; but the lecture was well received— Coming out, I met <persRef ref="ellis-william2">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Ellis</persRef> of Dedham. Spent the remainder of
							the evening at D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s.</p>

							to meeting, where <persRef ref="brazer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brazer</persRef> of Salem
							performed the service morning and afternoon instead of <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef>— His morning text was from 2.
							Corinthians 1.12 [“]For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our
							Conscience that in simplicity, and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
							wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the
							world and more abundantly to you ward.” The discourse was an impressive
							dissertation upon the blessing of a good conscience, and the pre-eminent
							virtue and simplicity of heart— The afternoon sermon, was from Hosea,
							10.12—[“]break up your fallow ground.” This is only part of the verse—
							The imagery of the prophet urges reformation from wicked agency— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brazer understood and argued it as rousing
							to energy from inaction.— The reasoning was therefore not closely
							adapted to the precept of the prophet but it was sufficiently congenial
							to the text, taken by itself, and like the morning discourse was a very
							excellent moral essay— There is no infirmity of which human nature is
							more susceptible than insincerity, and no vice more reprobated by Christ
							in his doctrines than hypocrisy— There are shades of depravity in this
							vice, and in the intercourse with the world, it is difficult to draw the
							line, between the courtesies which custom has introduced, and usage has
							rendered indispensable, and the strict regard to truth required for
							sincerity— These conventional forms of civility, such as subscribing
							yourself your correspondents’ humble servant are not chargeable to
							hypocrisy nor even to insincerity, but they are the forms of a
							hypocritical world, and their tendency is vicious— I conform to them
							reluctantly, and avoid them frequently— <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> after the French
							Revolution always did—and it would have been well for him if he had
							carried his aversion to insincerity further than the disuse of its
							formulary words.— The duty of breaking up the fallow ground, is directly
							applicable to the political principle of internal improvement— Can I not
							break up some of my own fallow ground— Have I ever duly considered that
							every public-trust is at once a chair and a school of moral philosophy?
							From the close of the afternoon service, we were engaged in the anxious
							occupation of packing up for our departure to-morrow morning, except two
							hours of the Evening which we spent at <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peter C. Brooks’s</persRef> <persRef ref="brooks-gorham">Gorham Brooks</persRef>, and <persRef ref="shepherd-ellen">his wife</persRef> were there, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brazer the preacher of the day— I sent the
							manuscript of my lecture upon China to <persRef ref="palfrey-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Palfrey</persRef>, with authority to use it at his pleasure—and I enclosed Gelon
							of Syracuse to <persRef ref="loring-ellis">Ellis Gray Loring</persRef>.</p>

						<p>Between 3 and 4. O’Clock this morning I was awaked by a peal of Bells
							rung for a fire, which lasted nearly an hour— About half past five, a
							fire blazed out from the chimney of the house we were about to leave,
							but it passed off in ten or fifteen minutes—about 3 in the morning it
							had begun to snow, and at dawn of day the ground was well powdered, and
							the snow seemed to hold up. At 7. <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> and myself repaired to the Cars
							at the depot of the Worcester Springfield and Hudson railway, expecting
							to reach Hudson between 6 and 7 this evening— With the rising of the Sun
							the snow recommenced, and fell thick and fast till about 2. P.M. when we
							reached Springfield, having already been arrested several times ten or
							fifteen minutes at a time by snow drifted across the road.— Here the
							Snow continuing unabated, my Son found that there was no prospect of
							reaching Hudson by the railway this Night—the necessary consequence of
							which would be the failure to reach New-York to-morrow— By the advice
							and care of my Son our baggage was withdrawn from the cars of the Hudson
							train; and after dining at Springfield we took the Stage for Hartford 28
							miles, which we travelled on the eastern side of Connecticut river till
							we reached and crossed the Bridge at East-Hartford.— We exchanged horses
							at a place called Warehouse point 16 miles from Springfield and 12 from
							Hartford.— There were two Stages each crammed with nine passengers
							within and one or two outside.— Among the passengers in the Cars from
							Boston was that singular and equivocal personage, miss, and now called
							<persRef ref="vespucci-america">Countess America Vespucci</persRef>, who came three years ago a sturdy beggar, to
							Congress for a grant of lands, because she claims to be descended from
							the <persRef ref="vespucci-amerigo">adventurer whose name covers the two Continents of the Western
								Hemisphere</persRef>, instead of that of <persRef ref="columbus-christopher">Columbus</persRef>— I did not recognize her. She
							travels without a male companion— As did <persRef ref="sedgwick-catharine">miss Sedgwick</persRef> the authoress,
							from whom we parted at Springfield; and with whom I had not the
							opportunity of so much conversation as I should have desired.— There was
							also a gentleman, a resident of Boston, named <persRef ref="u">Dorr</persRef>, who claimed kindred
							with me, as descended from the <persRef ref="fiske-moses">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Moses
								Fiske</persRef>, and his second wife, <persRef ref="quincy-anne">Anna</persRef> daughter of <persRef ref="shepherd-thomas2">Thomas Shepard</persRef>, and widow
							of <persRef ref="quincy-daniel">Daniel Quincy</persRef>—my great great grandmother.— We reached Hartford about
							half past 8. O’Clock and stop for the night at the City Hotel— Here we
							met <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>, who is here engineering upon the Northeastern

						<p>The sky cleared away after Sunset last Evening; the moon shining at the

							in glory while we were on the way, but the windows of the Car were so
							becrusted with frost, that we could scarcely discern him as he rose— We
							reached New-Haven at ten minutes before nine and immediately embarked in
							the Steamer New-York for that city— Our fellow traveller <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							is now on furlough— We landed at New-York at a quarter past 2 and I
							walked about the streets, the side-walks of which were much clogged with
