						<p>Visitors absorbed at least two thirds of this day— First came <persRef

							Oliver</persRef>, a Senator from the County of Essex in the Legislature
							of Massachusetts, who brought me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel2">Daniel C. Baker</persRef>, corresponding
							Secretary pro tem, of the Lynn Union Lyceum inviting me to deliver a
							Lecture before that institution in the early part of next fall. I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver that it was very doubtful,
							whether I should not be necessarily detained here the whole of the next
							Fall; and in that uncertainty could not contract any engagement to
							deliver a Lecture any where— He said he had expected this answer. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver spoke cautiously about the
							proceedings of the Massachusetts Legislature at their recent Session— He
							attributed all their movements to the Boston delegation, and seemed to
							be not altogether satisfied with them— He did not tell me what he came
							here for— Next was <persRef ref="harrison-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Harrison</persRef>; heretofore
							a Captain in the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> regiment of infantry,
							and who lost a leg in the last War with Great Britain. He was a
							candidate for the Office of Naval Officer at Boston, and wrote me a
							Letter requesting my influence in his favour— That office has however
							been given to <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P. Davis</persRef>, and
							now M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrison comes for the Office, taking
							it for granted that <persRef ref="mcneil-john">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> M’Neill</persRef> a New-Hampshire man will be removed—
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Sewall</persRef> to a bequest by a man from Wurtemberg named
								<persRef ref="u">Prescher</persRef> of a portion of an inheritance,
							with enquiries how it may be recovered— I read to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing the Letters that I had received
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Sewall on this subject, with a translated Statement of

							Department of State might give some aid for the recovery of this
							property, and I offered the papers to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cushing, to pursue that track but he declined to receive them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing said he proposed to go home next
							week for a week and then to return and remain here till the extra

							Administration. <persRef ref="walley-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The condition of the <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>President’s</persRef> health is alarming. He was seized last
							Saturday with a severe chill; and the next day with what his physicians
							called a bilious pleurisy; since that time he has been very ill, with
							symptoms varying from day to day and almost from hour to hour. The
							porter at the door answers all enquirers that he is better; while
								<persRef ref="chambers-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chambers</persRef> and <persRef ref="todd-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef> report that there is no
							change, and the physicians agree to answer all alike. Yesterday during
							the day time the answer was much better—last evening not so well—this
							morning, quite out of danger— I rode to the Capitol to enquire for the
							last sheets of the House Journal of the late Session of Congress, and
							for the documents relating to the Slave-trade, and <persRef
								ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist’s</persRef> correspondence, neither
							of which is yet from the press. Returning home, I stop’d at <persRef
								ref="taylor-frank">Taylor’s</persRef> Book-store and settled an old
							Bill—then at <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cushing’s</persRef> lodgings, but he was abroad—then at <persRef
								ref="semmes-edward">Semmes’s</persRef> wine-store but found a
							dry-goods store in its place— Then at the National Intelligencer Office,
							where I found <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Seaton</persRef> very much occupied— He had a note from
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Todd written at 9 this morning,
							informing him with extreme pleasure that the President was decidedly
							better; and a second note, between 12 and 1. that the 4. physicians,
							being then in consultation confirmed the previous report the remainder
							of the day frequent reports announced much improvement and rapid
							recovery till Evening, when unfavourable symptoms again recurred.
								<persRef ref="thornton-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Thornton</persRef>, with <persRef ref="talbot-adelaide">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Talbot</persRef>
							<persRef ref="talbot-theodore">her son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="talbot-mary">daughter</persRef> spent the Evening here. My time
							slips away from under me week after week, while I am doing nothing. I
							was all this day absorbed in struggling to answer a Letter from Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							<persRef ref="jocelyn-simeon">Jocelyn</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">Leavitt</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef>, about the Amistad
							Africans, whose case involves deeply perplexing questions yet to be
							discussed and adjusted—and I had this day a Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt <hi rend="strikethrough">a
								Letter</hi>, mentioning that the printer was calling for my revised
							argument before the Supreme Court upon which I have not yet commenced—
							Upwards of two hours of my time was consumed in reading documents in the
							Parliamentary papers relating to the Slave trade; accumulating proofs of
							the duplicity of Spain and Portugal in their Treaties with Great-Britain
							and in their Edicts against the Slave-trade— With that same duplicity
							the Government of the United States stands heavily charged, and with
							such defences as <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth’s</persRef>
							despatches and Trist’s Dissertations compared with the last paragraph of
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren’s</persRef> last annual
							Message to Congress, an American must hide his head for shame— The
							consummation of the whole system of policy is disclosed in N. P. Trist’s
							Letter to the British Commissioners of 2. July and 29. August 1839.
							where the consummate impudence of <persRef ref="charteris-francis"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Chartres</persRef>, is
							combined with an equally shameless hypocrisy.</p>

							has been much more ably managed by Seward, than by the Virginians, but
							there have been symptoms of the basest defection to the cause of Freedom
							among the New-York whigs, and a disposition to sacrifice Seward to the
							South which excite fearful misgivings of the result. I called this
							morning at the Treasury Department and there deposited 500 dollars in
							gold and silver for which I took 5. Treasury Notes of 100 dollars each
							of this date, payable in one year and bearing interest at 6 per Cent— I

								<persRef ref="harrison-william">President</persRef> was better, and
							that was given out all the morning— I rode to the Capitol, spent an hour
							in the Library and walked home— Met <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi

						<p>At 30 minutes past midnight this morning of Palm-Sunday the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1841. died <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">William Henry Harrison</persRef>, precisely
							one calendar month as President of the United States, after his
							inauguration— The first impression of this event, here where it occurred
							is of the frailty of all human enjoyments, and the awful vicissitudes
							woven into the lot of mortal man— He had reached but one short month
							since the pinnacle of honour and power in his own country— He lies a
							lifeless corpse in the Palace provided by his Country for his abode. He
							was amiable and benevolent. Sympathy for his sufferings and his fate, is
							the prevailing sentiment of his fellow-citizens— The bereavement and
							distress of his family, is felt intensely, albeit they are strangers
							here, and known to scarcely any one— <persRef ref="harrison-anna">His
								wife</persRef> had not yet even left his residence at North-bend,
							Ohio, to join him here. An express was sent for her two or three days
							since, but the tidings of death must meet her before she can reach this
							city. The influence of this event upon the condition and history of the
							Country, can scarcely be foreseen— It make the Vice-President of the
							United States, <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> of
							Virginia, acting President of the Union, for four years, less one Month—
							Tyler is a political sectarian of the Slave-driving, Virginian
							Jeffersonian school— Principled against all improvement— With all the
							interests and passions, and vices of Slavery rooted in his moral and
							political constitution—with talents not above mediocrity, and a spirit
							incapable of expansion to the dimensions of the station upon which he
							has been cast by the hand of Providence unseen through the apparent
							agency of chance— To that benign and healing hand of Providence I trust
							in humble hope of the good, which it always brings forth out of evil— In
							upwards of half a century, this is the first instance of a
							Vice-President’s being called to act as President of the United-States,
							and brings to the test that provision of the Constitution which places
							in the Executive Chair a man never thought of for it by any body.— This
							day was in every sense gloomy— Rain the whole day. I attended public
							worship first at the Presbyterian Church where there were less than 30
							persons, and a stranger gave out two hymns, and made a short prayer.
								<persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef> was to have reached home last Evening but did not—
							The Cars from Philadelphia having failed to arrive at Baltimore in time
							for the passengers to come on in those from Baltimore to this place last
							Evening. The Stranger said that he himself came from Philadelphia the
							day before yesterday, and from Baltimore last evening— That he was too
							unwell to preach this morning but that he would preach at half past 3
							this afternoon. The Congregation was then dismissed and I went to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church where <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							was reading the morning prayer for the Sunday before Easter. He preached
							from Psalm 39.5—“Veryly, every man at his best state is altogether
							vanity.” He said he had witnessed the death of the chief magistrate,
							after prayers at his bed-side at 9 last Evening.— <persRef

							Sundry Corporations, and Associations— And two communications from the
							Legislature of Maryland now in Session at Annapolis, to the Secretary of
							State, announcing their Resolution to attend the funeral in a body.
							These occurred in the course of this day). I had a morning visit from
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>,
							originally from Scituate and a distant relative of the heretofore
								<persRef ref="cushing-william;cushing-nathan">judges William and

							District and State of Maine, and now a Citizen of Boston; concerned in
							some project of an establishment at Neponset Dorchester, connected with
							the projected railway, between Boston and Quincy— He told me that he was
							here only for a day or two, but did not tell me for what he came. The
							corpse of the late President Harrison was laid out in a plain coffin
							covered with black velvet, on a table in the middle of the entrance Hall
							at the President’s house— At 2 O’Clock P.M. I went with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, and took a last look at the face of the Patriot
							Warrior, taken away thus providentially from the evil to come. I then
							parted from the Ladies and called on <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Caleb Cushing</persRef> whom I found
							at his lodgings, dining in solitude. He has postponed his departure to
							visit his home till next week.— Conversing with him on various political
							topics, I found him doubting what will now be the principles of the
							administration substituted for that of General Harrison—and very
							reserved in the expression of his own opinions— Walk home— Late dinner—
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> unwell. Evening
							visit from <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef>, who is in some perplexity with regard to the

							not improper, but that some variation of expression might be proper— He

						<p>The arrangements for the funeral of the late President of the United
							States, <persRef ref="harrison-william">William Henry
							Harrison</persRef>, were published in this day’s National Intelligencer—
							The Vice-President <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> of
							Virginia, arrived here at 5. O’Clock this morning, and took lodgings at
								<persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel. At Noon the
							heads of Departments waited upon him. He requested them all to continue
							in the Offices, and took the Official Oath of President of the United
							States, which was administered to him by <persRef ref="cranch-william"
								>William Cranch</persRef> Chief Justice of the Circuit Court of the
							District of Columbia— The judge certifies that although M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler deems himself qualified to perform
							the duties and exercise the powers and Office of President, on the death
							of President Harrison, without any other Oath than that which he had
							taken as Vice-President, yet as doubts might arise, and for greater
							caution he had taken and subscribed the present Oath— And may the
							blessing of Heaven upon this Nation attend and follow this providential
							revolution in its Government— For the present it is not joyous but
							grievous— The moral condition of this country is degenerating; and
							especially that part of its institutions, which is organized by the
							process of unceasing elections— The spirit of the age and country is to
							accumulate power in the hands of the multitude, to shorten terms of
							service in high public office; to multiply elections and diminish
							executive power—to weaken all agencies protective of property or
							repressive of crime—to abolish capital punishments, imprisonment for
							debt, and even the lien upon property of contracts—Slavery—Temperance,
							Land-jobbing, Bankruptcy, and sundry controversies with Great-Britain,
							constitute the materials for the History of John Tyler’s administration—
							But the improvement of the condition of man will form no part of his
							policy, and the improvement of his Country will be an object of his most
							inveterate and inflexible opposition— May the omnipotence of God
							overrule the depravity of man— Of human purpose or human energy I
							despair— <persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Elizabeth Pierce</persRef> was
							here this morning with another Letter of sturdy beggary from her sister
								<persRef ref="telfair-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Telfair</persRef>— I rode to the Capitol, but the Library was closed
							and I walked home— All the public offices are closed and all the works
							upon the public buildings are suspended: there are consequently large
							numbers of idlers lounging about the Capitol yard, the Streets and
							avenues and the Hotels.— <persRef ref="thomas-james3">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas</persRef> was here this
							afternoon, gossiping for upwards of an hour, but des orienté, with
							regard to the prospects of the renovated administration— <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> took tea and spent the Evening
							here— The infection of suspended labours and of idleness caught and
							subdued me— I undertook to assort and file my Letters received through
							the last year, and soon found myself entangled in a snarl
							inextricable—from this I fall back to the perusal of the Parliamentary
							papers on the Slave-trade and the wrangling Negotiation, between
							Great-Britain and Portugal.</p>

						<p>Funeral of W. H. Harrison President U.S. </p>
						<p>This ceremony was performed in a decent and unostentatious manner, with
							proper religious solemnity, and with the simplicity congenial to our
							republican institutions— A quarter before 12. Noon I attended at the
							President’s House, where in the centre of the East room the Coffin
							covered with a black velvet pall was placed on a plain table, by the
							side and crosswise of which was another at which the <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> Rector of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church read the episcopal funeral
							service, with a very brief additional statement of two facts— The first
							that the day after <persRef ref="harrison-william">General
								Harrison</persRef> entered the President’s house, he walked out into
							the City, and purchased a Bible, and a prayer-book both of which were on
							the table, and were exhibited to the assembled auditory by the
							officiating divine, who said that it had been the daily practice of the
							late President, to commence the day by reading in that Bible— The other
							fact was that he had expressed his regret at not having joined in full
							communion with the Church, and that it was his intention to have done
							so; on the ensuing Easter day, next Sunday— After the reading of the
							Church service the order of procession was formed; <persRef
								ref="carroll-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carroll</persRef>, the Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United
							States officiating as one of the Marshals—he called out in succession
							the Mayors of the three Cities of <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Washington</persRef>, <persRef ref="cox-john">Georgetown</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="snowden-edgar">Alexandria</persRef>: then the Clergy
							and the Physicians— Then eight Soldiers of the Marine Corps came in, and
							bore away the Coffin which was placed on a Car drawn by six white
							horses. Twenty-six pall bearers in white skarfs, one representing each
							State in the Union followed the corpse. Then the family and relatives of
							the late President— Then the <persRef ref="tyler-john">acting
								President</persRef>, and heads of Departments— Then the
							Ex-Presidents—that is, myself, with Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="paulding-james">Paulding</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="gilpin-henry">Gilpin</persRef>, heads of departments of the
							late <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef> Administration—
							After which came the judges of the Courts, Senators—Foreign Ministers,
							Legations and Commissioners, and then Members of the House of
							Representatives. Governors of States and Territories &amp;c—all preceded
							by a numerous and diversified Military escort— <persRef ref="simms-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Semmes</persRef> the Chief Clerk
							of the Navy Department rode with me in my Carriage— The Corps
							Diplomatique were in full costume, but <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef> the British Minister was
							not present, nor I believe any member of the British Legation— Vast
							crowds of people followed in the procession, and the Avenue from the
							Palace to the Capitol was equally thronged. The City Bells were tolled,
							and minute guns were fired from the western terrace of the Capitol— A
							floating multitude, male and female, of all ages and colours followed
							the procession, to the Navy Yard burying ground, where the corpse was
							deposited in the receiving vault; with some difficulty from the
							excessive crowd; but not the slightest disorder— On the return, only the
							military escort continued in procession. I took up a <persRef
								ref="brent-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
							Brent</persRef>, who had lost his Carriage and left him on Capitol Hill—
							I reached home at half past 4. and idled off the remainder of the

							Chief Clerk of the Department, on the subject, and also with <persRef
								ref="morris-charles">Commodore Morris</persRef>, who M<hi

								William Emmons</persRef>, a Teazer came with his subscription book,
							for a republication of the trial of the Soldiers for the Boston Massacre
							of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1770. He says he
							published the Edition of 1822 at the instigation of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>, and he has now been
							a year and a half teazing me for aid to publish another edition of it—
							He has also made application for aid, to President Quincy, from whom I
							have an unanswered Letter concerning it— Emmons is now going to Boston;
							and his most urgent want was of 3 or 4 dollars to help him on his way— I
							subscribed for two copies of his book, and paid him for them two dollars
							a copy in advance, having little expectation of ever seeing them, but
							willing to get rid of the sight of him hereafter at that price. <persRef
								ref="hodgson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> will dismiss <persRef ref="greenhow-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenhow</persRef> from the office of

							Constantinople as Dragoman, and that in that event <persRef
								ref="porter-david">Commodore Porter</persRef>, will either kill him,
							or in some way accomplish his ruin— He wants me to intercede with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, to restore to him his place as
							translator— I rode to the Capitol, and returned to the library, the
							American Almanac for 1841. but neither House Journal nor Slave-trade
							document was to be found at the Clerk’s Office and I walked home— At
							Sunset I took another walk, and in the Evening answered an old
							invitation, to deliver a Lecture before the Mechanics Society at
							Lancaster Pennsylvania, which I declined— I continued but could not
							finish a Letter to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and
							it seems to me, as if I never before wasted so much time in idleness,
							with such a burden of work before me to do— The Parliamentary Documents

							and all to no profitable purpose.</p>

							adhering to principle. <persRef ref="mayo-robert">D<hi

								>Rives</persRef> for a libel, charging him with having <hi

							suited upon demurrer; the Circuit Court of the District having decided
							that the word was not actionable— The Doctor has repeatedly applied to
							me for these interrogatories, which I had mislaid, but which upon
							overhauling my papers I had found and now returned to him.— He promised

						<p>Morning service at the second Presbyterian Church; all but empty—
								<persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef> preached from Isaiah 59.9. “We wait for light, but
							behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.”— He began
							with a historical narrative of the condition of the kingdom of Judah, at
							the time when this prophesy was delivered—and indeed it was a melancholy
							time— It is difficult to present a parallel between any portion of the
							history of the Jews and our own history, in which there is any
							resemblance— With the exception of the reign of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>, a bright spot of 40 years yet of oriental
							despotism, the history of the children of Israel, is one tissue of
							calamity and crime, from the Exodus out of Egypt till Ephraim was
							swallowed up by the Assyrian and Judah by the Babylonian Monarchy— The
							writings of all the prophets and especially of Isaiah are but the
							records of cause and effect— The atrocious crimes of the kings and
							people and the severe judgments of Heaven. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wood however called the attention of his hearers to a
							parallel line of transgressions and of punishments as having marked the
							history of our last ten years— He specified the Cholera of 1832. the
							great fire at New-York—the Tornado at Natchez and the compound
							calamities of Mobile all of which together scarcely amount to a
							pin-scratch in comparison with the disasters of the Jews in the days of
							Isaiah. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood mentioned also the disorders
							of the currency and pecuniary embarrassments of the Country, and lastly
							to cap the whole the sudden and astounding decease of <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">President William Henry Harrison</persRef>
							within a month, a little month after his inauguration.— Upon this event
							he made many very sensible observations and added many appropriate
							notices of his life and character. It was a very creditable funeral
							discourse; concluding with an earnest call upon the auditory to turn
							away from their own sins among which he denounced in bold language the
							practice of dueling; and to make their peace with God— He gave out the
							first and last 3. verses of <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef>
								67<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm to be sung.— I had received
							an invitation from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="gilliss-george">George Gilliss</persRef>
								and<space/><persRef ref="hand-unknown">Hand</persRef>, elders of the
							seceding 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Presbyterian church, to attend
							a funeral Sermon by the <persRef ref="vanrensselaer-cortland">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Rensselaer</persRef> (son of the <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">Patroon</persRef>) their Pastor, at
								<persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Laurie’s</persRef> Church at half past 3. this afternoon. I went
							accordingly with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
							wife</persRef>, and heard the Discourse from 1. Peter 1.24. [“]For all
							flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The
							grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: 25. But the word
							of the Lord endureth forever.” A long and eloquent funeral eulogy;
							contrasting the transient nature of the highest human excellence, with
							the eternal duration of the word of God.— As a panegyric it was
							skilfully composed and the account of the life of General Harrison was
							more copious of incident than I had known of before— A President of the
							United States chosen by a large majority of the People, cannot be an
							ordinary man. The house was crowded. <persRef ref="tyler-john">President
								Tyler</persRef>, the Secretary of the Treasury <persRef
								ref="ewing-thomas">Ewing</persRef>, and the Post-master General
								<persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> were there.

						<p>On rising this morning I found the roofs of the opposite houses covered
							with snow, and it continued to snow all the morning; but melted as it
							fell— It confined me to the house until the evening twilight, when I
							walked to the foot of the Capitol Hill and back for exercise— I wasted
							hours upon the parliamentary papers relating to the Slave-trade, and
							then hours upon a genealogical treatise by <persRef ref="grace-john"
								>James A Grace</persRef>, and a Letter from him to <persRef
								ref="heard-john4">John Heard</persRef> dated Havana 9 Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1841. about <persRef key="adams-abigail"
								>my mother’s</persRef> published Letters, and about the families of
							Quincy, Adams and Grace or Legras— My poem of <persRef
								ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot Macmorrogh</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">Henry Middleton</persRef> of South-Carolina.
							All these things make such a jumble of matter that it swallowed up the
							day, and left my letter to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef> yet unfinished— <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> called this
							afternoon disappointed and desponding— He has been applying for the
							Office of Surveyor of the port of Philadelphia; his last resource after
							repeated failures of numerous speculations.— He said there had been this
							morning a cabinet meeting, and the three offices of the Philadelphia
							Custom house had been finally fixed; he knew not upon whom; but neither
							of them upon him— They would put him off with some inferior Office which
							he should not accept— The explosion of the Pennsylvania Bank of the
							United States has at length taken place and exhibits the conduct of
								<persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="biddle-thomas2">Thomas Biddle</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jaudon-samuel">Jaudon</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cowperthwaite-joseph">Cowperthwait</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="andrews-john3">Andrews</persRef>, as steeped in the vilest
							corruption— Three-fifths at least of the Capital stock of the Bank is
							sunk and lost to the Stockholders forever— Enormous sums of it have been
							embezzled by each of those men, in a manner to shake all faith in human
							integrity— The report of a Committee of investigation was read at a
							public meeting of the Stock holders last Thursday, which broke up in a
							tumult, and another meeting is to be held next Thursday— Connell says
							that <persRef ref="clayton-john">John M. Clayton</persRef> of Delaware
							went there and attempted to defend N. Biddle but was hissed down and
							left the Meeting in disgust— Connell at two distant periods of time has
							served three successive years as a director of the Bank—the last of
							which was as late as the last year— I have always believed him a rigidly
							honest man; but he gave me time after time statements of the condition
							of the bank, flattering in the highest degree— He now tells me that he
							never owned any of the Stock— That shares had been transferred to him,
							to enable him to be chosen as a director; and that he never had any
							knowledge of the real condition of the bank: He says Nicholas Biddle has
							published in the National Gazette of last Saturday, a preliminary
							Article in defence of himself, and promises another— Alas! he is
							irretrievably ruined, in fortune and in fame— I doubt if his person is
							safe in Philadelphia.</p>

								Dickinson</persRef> called on me this morning, and introduced
							himself to me, by presenting a Letter dated at Albany the first of this
							month, from the Governor of New-York <persRef ref="seward-william"
								>William H. Seward</persRef> to the late <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef>, recommending
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickinson as a man of plain speech
							but of great intelligence and of weighty influence as a member of the
							Senate of New-York. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickinson did not
							arrive here till after the death of General Harrison, and had not seen
							either the new <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef>, or
							any of the heads of Departments— The Legislature of New-York are still
							in Session, and will continue so, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dickinson thinks till the latter end of May. That in the midst of the
							Session this Gentleman should come away from Albany with such a Letter
							from the Governor of the State to the President, suggested naturally to
							me conjectures that his visit here was upon a political mission, to
							ascertain the purposes of this administration upon important points of
							policy, and to concert a corresponding system of action for the
							Legislature of New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickinson did
							not tell me that he was thus deputed, but he manifested great anxiety to
							know, what were the intentions and the expectations of the
							administration with regard to a national Bank, a Tariff and the
							distribution among the States of the proceeds of the public Lands— I
							told him I knew nothing more upon these subjects than was to be gathered
							from the Newspapers, and advised him to see the President and the
							Secretaries. I said there was another subject which I deemed of more
							vital importance to this Union, than the Bank, the Tariff, the Currency,
							or the Land and State debts questions, or than all of them together—and
							that was the controversy between the States of New-York and Virginia,
							and the Slavery question generally; about which not one word was said by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler in his Address, to the people
							of the United States intended for an inaugural exposition of his
							principles of Administration— He said he thought as I did with regard to
							the importance of the question between New-York and Virginia— I enquired
							if the People of New-York would sustain Governor Seward in the stand he
							had taken— He said certainly.—and that there was but one weighty member
							of the Senate opposed to it, or doubtful of it— <persRef
								ref="verplanck-gulian">Gulian C. Verplanck</persRef>.— I suppose
							Verplanck to be the ablest man in that Senate, but the nerve is not in
							him— He is of the class of men, whose last resort always is to
							compromise with principle— I had visits also from <persRef
								ref="harrison-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Harrison</persRef>, with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lloyd</persRef>, originally from Worcester County
							Massachusetts, but now settled at Cleveland Ohio—apparently a very
							intelligent man but of slender Constitution and infirm health— I walked
							before dinner nearly to Georgetown and at Evening twilight round the
							Capitol hill— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> dined and
							spent the Evening with us, and her brother <persRef ref="cutts-richard2"
								>Richard</persRef> was here in the Evening— I could not get through
							my Letter of commentary upon Grace.</p>

						<p>The Snow has disappeared; but the chilly weather and cold April showers,
							with the peach and cherry trees in blossom blasted in the open bud—
								<persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Elizabeth Pierce</persRef> was here
							with three of the seven shirts which she is making for me, but I did not
							see her— I walked half an hour before dinner towards Georgetown, and
							round the Capitol hill at Sunset— Finished and despatched my Letter upon
							endless genealogies to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
							and answered a Letter and Resolutions of the coloured People residing at
							Columbus in the State of Ohio. I have a Letter also from <persRef
								ref="seward-william">W. H. Seward</persRef> Governor of the State of
							New-York, which though short I must answer, whatever responsibility may
							follow— But all this absorbs time which ought to be otherwise employed—
								<persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef> was again here anxious for the decision upon his
							application for the chaplaincy; but <persRef ref="badger-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Badger</persRef> the Secretary of the
							Navy has not yet returned— <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett</persRef> called also upon
							me, and now fully disclosed his project which is to place the investment
							and disposal of the Smithsonian funds under the management of the
							American Institution for the promotion of Literature and Science.— He
							concurs entirely in my views of confining the appropriations to the
							annual interest, leaving the principal unimpaired, and of making the
							first appropriations for the establishment of an Astronomical
							Observatory.— But he did not approve of leaving the selection of the
							spot to the <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, and thought the hill opposite Analostan Island
							objectionable on account of its exposure to fogs, from its proximity to
							the river— He spoke of two or three other places between Meridian hill,
							and the President’s house with some remarks on each spot worthy of
							consideration— He said he had at present no other occupation on hand,
							and would be willing to devote two years, entirely to organizing this
							establishment, and getting it into full operation. I know not that it
							could be accomplished more effectively; and think I must acquiesce in
							this arrangement and endeavour to carry it through— The chief obstacle
							however will now be to extricate the funds from the fangs of the State
							of Arkansas. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett thought that they
							paid the interest upon their bonds punctually; but the Law requires that
							the interest should when paid be immediately reinvested in State Stocks,
							and I struggled in vain at the late Session of Congress to obtain a
							repeal of that Law.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett said he was
							now going in a very few days to South-Carolina, but should soon return
							here. I received a Letter from <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua Leavitt</persRef> with slips
							from Newspapers embracing the whole of my speech before the Supreme
							Court of the United States in the case of the Amistad captives— I cannot
							longer delay to undertake the revisal of it, unless I abandon it
							altogether.</p>

						<p>I finished my Letter to the <persRef ref="seward-william">Governor of
								New-York</persRef>, which I marked private, but wrote with a
							constant anticipation, that it may be published very soon; and in all
							probability will be sooner or later.— I have laid down the principle, of
							international Law, upon which I concur with him in his controversy with
							the executive authorities of Virginia. I take what I believe to be the
							impregnable position, the right of each Sovereign party to a contract to
							construe its provisions for itself, but not to impose its construction
							upon the other— I have not touched upon the policy of impolicy of
							delivering up fugitives from Justice—nor upon the usages among civilized
							Nations, nor upon the degree of transgression embraced in the definition
							of the word crime.— Upon all these points there is much debatable
							ground— But the independent right of construction on both sides, the
							necessity that both parties should understand the words constituting
							obligation in a compact, in the same sense, and the basement story of
							the controversy the conflict between Freedom and Slavery are parts or
							auxiliaries of Seward’s argument which cannot be shaken. Prudence has
							warned me to stand aloof from this contest, but I cannot— The leading
							men of the North are all truckling to Southern Slavery— They are all
							ready to desert Seward in the stand that he has taken. I see what it
							will cost me to stand by him; but I have so little political capital
							left, that the remnant is not worth saving— Especially at the cost of
							base desertion from the cause.— <persRef ref="thomas-james3">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas</persRef> was here this
							morning; and gave me a sample of the way in which <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> is doing business— Thomas is
							an applicant for the Office of Navy Agent here— The Office is at the
							disposal of the Secretary of the Navy, <persRef ref="badger-george"
								>Badger</persRef>— But Thomas wanted a good word or two from Webster
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Badger supposed to be under special
							obligation to Webster for his place— So Thomas obtains Letters from
								<persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="curtis-edward">Curtis</persRef> to Webster, warmly
							recommendatory of Thomas, as a most useful political friend, strictly
							confidential, for Webster’s eye alone and utterly unfit to go into other
							hands— After several ineffectual calls to see Webster, always engaged,
							Thomas writes him a Letter, soliciting his influence with Badger, and
							enclosing the Letters from Evans and Curtis to Webster himself— Two days
							after Thomas calls again upon Webster, still engaged with company, who
							gives him back his Letter of solicitation, with the two enclosures from
							Evans and Curtis; and advises him to deliver them all to the Secretary
							of the Navy—Thomas says it is plain that Webster had not read them; for
							if he had he would never have suffered them to go out of his hands—
							Thomas called upon him again early this morning but found <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> watching for him at his door.—
							He was going to try to find him again— Morning visit from <persRef
								ref="white-stephen2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef> from <persRef

								Robert Reeves</persRef> is a day watchman at the Treasury
							Department: a native of Ireland, who boasts that he never went to school
							a day in his life; and who brought for my perusal a well written
							manuscript of about 100 pages, containing a plan for a bank, a
							protecting Tariff, and a National currency and system of exchanges,
							original, altogether his own, and far superior to any thing ever
							proposed by any-one else— In this opinion he is perfectly sincere, and
							although conscious of the lowliness of his condition, and of the
							conclusion that other men may draw from this circumstance against his
							plan, it is to him only a source of higher self admiration, in the
							comparison between the greatness of his achievements and the smallness
							of his means— He had communicated his manuscript to the late <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef> who had read it,
							and conversed with him concerning it; but he was so taken with the sub
							treasury that he could approve of nothing else— I paid a visit this
							morning to <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tyler</persRef> who styles himself President of the United States
							and not Vice-President acting as President which would be the correct
							style— But it is a construction of the Constitution, in direct violation
							both of the grammar, and context of the Constitution, which confers upon
							the Vice-President on the decease of the President, not the Office, but
							the powers and the duties of the said office— There is a dogmatical
							article in the National Intelligencer, asserting this false
							construction, which is not worth contesting, but which to a strict
							constructionist would warrant more than a doubt whether the Vice
							President has the right to occupy the President’s house or to claim his
							Salary without an act of Congress.— He moved into the house, two days
							ago, and received me in the old South-east Cabinet chamber.— He received
							me very kindly, and apologized for not having visited me without waiting
							for this call— To this I had no claim or pretension My visit was very
							short, as there were several persons in attendance and among them
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> now President of the Senate— I then called at the
							Navy Department, where I found <persRef ref="badger-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Badger</persRef> the Secretary,
							returned from North Carolina, and renewed the recommendation of <persRef
								ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef> for a chaplaincy in the Mediterranean squadron.
							Then on <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Stephen Pleasonton</persRef>,

						<p>I should have mentioned that yesterday morning I visited <persRef

							for Charleston South Carolina— I enquired when he proposed to return
							here, and understood him to say not till next Winter—but then he comes
							for two years to preside over the National Institution for the promotion
							of Science; and as he expressed a wish that the Smithsonian fund might
							be connected with that Institution and placed under its management, I
							requested him to take the Bill reported to the house with my Report of
							5. March 1840, and prepare any amendment to it, which would carry out
							his views, and send it to me, before the approaching Session of
							Congress, which he said he would do— And in the afternoon, with <persRef

								ref="tayloe-benjamin;dickinson-julia">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Benjamin Ogle Tayloe</persRef>,
							and thanked the Lady for a lithographic print likeness of her father the

							me last week. They have <persRef ref="tayloe-estelle;dickinson-julia2"
								>two little girls</persRef> who speak nothing but French—taught by a
							French Nursery Maid according to the Russian fashion— This morning I was
							visited by <persRef ref="williams-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Henry Williams</persRef> of Boston, and <persRef
								ref="etheridge-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Etheridge</persRef> of Charlestown— The latter had visited me some
							weeks since; though his name was omitted from the margin by
							inadvertence— He had also spoken to me of some claim last November when
							I delivered the Lecture at Charlestown and met him there— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams comes to apply for the Office of
							Surveyor of the Port of Boston, for which he thinks he has special
							qualifications and aptitudes— He made himself very conspicuous the
							Summer before last, by his opposition to the 15 gallon Law, against
							which he got up and edited a temporary newspaper, and wrote to me for my
							opinion, and published my answer—of which he reminded me now. <persRef
								ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef> came again to know his chance of success for a
							chaplaincy— I told him I had seen and spoken to the <persRef
								ref="badger-george">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, who had
							promised a speedy answer— He goes again to Alexandria, to preach there
							to-morrow— I called at the War Department, and left with <persRef
								ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>,
							Letters of application, for Office from <persRef ref="snelling-henry"
								>Henry Hunt Snelling</persRef>, New-York, for a place in the

								ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reuben
								Post</persRef> preached from Romans 5.8. [“]But God commendeth his
							love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
							us.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Post was formerly Minister of a
							Church in this city and several years chaplain to the House of
							Representatives— About the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of May 1829.
							he visited me, in my deep distress at Meridian hill; for which I feel
							grateful to him— He is now settled at Charleston South-Carolina— After
							dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the first Sunday after Easter, but read as the first
							Lesson the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Hosea, which is
							the first morning lesson of next Sunday, instead of the 48<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Isaiah, the proper first
							lesson of this Evening— He preached from Colossians 1.18. “And he is the
							head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the first born from
							the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence: 19. For it
							pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.” The purpose
							of the discourse was to illustrate the glorious character of Jesus
							Christ, and the special application of all the Epistles of <persRef
								ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef> to that
							purpose; the glorification of <hi rend="italic">Jesus</hi>— But why is
							this human personification of the only one and true God, the vital
							principle of the Christian Religion? Is it philosophical? The Creator
							God of the Universe, a worm of the dust? a crucified Jew? a vassal of
								<persRef ref="herod">Herod</persRef>, the Tetrarch vassal of
								<persRef ref="augustuscaesar;tiberius">Octavius and Tiberius
								Caesar</persRef>? why must we believe this? Is it not because the
							humanization of God is necessary to the deification of man? This seems
							to be the argument of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> chapter of
							the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Epistle to the Corinthians, which
							is the second lesson of this Evening. After Church, I went to <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye’s</persRef>
							and conversed with him concerning a Letter from <persRef
								ref="hinton-joseph2">Joseph B. Hinton</persRef> of Raleigh, to
							purchase the Columbian Mills— <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Frye</persRef> could not leave the
							bedside of young <persRef ref="u">Kuhn</persRef>, who is dying of a
							consumption at their house— <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas"
								>Thomas</persRef> came for me with the Carriage. I returned home,
							and went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> at 1/2
							past 7. to Trinity Church— <persRef ref="stringfellow-horace">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stringfellow</persRef> read the
							Evening service of the day—the 48<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter
							of Isaiah being the first lesson. <persRef ref="meade-william">Bishop
								Meade</persRef> of Virginia, preached from John 5.40. “And ye will
							not come to me that ye might have life.” Tender, affectionate,
							expostulatory—colloquial and attractive— He had preached on the same
							text this morning till his voice failed him— While we were out <persRef
								ref="thomas-john7;thomas-sarah">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thomas</persRef>, were here; and
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Clay</persRef> will be left to fight his own battle with the Land

							and the administration will waddle along, living from hand to mouth—for
							as to any great commanding and compact system, Webster is “a great baby”
							and <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Ewing</persRef> is another— Of course,

						<p>That most anxious and painful operation of packing up for departure

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams gave it to me last November

							when it was found— I took it to the <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry"
								>Commissioner of Patents</persRef>, and after some difficulty as to
							the wording of the order which was not made payable to me by name, he
							finally gave me an order upon <persRef ref="u">Fowler</persRef> for the

							receipt in the name of—Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							and received the money at Fowler’s Exchange Office. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Ellsworth shewed me the magnificent Hall
							in the new Patent Office where the models of Patents are to be deposited
							and arranged; a work which has already been commenced, but in which very
							little progress has yet been made. He said that a very extraordinary
							proportion of the patents came from the State of Massachusetts. He
							shewed me also several other chambers where collections are to be
							preserved—one especially for maps—where I saw two late splendid maps of
							England and Ireland—Geological— Thence I went to the Capitol and left
							orders with the Postmaster of the House, <persRef
								ref="mccormick-william">M’Cormick</persRef> to forward Letters and
							Papers for me, till a week before the Meeting of Congress, to Boston.
								<persRef ref="fletcher-noah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef> nor <persRef
								ref="berry-brooke">Berry</persRef>, so that I could not get sight of
							the Section of the West Point Academy appropriation Bill, which sunk one
							half the Smithsonian fund into Arkansas Bonds two months before it
							reached the mint— I have endeavoured in vain to trace that abominable
							fraud to its source.— I left word with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fletcher that there was yet a volume of my Senate Bills, Resolutions
							&amp;c missing— I found the Secretary of the Navy, <persRef
								ref="badger-george">Badger</persRef> at his office after 3. O’Clock,
							and met <persRef ref="morris-charles">Commodore Morris</persRef> in the
							Anti-chamber— I spoke to them both, in behalf of <persRef
								ref="kavasales-photius">Kavasales</persRef> for the chaplaincy;
							Morris expressed doubts whether he would get the appoint, but promised
							all kindness to him if he should.— The Secretary whom I pressed for an
							answer said he believed no appointment would be made to the office
							before the Session of Congress: as the squadron could not be got ready
							to sail sooner. I then asked if I might be permitted to say to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kavasales, that the <persRef

							whereupon, he desired me to ask Kavasales to call at the Department to

							accordingly an introductory Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I rose at 5, dawdled, and breakfasted and reached the Railway Office just
							in time to get my ticket, to have my trunk deposited in the baggage
							waggon, and to take my seat in the Cars before they started— They had
							already moved from under the shed— As I took my seat <persRef
								ref="fischer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fischer</persRef> the Bookseller of Stationer’s Hall introduced
							himself, and afterwards introduced <persRef ref="noble-noah">Governor
								Noble</persRef> of Indiana.— At ten minutes past 8 we alighted at
							Baltimore. I took my seat in the Cars for Philadelphia— Then a walk of
							half an hour in the Streets of Baltimore— At 9. we started from the
							depot at Baltimore, and passing Back river<space/>miles,
							Gunpowder<space/>the Susquehanna at Havre de
							Grace<space/>Wilmington<space/>West-Chester<space/>and the
							Schuykill<space/>arrived at the Depot in Market Street at 4 in the
							afternoon. The weather had been raw cold and lowering and had now come
							on to rain. A prospect of a cheerless evening and night at Philadelphia,
							with a moral impulse which I could scarcely define, hurried me on with
							my companions from Baltimore, Governor Noble and Fischer— <persRef
								ref="skinner-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John S.

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>, and
							recently appointed one of the Assistant Postmasters General was also a
							fellow traveller from Baltimore, but his journey terminated at
							Philadelphia— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fischer saw my trunk with
							his own, transferred from one baggage waggon to another— We step’d from
							the Car into an omnibus, rode down to Chesnut Street wharf, cross’d in a
							Steam ferry boat to Camden and there took the train of Cars for
							New-York— Night came on, pouring with rain. we passed in darkness
							through Burlington, Bordentown, Trenton, Princeton, New-Brunswick,
							Elizabethtown and Newark to the Steam ferry boat at Jersey City;
							formerly Powles hoek; took a Hack on landing in New-York, and at 5.
							minutes past midnight entered our names on the Bar book of the
							Astor-house— They could give us for the night only one chamber with two
							beds— N. 128. at which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fischer hesitated
							supposing I should wish to be alone: but I readily consented to share
							the chamber for the night, and within half an hour we were each in his
							own bed, and in five minutes more sound asleep— The Cars from Baltimore
							to Philadelphia make a stop of 15 minutes at Wilmington Delaware, to
							give the passengers who choose it, an opportunity to dine—but the fare
							at the tavern is so indifferent and the time so short, that very few of
							the passengers avail themselves of it. I did not, this day; but about
							half past 9 this Evening took a cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and half a
							dozen fresh oysters at New-Brunswick. This abstinence is to me the great
							secret of traveling as well as of labouring without fatigue.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fischer’s attentions to my small personal
							accommodation and the care of baggage were unremitting— The distance
							from Washington to New-York is at least 220 miles— The travel of 18
							hours, without the occurrence of the slightest unpleasant accident—

							the two pamphlets of Congressional documents containing the

							copper medalic image of <persRef ref="clarkson-thomas">Thomas

							being then engaged with <persRef ref="seward-william">Governor William

						<p>My fellow passengers in the Mohegan, were all strangers, to me, except a
							young man belonging to Providence who remembered me, though I had
							forgotten him— He named himself to me, and said he had been heretofore
							introduced to me, of which I have some recollection— His name is
								<persRef ref="u">Ives</persRef>, and he said he should be happy to
							assist me in any good office for my personal accommodation—just as
								<persRef ref="fischer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fischer</persRef> had done in the Cars— He accordingly bespoke a
							comfortable birth for me, for the Night— Although the aspect of the
							weather was so threatening the night was not stormy, and the movement of
							the boat was so easy that when the darkness came on almost all the male
							passengers gathered round the stove near which I was sitting, and set me
							to talking, which I did without prudence or reserve till past eleven
							O’Clock— I then turned in—the Night was quiet but I got no sleep. At
							half past 3. this morning I rose, and going back on deck, saw the
							Gull-island light on the starboard and the New-London light on the
							larboard quarter of the boat At 4. we landed at Stonington, with dawning
							day, half an hour earlier than at Washington— Upon repairing to the
							Cars, I saw one of them with the words “Ladies Car” painted upon it in
							large Letters— To ascertain how far it was exclusively reserved, I
							presented myself at its door, and enquired of the conductor whether I
							might take a seat in it— He answered No; unless I had Ladies with me. I
							acquiesced, and took my seat in another car— This rule of reserving one
							Car exclusively for Ladies and their companions is I believe of recent
							origin— At 7. we crossed in the Ferry-boat to Providence and I
							breakfasted— Then entered fresh Cars, and landed at the depot, at 9.
							A.M— Took a Hack and in ten minutes was landed at <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house, Hancock Avenue N. 3.
							where with grateful heart I found a cordial welcome from him, and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles7;adams-john17;adams-louisa3;adams-henry4">their
								four children</persRef>, all well!— Thus in 34 travelling hours, I
							have come from Washington to Boston; at least 470 miles at a cost
							of<space/>Dollars.</p>
						<p>Not the slightest accident had occurred on the road, and I had scarcely
							had more exercise of motion than if I had been all the time sitting at
							my writing table, at my Study in Washington. But after two Nights in
							succession with very short sleep, and a third with none at all, a state
							of drowsiness close upon lethargy disabled me for all mental and for
							almost all physical action for the remnant of this day. <persRef
								ref="brooks-edward">Edward Brooks</persRef> called soon after I came

							dinner, and their father <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C. Brooks</persRef>, spent a
							short Evening here— He invited me to his house to-morrow Evening, and to
							dine with him next Wednesday— I attempted to write to <persRef

							more than half through. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles wrote to

						<p>At the first Congregational Church, this morning <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathanael
								L. Frothingham</persRef> preached from Psalm 139.23. “Search me, O
							God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:” I think I never
							in my life, heard a Sermon of purer morality, of more elevated piety, of
							more affecting exhortation, of deeper impression— It was upon the duty
							of regulating, controuling and directing the thoughts— The discourse
							began by noticing that the first verses of the Psalm attested that God
								<hi rend="italic">had</hi> already searched the Psalmist and known
							him—and that the all-seeing eye of God perceives and knows the thoughts
							of men, even before they are formed.— He then examined and discussed the
							opinion extensively prevailing that thought is free and beyond our
							controul or responsibility. That thoughts cost nothing; and shewed by a
							strict analysis of their nature, influence and operations, how they may
							cost our integrity, our peace our reason, our existence here, our
							destiny hereafter—and urged the deep concernment to us all, of
							unremitting vigilance over them as they arise in our minds, and of
							holding them under the curb of a rigorous discipline— This doctrine
							truly Christian, is perhaps the crowning glory of Christian morality—
							The germ of it all may perhaps be found in the tenth Commandment of the
							Decalogue—thou shalt not covet— How far the exclusion of evil thoughts
							may be within our controul is not easily ascertained; but the most
							effective expedient to keep them out, is to occupy the mind
							unremittingly with good ones. Idleness is the most dangerous instigator
							of evil thoughts, and they who with good intentions have not
							inflexibility of principle for adherence to virtue should not leave
							themselves time to be wicked— There were in the pew three copies of
							another Sermon, called the Solemn Week, preached by D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham on the recent Fast-day, the
								8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month, and printed at the
							request of his parishioners. After meeting I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C. Brooks
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef>— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s text this afternoon was from
							1. Corinthians 1.31.—[“]He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”—
							As an illustration of this precept, he adverted to the passage of the
							prophet Jeremiah 9.23 and 24. where the same injunction is repeated with
							specific reference to the principal sources of earthly glory, wisdom and
							power and riches. This Sermon was perhaps as instructive as that of the
							morning in setting forth the vanity of all human possessions, a lesson
							which cannot be too often or too forcibly taught: but it was more of a
							common place character, and therefore not so deeply impressive— Nor was
							it exhortation to virtue of so exalted an atmosphere, or of so difficult
							attainment— No sacrifice of selfish passions or interest, is require for
							reverence to God, or for abstinence from vain glory: but the dominion
							over one’s own Spirit is an arduous, and self-crucifying operation to
							acquire. I spent this Evening with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C. Brooks</persRef> at his
							house— His Son Peter C. with <persRef ref="brooks-susan">his
								wife</persRef> live with him— A <persRef ref="u">brother</persRef>
							of <persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>The foul and stormy weather continues, and confined me chiefly to the
							house— I finished yesterday my Letter to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and this morning
							answered at last, the Letter of invitation from <persRef
								ref="pickering-john">John Pickering</persRef> chairman of a
							Committee of the Alumni of Harvard College, to deliver their first
							Anniversary Discourse the day before next Commencement.— I declined, on
							the plea that probably Congress will at that time be in Session.—
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> of Harvard
							University called on me, and invited me to dine with him at Cambridge
							next Saturday; and to come at 11. in the morning, to inspect the
							progress of the Astronomical observatory.— I promised to go— Visit from
								<persRef ref="vattemare-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alexandre Vatemare</persRef>, who in pursuit of his great project of
							literary exchanges has been all the last Winter in Canada and has
							recently come from Portland in the State of Maine— There was in this
							morning’s Newspapers an advertisement of a Meeting of the alumni of
							Harvard University at half past 3. this afternoon which I attended, with
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>— There were between
							60 and 70 persons present, and I was called to preside at the meeting—
							The Society was formed last Summer, and in my absence I had been
							unanimously elected its President— The purpose of the present Meeting
							was briefly stated by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Pickering; and
							more at large in a Speech by <persRef ref="story-joseph">judge
								Story</persRef>— The Constitution of the Society was then read and a
							Book was opened to which each member of the Society subscribed his name,
							with the payment of one dollar— Two Resolutions were then offered by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Pickering and adopted; for
							raising a subscription to erect a building which may serve as a dining
							Hall for their Anniversaries and on Commencement days; and in which the
							Panorama of Athens some years since presented by <persRef
								ref="lyman-theodore">Theodore Lyman</persRef> may be in constant
							exhibition— President Quincy presented plans for such a building, with
							estimates of the cost amounting to 6000 dollars if of wood 12000. of
							brick, and 17000 of Stone— The subscription was opened, and several of
							the members present subscribed, each one hundred dollars, for which sum
							I subscribed my name at the head of the list— There was a Committee of
							three. <persRef ref="minot-william">William Minot</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="loring-charles">Charles G. Loring</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="eliot-samuel3">Samuel A. Elliot</persRef> which called the

								ref="gould-benjamin">Benjamin A Gould</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="parkman-francis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis
								Parkman</persRef>, and my Son Charles Francis Adams; to carry the
							Resolutions into Execution— The Meeting was held in the Circuit Court
							room and about 5 O’Clock adjourned without day— In the evening I went
							with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> to the Tremont Theatre and saw <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> King Lear— The
							parts of <persRef ref="kinglear">Lear</persRef> by <persRef
								ref="vandenhoff-john;vandenhoff-charlotte">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and Miss Vandenhoff</persRef>. The play was acted as
							recently restored, ending with the death of <persRef ref="cordelia"
								>Cordelia</persRef> and of Lear. The performance was barely
							tolerable. We came home about 10, without waiting for the after
							piece.</p>

						<p>I had hoped in the short visit to my children during the interval between
							the last, and the approaching Session of Congress to pursue the most
							necessary occupations with which I am burthened with little
							interruption; but when I came to luxuriate in the Study of <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, with his classical Library, I
							find myself every moment enticed away by the fragrance of one blossom
							after another, till the day has passed off and I have done nothing— The
							last weeks arrears of this journal are not yet redeemed; and this is the
							first day upon which I have been able to take up the report of my late
							Speech before the Supreme Court of the United States, for revisal; and I
							found immediately that I had left at Washington all the important
							Documents which I wanted for the revisal— The Committee of the Alumni,
							to whom my answer declining to deliver the first anniversary address the
							day before next Commencement was given by my Son, urged me to make a
							conditional promise that I would deliver it, if I should find it
							practicable— Especially if Congress should adjourn before the time. To
							this I consented and promised to give them notice, as soon as I can
							ascertain whether it will be in my power or not— I called yesterday
							afternoon on <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> N. L. Frothingham</persRef>, who was
							confined to his chamber with a hoarse cold, under which he had been
							suffering, while preaching the day before; and instead of talking with
							him about his Sermons, on the solemn week, and the government of the
							thoughts as I ought to have done, I wasted the time in talking myself
							about <persRef ref="othello">Othello</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kinglear">Lear</persRef>— This day the Northeast storm
							continues, with alternate rain, mist, fog, and suspension till the
							evening, when certain lucid spots in the west gave promise of a clear
							morrow— Morning visit from <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman</persRef>, who spoke
							much of <persRef ref="vattemare-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Alexandre Vatemare’s</persRef> literary exchanges, and
							of the new Society of the Alumni of Harvard College, neither of which
							seemed to have his approbation. He adheres to the exclusive fellowship
							of the Φ.B.K of which fraternity he is a member, and the selectness of
							which he thinks a precious and most efficient stimulus to emulation— The
							new Society does not annul, but must necessarily swallow up the Phi beta
							kappa. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman made also some enquiry
							concerning that adventuring Lady, who two years ago came on the voucher
							of an alledged lineal descendant from that Florentine Non discoverer of
							this hemisphere which bears his name, to demand a grant of landed
							territory from the Congress of the United States— My opinion of her
							coincides with that of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman. Before
							dinner, I walked for exercise round the Common: in 25 minutes— Evening
							visit from <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef>: during which I went with my Son to the Odeon, and
							heard <persRef ref="palfrey-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Palfrey</persRef> deliver one of a course of Lectures upon the
							Evidences of Christianity. Degrand still here when we came back.</p>

						<p>Clear, vernal day—the first of a fortnight— Morning devoted to writing,
							and commenced the revisal of my speech on the case of the Amistad
							Africans. Received two Letters having reference to that subject—one from
								<persRef ref="jocelyn-simeon">Simeon S. Jocelyn</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">Joshua Leavitt</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef> the Committee at New-York,
							which has supported them through all their trials, expressing a grateful

								ref="buffum-arnold">Arnold Buffum</persRef>, dated the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> at
							New-Garden Indiana, complaining bitterly of the act of Congress of 1793.
							prescribing the process for taking up fugitive Slaves; and of certain
							proceedings of the colonization Society; with a postscript suggesting an
							amendment to the Constitution changing the mode of electing the
							President of the United States— This election of a chief magistrate for
							the whole Union, will never be settled to the satisfaction of the
							People. The theory of elective Monarchy is that the choice may fall upon
							the wisest, and the best— The theory of frequent elections is that power
							cannot be long trusted to the same hands even of the wisest and the
							best. The two parts can be reconciled to each other only by the
							inconsistency and corruptibility of human nature in its best estate: and
							never, never will any great people be satisfied with the result of their
							own elections of an executive head— We have now the tenth President of
							the United States brought into Office, in the space of 52 years that the
							Constitution has been in operation— One amendment has already changed
							the mode of election prescribed by that instrument— A second practical
							alteration has limited the term of service to two periods of four years—
							And a third is growing upon the impatience of the people, for a further
							limitation to one term of 4 years, while the office itself is falling
							into hands incompetent to the management, and upon heads inadequate even
							to the conception of any comprehensive system of administration for the
							affairs of a great confederated Nation— There is not a mind now occupied
							in the executive administration of this Government, and the only change
							yet accomplished, is of one set of low and miserable expedients for
							another.— The only prospect now is of recoiling to the last with
							aggravation of a shameless failure of the apparent extrication of the
							Country from the fangs of a worthless and profligate faction— I walked

						<p>I did not pass the sill of the door of the house, this whole day, and all
							that I effected was to bring up the arrears of this diary, and to begin
							a Letter to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
							which I could not finish: <persRef ref="plumer-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi></persRef> of Epping New Hampshire paid me a morning
							visit— He was desirous of obtaining the Office of U.S. Navy Agent at
							Portsmouth but it has been given to another— <persRef
								ref="leary-john;leary-michael">John and Michael Leary</persRef> were
							here; and <persRef ref="flynn-mary2">Mary Flynn</persRef>, and there is
							quite a commotion among them about the property left by <persRef
								ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy</persRef>.— John, as Administrator of his
							brother has received 172 dollars from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef> upon my order for a note and wages due by me to Jerry
							at the time of his death— He has remitted to <persRef
								ref="leary-michael2">his father</persRef> ten pounds equal to fifty
							dollars, but wrote him that it was of his own money.— He has entered
							upon a book some charges paid and for the expenses of his journey to and
							from Washington when he took out letters of administration, upon which I
							with <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef> became
							his bondsmen— But he knows not how to draw up an administration account,
							and imagines he has much more discretion in the disposal than the Law
							allows him— Among his charges is one of 11. dollars for cloathing for
							his brother Michael, which I told him the judge would certainly not
							allow.— Mary Flynn, claims upwards of forty dollars, for money lent to
							Jerry, 12.50 of which John admits, and of the remainder she has no
							evidence; and there are strong presumptions against the claim— But she
							has given out that she was married to Jerry, and I told her if it was so
							she was entitled to one third of his property but could not claim any
							money lent— I asked her if she had been married to him and she said she
							could not answer that question— She might some time hereafter, but could
							not now— She intimated too that Jerry had a <persRef ref="u"
								>child</persRef> in the Province of New Brunswick, for whom some
							provision from his property ought to be made, and John supposed that
							some claim might hereafter be produced upon some written promise by him
							to pay for the nurture of the child— I find I shall need no small
							circumspection to protect my own responsibility as John’s bondsman upon
							the Letters of Administration— I urged him to make immediately a further
							remittance of twenty pounds to his father: and to make several other
							arrangements for presenting his account of administration to the Orphans
							Court at Washington— These visits and interruptions absorbed all the
							morning. A visit after dinner from <persRef ref="tucker-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard D. Tucker</persRef> detained
							me, and <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks</persRef> after tea spent the Evening here. Charles went to
							hear <persRef ref="palfrey-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Palfrey’s</persRef> closing lecture on the evidences of
							Christianity— Received an invitation to dine with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tucker, next Thursday.</p>
