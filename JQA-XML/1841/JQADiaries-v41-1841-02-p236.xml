						<p>The inflammation of my eye at once disables me for reading or writing,
							and disorders the arrangement of my time and occupations— Still I write
							and read as much as nature will bear— Last evening the shooting pain in
							the eye was so threatening, that I suspended writing on the review of
							the case of the Antelope, and <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> read to me, three despatches from <persRef
								ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist</persRef>, Consul of the United
							States at Havana, dated from September to December 1839 all in defence
							of himself against numerous charges of participating in or conniving at
							the African Slave-trade, so notoriously and so scandalously carried on
							from the Havana— The call upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> for these papers is now beyond the reach of
							reconsideration— The President will not send them for if they shall ever
							be made public they will blast the reputation of this administration
							more than that of Trist— I went this morning to the Capitol, before 11.
							and witnessed the exhibition of the deaf and dumb; and blind, from a
							School in Virginia— The latter constitute a tolerable band of
							instrumental music, and performed passably well several popular airs and
							marches— The performances of the deaf mutes were as I have seen them
							elsewhere— I went into the Supreme Court and saw <persRef
								ref="randolph-richard">Richard K. Randolph</persRef> of
							Rhode-Island, and <persRef ref="birch-james">James H. Birch</persRef> of
							Missouri, admitted and sworn as Attorneys and Counsellors of the Court—
							Met <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> there— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sherwood</persRef> of New-York
							commenced an argument on the New Jersey Oyster case— I went into the
								<persRef ref="carroll-william">Clerk’s</persRef> Office; took the
							Copy of a decree of the Circuit Court of Georgia concerning the costs in
							the case of the Antelope negroes; and called on the Clerk for the first
							record of the case itself— Then returned to the house— <persRef
								ref="holt-hines">Hines Holt</persRef> was sworn as a member from
							Georgia, in the place of <persRef ref="colquitt-walter"
								>Colquitt</persRef>, resigned— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> presented an account from <persRef
								ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef> of Kentucky who
							has been sick at his lodgings this whole Session, and now claims
							allowances for short mileage at previous Session of Congress— The
							Speaker did not like to take upon himself the responsibility of allowing
							it, and submitted it to the house. After some petty discussion it was
							laid on the table— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>
							asked <persRef ref="jones-john9">J. W. Jones</persRef> to allow a short
							time to receive reports from Committees, but he declined— Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union <persRef ref="casey-zadok"
								>Casey</persRef> in the Chair, <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef> made a speech of four hours; bein a stout and
							plausible defence of the Administration—when he finished I went to his
							seat, shook hands with him, and thanked him for his last words and dying
							speech, and told him it was the best speech he ever made— Fillmore made
							another attempt to get the Committee discharged from the Note Bill, and
							failed again— My wife read Trist’s despatches to me the whole Evening
							till near Midnight.</p>

						<p>The inflammation of my eye continues to abate; but from caducity who
							shall recover? I took back to the Department of State this
							morning<space/>despatches from <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P.
								Trist</persRef> Consul of the United States, at the Havana, which
							are included in my call upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> by amendment of that of <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> last Saturday— I enquired if
							there had been any investigation of the charges against Trist, by the
							shipmasters and mariners, as was recommended by the report of the
							Committee of Commerce of the House of Representatives at the close of
							the former Session of this Congress, N. 707. 21. July 1840— <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Secretary Forsyth</persRef> was not at the
							Office, his <persRef ref="martin-jacob">chief Clerk Martin</persRef>
							told me that there had been no executive investigation of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Trist’s conduct since the last Session—
							That <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alexander H. Everett</persRef> had made a confidential report after
							a special mission to Havana upon all the complaints against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Trist in whose hands the report now was,
							for explanations and commentaries. And there was a voluminous Spanish
							judicial record the translation of which was in the hands of <persRef
								ref="dimitry-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dimitry</persRef>, and still to be reported. I found the house in
							Session, and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, having prevailed
							on someone to move a reconsideration, of the Resolution adopted
							yesterday to discharge the Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, from the further consideration of the Treasury Note Bill at 3.
							O’Clock this day— He, Wise had an amendment to propose, that the same
							power conceded to this Administration in the Bill, should be extended to
							the next—to issue an amount of five Millions of dollars to the end of
							the year, and that then the debate should cease, the questions on the
							amendments should be taken, and the Bill reported to the house— Cushing
							rose and inquired, what? without debate? whereupon Wise turned upon him
							like a Tyger, and in the most peremptory terms insisted yes without for
							the resolution to be reconsidered had itself arrested all debate— I
							voted for the reconsideration as I had voted against the suspension, and
							now the whigs voted for the reconsideration and it was carried— Wise
							then offered his amendment, but <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef> withdrew his Resolution— <persRef
								ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> moved to go in to
							Committee of the whole on the Union. Wise then proposed to appeal from
							the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker’s</persRef> decision, that
							Fillmore could withdraw his, Resolution, but the Speaker told him he was
							too late.— He put the question of going into Committee of the whole, and
							called <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef> to the Chair— <persRef

								<persRef ref="alford-julius">Alford</persRef> of Georgia for an hour
							and a half descanted upon all the topics which have been tacked upon
							this bill— Alford let out all his Georgian Bile against the Northern
							Manufacturers, and the Northern interests— I think I shall stand it no
							longer— <persRef ref="shepard-charles">Charles Shepard</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, took the floor—the Committee rose and the house
							adjourned at half past 4— The whole Evening was employed in retrieving
							Diary arrears of the last two days—</p>

						<p>Just as I was going out this morning, <persRef ref="hodgson-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hodgson</persRef> brought me two
							Newspapers in the Spanish language the Noticioso de Ambos Mundos.
							published at New-York—of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 23<hi

								<persRef ref="turnbull-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Turnbull</persRef> as British Consul at the Havana, because he is an

							of Quincy for an appointment of Cadet at West-Point, from next June,
							when <persRef ref="tower-zealous">Zealous B. Tower</persRef> of Cohasset
							is to be graduated— He was recommended by me, and has been at the head
							of his class throughout his whole career.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Poinsett was gone out to the Arsenal to see some exhibition
							of Ordnance; but the chief clerk told me, he would look up the
							recommendation, and this Evening I received the Commission of Cadet W.
							H. Wood— Reaching the Capitol half an hour before the Meeting of the
							house, I went into the <persRef ref="carroll-william">Clerk’s</persRef>
							office of the Supreme Court, and examined a small part of the first
							Record of the Circuit Court in Georgia of the case of the Antelope— The
							claim of the Spanish Vice-Consul at Savannah <persRef
								ref="mulvey-carlos">Mulvey</persRef> filed 1. August 1820. was for
							166 of the Slaves. that of the Portuguese Vice-consul Sorrel was for
							130— On my return to House, I found <persRef ref="shepard-charles"
								>Charles Shepard</persRef> on the floor, discussing the topics of
							the Treasury Note Bill, as a Southern planter for an hour; followed by
								<persRef ref="garland-james">James Garland</persRef> of the same
							interest— I then took my turn for an hour, and arraigned before the
							Committee, the Nation and the World, the principles avowed by <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Henry A Wise</persRef> and his three coloured
							standard of Overseer black, duelling blood red, and dirty cadaverous
							nullification white— Of its effect I will not now speak— I have
							discharged what I believe to be a solemn and sacred duty.— At the close
							of his reply his gang of duelists clap’d their hands and the gallery
							hissed. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef>
							began his usual rhodomontade, but the whole committee was in

						<p>Sleepless Night— The step that I have taken, yesterday absorbs all the
							faculties of my Soul— Deliberately taken, to have any useful effect, it
							must be calmly, firmly, judiciously, perseveringly, alas! skifully,
							pursued— I fear I have estimated too highly its importance— I fear my
							own incompetency to sustain it effectively and successfully— I know not
							what support I shall receive in or out of the house— I stand alone in
							this undertaking. Few if any of my colleagues appear to understand my
							purpose and from their deportment yesterday, I should conclude they
							thought it one of my eccentric, wild, extravagant, freaks of passion—
								<persRef ref="trumbull-joseph">Trumbull</persRef> of Connecticut
							alone came to me after it was over—took me by the hand, and thanked me—
								<persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							at the Department of State with a paper belonging to <persRef

							under other papers— <persRef ref="curtis-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"

							a Resolution that the debate on the Treasury Note Bill should cease at 7
							O’Clock this Evening, he at first proposed 5. but modified it at the
							request of some gentlemen pregnant with eloquence to 7. The house then
							went into Committee of the whole, <persRef ref="casey-zadok"
								>Casey</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W.
								Cost Johnson</persRef> began with a short feeble interrupted Speech,
							followed by some chaffering in which Cushing and Lincoln were at issue,
							and there by a three hours whig speech from <persRef
								ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner</persRef> of North-Carolina—next by two
							hours of vulgar, coarse and silly buffoonery from <persRef
								ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef>— <persRef

							yielded it to <persRef ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> the
							re-instated member from Norfolk Virginia, who swallowed whole the system
							promulgated in Wise’s Speech, and endorsed every word and syllable in
							it— Then <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, who told
							of the Speech which he would have made, but that he had not time— The
							debate finished by a sneer at the little end of the big whig party—in
							the difference between <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>
							and Lincoln. Barnard’s amendment was rejected, Wise’s adopted—the Bill
							was reported, passed to the third reading and passed,—and the house

						<p>I attended at the Hall of the house, half an hour before Noon, the stated

								ref="carroll-william">Clerk of the Supreme Court</persRef>, and read
							several pages more of the Record of the Antelope case in the U.S.
							Circuit Court for the District of Georgia— Returning to the house, they

							to see a <persRef ref="bacon-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bacon</persRef> of New-Haven a brother of the <persRef
								ref="bacon-leonard">Clergyman</persRef> who was here with <persRef
								ref="parker-peter">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker</persRef>,
							and who has lived sometime on the Coast of Africa— I had some
							conversation with him, respecting the manner in which this Slave trade
							is carried on in the interior of Africa itself. He says that they are
							divided into small tribes, each with chiefs wh are called by Europeans,
							kings— That they are constantly at War with each other for the express
							purpose of making Slaves for sale. That the Europeans at the factories
							on the Coast advance money or goods to them with a credit of three, four
							or six months, in which time they are to procure and bring down for
							delivery at the factory a given number of Slaves, and when they deliver
							them they recieve another credit in advance— That great numbers of the
							Slaves by nightly expeditions were taken and their villages were burnt—
							That considerable numbers were sold by judicial sentences for crimes,
							particularly for adultery: an offence for which they are particularly
							sensitive— He says he asked <persRef ref="cinque">Sinqua</persRef> who
							sold him, and he answered the son of his king; whom he Bacon well knew,
							an one of the most active African traders.— While talking with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bacon I lost my name on a call of yeas and
							nays in the house— It was a day for the consideration of private
							business, and the rule of the house is that Bills shall be taken up, in
							Committee of the whole against which there is no objection To the first
							bill brought up in Committee objection was made; and from that time the
							member who had charge of the claim on which that bill was founded made
							objection to every bill that was brought up— Nothing—absolutely nothing
							was done. The Committee rose two or three times, and the house by yeas
							and nays two or three times refused to adjourn. At <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> motion they rescinded the
							rule—took up a bill; debated it half an hour rejected it by yeas and
							nays, received a motion for reconsideration and just after 4. adjourned—
							I dined with <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Braxton’s</persRef> day, and that and the weather had so thin’d the
							hall, that it was piteous to look round on the empty chairs.— It looked
							like the House without a Quorum on weekdays about the hour of dinner.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Braxton entered upon the enclosure of
							the Speaker’s chair, with an old Scotchman, who preached in his stead
							from Acts 13.12. “Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed,
							being astonished, at the doctrine of the Lord.”— This chapter contains
							the narrative of the first going forth of <persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul</persRef> and <persRef ref="barnabas">Barnabas</persRef> to
							preach the gospel to the Gentiles; and of the sorcerer <persRef
								ref="elymas">Elymas</persRef> struck blind at Paphos in the Island
							of Cyprus.— A copious subject, but of which the old Scotch divine made
							not much profitable instruction— The principal merit of his discourse
							was its brevity— The broad Scottish brogue of his pronunciation was
							unpleasant—his personal appearance was not favourably prepossessing, and
							very commonplace Christian morality, formed the texture of the Sermon—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Braxton read the hymn; but there was
							no one to sing, and the whole service barely occupied an hour.— After
							dinner I attended at <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Laurie’s</persRef> Church, expecting to hear <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-cortland">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Rensselaer</persRef> a Son of the <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">Old Patroon</persRef>, who is now partly
							settled in that Church: but there too I found a stranger who preached
							from James 1.13. “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of
							God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
							14— But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and
							enticed 15. Then, when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and
							sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” Whatever may be the
							character of the Sermon, there never fails to be wisdom and virtue in
							the text— There was nothing to be remembered in this preacher’s
							treatment of his text, but there was an inexhaustible fund for
							meditation and improvement in the text itself. He gave notice that the
							communion would be administered this day two weeks, and that the Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
							Rensselaer had been prevented from officiating in the service of this
							day by serious indisposition— Throughout this day as through many that
							have immediately preceded it my mind has been in a state of fearful
							agitation, and my health and spirits suffer with it— Neither of the
							preachers of this day had power to call me from the world to God.—
								<persRef ref="cookman-george">Cookman’s</persRef> admonition to
							bridle my tongue ought to have its practical influence on my conduct— I
							pray that it may have—but I must speak. This day my thoughts have been
							scattered; and I have been looking into <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> for <persRef
								ref="coriolanus-gaius">Coriolanus</persRef> and the Volsces, and for
							the plucking of the red and white roses in the temple Garden, in the
							days of the Plantagenets— I had no time to waste on the arrival last
							Evening at Baltimore last Evening, of <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>William Henry Harrison</persRef>, President elect of the United
							States, nor on the cotemporaneous suspension of specie payments, by the
							Banks of Philadelphia, and Baltimore.</p>

							in Georgia, of the case of the Antelope—but could not reach the first

							Petitions—The only one for several weeks past— The only one for the
							remainder of the Session— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W.
								Jones</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, moved
							to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the

							from the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef>, and
							from <persRef ref="armistead-walker">General Armistead</persRef> asking
							an appropriation of 100000 dollars to buy a surrender of the remaining
							Indians in Florida—and wanted to go into Committee of the whole upon the
							Union for that— Jones told him that he might move it as an amendment to
							his pension bill— I supplicated for this day, for the reception of
							petitions: of which I said I had in my draw, ten of which might possibly
							be received.— I spoke in vain. I called for the yeas and nays which were
							92 and 92. and the Speaker decided to go into Committee of the whole,
							and called <persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> of Maine to
							the Chair— The Pension Appropriation Bill was read— Waddy Thompson then
							moved his appropriation-bill to buy an Indian surrender— <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> objected to it as not in
							order, as it certainly was not, by the 50<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							rule— Clifford was muddily bothering his trickster invention to get over
							this rule, when <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> suggested
							to him the last patch upon the 76<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule;
							he snap’d at it like a mackerel at a red rag, and said the amendment was
							in order— Waddy Thompson made a frothy speech upon the amendment and
							when he had done, I objected that the amendment was not in order—he said
							it was too late; and the debate proceeded.— <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> of Ohio in a speech of
							three hours, opposed the amendment, assuming to prove that the Florida

							Southern Slavery.— He laid down too narrow a basis for his

							proof as he went along to the exquisite torture of the Southern duelists
							and Slave-mongers—Georgians, Carolinians and Virginians.— They
							interrupted him every five minutes by calls to order, and Clifford who
							has neither eyes to see nor a heart to feel what is or is not in order,
							according to his caprice, sometimes sustained and sometimes silenced
							him. When he finished <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A.
								Cooper</persRef> one of the Apostate and dismounted whigs of Georgia
							took the floor and argufied without losing his temper till half past 4.
							when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— I came home and a man

							Minister of Carlisle Middlesex County Massachusetts came complaining
							that his valise had been stolen from him and craving supplies. I
							expected some evidence of his character or of his loss, and he took

								<persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Slade</persRef> was the only other member of the Committee who
							attended, and nothing could be done— The President elect, <persRef

							Citizens, headed by the Mayor of the City, <persRef ref="seaton-william"

							the <persRef ref="carroll-william">Clerk of the Supreme Court</persRef>,
							and read further in the Circuit Court Record of the Antelope case— I
							bespoke a copy of the judge’s decision in the case of the Spanish Vice

							this day— A bill reported by <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> about Steamboat explosions— The rules were
							suspended to postpone till Thursday that Bill, and take up again the
							Pension appropriation Bill with its tack the extra hundred thousand

								ref="cooper-mark">Mark A Cooper</persRef> resumed his Cretan
							labyrinth of argument in answer to <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Giddings</persRef>— Cooper whose ideas are generally false
							conceptions, strained hard to be very severe upon Giddings; but finding
							he could find no malignant sympathy to cheer him, turned at last upon
							me— He said there was an opinion among many that I was insane and did
							not know what I said but it was not so— If I was insane he wished he
							could be bitten by the same dog. There came a loud cry of <hi

								ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> in loud, rapid and
							peremptory tone, said the Gentleman from Georgia is out of order. I rose
							and implored the Chairman and the Committee that they would allow him to
							proceed— Mark saw he was upon a wrong scent, and turned off upon
							another— <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> came to my seat,
							and supplicated me not to reply to him— The appeal was irresistible— I
							pledged my word to Dawson that I would not open my lips upon the Bill—
							Cooper was followed by <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> with
							fourfold malignity and tenfold fury— He raved methodically and read from
							the Philanthropist and the Bible, till he was time after time called to
							order by his own party and by the Chairman, whose decisions were twice
							reversed—once that Black was not in order and once that he was.—
								<persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> at last

							followed, by a more vigorous and plausible, but quite as unjust an

								>Mulvey</persRef> the Spanish Vice Consul— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Carroll the Clerk told me that I was running up a bill
							against my clients by calling for these copies— I was aware of that, but
							I believed it absolutely necessary for a full and fair review of the
							case of the Antelope— Yet I must not overlook the admonition of the
							Clerk— In the house there was a motion of <persRef ref="andrews-landaff"
								>Andrews</persRef> of Kentucky to take the pension and Florida War
							Bill out of Committee of the whole to-morrow at Noon—carried by
							suspension of the rules. There was some struggling to get in petitions,

							in reply nor <persRef ref="alford-julius">Alford</persRef> who affected
							to believe or actually blundered into the belief that Waddy’s insult
							yesterday was hurled at him— The flurry was abridged by the hour of Noon
							when <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> offered a Resolution
							to send a Message to the Senate, that the house were ready to proceed to
							open and count the presidential electoral votes— The Senate immediately

								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> and presided at the
							Meeting—the Speaker being seated at his left. The Tellers <persRef

								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> and <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>John W. Jones</persRef> of the house sat in the front of the
							Clerk’s Table— The Vice President broke the Seals of the returns
							beginning with Maine— Two copies of each, one received by special
							messenger and one by the mail— The three tellers read alternately by the
							returns, which were sum total of votes 294. of which 234 for <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">William Henry Harrison</persRef> of Ohio, and
							60 for <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef> of

							it. He rode with me to the Capitol, and took it with him— I sat to him

							Post-roads, until the meeting of the Committee when we were obliged to
							retire— I went into the Office of the <persRef ref="carroll-william"

							remainder of the Record of the Circuit Court in Georgia in the case of
								<persRef ref="sorrel-francis">Francis Sorrel</persRef>, Vice Consul
							of Portugal against 130 african captives of the Antelope— In the house
							after some petty episodes, the pension appropriation Bill, with its
							Florida-War tack was taken up— <persRef ref="smith-oliver"
								>Smith</persRef> of Indiana who generally deserves the praise of
							silence, broke it now for a very foolish speech of half an hour; and a

							reported to the house, passed to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
							reading and passed— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>
							then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union
							to take up the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— It was carried,

							25000 dollars, for Stationery for the house of Representatives started a
							debate which consumed the remainder of the day, till from mere weariness
							and want of a Quorum, near five O’Clock the Committee rose and the house
							adjourned— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> moved
							to reduce the item to 15000 dollars—and the by-play of the two parties

								<persRef ref="garland-hugh">Hugh A. Garland</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="langtree-samuel">Langtree</persRef> was so scandalous, that the

								>Edmund Burke</persRef>, the very thickest skull of all
							New-Hampshire, Chairman of a Committee of the last Session to whitewash
							the Clerk, performed the work in so bungling a manner—that he now moved

							into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon this Bill,
								<persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in the Chair. The
							Bill had been sent to the Printers.— <persRef ref="french-benjamin"
								>French</persRef> acting Clerk, was about reading the original
							manuscript draught of the Bill— Some pettifogger demanded where was the
							Bill, and upon being told it was at the Printers objected to proceeding
							without the Bill— Up started a debate of an hour, upon the question
							whether a bill could be debated in Committee of the whole or in the
							house upon a manuscript copy— I never knew this question made before—
							The universal practice is to debate any sort of a copy manuscript or
							printed till the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> reading when it must be
							engrossed; no amendments are then admitted, and the question taken is
							upon the engrossed bill— But now nothing would do but the Committee must
							have the bill— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> who
							is recovering from a long and severe indisposition and has returned to

							Bill. Motion after Motion was made to take up other Bills and to rise—
							The Committee did rise once for lack of a Quorum; but returned into
							Committee again as soon as the quorum was ascertained; till at last the
							Bill was brought in from the Printers.— Then another debate was sprung
							upon the amount of the appropriation 50000— 37500 25000. 20000 were
							thought enough by some and the morning hour expired before a question
							could be taken.— <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>

							Steamboat Caroline.—but really an inflammatory invective against the

							by a close party majority of the house laid on the table, and ordered to
							be printed. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> moved an
							amendment, to print documents relating to the burning of the Caroline
							which was rejected. I moved to recommit the report; but the <persRef

						<p>I attended public worship this morning in the Hall of the house of
							Representatives, where <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sawtell</persRef>, who is the Minister of an American Chapel for
							Seamen at Havre delivered a discourse upon the character, virtues,
							vices, and wants of Seamen— It was rather a Lecture than a Sermon, but
							he took for a text Psalm 107.23— [“]They that go down to the Sea in
							ships, that do business in great waters 24. These see the works of the
							Lord, and his wonders in the deep 25. For he commandeth, and raiseth the
							stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 26. They mount up to
							the heaven, they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted
							because of trouble. 27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken
							man, and are their wit’s end. 28. Then they cry unto the Lord in their
							trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 29. He maketh the
							storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still 30. Then are they glad
							because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.”
							The text is a brief and graphic description of a storm at sea; but the
							discourse was a dissertation upon the characteristics of sailors as a
							distinct class of population— Of the causes which most frequently, lead
							men to follow the sea—upon the circumstances into which it throws
							them—upon the influences which it brings to bear upon them upon the
							temptations into which it necessarily throws them; upon the adventurous
							character of their lives, and upon the great influences which they
							exercise in human society.— And especially of their need of religious
							and moral instruction—interspersed with narratives of several affecting
							instances of conversions of sailors to exemplary piety—and righteousness
							of life and conversation. He gave also an account of the establishment
							of the American chapel for Seamen at Havre— Of his own settlement there,
							and of his own Mission now here to raise a sum of 10000 dollars to build
							a chapel there— Of which he said he had already obtained in this Country
							subscriptions to the amount of 8000.— The whole discourse was listened
							to with great interest by a full but not overflowing auditory.—
							Returning home I was first startled by the ringing of bells for fire—
							They soon stop’d and I then met <persRef ref="harrison-william">General
								Harrison </persRef>returning from church. He said he had received a
							note from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, inviting him to an evening party on
							the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>,

						<p>At 10 this morning I went to the Capitol, and gave a sitting of an hour
							to <persRef ref="lambdin-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lambdin</persRef> in the Committee room of the Committee of
							Post-Offices and Post-roads.— He asked me for another sitting to-morrow
							if practicable— In the house, <persRef ref="turney-hopkins"
								>Turney</persRef> of Tennessee obtained a suspension of the rules,
							to pass a bill about Tennessee Land titles, opposed by <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> and almost the whole
							North-Carolina delegation as injurious to the rights of that State— But
							several of the Tennessee members of both sides went round the house
							while the votes by yeas and nays were taken, begging their fellow
							partizans as a special favour, to help them push through the bill, and
							it was carried by a large majority. <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Stanly</persRef> asking to be excused from voting, unwilling to
							decide between his Tennessee whig friends, and his colleague Williams.
							The Bill was driven through by the previous question— It was the day for
							the presentation of Resolutions; and I had one, concerning an
							unconstitutional act of the Legislature of South-Carolina, ready— But
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> moved to go into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the civil
							and diplomatic appropriation bill, which was done, <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee in the chair Two small
							amendments were proposed by <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> and were
							adopted— <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Landaff W. Andrews</persRef> of
							Kentucky moved to strike out an appropriation of 1500 dollars for
							compensation to a Secretary to the President to sign Land patents—whence
							a debate in which <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> as a member of the Committee of public Lands
							brought to light two facts— 1. That for several years past none of the
							Land patents have been executed according to Law— And 2. that there are
							now at the Land Office 60,000 patents unsigned because of a question
							between the Commissioner and Recorder, which of the two should sign
							them. I entered with some indignation into this debate; but opposed the
							striking out of the appropriation.— Andrews finally withdrew his motion
							to strike out— <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef>
							moved to strike out a 1000 dollar clerk of the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> auditor, and after much criminative and recriminative
							debate—till this motion too was withdrawn— While it was under
							discussion, I went into the Supreme Court room, where I found <persRef
								ref="walker-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker</persRef>
							a Senator from Mississippi arguing a question, on the Constitutional
							right of the State of Mississippi, to prohibit the importation of Slaves
							into the State as Merchandize. He closed an argument of two days—but the
							case I was told would probably take two or three days more— The case of
							the Amistad will follow next. I went into the <persRef
								ref="carroll-william">Clerk’s</persRef> Office, and read the
								<persRef ref="johnson-william">late judge Johnson’s</persRef> first
							decision in the Circuit Court for the eighth District (Georgia) in the

							went into the Supreme Court, and heard the argument of <persRef

								Webster</persRef> on the second Mississippi Slavery case; and the
							closing argument of <persRef ref="walker-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker threatened tremendous

							which consequences sounded to me like argument for the constitutional

						<p>The arrangements had been made for the funeral of my poor, humble, but
							excellent friend <persRef ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy Leary</persRef> at
							3. O’Clock this afternoon. I walked to the Capitol this morning, with a
							Spirit humbled to the dust; with a heart melted in sorrow, and a mind,
							agitated, and confused— The case of the Amistad captives, had been fixed
							to commence in the Supreme Court this morning— I asked <persRef
								ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef>
							if he could consent to apply to the Court to postpone the case until
							Monday. But he said that he was under a necessity of returning home as
							soon as possible to attend State Courts about to be in Session— I
							therefore as soon as the court was opened and the case was called
							requested as a personal favour of the Court to suspend the proceedings
							in this case from 2. O’Clock P.M. this day, till Monday; to which
								<persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief Justice Taney</persRef>
							answered “certainly.”— We had supposed that upon the motion to dismiss
							the case, the opening and closing would have been with us, but on
							submission of the question to the court the Chief Justice said that the
							question of Jurisdiction being blended with the merits of the cause the
							opening and closing would be with the <persRef ref="gilpin-henry"
								>Attorney General</persRef> upon the appeal from the Circuit Court—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilpin therefore the Attorney General
							commenced and occupied three hours from 11 to 2 in making a statement of
							the facts, beginning with the register of the Amistad, in 1838. and
							ending with the appeal by the <persRef ref="holabird-william">District
								Attorney Holabird</persRef> from the sentence of the Circuit Court
							U.S. in Connecticut 29. April 1840— He read most of the proceedings from
							the printed record and from the Amistad Document H.R.U.S— N. 185 of the
							last Session of Congress and from the supplementary manuscript record
							obtained at my motion by certiorari— The Court then adjourned to Monday
							Morning— I went for 5 minutes into the house of Representatives where I
							found <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Sergeant</persRef> addressing with great animation the Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Bell</persRef> in the Chair, against the proposed proviso in the
							general appropriation Bill, to limit the compensation fees of the U.S
							Clerks of Courts, District Attornies and Marshals— I went over to
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Causten’s</persRef>
							to see <persRef ref="causten-john">John</persRef>, but they told me he
							was much better and was gone to his mother’s— I then walked home, dined,
							and at 4. p.m. walked in procession to the New Roman Catholic Church of
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Matthew’s, where the funeral service
							was performed by the <persRef ref="donelan-john">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Donelan</persRef> over the remains of my unfortunate assistant
							Jeremy Leary— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>
							and <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Smith</persRef> attended also at the service— The
							procession consisted chiefly of the members of the Roman Catholic
							temperance association of which he was a member— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Donelan delivered a short discourse from Book of Wisdom
							4.11. “Yea speedily was he taken away lest that wickedness should alter
							his understanding or deceit beguile his Soul.[”] He was then interred in

						<p>I attended public worship, with my granddaughter <persRef

							Presbyterian Church, and heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> from Luke 14.22. [“]And
							the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there
							is room.” The parable of the great supper— It was communion day; but the
							attendance was very thin—not fifty persons and less than half that
							number of communicants—chiefly women— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wood was really pathetic on the words “and yet there is room.” <persRef
								ref="boyle-robert">Boyle</persRef> wrote a whole volume upon
							intolerance from the words “compel them to come in[”]— The different
							views that may be taken of the same text of Scripture testify but the
							riches and the poverty of the human mind— My Spirit was deeply
							afflicted. I would have communicated with them, but they decline
							communicating with all not orthodox in their doctrine of the Trinity—
								<persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas B. J. Frye</persRef> was here a
							few minutes before dinner— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t</hi> John’s Church the Evening prayer for Quinquagesima, or the
							Sunday before Lent was read by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Morgan</persRef> a young Clergyman from England, who
							preached a pleasing Sermon from Hebrews 12.22. “and to an innumerable
							company of Angels.[”]— The doctrine of the Christian dispensation
							concerning Angels, is mysterious, cheering, and awful— Ministering
							Spirits, Messengers of weal and wo, numberless, graduated in
							hierarchies— Cherubim, Seraphim Archangels, Guardians of kingdoms, and
							of individuals—their nature, their employment, their abode, are all
							inexplicable to human intelligence, and yet all within the aspirations
							of human curiosity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morgan’s sermon was
							an industrious assemblage of multitudes of passages, in both the old and
							new Testament illustrative of the character and agency of these
							supernatural inhabitants of the spiritual world. When I reflected upon
							them I was almost tempted to address them in prayer— Meditative devotion
							as it kindles is apt to mislead the judgment, but my impending duties
							brought me again down to the earth. At the last hour I was yet to
							prepare a frame for my argument on the case of the Amistad Captives— I
							must accommodate my plan of extemporaneous discourse to that of the
								<persRef ref="gilpin-henry">Attorney General</persRef> scarcely yet
							unfolded and much also to my colleague’s argument which is yet to come—
							I began this evening an index to the Documents that I am to review, that
							I may follow some order in extemporising upon them— Of all that I have
							written 9 tenths are waste paper.</p>

							for information concerning which I referred him to <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>— I walked to the

							delivered his argument in the case of the Amistad Captives— It occupied
							two hours—and after a summary statement of the facts as developed in the
							documents from which he had copiously read on Saturday, he contended
							that the Amistad was a regularly documented Spanish Schooner employed in
							the coasting trade, between the different ports of the Island of Cuba—
							That the Passports of the passengers were regularly signed by the
							Governor General of Cuba and proved beyond all controversy that the
							blacks were the property of <persRef ref="ruiz-jose">Ruiz</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="montes-pedro">Montez</persRef>— That the Court, by the
							Comity of Nations could not go behind or enquire into the validity of
							these documents, for which he cited many authorities in the Law books.—
							He attempted no argument to show that the right of property remained
							unimpaired by the insurrection, and insisted that all the negroes ought
							to be restored to their owners, and that the Circuit Court erred in
							pronouncing the negroes free— <persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi

						<p>With increasing agitation of mind, now little short of agony I rode in a
							hack to the Capitol, taking with me in confused order a number of books
							which I may have occasion to use— The very skeleton of my argument is
							not yet put together— When the Court met, <persRef ref="wayne-james"
								>Judge Wayne</persRef>, and <persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge
								Story</persRef>, read in succession two decisions of the Court, and
								<persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> occupied the remainder of the day four hours in
							closing his argument in behalf of the Amistad Captives, and in the
							support of the decision of the District and Circuit Courts. The point
							upon which he dwelt with most emphatic earnestness was the motion to
							dismiss the appeal of the United States, on the contest of their right
							to appear as parties in the cause they having no interest therein— His
							reasoning therein was powerful, and perhaps conclusive— But I am
							apprehensive there are precedents, and an executive influence operating
							upon the Court, which will turn the balance against us on that point. In
							commenting upon the insurrection of the blacks, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baldwin firmly maintained their right of self-emancipation,
							but spoke in cautious terms to avoid exciting Southern passions and
							prejudices, which it is our policy as much as possible to asswage and
							pacify— When he came to the point of questioning the validity of the
								<persRef ref="ezpeleta-enrile">Governor General’s</persRef> Ladino
							Passports, he left a good deal still to be said— He closed at half past
							3. and left the day open for me to-morrow I went into the Congress
							Library, and took out for use the 37<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							volume of <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> register
							containing the speech of <persRef ref="madison-james">James

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brockway</persRef>, I enquired of him

						<p>Morning snow, which powdered the face of the earth; and cleared away

								Adams</persRef> came afterwards— I was busied in preparation in the

							till the moment when I rose, and then my Spirit did not sink within me—
							With grateful heart for aid from above, though in humiliation for the
							weakness incident to the limits of my powers, I spoke four hours and a
							half, with sufficient method and order to witness little flagging of
							attention, by the judges or the auditory; till at half past 3. O’Clock,
							when the Chief Justice said the Court would hear me further to-morrow—
								<persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> mentioned that he would stay and hear me
							to-morrow, but that he should be obliged to leave the City on Friday to
							return home. The structure of my argument so far as I have yet proceeded
							is perfectly simple and comprehensive—needing no artificial division
							into distinct points, but admitting the steady and undeviating pursuit
							of one fundimental principle, the ministration of <hi rend="italic"
								>Justice</hi>— I then assigned my reason for invoking <hi
								rend="italic">Justice</hi>, specially, aware that this was <hi
								rend="italic">always</hi> the duty of the court; but because an
							immense array of power, the executive administration, instigated by the
							Minister of a foreign Nation has been brought to bear in this case on
							the side of <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi>— I then commenced a review
							of the Correspondence between the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary
								of State</persRef>, and the Spanish Ministers <persRef
								ref="calderon-angel">Calderon</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="deargaiz-pedro">Argaiz</persRef>, which I analyzed with

							nor with a tenth part of the vigour which I would have applied had they
							been at my command— I did not I could not answer public expectation—but
							I have not yet utterly failed— God speed me to the end. After the
							adjournment of the Court, I went for a few minutes into the house, but
							they were yet in recess— I rode home with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Smith and Elizabeth C. Adams at 4. <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2"

						<p>The agitation of mind under which I have been labouring for weeks had

								>General Dearborn</persRef> called on me immediately after

							of an orphan school near Baltimore, established by himself, came for a
							contribution— I went with <persRef ref="leary-john">John Leary</persRef>
							to the <persRef ref="causin-nathaniel">judge of the Orphan’s Court
								Causten</persRef>, to apply for a Letter of Administration for him
							on the goods and effects of his deceased brother Jeremy— The judge
							required him to execute a bond with two sureties, with a penalty of 500
							dollars, before the Letter of Administration could be delivered to him—
							He then executed the bond which I signed with him as one of the
							sureties. I proposed to ask <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> to sign as the
							other— I took this opportunity also to write a Letter to the judge,
							declining to accept the trust, as Co-executor with <persRef
								ref="smith-richard4">Richard Smith</persRef>, of the last Will and
							Testament of <persRef ref="hay-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Elizabeth Kortwright Hay</persRef>, who died last year at Paris,
							leaving this Will— And then I went to the Office of the <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Mayor W. W. Seaton</persRef>, and answered
							certain interrogatories of <persRef ref="mayo-robert">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Mayo</persRef>, concerning, a
							suit for Slander brought by him against <persRef ref="blair-francis"
								>Blair</persRef> and <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef>,
							publishers of the Globe— D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Mayo had sent
							me three interrogatories, the first two of which I declined answering,
							as they were of opinions and not of facts— I answered the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> which was of the manner in which he had
							become possessed of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson’s</persRef> confidential Letter to <persRef
								ref="fulton-william">Fulton</persRef> the Secretary of the Territory
							of Arkansas of the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of December 1830, as
							stated by himself to me, when he communicated the Letter to me— Young
								<persRef ref="brent-robert">Robert Brent</persRef> was there as the
							Doctor’s Lawyer, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rives of the Globe,
							with <persRef ref="hoban-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hoban</persRef> a lawyer.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton
							swore me upon the book— It was one O’Clock when I reached the house, and
							I found them in a snarl between <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn
								Banks</persRef> who had offered a Resolution to adjourn from 3 to 4.
							O’Clock to attend the funeral of <persRef ref="barbour-philip">judge
								Barbour</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> who
							opposed it because the same respect had not been shewn to <persRef
								ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef>. The Resolution
							was however carried— I attended the funeral obsequies, performed in the
							room of the Supreme Court by the Chaplains of the two houses of
							Congress, <persRef ref="braxton-thomas">Braxton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cookman-george">Cookman</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef>, and all the
							members of his Cabinet were there The Senate in a body—but very few
							members of the House, and excepting the <persRef ref="gilpin-henry"
								>Attorney General</persRef>, the only Member of the Bar that I saw
							there was <persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter Jones</persRef> with whom
							and <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, I rode part of the way to the
							Eastern Branch Cemetery, and then returned to the Capitol, where at 4.
							O’Clock the house met again— At 5. I came home, and then went and dined
							with <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel

								Smith</persRef> went with me this morning to the Office of Register
							of Wills at the City Hall, and signed the Administration bond of
								<persRef ref="leary-john">John Leary</persRef>, to administer the
							goods and effects of his deceased brother <persRef ref="leary-jeremy"
								>Jeremy</persRef>. I attended the morning sitting of the house of
							Representatives; but the impending remnant of my duty to the cause of
							the Amistad captives, before the Supreme Court next Monday the
							obligation of enabling John Leary to perform the last duties of kindness
							and affection to his ill-fated brother, and the confusion incident
							always to the last days of a session of Congress, aggravated by the
							crowds of candidates for Office under the embryo dynasty maturing for
							birth, and who throng the floors and lobbies of both houses of Congress,
							altogether absorb my faculties, and distract my attention from the
							business of the house, that I scarcely know what it is.— The naval
							appropriation was increased from short of a Million and a half to two
							Millions, by a vigorous effort of <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett"
								>Saltonstall</persRef>, <persRef ref="reed-john">John
							Reed</persRef>, and <persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef>;
							feebly resisted by the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means;
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>.— Slavery is
							already hurling thunderbolts at the <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>President-elect</persRef> and the Northern portion of his cabinet—
								<persRef ref="granger-francis">Francis Granger</persRef> who is to
							be the Postmaster General, is violently assailed for abolitionism— He
							took me aside this morning, and assured me that there was not a man
							living, whose good opinion he would be more unwilling to forfeit than
							mine. He attempted an explanation of a statement in the Richmond whig
							concerning the slave question between New-York and Virginia, which
							considering what he had said to me on the subject had almost surprized
							me— His explanation was by no means satisfactory, but he said he should
							ultimately be justified.— I asked <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> for some Spanish history which he promised me,
							but he was immediately after called to the Chair of the Committee of the
							whole on the State of the Union upon the army appropriation Bill, and
							was there till the recess— I then rode home, stopping at the National
							Intelligencer Office, and leaving there with <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Seaton</persRef>, a list of the Petitions, not presented by me since the
								21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January, the last day upon
							which petitions have been received by the house; which I requested him
							and which he promised to publish— He and <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> both told me
							that they had <persRef ref="wheeler-henry">Wheeler’s</persRef> report of
							my reply to <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and would publish
							it early next week— After dinner <persRef ref="pendergast-jeremiah"
								>Jeremiah Pendergast</persRef> and <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas"
								>Thomas Dumphy</persRef> Made by warrant from the judge of the
							Orphan’s Court an inventory and appraizement of the effects of Jeremy
							Leary to be returned on Monday to the Court—amounting to 472 dollars 31
							cents. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S. Smith did all the writing—
							The whole was delivered to John Leary the Administrator, to whom I gave
							an order upon my son for 172 dollars— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary
								Cutts</persRef> took tea here, and her brother <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard2">Richard</persRef> came for her in the
							Evening—</p>

						</list>
						<p>I rode with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> to the Capitol, where the
							Hall of the House of Representatives was so excessively crowded that it
							was with extreme difficulty that we were enabled to obtain seats— The
							Chaplains of both houses, were in enclosure where the Speaker’s chair is
							usually placed but whence it was now removed into the platform of the
							Clerk’s table. <persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman</persRef> preached a
							farewell Sermon, from Revelation 20.11. “And I saw a great white throne,
							and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled
							away; and there was found no place for them. 12. And I saw the dead,
							small and great, stand before God: and the books were opened; and
							another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were
							judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to
							their works— 13. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and
							death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were
							judged every man according to their works.” A discourse upon the day of
							judgment— It appeared to me, that the subject was above the powers of
							the Speaker—perhaps above the powers of mortal man—but it was listened
							to with deep attention, from beginning to end. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Cookman closed with a farewell address to the members of
							both houses of Congress and then to the Citizens of Washington— He
							should be hereafter stationed by the Methodist conference which three
							years ago had stationed him here—at a distant place— That he was going
							now very shortly to the land of his nativity, England to visit an <persRef ref="cookman-george2">aged
								father</persRef>, and the grave of a <persRef ref="cookman-mary">dearly beloved mother</persRef>, and after six Months
							he should return to this his adopted country where thenceforth he
							intended to live and to die, and for whose prosperity and happiness,
							whether absent or present he should never cease to offer up daily
							prayers to heaven. This part of the discourse was quite pathetic, and
							drew forth sundry white handkerchiefs among the Ladies.— There was a
							small choir of singers in the front galleries who sung the hymns— <persRef ref="braxton-thomas">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Braxton</persRef> made the prayers after the Sermon.
							I took leave of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman, at the outer
							door of the House of Representatives, wishing him all prosperity and
							happiness.— His ministration has been pleasant and I hope useful to me—
							I parted from the Ladies and walked home, stopping on my way, at
							<persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> hotel to visit <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott;lawrence-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef> who are here with <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine2">their
									daughter</persRef> and a <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott2">young son</persRef>— I met there <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>, and a young man
							named <persRef ref="u">Cutts</persRef>, keeper of the documents of the house. <persRef ref="wool-john">General Wool</persRef> came in
							while I was there— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church, there were two clergymen, with <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley</persRef>. <persRef ref="parker-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker</persRef> who read the
							Evening service for the first Sunday in Lent, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis</persRef> of New-York, who preached from
							Psalm 8.3. [“]When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the
							moon and the stars which thou hast ordained; 4. What is man, that thou
							art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?” Evening
							past in preparation for to-morrow—</p>
