						<dateline>Washington Friday 1. January 1841.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. V. </date>Friday.— </p>
						<p>About seventy Visitors.</p>
						<p>A new years day, congenial to the season—of Snow, hail and sleet from
							morn to eve—the consequence of which was, that I was confined the whole
							day to the house, and that our annual visitors, usually numbering at
							least two hundred, scarcely amounted to seventy— Most of them were
							members of Congress; some of them with their wives and daughters; and
							they came after the usual visitation to the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President of the United States</persRef> at
							the white house. The numbers there were also much reduced from those
							customary on the occasion, and consisted chiefly of the whigs—the
							President’s adversaries— His own party deserted him.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>“Donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos</l>
							<l>Tempora, si fuerint nubila, solus eris.[”]</l>
						</lg>
						<p>there is perhaps no occurrence in human affairs which more uniformly
							exemplifies this propensity of human nature, than the exit of a
							President of the United States from Office than this.— Among my visitors
							this day, were the late Governor of Pennsylvania, and <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">George Bancroft</persRef>, the collector of
							the Port of Boston, men who in different ways have taken prominent part
							in the political struggles of the time, and have experienced great
							vicissitudes of popular favour— <persRef ref="ritner-joseph">Joseph
								Ritner</persRef> was elected Governor of Pennsylvania, by the
							prevalence of Antimasonry in 1836. He lost the election in 1839. By the
							anarchy of Jacksonism, and the mob law of Harrisburg— Last November he
							was chosen an Elector of President and Vice President of the United
							States, for the State of Pennsylvania, and with his colleagues gave the
							vote of the State to <persRef ref="harrison-william">William Henry
								Harrison</persRef>, for President and <persRef ref="tyler-john">John
								Tyler</persRef> as Vice-President— George Bancroft, son of an
								<persRef ref="bancroft-aaron">eminent high toned, federal unitarian
								clergyman at Worcester</persRef>—educated for a preacher of the
							gospel—then teacher of the Roundhill academy at Northampton—till within
							five years a fiery fever heated federalist, suddenly turned into a
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> Kinderhook democrat,
							and now collector of the customs at the port of Boston, and pattern
							traveller of the Kitchen cabinet strolling about the country and doling
							out lectures on the omnipotence of democracy— He comes to visit me on
							the New-Years day, and to drivel out flattery by the gallon. <persRef
								ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac E. Holmes</persRef> of Charleston South
							Carolina, to demonstrate his chivalry in setting aside all party
							feelings one day in the year.— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had the face to say to
							the President that nothing but his devotion to <hi rend="italic"
								>him</hi> could have induced him to come out from his lodgings on
							such a day as this— Clay crows too much over a fallen foe. I have no
							time even to meditate as usual on the close of one year and the opening
							of another on the blessings and trials of the past and on the prospects
							and duties of the future— The year just expired has been full of
							gracious providences calling for the deepest gratitude, and of warnings
							which I have not sufficiently regarded— May I be wiser in the time to
							come.— What I most want is firmness to rule my own Spirit, and to resist
							with cool composure influences from abroad— I took up for a couple of
							hours this Evening the case of the Amistad captives.</p>

						<p>A fair day, but cold— These are visitors who were prevented from calling
							yesterday, by the weather. <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> came alone, and I had a long conversation with him
							on the present state and prospective movements of parties— The Governor
							gave me to understand that he knew <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef> was to be <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>Harrison’s</persRef> Secretary of State, but left it rather
							uncertain whether he had it from himself, or from good authority— He
							said <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stephen C. Phillips</persRef> had told him he had it directly from
							Webster.— I asked him whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had
							consulted or communicated with him concerning any measures which were to
							indicate the principles upon which the administration would be
							conducted— He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had once
							commenced a conversation with him, in which he had answered some
							enquiries, by assurances that all would be right—that the expectations
							of the friends of General Harrison would be gratified, but that he had
							not then time to enter into details and thus avoided all specification.
							I enquired if he knew who was to be the Secretary of the Treasury and
							whether <persRef ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="stevens-thaddeus">Thaddeus Stevens</persRef> was to be the
							representative of Pennsylvania, in the new administration— He did not
							know— He had attended several meetings of the whig members, for
							consultation and comparison of opinions; but had found so much
							dissension among them, that he had ceased to attend the meetings. He had
							heard at the commencement of the Session, much and loud interest among
							the Pennsylvanians, in the appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sergeant to the Treasury—but within the last fortnight all this has been
							hushed, and he had not heard even the name of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Sergeant mentioned— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thaddeus
							Stevens is now here, and has been for some days, and there is much said
							of his claims to notice and distinction from General Harrison and his
							friends—and there seems to be an effort from the Western part of
							Pennsylvania, for the exclusion of Sergeant from the Harrison Cabinet. I
							said that Sergeant was an old and intimate friend of mine—a very able,
							and very honest, though a timid politician— That I should be glad to see
							him at the head of the Treasury Department; and at this moment I
							supposed the fact of his appointment or exclusion, would disclose the
							policy of the Harrison Administration for, or against a national Bank— I
							had also some conversation but not of much import, with <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Saltonstall</persRef>— I dined with my neighbour <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel D.
								Barnard</persRef>, member of the house of Representatives from the
							Albany District of New-York— <persRef ref="barnard-catharine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Barnard</persRef>, his daughter by
								<persRef ref="barnard-sarah">his first wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="barnard-cora">Cora</persRef>, and his little daughter by his
							present wife, <persRef ref="barnard-sarah2">Sarah</persRef> were there.
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">Major General Winfield
							Scott</persRef>, <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Daniel Jenifer</persRef>,
							member from Maryland, and <persRef ref="dawson-william">William Crosby
								Dawson</persRef> member from Georgia, and nominated candidate for
							Governor of that State were the company, and it was more of Schoolboys
							in the Holidays, than of Military commanders and grey-bearded Statesmen—
							The motto of the meeting was <persRef ref="swift-jonathan"
								>Swifts</persRef> Vive la bagatelle— I came home before 8. p.m.</p>

						<p>Attended morning worship at the Capitol, with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>— The Chaplains of the two
							houses were both present. <persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman</persRef> preached, from
							Revelation 21.5. first clause of the verse: “And he, that sat upon the
							throne said, Behold, I make all things new.” A New-Year’s
							discourse—begun with general remarks upon the irresistible charm of
							novelty to all mankind—illustrated not only by the character ascribed in
							Scripture to the Athenians at the time of the preaching of <persRef
								ref="paul">Paul</persRef>, but by the history of mankind in all
							ages, and by our own experience and consciousness—the passion for
							novelty being felt by us all from the highest concerns of life down to
							the mere fashions of wearing apparel, so that we are almost ashamed to
							be seen in a dress which but six months before was the very pink of the
							fashion— Then he said that all the books of the world together contained
							not a hundredth part of matter, gratifying to the passion for novelty,
							as was in the Bible— I thought it whimsical that the oldest book in the
							world should be cited for its transcendant novelty; but the position was
							maintained in the sense in which the preacher had taken it, with equal
							ingenuity and energy— All the miracles recorded in the Bible are
							novelties— The creation of the world is the greatest of all novelties,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman after reading the first four
							verses of the book of Genesis fell into a trance of extasy, at the
							speaking into existence of light— Then he quoted some of the prophetic
							sublimities of <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>; and one from
								<persRef ref="habakkuk">Habakkuk</persRef>. Then he passed to the
							New Testament—to the lowly birth of the Saviour, solemnized by the songs
							of angels—to the preaching of the gospel to the poor. To the selection
							of Apostles from fishermen, from publicans, from a bigoted and
							persecuting pharisee— Then to the triumphs of the cross and the
							overthrow of the whole heathen mythology, by the crucifixion of Jesus.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman finished with a rhapsody upon
							the progressive improvement of the condition of mankind, and
							congratulated somewhat indiscreetly his auditory, upon the political
							conversions effected within the last six Months, by the addresses of
							many of the most distinguished men of this Country to popular
							assemblies. He concluded by a direct address to the members of both
							houses of Congress, of whom there might be 20 present, wishing them all
							happiness and prosperity for this, and many succeeding years— Mary Cutts
							was here before dinner— Evening service at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church. <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the
							second Sunday after Christmas—and preached very briefly upon 2.
							Corinthians 4.17. “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
							worketh for us, a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory.”
							Evening so cold that I could not write— I was obliged to employ it in
							reading, and nearly read through the record prepared for the Supreme
							Court in the case of the Amistad Negroes.</p>

								<persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef>, was referred to the

							received— Two for rescinding the gag-rule— I moved the reference of each
							of them to a select Committee with instructions to report a Resolution
							to rescind the rule— <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef> in
							each case moved to lay on the table—and they were laid on the table— Two

							Committee on the judiciary; the Chairman of which <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef> has been here scarcely
							3. days since the commencement of the Session— The Committees were
							called for Reports— <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef> ungraciously
							consented that I should present the report which I had prepared on the
							falsified document N. 185. which I accordingly did present— It concluded
							with a motion that the Committee should be discharged from the further
							consideration of the subject which was adopted, and the report and
							testimony were laid on the table, and ordered to be printed— After the
							reports of Committees, <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. D. Barnard’s</persRef> Resolution
							for a call on the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, relating to the state of the finances came up—
							It was already long and he lengthened it by a modification— He had
							spoken less than half an hour, and was proving the smaller blunders in
							the report of the Secretary, when a Message from the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> came in— <persRef
								ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef> immediately began to
							bustle and wriggle about the house to get at the message. He finally
							moved to proceed to the orders of the day which was carried by yeas and
							nays, 79 to 62. The message contained a sharp correspondence between the
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of State</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="fox-henry3">British Minister Fox</persRef>, which
							kindled a faggot flame in the house: it burnt fiercely for upwards of an
							hour, and ended by a reference to the Committee of foreign relations of
							the message— The remarkable part of this affair is the tone assumed by
							Fox at this time— Immediately after the reference of the Message the
							house at 20 minutes past 3. adjourned— While we were at dinner a man
							named <persRef ref="piggot-robert">Piggot</persRef> came with a project
							of some patent invention, for compendious teaching of Arithmetic, for
							which he wanted my subscription, and recommendation— I read his paper,

								Martin</persRef>, chief clerk in the Department of State came this
							morning, to say that there would yet be some days before the answer
							could be transmitted to the call for documents relating to our
							intercourse with China— The Message received some days since from the
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> was in answer to
							another Call— I met the Committee of manufactures this morning at half

								<persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef>. There was a long
							discussion upon the expediency of reporting the remainder of the bill to
							secure more effectively the collection of the revenue, lost at the heel
							of the last Session, that is the additional bill, which the Senate
							tacked upon the one which had passed the house— Tillinghast proposed and
							urged it upon various considerations— Davis of Pennsylvania, who at the
							last Session struck with palsy all action of the Committee and of the
							house in favour of the manufactures and lost his election for this
							subserviency to the Southern policy was now quite obstreperous for this
							revision of the Tariff at this time— Slade rather inclined to report the
							Senatorial revenue splice upon our bill, but wished to amend it, and
							make it more intelligible— Nisbet was utterly against reporting the bill
							at all, and so was I—he moved to lay the whole subject on the table for
							the remainder of the Session. After much debate it was agreed to
							postpone the further consideration of the subject for the present; and I
							gave notice of my intention to move again the resolution, which I lost
							in Committee at the last Session. The Letter from the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to me, with
							five enclosures was read, and two or three references from the house—and
							the Committee adjourned to next Tuesday morning, at half past ten. In
							the house <persRef ref="morris-calvary">Calvary Morris</persRef> offered
							a Resolution for a Committee of enquiry into the condition of Lunatics
							in the district of Columbia. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost
								Johnson</persRef> Chairman of the Committee on the District said
							they had a Bill ready prepared on the subject, and on which he should
							invoke the early action of the house—upon which Morris withdrew his
							motion— The special order of the day was the contested election for the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> congressional district of
							Pennsylvania— <persRef ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef> moved that
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>
							should be heard at the bar of the house in support of his petition, as
							well as the sitting member, whereupon a long and very unprofitable
							debate arose on sundry questions, how and upon what points Ingersoll
							should be heard. He was at last admitted without limitation, and
							addressed the house till 3. O’Clock when they adjourned— I went into the
							Office of the <persRef ref="carroll-william">Clerk of the Supreme
								Court</persRef> and looked at the Manuscript copy of the record in
							the Amistad captives case— The printed copy is full of errors. This
							evening I had a visit from <persRef ref="hackett-james">M<hi

							with whom I had a pleasant conversation upon some of the characters and

						<p>January thaw— Rain. Slushy Streets—</p>
						<p>A boy came from the Globe Office this morning with the copy of my report,
							made by a Clerk in the Office of the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk
								of the house</persRef>, in the case of the falsified document N. 185
							and sent to the Globe Office to be printed— There was a mark in red
							pencil under the letter o. in the word Ladino in the second
							specification of variance from the manuscript in the printed
							document—the boys enquiry was whether the word at this place in the
							manuscript report should not be Ladina. I took the paper to the capitol
							and on comparing it with the manuscript from the Department of State
							found the word was Ladina—wrote with a black pencil on the paper that it
							should be so and gave the paper to <persRef ref="berry-brooke">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Berry</persRef> of the Clerks Office,
							to be sent immediately back to the printing Office— The whole of these
							transactions goes to prove the extreme difficulty and yet the extreme
							importance of printing, and of copying manuscript correctly—especially
							of public documents— It teaches a prudent man to be vigilant for the
							detection of errors, and a candid man to be distrustful of his own
							suspicions in the imputation of motives— I have discovered several
							errors, of translation of copying and of printing, in these documents,
							and especially both in the manuscript record transmitted from the
							circuit to the Supreme Court and in the printed copy of it— I went in to
							the Library and borrowed the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="peters-richard2">Peters’s</persRef> Reports, a Volume
							of the Laws of New-York, containing the Constitution of the State and
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> Notes on
							Virginia— In the house, <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W.
								Jones</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
							reported the army appropriation Bill— I enquired when the civil, and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill might be expected—he said within the 30
							days from the time of the appointment of the Committee allowed by the
							rule. There was a report from a select Committee about the breaking down
							of the chandelier—that no person was to blame—that it must be paid for,
							and the wreck taken in part payment by the makers. <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> by suspension of
							the rules obtained leave to bring up his Bill for transporting the
							Lunatics of the District to Baltimore— Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> in the Chair— Johnson
							had drawn his Bill so carelessly and drove it along so stubbornly and
							heedlessly that he lost it at the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							reading by yeas and nays. 72 to 82. A motion for reconsideration was
							immediately made by <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fillmore</persRef> to re-instate the
							Bill and limit its duration to two years; but the orders of the day were
							called, and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> resumed his speech
							against the election of <persRef ref="naylor-charles">Charles
								Naylor</persRef> and in favour of his own— He closed about 3.
							O’Clock and Naylor rose and addressed the <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef>. The house immediately adjourned— I rode home,
							and spent the Evening in writing— Oppressed with trivial researches—</p>

						<p><persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Ness</persRef> called upon me this morning and spoke of his argument
							before the Supreme Court of the State of Vermont in the case of <persRef
								ref="holmes-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef>
							the Canadian Murderer. I had enquired of <persRef ref="slade-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Slade</persRef> whether he
							could furnish me the argument of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Ness
							on this case before the Supreme Court of Vermont. He said he would ask
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Ness himself for it, he being
							here. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Ness now told me that he had
							not a copy of it at hand, but observed that he had sent one to <persRef
								ref="fletcher-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac
								Fletcher</persRef> a member of the house from Vermont, for me, last
							Summer, which is true—but I have mislaid it. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Van Ness is here, engaged with some claims before a joint
							commission, for the settlement of certain claims against the Mexican
							Government; and he enquired what had been the reason for inserting in
							the Florida Treaty with Spain in the Article establishing a Commission
							for the adjustment of claims, a limitation of the claims to those in
							support of which the interposition of the Government had been solicited—
							I told him it was for the sake of fixing the amount of the sum to be
							paid by Spain, and for the sake of including within the reference the
							claim of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mead</persRef>,
							which Spain might otherwise have excluded, as one with which the
							government of the United States had no right to interfere— A man named
								<persRef ref="mark-john">Mark</persRef> a native of Hanover in
							Germany came to enquire if I had the disposal of any portion of the
							Smithsonian fund—and to inform me that a man by the name of <persRef
								ref="u">Löwenberg</persRef> at New-York had the very finest and most
							perfect Telescope in the world for sale— I enquired what price he would
							ask for it—he said 3000 dollars; but he would take half that sum for
							it.— I referred him to the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> as the person who had in charge the Smithsonian
							fund.— In the house <persRef ref="naylor-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor</persRef> had the floor to
							answer <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>,
							but was so much indisposed that he desired it might be postponed till
							to-morrow; and as that, and Saturday will be private bill days it was
							postponed, not without opposition till Monday— <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fillmore’s</persRef> motion to reconsider the rejection of the
							Lunatic bill followed. It was reconsidered—taken up in Committee of the
							whole on the State of the Union, <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"
								>Lincoln</persRef> in the chair; <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef> having requested to be excused— The bill was

							passed by yeas and nays 110 to 60, in spite of the snorting of <persRef
								ref="hubbard-david">Hubbard</persRef> of Alabama one of the
							nuisances of the house— Reports from the heads of Departments, Bills
							from the Senate, and Reports from the Committees came in succession—
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> moved to suspend the

							additional sentence was of no sort of consequence, but he thought it

						<p>I had received yesterday a Letter, from the four persons first named in
							the margin, announcing themselves as a Committee from the importing
							merchants of New-York, and requesting an interview, with me at my
							convenience— I answered that I would with pleasure receive them at my
							house at ten o’clock this morning. They accordingly came, and said they
							had been appointed to represent the objections of the importing
							merchants of New-York against parts of the Bill N. 556. of the present
							Session to ensure the more faithful execution of the laws, relating to
							the collection of duties on imports. They declared themselves anxiously
							desirous for the suppression of frauds and would not object to most of
							the provisions of the bill, though they believed the existing laws amply
							sufficient if faithfully executed— That the frauds which had been
							committed by the yorkshire importers at New-York had been effected by
							corrupt connivence of subordinate officers of the customs, and not by
							any defect in the Law. I heard all they had to say; and told them that
							the Committee of manufactures would meet next Tuesday morning at
							half-past ten; and I proposed to them to attend that meeting; and to
							come prepared with their objections to the bill reduced to writing; to
							which they assented— As they went out <persRef ref="stuart-margaret"
								>Miss Margaret Monroe Stuart</persRef> came in—a maiden Lady, who in
							the compass of half an hour uttered in one continued stream, more good
							words than I could record in three months— <persRef ref="u">Her
								Sister</persRef> is the wife of <persRef ref="gedney-thomas">Captain
								Gedney</persRef>, who is here very sick; and she fears not very
							sound in mind— She came to intreat me, in arguing the Amistad case
							before the Supreme Court, I would not bear hard upon Captain Gedney; for
							she fears it might kill him, and she is sure it would kill her Sister— I
							assured her that I would have all due consideration of the condition of
							Captain Gedney— In the House my Resolution Call upon the Postmaster
							General for a list of Postmasters removed came up, and was entangled
							with a budget of seven controversial Resolutions about the powers of the
							President and the rights of the house— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> pronounced this amendment proposed by <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> in order— I appealed— The
							appeal was laid on the table 95 to 80— The house refused to lay the
							whole subject on the table 92 to 84— The Resolution and Amendment were
							ordered to be printed.— In the <persRef ref="carroll-william">Clerk’s

						<p>I attended, with <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> this morning, public
							worship at the Capitol, where the Chaplain of the house <persRef
								ref="braxton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Braxton</persRef> preached a Sermon of an hour from John 3.7.
							“Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again.” about as
							shallow and superficial a discourse as it was ever my lot to hear,
							explaining into ten fold obscurity what was dark enough before— There
							were however at the close of the argument certain benevolent,
							affectionate and unctuous exhortations, which bespoke indulgence for the
							preacher and made up for all deficiencies of intellect— The auditory was
							thin; not more than half the seats of the members being filled, nobody
							in the galleries, and no baptist choir to sing; as there was this day
							fortnight. After the service, <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Jonathan
								Elliot</persRef> at the request of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Braxton, introduced him to me— He enquired if I had been acquainted with
								<persRef ref="braxton-carter3">his father</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="braxton-carter2">grandfather</persRef>— I had not—but I said
							his grandfather was universally known as one of the signers of the
							Declaration of Independence— Of his father I had never heard. His father
							he said must have been about of my age— He said that his father and
							forefathers had been episcopalians, but he had become a dissenter, and a
							member of the baptist church which he preferred to all the other
							denominations— He said he was pleased to find that many of the members
							of Congress were religious men— That they had prayer meetings every
							Saturday Evening; and that many of the members attended them. This was
							news to me— There were precious few members of Congress in attendance
							this day— I called with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, at
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Ballard’s</persRef>, on the Capitol hill, and saw <persRef
								ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope</persRef> who
							lodges there— He was seized yesterday with a vertigo as he was rising
							from the dinner table; and said he thought for some time he was going
							off hand to kingdom come—he seized hold of the table to steady himself,
							but the table danced round the room— One of his friends supported him,
							but the house itself was sinking and swinging round him— He recovered
							himself however in a short time, and walked to and fro, with-out his
							hat, in the Street in front of his lodgings for an hour till he
							recovered— He is now trying the remedy of abstinence. While we were
							there, <persRef ref="williams-joseph2">Joseph L. Williams</persRef>
							member of the house from Tennessee and <persRef ref="catron-john">Judge
								Catron</persRef> of the Supreme Court, also from Tennessee came in—
							The Session of the Court commences to-morrow— Judge Catron says that the
								<persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief Justice, Roger B.
								Taney</persRef> is very frail, and cannot last long— I visited also
							at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Arguelles’s</persRef>, <persRef ref="crabb-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crabb</persRef> of Alabama, with whom
							I found <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> of North-Carolina—
							They had visited me together— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the
							first Sunday after the Epiphany, and preached from Matthew 9.29. [“]Then
							touched he their eyes, saying, according to your faith, be it unto
							you[”]— Evening consumed in reading Amistad Documents.</p>

						<p>It was the day for the presentation of Petitions in the house, and I
							attended at the commencement of the sitting, but immediately after the
							reading of the Journal I moved an amendment of it. The entry was that
								<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> had moved to strike
							out of my Resolution call on the <persRef ref="niles-john">Postmaster
								General</persRef> all after the word resolved, and insert his eight

							resolution, but only wished me to accept his in addition to mine— The
								<persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> said it was so, and
							directed the amendment to be made in the Journal— <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef> the Chief Clerk came to my
							seat and shewed me Hopkins’s Resolutions in which there was not a word
							about striking out mine: but French said he thought it was necessarily
							implied— The Speaker then immediately announced the special order of the

								ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef> had the floor— He occupied it
							about 3 hours, in answer to <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.

							for adjournment by <persRef ref="toland-george">Toland</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> by general

							rode home with <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef>—
							Before I went to the house <persRef ref="burk-redmon">Redmon
								Burk</persRef> the Stone cutter came to intreat again

							from <persRef ref="u">Walker</persRef> supervisor of the work on the

								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk of the House</persRef>, I had several
							Petitions which had been presented at former Sessions, taken from the
							files; and with their papers referred to the Committees of Commerce and
							of Roads and Canals. I had thought they would be referred of course,
							under a general order of the house passed at the commencement of the
							Session—but I find that none of them is referred, unless at the special
							instance of those who had charge of them at the preceding Sessions— The
							Supreme Court met this day at Noon— I went into their room twenty
							minutes after and they had just adjourned— All the judges were here,
							excepting <persRef ref="story-joseph">Story</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Thomson</persRef>—detained on the way by

							goes to-morrow for New-York and Charleston— There was this Evening a
							meeting of the Institution for the promotion of Science and the Arts, at
							which I intended to have been present, but was deterred by unfavourable
							weather; and by necessary to the Amistad negroes case— I employed the
							whole Evening in reading and writing upon it— But it presents itself
							every day to me in a new aspect—and I still know not how to present it
							to the Court—</p>

							him I was unable to answer it at present— I thought it would be
							impracticable; and wished him to communicate this to the Society as my
							answer. but if, after the close of the Session of Congress, I should
							have leisure, I would undertake the task, and would give due notice to
							the Society of the time when I shall be prepared to deliver the Lecture—
							He was satisfied with this— I rode with <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> to and from the Capitol— Attended first at the
							Supreme Court, which meets at 11. O’Clock— The <persRef

								ref="mclean-john2;baldwin-henry;wayne-james;barbour-philip;catron-john;mckinley-john"
								>six other Judges</persRef> were on the bench but the judges
								<persRef ref="story-joseph">Story</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Thomson</persRef> were not there— A land cause,
							in which <persRef ref="ogden-david3">David B. Ogden</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="key-francis">F. Key</persRef> were the Counsel of the
							parties was taken up— I met <persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Baldwin</persRef> there, and
							introduced him to the <persRef ref="gilpin-henry">Attorney General
								Gilpin</persRef>— After a few minutes I took M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baldwin into the Congress Library, introduced him to the
								<persRef ref="meehan-john">Librarian Meehan</persRef>, and went with
							him into the Library Room of the Supreme Court— There I left him looking
							up the books that he wanted, and went into the house; where immediately
							after the reading of the Journal <persRef ref="naylor-charles"
								>Naylor</persRef> resumed his argument and continued till past 3
							O’Clock without finishing. I had heard enough on both sides to satisfy
							me of the vote that I am to give in the case, and I went into the Senate
							chamber to speak to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> about the bill for
							granting certificates of enrollment to the purchaser of the Amistad— The
							Senate chamber was full of members of the house listening to an argument
							against a pre-emption bill of <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Benton’s</persRef> and an amendment of <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhouns</persRef> to give away the public Lands— I heard <persRef
								ref="preston-william2">Preston</persRef> for about an hour,—and
							think him the most accomplished Orator now in the house— Oh! for his
							elocution! I returned to the house, and moved that the Bill N. 311. of
							last Session to increase the duties on the importation of silks, should
							be made the special order of the day for this day fortnight— Opposed by
								<persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> and all the
							South. After a short discussion, question taken by yeas and nays—64 to
							52. no quorum, and adjournment moved by <persRef ref="hubbard-david"

						<p><date>14. VI. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>Another dull and gloomy day—<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> continuing better, but still confined to her bed—
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> rode with me to the
							Capitol where I went into the Supreme Court room just before the judges
							came and opened the court— <persRef ref="key-francis">F. Key</persRef>,
							the District Attorney came to me, and enquired when the case of the
							Blacks was to come on— I said we had filed a motion to the Court to
							dismiss the cause, which I understood was to come up for argument on
							Saturday— He said he was afraid there was not any chance for the poor
							creatures— That the case of the Antelope, was precisely in point against
							them— He had argued that case for the freedom of the negroes, but it had
							been overruled— Yet it never would do to send them back to Cuba— The
							best thing that could be done was to make up a purse and pay for them
							and then send them back to Africa— I said we hoped to prove that the
							case of the Antelope, would not be conclusive in its bearing upon our
							clients; but he continued very positive in the impression that it would—
							I went therefore into the Supreme Court Library room: and took out the
							volume of <persRef ref="wheaton-henry">Wheaton’s</persRef> Reports
							containing the case of the Antelope— I read as much of it as I could—and
							longed to comment upon it as I would—but I have neither time nor head
							for it—nothing but the heart— In the house after the reading of the
							Journal, the question upon making my silk bill the special order for
							Wednesday the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> was the first thing that
							came up— I moved for a call of the house which was refused— The vote on
							the question’s being taken was 78 to 64. and the majority not amounting
							to two thirds my motion was lost.— After some snarling by <persRef
								ref="rives-francis">Rives</persRef> of Virginia, <persRef
								ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef> resumed his argument in
							support of his right to his seat— He increased in vehemence as he
							proceeded, till in hoarseness he almost lost distinct articulation, and
							at a quarter past 3. he concluded—not that he had finished, but from
							absolute exhaustion— <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles"
								>Ingersoll</persRef> rose to reply; but the house adjourned after a
							suspension of the rules for <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W.
								Jones</persRef> to move to make his five Million Treasury Note Bill,
							the special order for next Monday.— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
								>Barnard</persRef> moved an amendment to instruct the Committee of
							Ways and Means to bring in a Bill for a loan of ten Millions of dollars,
							and to levy duties on silks, wines and spices,—but the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> declared it not in
								order;—<persRef ref="green-willis">Willis Green</persRef> offered a
							Resolution of much the same purport, but could not obtain a suspension
							of the rules to offer it— D. D. Barnard from the Committee on the
							judiciary did obtain leave to report the Bill which passed the Senate at
							the last Session,— He moved to make it a special order; but the house
							adjourned— <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thomson</persRef> came to
							my Seat and enquired what allowances were made to ministers going
							abroad— I told him, and asked if he had any particular interest in
							making the enquiry—he said in confidence that he had— I pursued this
							Evening my examination of the Documents in the case of the Amistad
							captives, but am yet utterly unprepared for the argument.</p>

							shewed me the Letter from <persRef ref="holabird-william"
								>Holabird</persRef> U.S. District Attorney in Connecticut, of 21.
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1839.— In the manuscript

								rend="italic">no</hi> after <hi rend="italic">had</hi>, in the

							original Letter. Martin said he would send me a certified copy of the
							Letter.— But I knew he would not, for on reading the Letter I saw it was
							garbled in the copy transmitted to the house— In the Letter after
							stating that the Court had doubts as to the habeas corpus, he declares
							his fears of the result, and adds I should regret extremely that the
							rascally blacks, should fall into the hands of the abolitionists with
							whom Hartford is filled.— Meeting <persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi

						<p><date>16. V. </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>This day the motion signed by <persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> and myself, and
							filed by him in the Supreme Court, to dismiss the appeal by the United
							States from the Decree of the District and Circuit Courts, in the case
							of the Amistad captives, was to have been argued— Saturday being by the
							rules of the Court the weekly day for the argument of motions— I was not
							half prepared, and went to the Court with a heavy heart, fill of
							undigested thought—sure of the justice of my Cause; and deeply
							desponding of my ability to sustain it— When the Court was opened the
								<persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief Justice, Roger B.
								Taney</persRef> said that the Court had thought it best to postpone
							the Amistad case, to await the arrival of <persRef ref="story-joseph"
								>judge Story</persRef>, who was expected to be here on Monday or
							Tuesday. It was desirable that there should be a full Court for the
							hearing of the case; and the Court would take it up, on any day of the
							week immediately after his arrival— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baldwin stated that he was under a necessity of leaving this city next
							Saturday to attend a Court in Connecticut. The postponement of the case,
							afforded me a momentary relief, but, left a state of suspense scarcely
							less distressing than the agony of the ordeal itself— In the house
								<persRef ref="toland-george">Toland</persRef> came to my seat, and
							said there was talk of a motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday
							declaring <persRef ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef> entitled to his
							Seat; and enquired if I thought such a motion was receivable upon a
							decision of the house in its judicial capacity. I said it ought not to
							be—but that I could answer for nothing from the majority of this house—
							He said if the motion should be made he should resist it, and asked if I
							would sustain him— I said I would—but the motion was not made. <persRef
								ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee
							of Elections, moved a suspension of the rules for a Resolution
							authorising the allowance of the pay and mileage of a member for the
							Commencement of this Congress till the decision of the house against
							him— But instead of a vote of two thirds, he could scarcely obtain a
							vote of one third of the house to suspend the rules— <persRef
								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> also moved a suspension of
							the rules for a satirical call upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>. A Tennessee land-bill raised a
							debate some of the members from that State and others from North
							Carolina, till arrested by the expiration of the morning hour— A number
							of private bills were then disposed of in Committee of the
								whole—<persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the chair.
							among the rest, a Bill reported by the Committee of claims for the
							relief of <persRef ref="goddard-nathaniel">Nathaniel Goddard</persRef>
							and others, among whom <persRef ref="perkins-thomas">Thomas H.
								Perkins</persRef>, owners of the ship Ariadne and cargo, which
								<persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> opposed because
							Perkins was a member of the Hartford Convention— He moved to strike out
							the enacting clause, which was carried— Several other Bills were passed
							upon, and reported to the house where the discussion upon the Hartford
							Convention was renewed, but no question taken—adjourned near 4.</p>

						<p>Rainy Night and morning. as the rain subsided I walked to the Capitol and
							heard <persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cookman</persRef> preach from James 1.26 [“]If any man among you
							seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own
							heart, this man’s religion is vain. 27. Pure religion and undefiled
							before God, and the father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows,
							in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.” He
							began by observing, that among the first followers of Jesus Christ
								<persRef ref="james">James</persRef> was the great apostle and
							champion of practical religion— Then he discoursed largely, and most
							instructively upon the necessity of bridling the tongue, gathered a
							number of passages of scripture elucidating that position—descanted upon
							the mysterious identification of the <hi rend="italic">word</hi>, with
							God—contrasted the confusion of tongues at the confusion of Babel, and
							the gift of fiery tongues at the miracle of the Pentecost— He spoke of
							the wonderful power and influen of speech for good or for evil in the
							lives, history and atchievements of <persRef ref="demosthenes"
								>Demosthenes</persRef> and <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> of <persRef ref="pitt-william">Chatham</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="henry-patrick">Patrick Henry</persRef>—of <persRef
								ref="danton-georges">Danton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="robespierre-maximilien">Robespierre</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="marat-jean">Marat</persRef>.— Thence he passed to the second
							verse of his text, to the thrice repeated exhortation to purity, in the
							phraseology of the text, its indissoluble connection with religion—its
							utter aversion to and horror of hypocrisy.— He marked the gentle, quiet,
							humane, benevolent Spirit with which this pure and undefiled religion
							makes her way and settles herself in every humble dwelling in the valley
							and upon every mountaintop— I see her—said he— I see her and he looked
							round the half empty seats of the members, I thought he was going to say
							taking her seat successively in every one of the chairs before me, and
							breathing around her Spirit to be caught by those who shall occupy them
							through the week— He said it not but he looked it— The auditory was thin
							and among them were very few members of Congress— The party of gentlemen
							above named dined with me— I had invited <persRef ref="naylor-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor</persRef> and he had
							promised to come; but I received a note from him dated last Night saying
							that he was called to Philadelphia to his sick child, and must go off
							this morning. I sent to invite <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef>, but he was engaged—
							I sent to <persRef ref="smith-truman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Truman Smith</persRef> and he came— This Evening I received a Letter
							from <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Stephen Fox</persRef> the British Minister requesting me to appoint
							a time to see him to have some conversation with me concerning the case
							of the Amistad captives, in behalf of whom he is instructed by his
							Government— And he wishes my advice, in the event of a judgment of the
							Supreme Court against them.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef>, with another
							Folio pamphlet of Correspondence with Foreign Powers relating to the

							Class D. further series 1840—came this morning. On looking into it I
							found I should want the Class C—but I can as yet make no time to read
							any of them— The Correspondence between the Governors of New-York and
							Virginia has absorbed two of my Evenings; and is of awful import— Its
							most alarming feature is the lameness of tone on the part of <persRef
								ref="seward-william">W. H. Seward</persRef> the Governor of

							collector of the customs at New-York with the smuggling importing

							the house <persRef ref="peck-luther">Peck</persRef> of New-York moved a

								>Secretary of War</persRef>, and <persRef ref="reynolds-john"
								>Reynolds</persRef> for a Resolution to meet hereafter. daily at 11.
							O’Clock— Both failed. Committee of the whole on the State of the Union,
							Casey in the chair on the Bill to authorize the issuing of Treasury
							Notes.— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee made his
							Speech of 3 hours upon the condition of the finances, and <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> took the floor after
							him—the Committee then rose— Sundry members were slipping in petitions,
							till I moved that the States should be called for Petitions, whereupon
							the house adjourned— By an agreement this day between <persRef

							Baldwin</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="gilpin-henry">Attorney General

							case till the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin left the City this afternoon to
							return home— This gives me a long respite for further preparation but my
							senseless distribution of time leaves me none for this all important

								<persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton’s</persRef> pre-emption Bill—
							Sharp shooting between <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>,
							and the sneaking scrivener <persRef ref="buchanan-james2"

							with two heavy Mails of Letters legible and illegible, and dull

							now— I had no better expectation of a Spirit of National improvement in

								ref="carr-john3">Carr</persRef> of Indiana, moved to take the
							morning hour to call the States for Petitions, which was carried.— The
								<persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> began with Maine,

							before it came to my turn— I had upwards of thirty to present.— I
							presented only five three of which were referred to appropriate

							abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade in the District of Columbia 2.
							The prohibition of the Slave-trade between the States 3. To refuse the
							admission of any new State whose Constitution tolerates Slavery. I moved

							and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bacon is a Trinitarian Calvinist, but his
							discourse was written and its subject was the interview between Jesus
							and the Samaritan woman at Jacob’s Well, in the city of Sychar. To this
							woman according to our English Bible he expressly affirmed that <hi

							simply says “I am”—the <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is added in our
							translation— The question, why he so expressly revealed himself to this
							degraded woman of Samaria, with whom his disciples marvelled that he
							should talk at-all, might furnish a subject for an interesting
							historical Discourse— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bacon considered it
							from another point of view— His manner is grave, emphatic, but
							temperate—his elocution distinct and audible—his delivery good but
							rather stiff. The house was not full— <persRef ref="benton-thomas"

							which they fulfilled. 27. And when they were come, and had gathered the
							church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how
							he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.”— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker was ordained as a missionary to
							China in 1834— And as one of the injunctions of Christ to his Apostles
							was to heal the sick, that was also one of the duties with which he was
							charged— In 1835. a hospital was erected by the munificence of the
							Americans and English at the factories at Canton; and in the short space
							of 5 years 8000 persons have been admitted to the administration of its
							benefits— He gave a very brief summary of the origin and present state
							of the quarrel between Great-Britain and China—and related the Scenes of
							the strangling of an opium smuggler in front of the factory, and of the
							riot and mob at the factories on the occasion of an attempt to strangle
							another there— His narrative was on the whole not encouraging.— This
							church was crowded almost to suffocation, and it was with the utmost
							difficulty that we obtained Seats— <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi

							blended together that I had no small difficulty in discriminating the
							papers which emanated from one of the Courts from those which belonged

							may be made to carry into execution that swindling Treaty— That petition

							advised them to see <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Oh! how impotent is my voice to fulfil the purpose of my heart!— I want
							and cannot yet find the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="wheaton-henry">Wheaton</persRef>— I went also into the

							it to him— In the house, <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi

								>Benton</persRef> took advantage of the report, to press in the

						<p>An effort was made in the house this morning to suspend the special order

								ref="russell-david">Russell</persRef> pressed it upon the house, but

							on his motion, which were 79 to 87. I was except <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> the only oppositionist who
							voted against the suspension, because the simple repeal, without making

								>Pickens</persRef>, who with upstretched arm held a fluttering scrap
							of paper being a Call upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> for information concerning the seizure of

								ref="garland-james">James Garland</persRef> came to me with a
							Resolution; which he requested me to offer, to grant the use of the Hall
							for an hour and a half before the meeting of the House next Monday
							morning to an exhibition of deaf and dumb and blind pupils— I offered
							the Resolution, and it was adopted without opposition— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> held the floor for three hours, in
							concluding his Speech a motley compound of Eloquence and folly, of
							braggart impudence and childish vanity—of self-laudation and Virginian
							narrow-mindedness—Wise is the personified caricature of Virginia— Great
							conception—wild but energetic elocution— Bathos of conclusion— Small and
							pitiful result. He was followed by <persRef ref="hubbard-david"
								>Hubbard</persRef> of Alabama; who began grunting against the tariff
							for about half an hour, and then gave way to a motion to rise— The
							Committee had already once risen, reported no Quorum, and after a
							refusal to adjourn the house had gone into Committee again— They now
							rose again and reported no Quorum, and adjourned by yeas and nays 51 to
							22— In the course of the morning, <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> came in, had me
							called from my Seat, and sat down with me five minutes on a Sofa— He
							said that a member of the Senate of Massachusetts had written to him
							concerning the North-eastern boundary question— He had informed himself
							of the present condition of the Negotiation—and he had answered the
							Massachusetts Senator that the Resolutions should be firm as to the
							maintenance of the right, and complain much of delays.— In the Evening I
							received a Letter, from <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>,
							opening a Scene in the Legislature of Massachusetts, responsive to the
							course of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster here.— The boundary

						<p>An inflammation in my left eye, threatens me with complete disability to
							perform my final duty before the Supreme Court in the case of the
							Amistad captives, while the daily and hourly increasing weight of the
							pressure of preparation, aggravates that disability— At the first
							meeting of the house, <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>
							reproduced his call upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> for information respecting the seizure of
							American vessels by British Cruizers on the Coast of Africa; and it was
							received without objection. I had prepared this morning and now moved an
							amendment calling for the correspondence with the British Government
							relating to the African Slave-trade; and for all <persRef
								ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist’s </persRef>despatches as Consul at
							the Havana, to the Department of State relating to the same subject— I
							have been ever since the commencement of the last Session anxiously
							waiting for an opportunity to move this call but have abstained from
							offering it, from a certainty that if I did it would be objected to, and
							rejected— Pickens now accepted my amendment— <persRef ref="weller-john"
								>Weller</persRef> of Ohio who sees deeper into a millstone than
							Pickens started up and said—“I object to that”— It was too late for
							Pickens to retract— He repeated that he had no objection to my
							amendment— Weller roared out again I object, but the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> heeded him not—he put the
							question upon the Resolution as amended and it passed, so that if Weller
							himself said no, I did not hear his voice— Pickens then, seemingly
							alarmed at Weller’s objection came to my seat, and said that the only
							objection that he had to my amendment was that the papers called for by
							it are so voluminous that he feared it would delay the report upon the
							call till it would be too late for action upon the papers that he
							wanted. Foreseeing a motion for reconsideration I said he might easily
							call at the Department of State, and get a report in part, furnishing
							the papers of his call, and leaving time for the preparation of the
							remainder— He seemed satisfied with this, but the danger of a
							reconsideration was still so great that I went to <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef> the sub-clerk, and asked him
							to despatch the Call to the President immediately, which he promised to
							do.— We shall certainly not get Trist’s despatches—perhaps not the
							diplomatic correspondence particularly <persRef ref="fox-henry3"
								>Fox’s</persRef> last note about the Amistad captives—but a refusal
							or an apology for withholding them will be useful for the appeal to the

								Parker</persRef> the Missionary to China this morning in the Hall of
							the House of Representatives, instead of <persRef ref="cookman-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman</persRef>, who was
							present—prayed, and gave out, and sung the hymn D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Parker gave out as preliminary to his discourse five or six
							texts, the first of which was Joshua 13.1.—“and there remaineth yet very
							much land to be possessed.”—and the last was Isaiah 49.12. [“]Behold,
							these shall come from far; and lo, these from the North and from the
							west: and these from the land of Sinim.” Of the intermediate texts one
							was from Deuteronomy, one from Acts, and one, Mark 16.15 “And he said
							unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
							creature.” The discourse itself consisted of desultory and miscellaneous
							observations concerning the religions, manners, customs, habits domestic
							opinions, principles, prejudices and moral doctrines of the Chinese— He
							rates the population of the Empire at 360 Millions, which must be
							greatly over-rated— Of these the great mass have no faith in a state of
							future existence— <persRef ref="confucius">Confucius</persRef> upon an
							enquiry made to him upon this subject answered only by extinguishing a
							taper— Yet they have many religious ceremonies, festivals, sacrifices;
							household idols—but no sabbath— The boodhists believe in the
							transmigration of souls, and use no animal food for fear of eating their
							grandfathers— Their system of social intercourse is ceremonious,
							punctilious, and full of reciprocal courtesy.— The obstacles to the
							propagation of the gospel among them are insuperable to all worldly
							wisdom or eloquence; for the first question a missionary meets from a
							Chinese is how he can expect him to believe a religion, whose God, was
							crucified as a malefactor— Yet should not the preacher of the Christian
							gospel despair— The Empire of China, is about to be opened to the social
							intercourse with the world, and God, in his own time will provide the
							means of rallying that great people to the Christian fold— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker gave notice that he should repeat
							the substance of this discourse, this afternoon at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
