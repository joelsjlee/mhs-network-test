							came this morning and informed me that he now held ad interim the
							Clerkship vacated by <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">Andrew T.
								M’Cormick</persRef>, who died a few days after I went home in April—
							I had placed him in the Department of State on the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January 1818. and he remained there
							undisturbed till his death. But Homer says <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> had promised
							the place to a Classmate of his at College named <persRef ref="u"
								>Bingham</persRef>; so that Homer’s tenure is barely momentary, and
							he says the Secretary of the Treasury, <persRef ref="ewing-thomas"
								>Ewing</persRef> has not treated him fairly; for he promised him an
							office to commence on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of May, and
							then disappointed him— He was arrested in the detail of his grievances
							by <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Force</persRef> and <persRef ref="nourse-michael">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse</persRef>—who came as a
							Committee from the Columbian College, with a written proposal to pay the
							annual interest due on their bond to me, and 3000 dollars of the
							principal, provided I will receive it in such funds as they have
							received—that is in depreciated Bank Bills— I told them I wanted the
							3000 dollars to pay a debt of the same amount, and if my creditor would
							take what they proposed to pay me— They assented to this— I sent for
								<persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef>, and enquired of him
							if he would take the bills or corporation stock in payment— He said he
							would enquire as to the value of corporation stock and give me an
							answer— He afterwards came again and said he would take corporation
							stock at 94 per cent, with the discount for the depretiation of the
							Bills— Morning visit with Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gates-seth">Gates</persRef> of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef> of the State of
							New-York residing on Lake Champlain, and <persRef ref="tomlinson-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tomlinson</persRef>— By all this
							and a call of Charity for a coloured man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Lancaster</persRef>, I was belated a quarter of an hour at the
							Capitol— <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> rode
							thither with me, and when I entered the Hall, the house had determined
							to take by yeas and nays on my amendment to <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood’s</persRef> amendment to <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Resolution to adopt the rules of
							the last house of Representatives— The <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> was in the act of ordering the call of the roll
							when I reached my seat— I addressed the House about three quarters of an
							hour in support of my amendment— Slade rose to speak, but <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> from the joint Committee
							appointed to wait on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>
							asked to make a Report— The debate on the Rules was accordingly
							suspended. Sergeant reported that the President had informed the
							Committee that he would make a communication in writing to both houses
							immediately— The Message was then delivered by his Son <persRef
								ref="tyler-robert">Robert Tyler</persRef>, and read by the <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk</persRef>—10,000 copies extra to be
							printed, after much debate for more. <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
								>Pickens</persRef> moved a Resolution that the seats should be

							was here this morning and concluded the narrative of his grievances in
							failing to obtain a permanent Office in the Department of the Treasury
							or of State. He wants my influence to assist him— That would not avail
							him; but he has more powerful influence than mine at work <hi
								rend="strikethrough">than mine</hi> in his favour, and he will not
							be finally disappointed— Morning visits from <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef>, with two of his Colleagues, new members of the
							house— <persRef ref="greig-john">Greig</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-henry">Van Rensselaer</persRef>— Greig is a
							Scotchman; representing <persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger’s</persRef> District, and
							elected to supply his place— He told me that he had been acquainted with
								<persRef ref="porter-agnes">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Agnes
								Porter</persRef> late of London, so warmly the friend of <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and me when we were
							last in England, and so kindly remembering us after we came home while
							she lived— A person by the name of <persRef ref="matthews-henry">Henry
								Matthews</persRef> from the Western part of New-York came and
							announced himself as a Candidate for the office of Sergeant at arms to
							the House of Representatives. At the Office of the National
							Intelligencer neither of the Editors <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Gales</persRef> or <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>
							was there. I pointed out to the foreman the egregious error in the
							report of my speech yesterday, in support of my motion to rescind the
								21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule of the last House— I sent to
							the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk’s</persRef> table, and caused to
							be read the Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts, against the
							identical rule. After the House adjourned yesterday I called at the
							Office, expressly to state my solicitude for the correctness of the
							report and to request that the Resolutions should be published as part
							of my speech, which Seaton promised to do; but by a ludicrous mistake,
							published another set of Resolutions, relating to Slavery but having no
							reference to the rule whatever. The foreman promised that the error
							should be corrected in the Country paper and in the daily paper of
							to-morrow.— I spoke on the same subject to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Seaton, at the Mayor’s Office, and afterwards to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales— I called at the Patriotic Bank and
							received 316.75. for the Franklin Insurance Office dividend, in Virginia
							Bank Bills, as <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Charles J. Nourse</persRef>
							told me, at 4 1/2 per Cent discount— I told <persRef
								ref="rothwell-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rothwell</persRef>, Treasurer of the Columbia College, that my
							creditor declined receiving payment otherwise than in Specie or its
							equivalent, and I must therefore do the same— But I said he would take
							corporation Stock in payment if that would suit the college— He said he
							would consult the Directors and let me know their decision on Friday: At
							the house: the names of the Committee of one Member from each State, on
							my Resolution honorary to the memory of <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>President Harrison</persRef>, were announced—mine as Chariman—
								<persRef ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef> then announced

								ref="u">Senter</persRef> from Western New-York who was desirous of
							being introduced to me—to which I consented. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Homer came with him accordingly this morning and introduced
							him and left him with me. After a short conversation, upon <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Giddings</persRef> of Ohio’s coming in with <persRef ref="u">judge
								Morfitt</persRef> of that State, he withdrew, saying that he would
							occasionally drop in, to see me— At the House, the discussion upon the
							adoption of the Rules of the house in the last Congress, was resumed, on
							my amendment to <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood’s</persRef>
							amendment to <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> motion— Wise
							accepted Underwood’s amendment, and then, at great length answered my
							argument in support of my amendment— He was followed by <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef>, who made a
							plausible and temperate speech in support of his speech—brought up again
							as he did at the time of the adoption of the rule, what he represents as
							a precedent—the yeas and nays on a motion to lay on the table a motion
							to receive an abolition petition, on the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January 1836 for which I voted— It was to lay on the
							table for that day to be taken up again and be decided immediately
							after, as it was by receiving it— Johnson committed the gaucherie also
							of saying that he had a Letter from the acting <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President Tyler</persRef>, declaring his approbation of the Rule— I
							called on him to produce the Letter— He said he had it not here, and
							that it was written last year when the rule was adopted— <persRef
								ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> moved two amendments to my
							amendment, but afterwards abandoned one of them—only retaining that of
							striking out that part of my amendment which requires the rescinding of
							the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule. <persRef ref="mason-samson"
								>Samson Mason</persRef> proposed as a compromise to adopt all the
							rules, for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Session, and <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef> had some other
							concession to propose the previous question was vociferously called for
							from various quarters— I asked of the justice of the house to allow me
							the opportunity of replying to Wise and Johnson—and of assigning my
							reasons for not accepting Slade’s amendment to mine— The vote on the
							previous question was taken by tellers and resulted 75 to 95— This,
							according to the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker’s</persRef>
							construction of Parliamentary Law; laid over the whole subject to
							another day.— The Senate had concurred in the appointment of a
							joint-committee, to honour the memory of the late <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef>, and appointed a
							Committee of 5 on their part—<persRef ref="bayard-richard"
								>Bayard</persRef> Chairman— As Chairman on the part of the house I
							went into the Senate chamber, and agreed with Bayard, that the Committee
							should meet on Saturday next at Noon in the Vice-Presidents chamber; of
							which I gave notice to all the members on the part of the House— The
							report of the <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> on the Finances was received. It proposes a Bank.
							Wise moved a call for the plan, and a Committee to report upon it. Much
							debate and confusion— Adjourned to next Monday 11. A.M. Evening visits

							brought back my French translation of the Silesian Letters, and expects
							to inflame my zeal in his favour by the great interest he has taken in

							office— Nor will M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kavasales be more

							at his chamber there; nor at his lodgings at <persRef ref="mayo-robert"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayo’s</persRef>— He was gone to
							the races.— In the Congress Library I found in the extra Globe of 19.

								ref="johnson-william2">W. C. Johnson</persRef> in taking up a list
							of yeas and nays of the day before, and for which I voted, as a
							precedent for refusing to receive abolition petitions.— I afterwards

							and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seatons</persRef> Register of Debates;
							and only pray that in exposing this knavish practice I may be enabled to
							preserve my temper— I paid a visit to the acting <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President John Tyler</persRef> and had a
							conversation with him upon the condition and prospects of the
							Smithsonian fund— The <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary of the
								Treasury Ewing</persRef> has not communicated to him my Letter of
							19. April last, nor the report nor any of the documents which I sent him
							with it— When I went into the room where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tyler received me I saw <persRef ref="wise-henry">H. A. Wise</persRef>
							in the back portico, facing the Potowmac, but he did not come in, while
							I was there— My next call was on the <persRef ref="badger-george"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef>. I enquired for the correspondence
							on the Records of the Department, concerning a Mandate of the Supreme
							Court to <persRef ref="southard-samuel">S. L. Southard</persRef>
							Secretary of the Navy of 14. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1825. in
							the care of the Antelope—a certificate from the same Court of March and
							a mandate of May 1827. but none such was to be found— In the case of
								<persRef ref="welsh-thomas3">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Welsh</persRef> the Secretary assured me that he should have the
							privilege of passing an examination for an appointment as an assistant
							surgeon in the navy, instead of the present year, he not being of age
							till next August.— He gave me to understand that Kavasales would not
							receive appointment as chaplain in the Mediterranean Squadron, because
							he is not an Anglo-saxon.— I read to him the Letter of 3. April last to
							me from <persRef ref="bennett-clement">Clement Bennett</persRef> an
							Ex-Midshipman, dismissed from the Navy, and claiming to be restored. He

						<p>Bath and swim in the Potomac river.</p>
						<p>Summer has come to claim his own—from the raw frigid North-eastern winds.
							I have made a sudden plunge into the burning atmosphere of the tropics.
							I rode in the barouche to my old bathing haunt under the high bluff
							half-way between the mouth of the Tiber and the bridge, which I had not
							visited since the Summer of 1838. and very seldom since September 1828—
							The bed of the river continues to encroach on this northern side of the
							strand— The large old trees which formerly stood on the banks have been
							uprooted by the tides, and all swept away. The bluff sapped beneath by
							the frequent washings of the Springs tides has become top-heavy, and
							masses of the clay have broken down, in heaps washed away again by the
							tides— I took the bath on a rising tide; swam about ten minutes and
							walked home— Morning visits from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>

							the meeting of the joint Committee on the tokens of respect to the
							memory of the late <persRef ref="harrison-william">President William
								Henry Harrison</persRef>, in the chamber of the Vice-President— The
							Committee on the part of the Senate were <persRef ref="bayard-richard"

								>Prentiss</persRef> of Vermont, <persRef ref="benton-thomas"

								>Walker</persRef> of Mississippi of whom Archer and Walker were
							absent; of the House the Committee consisted of one member from each

							Bayard Chairman of the Senates Committee, proposed two Resolutions
							similar to those adopted on the decease of <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>James Madison</persRef>.—and they passed unanimously without
							debate. There was much discussion upon a third Resolution for a grant of
							money to the widow of General Harrison, which was adopted not
							unanimously, leaving the sum in blank— The Chairman of the Committee on
							the part of the house was instructed to prepare the bill and report it
							to the house. Something was said about an Eulogy, to be delivered before
							both houses, but none such having been pronounced upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison, no formal proposition for it was
							now made— The Committee adjourned without day— At the City Hall I left

								<persRef ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy’s</persRef> effects; and <persRef

						<p>Trinity Sunday. Morning worship at the second Presbyterian Church— Two
							other clergymen besides <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> were there— One of whom
							was <persRef ref="welton-a">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Welton</persRef> who lately called on me with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood— Of the name of the other I was not
							informed. He made the prayers, and baptised M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wood’s infant daughter, whom he himself accompanied by
								<persRef ref="wood-susan">his wife</persRef>, presented— The name
							given to her was <persRef ref="wood-emmeline">Emmeline Merwin</persRef>,
							and before administering the rite the minister gave a succinct account
							of the origin of the institution.— He said the Abrahamic, the Mosaic and
							the Christian Church were one. That the Covenant of God was with
								<persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>, and its token was the rite
							of circumcision— That to this institution, <persRef ref="moses"
								>Moses</persRef> added that of the passover; and that both had been
							adapted to the Christian dispensation by substituting baptism for
							circumcision, and the communion of the Lord’s supper for the passover—
							Then he said that baptism was the signal of admission to the Christian
							Church and reminded the Parents of the obligations of duty which they
							contracted for their child in offering her for this admission.— After
							which he took the child in his arms, and baptised her in the form of
							direct address to herself— Emiline Merwin I baptise thee, in the name of
							the father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost—amen! M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Welton preached from 1. Peter 4.18. “And
							if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly, and the
							sinner appear?” The manner of the preacher was earnest and affectionate
							the theme solemn and awful— The terrors of the judgment day— But it is
							the hacknied common-place of Calvinism, the pathos of which is lost upon
							me— That the righteous are saved in the future world I have no doubt,
							although the best may have much to answer for. Man can rely upon no
							merits of his own, but on the mercy of a God, whose tender mercies are
							over all his works— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> attended, and took the communion at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church: at which there was no
							evening service— <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Captain
								Buchanan</persRef> dined and spent the Evening here, and <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> was also here this
							Evening.— I attended after dinner at <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Laurie’s</persRef> church where a
							young man whom I knew not, preached from 2. Peter 3.9. [“]The Lord is
							not slack concerning his promise; as some men count slackness: but is
							long suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
							all should come to repentance”— The long-suffering of the Lord, was
							expounded, in very handsome language, pronounced very correctly and the
							auditory solemnly warned against too much reliance upon the
							long-suffering of the Lord— I prepared a short Letter to <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">Joshua Leavitt</persRef>, New-York.</p>

						<p>I gathered up all the gold and silver that I had in the house, excepting
							some small change; and made up a purse of 700 dollars, which I took to
							the Treasury building and exchanged for 3 Treasury Notes one of 500 and
							2 of 100 dollars each— They made a scruple at receiving the Sovereigns,
							because upon a late essay at the mint it had been found that they were
							1/4 of a grain below the standard weight; being the exact allowance of
							the law, but which in recoining caused a loss of one cent a piece— As
							the amount was so small however the <persRef ref="selden-william"
								>Treasurer</persRef> consented to take my Sovereigns as I had
							received them at 4.85— <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kavasales</persRef> came again this
							morning, still insisting, and still sangwine in the hope of receiving an
							appointment of Chaplain in the Navy. At 11. O’Clock the house met—
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> came over to my seat and
							asked me to yield him the floor, on the question about the rules, to
							read a precedent exactly in point, in the year 1800— I said certainly—
							The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> announced my amendment
							to the motion for adopting the rules of the last H.R. as the subject
							under consideration— I yielded the floor to Wise who with a great bustle
							of pomposity read his precedent of 1800 with all the yeas and nays, and
							it was in truth a precedent as strong as possible against him— As soon
							as he sat down, I rose and said— And the Mountain is delivered of its
							mouse—and in a speech of about three hours I replied to the Speeches of
							Wise and <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. C. Johnson</persRef> in
							opposition to mine—supporting my amendment— But as much as one third of
							the time in interruptions by Wise and Johnson with fresh speeches under
							colour of explanations— <persRef ref="king-thomas2">Thomas Butler
								King</persRef> of Georgia replied to me with great bitterness and
							virulence— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Millard Fillmore</persRef>
							then moved the previous question, which the Speaker stated would be
							first on my amendment (merely “except the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st</hi>”) (I had accepted <persRef ref="slade-william"
								>Slade’s</persRef> amendment, and struck out the rescinding clause)
							and then upon the Resolution to adopt the rules.— After much chicanery
							the previous question was carried, and the vote by yeas and nays on my
							amendment was carried 112 to 104. almost exclusively bond and free—
							After much struggling the question was carried to adopt the rules with
							the exception— Then a ragged question of precedence in business, in
							which Wise wrangled as usual, but which ended in the adoption of the
							order moved by <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> that the
							Standing Committees of the house be now appointed with an additional
							select Committee of 9. moved by <persRef ref="sergeant-john">John
								Sergeant</persRef>, on the currency— <persRef ref="mckeon-john"
								>M’Keon</persRef> moved a division of the question, and both parts
							of it were successively carried. I asked leave to make a report from the
							joint <persRef ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> Committee, but
							in the confusion I was not heard. It was near half past six when the
							house adjourned to Noon to-morrow— I requested the Speaker not to
							appoint me on the Committee of Manufactures— He said he did not so
							intend— And asked if I had any objection to the Committee of Foreign
							Relations— I said no. <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">M<hi

							claim on account of some service of <persRef ref="u">her
								husband</persRef>, deceased— She was here before; when I desired her
							to get her petition drawn up in form, and promised to present it— She
							came now again with her daughter. Lawyer <persRef ref="key-francis"
								>Key</persRef> is to draw up her Petition. But as Congress will
							probably not act upon Petitions at this special Session—she reserves it
							now till the next winter Session, and desiring to go to Annapolis, to
							establish her daughter there in some profitable business, could not I
							accommodate her with a small sum in advance of what she may obtain on
							her claim? No. Well, could not I give her a trifle, ever so small, were
							it no more than five dollars, to pay for her journey to Annapolis, and
							the accomplishment of her business there? No. There came another woman
							with a basket over her arm, as going to market— She said she had four
							children, and not a cent to give them bread, and she asked for charity—
							This is an average specimen of the daily number and classes of beggars
							who beset members of Congress in this city. I went to the Orphan’s
							Court, with <persRef ref="leary-john">John Leary’s</persRef> statement
							of his administration account, of his brother <persRef
								ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy’s</persRef> estate and <persRef
								ref="flynn-mary2">Mary Flynn’s</persRef> claim and affidavit— The
							judge appeared willing to admit all the charges, and Mary Flynn’s
							demand, but he requires burdensome, troublesome, and expensive
							authentications. At the house an order was adopted to proceed
							immediately to the Election of Officers of the House, after the journal

							Instead of the foreign Affairs which the <persRef ref="white-john6"

							in the choice of <persRef ref="townsend-eleazar">Eleazar

								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> moved a

								<persRef ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef> were
							received from the Senate, and concurred in unanimously though not

								Kavasales</persRef> was here again this morning, but I had not had
							time to call on the <persRef ref="badger-george">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>, and I promised I would as soon as possible— I called
							at the Orphan’s Court with <persRef ref="flynn-mary2">Mary
								Flynn’s</persRef> affidavit and a Massachusetts register for this
							year, with the name of <persRef ref="gourgas-john">John M.
								Gourgas</persRef>, as a Justice of Peace, and the quorum in the
							County of Norfolk, to enquire if the judge would not take this and my
							own testimony as sufficient authentication of the fact, without putting
							the poor woman to the trouble and expense of procuring a certificate
							under the seal of the County Court. The register said he thought he
							might but the judge would hold Court again next Friday, when I might
							ascertain from him— I suddenly met in the Office <persRef
								ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tobias
								Watkins</persRef> whom I had not seen since 1829. at Meridian
							hill—he being then in deep trouble, from which he has yet but partially
							emerged— I took him by the hand and enquired how he was; at which he
							seemed surprized and bewildered; but he shook my hand cordially, and
							said he was well— At parting we shook hands again but without saying any
							thing further— At the House great part of the day was consumed, in
							electing by nominal call, <persRef ref="follansbee-joseph">Joseph
								Follansbee</persRef>, as Door-keeper. <persRef ref="hunter-john"
								>John W Hunter</persRef> as Assistant Door-keeper; both these were
							cases of re-election, and both were contested by seven rival candidates—
							At last by unanimous consent <persRef ref="mccormick-william"
								>M’Cormick</persRef> was re-appointed Postmaster to the house by
							Resolution. <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J Sergeant</persRef> then moved
							a Resolution (after the election of the <persRef ref="french-john"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> J. W. French</persRef>
							episcopalian as chaplain) for the appointment of Printer to the house to
							receive a compensation 20 per cent less than the prices fixed by the
							joint Resolution of 1819,—but Fornance and <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> insisted upon the
							consideration of their respective motions to reconsider first my
							amendment to <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Resolution for
							the adoption of the Rules, and secondly the Resolution itself adopting
							the rules with my amendment— <persRef ref="everett-horace"
								>Everett</persRef> opposed the consideration of Ingersoll’s motion,
							as out of order, as it certainly was— But a Slave holding Speaker could
							not reject this new convert to the servile cause—and Wise, and <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">Cost Johnson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="king-thomas2">King</persRef> of Georgia, were all clamorous for
							hearing Ingersoll and he proceeded in an elaborate speech on three
							points—The African Slave trade—the internal Slave trade and Slavery—and
							the Right of Petition— He spoke nearly an hour on the first point the
							African Slave-trade; frequently interrupted by <persRef ref="botts-john"
								>Botts</persRef> as out of order, but sustained by Wise, Johnson and
							King and feebly resisted by the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef>, who always finished by letting him go on— He
							enlarged the range of debate by bringing in the African Slave-trade; and
							I begged that he might be allowed to proceed in his own way—allowing
							others to reply— Between 5 and six a motion was made to adjourn and
							carried by yeas and nays— Thermometer over 90. Utterly impossible to
							read or write in the Evening.</p>

						<p>The weather continues intensely warm, with alternations of blazing Sun

							convenience to bathe before breakfast, and I have no other disposable
							time— <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef> was here twice, morning and Evening.—in the

								ref="badger-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Badger</persRef>,
							and delivered to him the recommendations of M<hi rend="superscript"

							office and leave a vacancy to be filled. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Badger said there could not possibly be presented stronger, or more

							requesting the discharge of <persRef ref="cary-thomas4">her

							would perhaps be advisable to repeal the Law, authorising such
							enlistments—but asked a written answer to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Cary’s application which he promised— I called upon
								<persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, about the Marshal’s auction sale this day. of
								<persRef ref="johnson-george4">George Johnson’s</persRef> lots 20

							upon his promise to renew it. Marshall then made a splendid two hours
							speech, at and against me, and closed by renewing the demand of the
							Previous Question— A motion was made to lay the whole subject on the

							yeas and nays and the question to reconsider the vote adopting my

						<p>Unabated and oppressive heat. I attended again the Orphan’s Court, and

							accordingly and took the affidavit with me together with a copy,
							furnished me of the inventory and appraisement returned of <persRef
								ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy Leary’s</persRef> effects— At the house,
								<persRef ref="hunt-hiram">Hiram P. Hunt</persRef> a mellow whig
							member from New-York who occupies the seat immediately before mine gave
							notice of his intention to ask leave to bring in a bill to repeal the
							act of 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> October 1837. to postpone the
							fourth instalment of deposite with the States— Hunt is a busy body
							Marplot in the morning, and always fuddled after dinner— The fourth
							instalment has been long since used up and wasted by the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef> Administration, and it is
							too late to call for it now.— To raise money from the people, by
							taxation now, merely to deposite with the States, will not meet with
							much encouragement from Congress. But it will consume time— Sundry other
							members asked <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> to allow them a
							minute or two to offer resolutions, but he was biting his curb bit, and
							rudely refused. After much solicitation he permitted Botts to enquire of
							the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>, whether a
							reconsideration of the vote adopting the rules, would not annul all the
							proceedings of the House under the rules.—Without waiting for the
							Speaker’s answer Wise began in a tone, which I saw would break him
							down—Loud—vociferous. declamatory—furibund—he raved about the hell-hound
							of abolition, and at me as the leader of the abolitionists throughout
							the Union, for a full hour till his voice had broken into childish
							treble two or three times— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>
							of Tennessee came to my seat, and with deep earnestness intreated me not
							to reply to him, and I promised that I would not. Without abatement of
							his vehemence Wise came to speak of the controversy between the States
							of Virginia and New-York; and then his tone suddenly fell—he became
							bewildered in his argument; his voice failed him, he became ghastly pale
							said he felt himself unwell, sank into his chair and fainted. Several of
							his friends flew to his assistance, led him out of the Hall, and took
							him to his lodgings— The house postponed the further consideration of
							the Subject till to-morrow.— Then after a sufficient dose of Kinderhoek
							Chicanery, and an appeal by <persRef ref="atherton-charles"
								>Atherton</persRef> from a decision of the speaker, confirmed by a
							vote of nearly two to one <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef>

							a recommendatory Letter from <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge
								Cranch</persRef>, and a request that I would sit to him for a
							drawing of my bust for the judge, which I consented to do at 7. next
							Monday Morning.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Franquinet had with him
							a Portrait of judge Cranch and one of a young Lady in New-York, to show
							as samples of his art—very good— A Stranger from Philadelphia named
								<persRef ref="gold-job">Gold</persRef> came to enquire, whether the
							slave population in this Country increased the numbers of the House of
							Representatives? and how? He thought that a Southern Planter with 500

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bishop</persRef>, an inventor of
							a mode of making cloth out of wool without spinning or weaving— He had
							with him some samples of his cloth— He has taken out here a patent for
							his invention—is going to England to obtain a patent there, and applies
							to me for Letters of recommendation— He presented to me, a
							recommendatory letter, addressed to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef>, <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>,
							and myself signed by <persRef ref="bissell-clark">Clark

								ref="isaacs-charles">Charles Isaacs</persRef> and <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise</persRef> was in his seat; but
							apparently very feeble, and his motion of reconsideration was again

								>five members</persRef> from Alabama to come in— <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> came in two or three days

							The Legislature of that State to secure a full jacobin representation
							changed their mode of election for members of the house from the
							District to the general ticket system— They are all of course slave
							dealers— The States were now called for Petitions; and beginning with
							Maine and were gone through. I presented none—abstaining purposely— But
								<persRef ref="mattocks-john">Mattocks</persRef> of Vermont presented
							an abolition petition, which produced an immediate explosion.— The
							motion to receive it, was laid on the table— The Committee on the Rules,
							reported, that during the present Session, it shall be understood that
							objection is made to the reception of all petitions and the motion to
							receive shall be laid on the table— This report was not within the
							reference to the Committee, and Wise and his gang resisted its adoption
							by the house. So did I—only however by voting against it— I cannot agree
							to the exclusion of all petitions, with partial and favourite exceptions
							for a whole session— There were seven motions for adjournment taken by
							the yeas and nays and rejected— The report of the Committee was carried,
							and a motion to reconsider rejected— Evening with <persRef

						<p>Inexorable heat day and night. I attended public worship this morning at
							the second Presbyterian Church, and heard <persRef ref="wood-george2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef>, from Romans
							5.21. “That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so, might grace reign
							through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord,”
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood said that the sum total of the
							Christian dispensation— The whole chapter is a parallel between the
							visitation of punishment upon the whole race of <persRef ref="adam"
								>Adam</persRef>, derivative from his sin of disobedience, and the
							restoration of the same family of man to eternal life, by the suffering
							and obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ.— This is the great doctrine of
								<persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Paul</persRef>—figurative and allegorical— Jesus, is the <hi
								rend="italic">Lamb</hi> of God, that taketh away the sins of the
							world—as the <hi rend="italic">Dove</hi> is the Spirit of God alighting
							upon him and abiding with him— Just as Jesus was a lamb, just as the
							holy Ghost was a dove, just so was the sin of Adam a curse upon all his
							posterity, and just so was the crucifixion of Christ, the atonement for
							the primeval sin, and the restoration of the whole family of man to the
							Grace of God. And if so what remnant is there left of original sin, for
							any individual of this or any preceding age since the death of Christ to
							be responsible for— As in Adam all sinned so in Christ all were restored
							to life— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood had preached this Sermon
							once before, and said that he now repeated it, at the request of one of
							the members of the Congregation— He delivered it in a very heavy in
							inanimate manner, and he said it was impossible under such a heated
							atmosphere to discourse with the energy which might be necessary for the
							occasion— The evening service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church was postponed till 5. p.m. on account of the heat of the weather—
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> then read Prayers for the first Sunday after
							Trinity, with an additional prayer for rain, and preached from <persRef
								ref="luke">Luke</persRef> 19.40. “And he answered and said unto
							them, I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones
							would immediately cry out.”— As Jesus was approaching Jerusalem, he was
							followed by multitudes of the People, shouting, Blessed be the <hi
								rend="italic">King</hi> that cometh in the name of the Lord. It was
							for this that the Pharisees called on him to rebuke his disciples; and
							this was his reply— He afterwards said that his kingdom was not of this
							world; but it was for suffering himself to be hailed as a king, and
							countenancing the pretension, that he was crucified— This Evening,
								<persRef ref="moseley-william2">General William H. Moseley</persRef>
							of Northampton, Massachusetts, paid me a visit of curiosity. also
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel

							a member of the U.S. house of Representatives in the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> Congress from 1831 to 1833— <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> also spent the Evening here—
							There was a breeze throughout the day, but the deadly night calm came
							with the setting Sun and overcame me till I felt dropping into a
							lethargy—</p>

						<p>At 7 this morning <persRef ref="franquinet-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Franquinet</persRef> came and began
							his portrait of me in crayons, he breakfasted with us and asked for
							another sitting to morrow morning to which I consented. He is a native
							Belgian, an experienced Connoisseur in the art of painting, and greatly
							admires the last portrait by <persRef ref="stuart-gilbert"
								>Stewart</persRef> of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							in his 90<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year— But his likeness of me is
							already a failure, and will in no respect equal that which he has taken,
							of <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="homer-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Homer</persRef>
							came in and introduced a gentleman whose name I did not retain and who
							came to see me only from curiosity— I had received a note from <persRef
								ref="webb-jf">J. F. Webb</persRef> the broker, which induced me to
							call at his Office and at that of the Franklin insurance company’s
							Office; but there was no person at either of them. At the House
							immediately after the reading of the Journal <persRef ref="wise-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise</persRef> resumed his
							speech in support of <persRef ref="fornance-joseph">Fornance’s</persRef>
							motion to reconsider the vote adopting the old rules except the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> and spoke for upwards of six hours a
							continued invective upon me— He was apparently recovered from his
							fainting fit of last Friday, and he had sufficient self controul to
							avoid the bawling, brawling tone with which he then broke himself
							down—but beginning every successive sentence with a loud and vehement
							clatter; he immediately bowed down over his desk till his head and chest
							became horizontal, his mouth pouring out all the time his words in a
							whisper. Abolition—abolition—abolition—was the unvarying cry, and he
							represented me as a fiend, the inspirer and leader of all abolition— He
							gave a history in his own way full of misrepresentations of all the gag
							motions, orders and resolutions down to the Rule of 28. January
							1840—from <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">Pinckney’s</persRef> gag in
							1835— He finished about half past six when half a dozen members started
							up and <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> moved the previous
							question— <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner</persRef> of North
							Carolina intreated him to withdraw the motion, and promised that he
							would renew it—but Botts persisted—there was a call of the house, but
							only 210 members answered to their names— The previous question was then
							put and carried and then the reconsideration was carried by a vote of
							106 to 104 and the house was again left without rules— Several motions
							were then made with great confusion and disorder till a motion was made
							to adjourn and carried by yeas, and nays. I came home about 8 O’Clock in
							great tribulation, and perplexed in the dilemma between firm
							perseverance, intemperate retaliation and tame submission. What I most
							need and fervently pray for, is controul over my own temper. <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel

								<persRef ref="lincoln-jotham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jotham

							Treasury Department to give him and his family bread— He was turned out
							of an inspectors Office by <persRef ref="henshaw-david">David
								Henshaw</persRef> in May 1829.— And having engaged in mercantile
							business since has been recently ruined by the failure of his partner—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitcomb asked me to introduce him to

							has a curious collection of the figures of many distinguished men of
							this country assembled together and stand in one hall in relative
							positions to each other forming a very pleasant tableau, and many of

								Grammer</persRef>, who told me that he had lately purchased 200
							dollars of the Stock of the Company at par—and that the 500 dollars

								Webb</persRef> belonged to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Evans</persRef> of Baltimore who has lately failed— And

							<persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Kenneth Rayner</persRef> of North-Carolina
							had offered an amendment to strike out the whole of the Resolution after
							the word resolved—and insert a resolution adopting the old rules, till
							otherwise ordered by the house, and for appointing a committee of 9
							members to revise the rules, and confirming the choice of Officers and
							appointment of Committees hitherto made—this amendment was then objected
							to as out of order and the house adjourned— This morning after about an
							hour of wrangling upon points of order, and a refusal of a motion for
							the previous question Rayner got the floor and in a splendid Speech of
							three hours rang over all the changes of invective upon me and of
							Slave-breeding rhodomontade about abolition and the rights and
							institutions of the South: but on closing his speech he forgot to offer
							his amendment— <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> of New
							York started up and after disclaiming a declaration which he said I had
							made, moved the previous question— I called on him to specify the
							declaration. His answer showed he did not understand what I had said—
							Rayner finally got his amendment before the house which was slashed up
							into fragments and finally rejected—so was another amendment which he
							next proposed, and lastly the question was again taken upon the adoption
							of the old rules with my amendment except the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> and lost by a vote of 107 to 104 several of the members on
							both sides changing their votes to make up a majority.— The house then

							at Bristol in England— Is 56 years old. at the age of 14 he was taken by
							a Master of an American Vessel and brought to this Country where he was
							bound as an apprentice to learn the art of Navigation— From that time he
							went to sea as an American Seaman till the war of 1812—with a protection
							under the name of <persRef ref="geyer-john">John Geyer</persRef> to
							escape from British impressment— At the breaking out of the War of 1812
							he was on a Voyage to India. He was taken, carried to the Cape of Good
							hope. kept there two years and a half as a prisoner of War—then
							transfered to Dartmoor prison in England where in the butchery of
							American prisoners in April 1815 he was shot with a musket ball, and
							lost his leg by amputation.— He has a pension of 6 dollars a month: and
							has been ten or twelve years keeper of the light-house at tarpaulin
							cove. and there is a petition to the <persRef ref="ewing-thomas"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to turn him out, because he
							attended and voted at a <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van

							certificate from <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasonton</persRef> that his
							light-house has him invariably well and faithfully kept— Hayden asked me
							to obtain access for him; I went with him, introduced him to M<hi

							presented his papers—intreating his decision this day; which he promised
							to give— I had also a long visit from <persRef ref="freeman-russell"

								ref="stuart-alexander2">Stuart</persRef> of Virginia offered a
							Resolution of compromise, to hang up all petitions for this Session and
							put off the debate on the rule to the winter Session, and moved the

							motion was carried 119 to 103. <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Stanley</persRef> immediately moved and carried a vote against
							reconsideration to prevent a motion for it from being made to-morrow,
							and the house adjourned about 6. O’Clock The Marine corps band of music.
							performed several airs and marches on the grounds fronting the Eastern
							flight of stairs of the Capitol. There was a crowd of company to hear

							solicit an office in one of the Departments, because he was lately
							graduated at some college with the highest honours; because he is in
							poor health; and because he is a moral man, and he said he understood
							that many of the Clerks in the public offices were not moral men— He
							wanted a recommendation from me, which I declined to give— His intellect
							seemed disordered— I called at the Treasury Department, but the <persRef
								ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary Ewing</persRef> was at the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef>— I enquired of the <persRef
								ref="young-mcclintock">Chief Clerk</persRef>, whether the late
								<persRef ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef>, had
							drawn upon the Treasury for any part of his Salary, and was informed
							that he had not— I then called at the Department of State and enquired
							of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> whether the census returns were or would be ready
							for communication to Congress during the present Session— He said they
							were all ready—except from one District in Kentucky and one in
							Louisiana. I had half an hour’s conversation with him upon the cases of
								<persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> and of the Amistad— When
							Harrison came into office, he determined to remove Trist from the Office
							of Consult at the Havana.— Trist took himself off to Charleston S.C M<hi

							removed, but before receiving the Letter he embarked and returned to the
							Havana— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler declined to remove him

								<persRef ref="deargaiz-pedro">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Argaiz</persRef> the Spanish Minister upon the Amistad case, and

							called again at <persRef ref="palmer-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Palmer’s</persRef> lodgings, but he was out. At the
							house I put the question to the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef>, whether the standing Committees appointed under
							Rules cancelled by the reconsideration of the resolution adopting them
							were still extant— I did not so consider them, or hold myself a member
							of any such committee— And to test the sense of the house I moved the
							usual order that the standing committees of the house be now appointed.
							The Speaker said that the motion was not in order; as he considered the
							appointment of the standing committees already made as in full force. I
							then asked to be excused from serving as chairman of the Committee on
							Indian Affairs, and was excused without opposition— <persRef

							hours was reported to the house, with the blank filled with 25000

							previous questions, and refusals to adjourn, was passed to be engrossed
							and passed—122 to 66. Adjourned at half past 8. p.m.</p>

								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> public worship this morning
							in the Hall of the House of Representatives where the services were
							performed by the Chaplain of the House, the <persRef ref="french-john"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> French</persRef> of Georgetown— He read the prayers for
							the second Sunday after Trinity with out the Litany or the Communion
							service and preached from Matthew 22:37. [“]Jesus said unto him, thou
							shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
							and with all thy mind, 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39.
							And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbour as
							thyself. 40. On these two commandments hang all the law and the
							prophets” The discourse was specially addressed to the members of
							Congress of whom there were about twenty present, and it contained an
							exposition of the preacher’s summary of duties incumbent on a Christian
							Legislator— He dealt of course in generalities, and revealed no new
							discovery. He began by saying that all the duties of man, might be
							divided into two Classes—duties of Religion, and duties of morality—
							This was a clear and natural partition: and perfectly conformable to his
							text— But when he said that the duties of a Christian Legislator were
							all comprized in the Love of God, and the love of his Country, he
							narrowed down the second division of the Saviour’s summary of human
							duties from the Christian to the Roman standard, from universal humanity
							to patriotism—what a falling off was there! Patriotism, is one
							modification of the Law of universal benevolence— Friendship is
							another—the family affections a third— The Christian’s duty embraces
							them all; and when they conflict with each other as they too often
							inevitably do, there is but one umpire between them and that
							is—Justice—inexorable justice— There is no impulse to action operating
							upon the heart of man, more potent to lead him astray from the path of
							Justice, than Patriotism— The Christian Legislator therefore must be not
							only a Patriot, but a Philanthropist—he must love not only his Country,
							but his neighbour and his neighbour is every individual of the human
							family, friend or foe. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French is in a low
							state of health— He appeared to preach without notes. His elocution is
							good—his manner emphatic and impressive—his action graceful and
							oratorical— He gave out a psalm to be sung, but there were no singers,
							and he gave notice that the <persRef ref="tustin-septimus"
								>chaplain</persRef> of the Senate would preach next Sunday. I walked
							home, and on my way stopped at the National Intelligencer Office and saw
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							adjourn, they would adjourn over to Monday— The Resolutions were adopted
							without opposition, and sent to the Senate— The States were called for
							Petitions— Only three were presented— I had none— No Reports from
							Committees— <persRef ref="floyd-john3">Floyd’s</persRef> Resolution

							went into the Senate chamber where I found them taking the question upon
							the Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="harrison-anna">M<hi

								>r.</hi><space/>Moore</persRef> preached from Galatians 6.7. [“]Be not
							deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
							also reap. 8. For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap
							corruption: but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
							life everlasting”— The Epistle to the Galatians, is the argument of
								<persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> to prove that the Levitical law
							was so far superseded by the gospel of Christ, that the Gentiles or
							heathen converts to the gospel were not bound to the observance of it—
							In this opinion Paul appears among the apostles to have stood alone— For
								<persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, who by a supernatural
							revelation had received the command to admit the Gentiles into the
							communion of Christianity, still insisted that they must submit to the
							rite of circumcision, and to some indefinite extent to the observance of
							the Mosaic ritual— There had been sharp contention between Paul and
							Peter, upon this question at Antioch—and this epistle written from Rome,
							where Paul was then suffering persecution and imprisonment for the faith
							runs in a strain of severe censure, and indignant remonstrance.— He
							relates the story of his own conversion; reminds the Galatians, that he
							had been the first preacher of the gospel to them, and marvels that they
							should so soon suffer themselves to be troubled by the pretension to
							exact from them the observance of the rite of circumcision— His argument
							is that the Law was a temporary dispensation for the government of the
							children of Israel, preparatory to the promise, made 430 years before to
								<persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>, that in him all the
							families of the earth should be blessed— The fulfilment of this promise
							by the advent of the Messiah superseded the obligation of the Law, and
							faith in Christ was thenceforward to be substituted for the ritual of
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>.— The style of stern but
							affectionate reproof was preserved throughout the whole epistle— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood gave notice of a Sunday School Union
							meeting of the three presbyterian churches in this city next Sunday.—
							After dinner a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							read the service for the third Sunday after Trinity, and preached from
							Ecclesiastes 3.2—“a time to die”— A cold treatment of a grave subject—a

							church I met <persRef ref="folsom-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>r</hi> Habersham proposed some slight amendments to the Bill for
							repealing the subtreasury Law, which after some modification were
							adopted. The Chairman had proposed on Saturday an additional section to
							repeal one Section of the act of June 1836, which it is understood will

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Botts embracing that of M<hi

							Journal, <persRef ref="dawson-william">W. C. Dawson</persRef>, Chairman
							of the Committee on Military Affairs announced the decease of <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">Major-General Alexander Macomb</persRef>, and
							offered three Resolutions. 1. of regret for the event 2. to attend the

							Immediately after the adjournment the Committee on the Currency met

								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="mckeon-john">M’Keon</persRef> the 9<hi rend="superscript"

							reporting the repeal bill, till at least the Committee shall have
							considered of a substitute for the sub-treasury. Rhett and M’Kay are
							against reporting the repeal bill at-all— The Committee agreed to meet
							again to-morrow immediately after the adjournment of the house— The
							suddenness of the notice of the funeral prevented the attendance of any
							of the members at the house of the deceased— As many hacks as could be
							found disengaged were provided by the Committee of arrangements— I rode

								ref="gates-seth">Seth M. Gates</persRef>, and a friend of his from
							New-York State joining the procession, as after coming up the avenue it

							me—but he and his Colleague <persRef ref="claiborne-john"
								>Claiborne</persRef> had signed and published in the globe a furious
							and most abusive attack upon me in the shape of an address to their
							Constituents. But another reason for postponing the presentation of the
							charges was that the State of Mississippi is not represented in the
							house and whether represented by Gholson’s friends or adversaries, they
							should be here when charges are presented against him— The <persRef
								ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> resolution was postponed—
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union <persRef
								ref="lawrence-joseph">Joseph Lawrence</persRef> in the chair on the
							land Bill. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>
							finished his speech, and <persRef ref="clifford-nathan"
								>Clifford</persRef> of Maine, commenced a speech against the Bill.
							At 3. the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. Select Committee on
							the Currency— All present except W. Cost Johnson— Desultory discussion.
							Adjourned to Friday Morning at 9. Intelligencer Office—left with him A.
							Hamilton’s Manuscripts— Evening visits from <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholls</persRef> who wants a
							Consulate from <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef>,
							member from Kentucky, and from <persRef ref="crane-watts">Watts

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="ross-john">John Ross</persRef>, Chief of
							the Cherokee Nation with <persRef ref="vann-david">Vann</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">Benn</persRef> two others of the delegation. Ross
							had written to request an interview with me for them, on my appointment
							as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs— I was excused from that
							service at my own request from a full conviction that its only result
							would be to keep a perpetual harrow upon my feelings, with a total
							impotence to render any useful service— The Policy from <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> to myself of all the
							Presidents of the United States had been Justice and kindness to the
							Indian tribes—to civilize and preserve them— With the Creeks and
							Cherokees it had been eminently successful.— Its success was their
							misfortune— The States within whose borders their settlements were took
							the alarm, broke down all the Treaties which had pledged the faith of
							the Nation.— Georgia extended her jurisdiction over them—took possession
							of their Lands, houses, cattle, furniture, negroes, and drove them out
							from their own dwellings— All the Southern States supported Georgia, in
							this utter prostration of faith and justice, and <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef> by the simultaneous
							operation of fraudulent treaties and brutal force consummated the work—
							The Florida War is one of the fruits of this policy; the conduct of
							which exhibits one interrupted scene, of the most profligate corruption—
							All resistance against this abomination is vain— It is among the heinous
							sins of this Nation for which I believe God will one day bring them to
							judgment—but at his own time, and by his own means. I turned my eyes
							away from this sickening mass of putrefaction, and asked to be excused
							from serving as the Chairman of the Committee— Ross and his colleagues
							are here, claiming indemnity for the household furniture, goods, and
							cattle stolen from their people, when they were expelled from their
							dwellings; and a new treaty to give them some shadow of security for the
							permanent possession of the lands to which they have been driven— They
							complain of delays, and neglect by the new Secretary of War, <persRef
								ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, and I
							promised to speak to him in their behalf—and I told them to call upon me
							freely, if upon any occasion I could be serviceable to them. At the
							house, immediately after the reading of the journal, Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="lawrence-joseph"
								>Lawrence</persRef> in the Chair on the land-bill. <persRef
								ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> finished his speech,
							followed by <persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> of
							Georgia, <persRef ref="howard-jacob">Howard</persRef> of Michigan,
								<persRef ref="kennedy-andrew">Kennedy</persRef> of Indiana, and
								<persRef ref="alford-julius">Alford</persRef> of Georgia till 3.
							O’Clock, when <persRef ref="brown-charles3">Charles Brown</persRef> of
							Philadelphia took the floor, the Committee rose and the house adjourned—
								<persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef> took tea here— Music at the Capitol—</p>
