						<p>Public worship at the second Presbyterian Church, where a Stranger
							preached from <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon’s</persRef> Song, which he
							called the Canticles. 5.10: “the chiefest among ten thousand.”— A
							singular text upon which to construct a panegyric of Jesus Christ— The
							preceding words of the same verse are, “my beloved is white and ruddy,”
							and the remainder of the chapter is a description of his person in the
							wildest style of oriental imagery. Nor does it appear to be a suitable
							text for a commentary on the Saviour of the world, to call him the
							chiefest among ten thousand.— a mere General of a small army— The first
							among his peers— The Song of Solomon is an admirable specimen of
							romantic and dramatic antient literature— A parallel between the Hebrew
							and Grecian Schools of Literature would form a fine subject for a
							Dissertation when shall I have time to make the attempt? The preacher
							this morning, concentrated his whole discourse into a mere eulogy of
							Jesus, as if the whole duty of man consisted in the worship of him. But
							he closed by addressing his impenitent friends of the congregation and
							exhorting them very earnestly to repentance— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys</persRef> of Annapolis, read
							prayers for the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity,
							and preached from <persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef> 15.7. “I say unto
							you, that likewise joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that
							repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no
							repentance.”— This is evidently a hyperbole— Taken literally it has the
							aspect of an invitation to sin for the sake of repenting; and so it has
							been insidiously construed by the profligates <persRef
								ref="stanhope-philip">Chesterfield</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="rousseau-john">John B. Rousseau</persRef>. The Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys,
							who stands 6 feet 4 without his shoes, has a very cold manner of
							delivery, but his discourse was sensible and ration—like the preacher of
							this manner he has the habit of addressing his auditory by the
							denomination of my impenitent friend, a style very common in this part
							of the Country among the calvinistic preachers. In undertaking to assign
							the reasons why there should be more joy in heaven over one repenting
							sinner than over ninety nine just persons who need no repentance, he
							found a difficulty to reconcile with his creed, which is that there are
							no such just persons, all mankind being sinners more or less. And in
							this as in numberless cases the preacher was more successful in raising
							a difficulty than in removing it— I am still suffering with the
							complaint brought on me by the intense heat of the Season; and as this
							Evening came on finding my Spirits much depressed I walked the square
							round by the Navy and War Departments, and on my return home, stopped
							and returned the visit of <persRef ref="smith-samuel">S. Harrison
								Smith</persRef>— I have so little heart for any intellectual labour
							that I spent all the leisure of this day in franking a number of copies
							of my Amistad Argument sent me from New-York, directed to lawyers in all
							the free States of the Union— I have still under consideration <persRef

						<p>Petition day. I had only three or four, all abolition petitions to
							present, but I was desirous of presenting a resolution: the Journal of
							Saturday however had no sooner been read than <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef>, chairman of the select
							Committee on the currency moved to go into Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union with a view to take up the Bank Bill from the Senate—
							I enquired if it was intended that no more petitions should be
							presented, and no more resolutions acted upon at the present Session of
							Congress— Several other members urged the allowance at least of the
							morning hour, to the reception of Petitions and Resolutions. But
							Sergeant persisted, and the house went into Committee. The <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> called <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> to the Chair, but he
							asked to be excused, and <persRef ref="clark-john">John C.
								Clark</persRef> was substituted in his place— <persRef
								ref="roosevelt-james">James I. Roosevelt</persRef> from the City of
							New-York attempted to snatch the floor away from Sergeant, by moving the
							committee to take up the bankrupt bill—but Sergeant objected that the
							chairman had not announced the Committee to be in Session, though in
							fact this is never done. The Chairman however did so now; and Sergeant
							was too quick for Roosevelt in moving to take up the Senate’s Bank Bill—
							Roosevelt, failed in his dishonest attempt to get the floor, said he saw
							the house intended to give the go-by to the Bankrupt Bill, and the house
							laughed at him. Sergeant, after promising that the object of the special
							Session was to put the affairs of the Country in order, assumed that the
							concerns of the Government never could be managed well without the
							agency of a Bank and for proof went back to the institution of the Bank
							of North America by the Confederation Congress in December 1781. He then
							pursued the subject historically; but confined his argument almost
							exclusively to the position, that although one’s private opinion might
							be against the authority of Congress to establish a Bank, he might
							safely wave the constitutional question, as <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>President Madison</persRef> did in 1816.— After Sergeant, <persRef
								ref="mcclellan-robert">Robert M’Clellan</persRef> of New-York wore
							out his hour against the Bill, as did <persRef ref="saunders-romulus"
								>Romulus M Saunders</persRef> of North Carolina. <persRef
								ref="stuart-alexander2">Alexander H. H. Stuart</persRef> of
							Virginia, vindicated the Bank of 1816. as a democratic establishment.
								<persRef ref="kennedy-andrew">Andrew Kennedy</persRef> of Indiana
							spouted rabblement eloquence for his hour against the bill. <persRef
								ref="mason-john10">John Thompson Mason</persRef> of Maryland took
							the floor on the same side at 4 O’Clock: the Committee rose, and the
							house adjourned: <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> gave
							notice that he would move a resolution on to morrow to take the bill out
							of Committee next Friday at 2 O’Clock. <persRef ref="buchanan-robert"

						<p>I was again belated this morning in reaching the house, and missed the
							opportunity of presenting three abolitions, several others, not of the
							same character having been presented and received, by general consent— I
							found <persRef ref="yulee-david">Levy</persRef> the Delegate from
							Florida, attempting to get up for consideration his Resolution of
							enquiry upon the <persRef ref="bell-john">Secretary of War</persRef>— I
							said I had an amendment to it to offer; whereupon all was drop’d by
							instinct, that is, by general consent— Levy, and <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="randall-alexander">Randall</persRef> of Baltimore came to my
							seat to enquire what my amendment was, and I gave it to each of them to
							read— The house will hear no more of Levy’s Resolution, unless he can
							slip it through in my absence— <persRef ref="oliver-william">William M
								Oliver</persRef> of New-York had given notice yesterday that he
							would this day offer a Resolution to amend the rules so that the yeas
							and nays may be taken in the house upon amendments rejected in the

								ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> objected to its reception,
							and <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved to lay it
							on the table. Much altercation whether it was received or not. Question
							upon laying on the table at last taken by yeas and nays, and carried 107
							to 84.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef> in the chair, on the Bank
							Bill from the Senate— <persRef ref="mason-john10">John Thompson
								Mason</persRef> of Hagerstown announced that he opposed the Bill on
							original grounds—all his own—his main argument was that the Legislature
							of Maryland had by the State Constitution no power to charter a Bank;
							whence he inferred that they could not grant to Congress the power to
							charter a bank in the District of Columbia; and of such materials was
							his hour’s speech composed. <persRef ref="brown-charles3">Charles
								Brown</persRef> of Philadelphia followed for his hour; and said he
							should make a different speech from what he would have made if he would
							have made if he had got the floor yesterday— This is a sample of the
							man; an empty demagogue, but not crabbed or sour tempered— <persRef
								ref="washington-william3">William H. Washington</persRef> of North
							Carolina the youngest member of the house made a speech of 40 minutes in
							favour of the bill, worth more than all the declamations against it,
							past, present and to come— <persRef ref="wood-fernando">Fernando
								Wood</persRef>, from the City of New-York came next against the
							Bill—he said he was not a talking man, but he talked nonsense and
							knavery for an hour, threatening to repeal the bill if it should pass,
							because a rabble of his constituents have passed resolutions that it
							shall be done.— <persRef ref="payne-william3">William W. Payne</persRef>
							of Alabama, closed the debate for the day, with violent denunciation of
							the unconstitutionality of a Bank; when he closed <persRef
								ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> said that Payne had
							introduced into the Legislature of Alabama a Resolution instructing the
							Senators in Congress and requesting the Representatives to introduce and
							support a bill to establish a National Bank, with a Capital of 100
							millions of dollars. Payne said he had nothing to say to that— A shout
							of laughter. </p>

						<p>I wrote this morning a short note to <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>, who has my power of
							Attorney for the management of much of my property in this city
							requesting a supply, and received from him this evening a check on the
							Bank of Washington for 400 dollars— I finished this morning the despatch
							of about 250 copies of my Amistad Argument, sent me, directed to sundry
							lawyers in the free States from Maine to Michigan.— At the house,
								<persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> called up his
							resolution to take the Bank-Bill out of Committee next Friday at 12.
							O’Clock but the question now being on a motion to strike out the
							enacting clause of the Bill, no amendment to it can be moved, till that
							is decided; and as the debate upon it will be continued until the
							limited time for taking the bill out of Committee there will be no time
							even to offer amendments, and certainly none for debating them— After
							much underbrush conversation Morgan, after an ineffectual motion for a
							call of the house, rejected by yeas and nays 80 to 89. modified his
							resolution so as to fix next Tuesday, instead of Friday to take the Bill
							out of Committee; rejected by yeas and nays 55 to 136. <persRef

								<persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef>, who

							propositions of amendments—two or three were moved to the first section
							by others, upon which when the questions were put, not more than half a
							dozen voices answered aye, while the negatives sounded like peals of
							thunder. I saw that the caucus decree of last Evening was in full
							operation.— I nevertheless proposed the amendment of which I had given
							notice yesterday to the first section, and one other— They were rejected
							like the rest.— I then said that observing the repugnance of the

							I had proposed, except that in the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							Article of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section, respecting the

						<p><persRef ref="miller-daniel2">Daniel L. Miller</persRef>, is a young <hi
								rend="italic">Friend</hi> from Philadelphia. He brought me a Letter
							of recommendation from his uncle <persRef ref="webb-samuel2">Samuel
								Webb</persRef>. He comes here on business of his own, and said he
							wished an introduction to <persRef ref="choate-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus Choate</persRef>, one of the
							Senators from Massachusetts— I told him I would call for him this
							morning at 9. O’Clock and go with him to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Choate’s lodgings, and there introduce him, which I accordingly did—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Choate who lodges at <persRef
								ref="sewall-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Sewall’s</persRef> at first sent word that he was very much engaged;
							but I sent my name, and he came down— I introduced my young quaker
							friend to him, and left them together— The house fell into a snarl in a
							struggle finally successful to take up the bill from the Senate to
							repeal the sub-treasury—reported by the currency Committee to the house,
							with amendments. <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> moved
							to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up
							that Bill— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>
							proposed the District Bank Bill— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D.
								Barnard</persRef>, the Bankrupt Bill<space/>the Bill to amend the
							act to provide for taking the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Caucus—
							After much confusion this last was taken up, but <persRef
								ref="randall-alexander">Alexander Randall</persRef> had an amendment
							to it to offer, but was not in his seat, and coming in shortly after was
							not ready— The Bill was laid aside, and the Bankrupt bill taken up and
							read through—immediately after which a motion was made to lay it aside
							and take up the repeal Bill— Barnard said he would not press the further
							consideration of the Bankrupt-Bill now, but the vote could not be
							carried to take up in Committee the repeal Bill.— After an excessively
							confused wrangle, and a hot cross-fire of calls to order a motion was
							made and carried for the committee to rise, <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> the chairman gave the
							Chair to the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>, and Sergeant
							moved to discharge the Committee of the whole from the further
							consideration of the repeal Bill. <persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin"
								>Bidlack</persRef> objected that as a money Bill, it must by the
							rules be first discussed in Committee of the whole— The Speaker decided
							that the motion to discharge the Committee of the whole from the
							consideration of a Bill was not debatable— I appealed from the decision,
							but the Speaker refused to entertain the appeal. The previous question
							was carried—on putting the main question, I did not vote, and asked to
							assign my reason. The Speaker said it was not in order. The vote by yeas
							and nays to discharge the Committee was 103 to 102. and it was carried
							by <persRef ref="sollers-augustus">Sollers</persRef> changing his vote.—
							Then came the question whether the Bill discharged took precedence of
							all other business in the house. The Speaker decided that it did.
								<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> appealed; but on
							learning from the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk</persRef> that the
							same bill, was the first, in order on the Calendar withdrew the appeal,
							which I renewed. but the Speaker refused to receive the appeal. Next
							followed a Cock and a Bull squabble between <persRef ref="pearce-james"
								>James A. Pearce</persRef>, and <persRef ref="mason-john10">John T.
								Mason</persRef>, two members from Maryland— Then a speech of an hour
							from <persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Gordon</persRef> of New-York and
							another from <persRef ref="shields-benjamin">Shields</persRef> of
							Alabama, both against the Bank bill— I presented the Petition from the
							Stone-cutters, which was referred to the Committee of ways and means and
							near half past 3 the house adjourned. </p>

						<p>Morning service of public worship at the second Presbyterian Church:
							performed by a stranger. He preached from 2. Peter 1.10. [“]Wherefore
							the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling, and election
							sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.” How can this text
							be reconciled with the doctrine of free grace and predestination?— What
							diligence can make the calling and election sure if all that man can do,
							is worthless and unavailing? The institution of preaching itself
							presupposes that the conduct of men is influenced by persuasion— Here is
							exhortation, to give <hi rend="italic">diligence</hi>, one of the
							greatest of human virtues, and cheering encouragement to the hearer that
							in the exercise of that virtue—he shall never fall— Is it not in a moral
							point of view, a pernicious doctrine, that the salvation of man depends
							not on himself or his own exertions, but upon the atonement? is not its
							tendency more to recklessness, to despair—to suicide, than to saving
							faith? Is not the doctrine of vicarious punishment and virtue an
							impeachment both of the Justice and the goodness of God?— Afternoon at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the ninth Sunday after Trinity, and <persRef
								ref="burroughs-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burroughs</persRef>, rector of the episcopal church at Portsmouth
							New-Hampshire preached from Romans 11.21. [“]For if God spared not the
							natural branches, <hi rend="italic">take</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">heed</hi> lest he also spare not thee.” This chapter
							is addressed especially to the Gentiles, and the apostle in his parallel
							between the two classes of his converts, Jew and Gentile, is not a
							little puzzled with his own argument. He assumes that the Jews have
							forfeited their right to salvation, by the rejection of Christ, but
							maintains that God has reserved a portion of them to himself and that
							the exclusion of the rest is the instrumental cause of the admission of
							the Gentile world to the blessings of Christianity. He compares the
							Jewish Nation under the Mosaic Law to an Olive tree—and the Gentile
							world to a wild Olive tree; and pursuing the figure supposes the
							branches of the Olive tree to have been cut off, and the branches of the
							wild Olive to have been engrafted on the trunk of the Olive; and then
							comes the warning to the gentile convert—if God spared not the natural
							branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Burroughs urged that the admonition was in like manner
							applicable to us, and earnestly contended that vice and iniquity did so
							abound that we must look for the most fearful judgment of God.— There
							was something of bathos in the first specification of complaint against
							the manners of the age, consisting in the profanation of the Sabbath—but
							it passed— <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> were here— And

						<p>Call at <persRef ref="clagett-darius">Clagett’s</persRef>, and settled
							his bill— The Journal stated that the Navy Pension bill, returned from
							the Senate with amendments had been referred to the Committee of Ways
							and Means. It should have been to the Committee of Naval Affairs and was
							so amended at my motion— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W.
								Jones</persRef> presented factious Resolutions of a democratic
							meeting in Fauquier County, Virginia, against the extra Session of
							Congress and all the great measures proposed since it met— Jones moved
							they should be laid on the table and printed— <persRef
								ref="powell-cuthbert">Cuthbert Powell</persRef> who represents the
							Fauquier District, said that the Democratic meeting amounted to 33
							persons—that their Resolution threatening the repeal of the Bank Law was
							strongly contested among themselves, and was not the sentiment of the
							People of the District— The Resolutions were laid on the Table, but the
							motion to print was rejected by yeas and nays 107 to 76. <persRef
								ref="owsley-bryan">Bryan Y. Owsley</persRef> of Kentucky offered a
							joint resolution to adjourn on Wednesday the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi>
							<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> objected until the
							Bankrupt bill shall have been acted upon— The Committees were called for
							Reports, and then Resolutions were promiscuously offered— I presented
							one requiring of the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk</persRef> to
							prepare and report to the house at the commencement of the next Session
							a list of the Petitions, the reception of which has been suspended
							during the present Session— After a long struggle to dodge this
							Resolution, from all parts of the house, <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"
								>Gilmer</persRef> of Virginia moved to lay it on the table— I called
							for the yeas and nays—and with the utmost difficulty obtained them— They
							were 124 to 62. So utterly prostrate is the right of Petition in the
							house; and so ashamed are they who submitted to the expedient of
							excluding <hi rend="italic">all</hi> petitions to keep out the
							abolitionists, that any record of their prostitution should remain— A
							multitude of other resolutions were offered, very few of which were
							adopted.— <persRef ref="tyler-robert">Robert Tyler</persRef> came with a
							message, and the house was all agog for a veto of the Bank-bill— It was
							to announce that the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> had
							signed a Bill—to continue some charitable corporation at
							Alexandria—whereupon the house burst into a fit of laughter. The
							Sub-treasury repeal bill was now taken up, and discussed by <persRef

							house at half past 5— I had left not more than 50. members in the house—
							When Hastings finished his reading— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Giddings</persRef> moved the previous question— There was a call of
							the house, and 206 members had answered— I arrived just in time to vote
							upon an appeal from a decision of the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef>, by <persRef ref="williams-james3">James W
								Williams</persRef> of Maryland— The decision was sustained— The bill
							passed by 137 to 87. <persRef ref="halstead-william">Halsted</persRef>
							moved a reconsideration, and amidst riotous confusion told the whole
							story, how the bill passed by the spurious representation from
							New-Jersey— Adjourned a quarter past 6. Hoarse sore throat. </p>

						<p><persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> came into the house this morning

								ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> moved to go into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the
							bankrupt bill— Wise wished to take up the amendments from the Senate to
							the Navy pension-appropriation bill; but Barnard persisted, and by 77 to
							57. the house went into Committee, <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"
								>Tillinghast</persRef> in the Chair, and Barnard made his speech of
							a short hour in support of the Bill— There is no better subject for
							popular declamation than the distressed condition of hopeless
							insolvency— But the bill is a sponge. He said there were 500000 of these
							hopeless insolvents in the United States— <persRef ref="nisbet-eugenius"
								>Nisbett</persRef> of Georgia followed with a neat and elegant
							speech for the bill— <persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Gordon</persRef> of
							New-York snarled against it— This man in speaking keeps butting his head
							against the air, like a he goat— <persRef ref="roosevelt-james"
								>Roosevelt</persRef> from the city of New-York followed him in a
							remarkably pleasant, good tempered speech, gracefully delivered—
								<persRef ref="mason-samson">Sampson Mason</persRef> of Ohio took the
							same side, though he said he had long been undecided whether to vote for
							or against the Bill— The debate was very languid— Hardly any one seemed
							willing to say any thing on the subject, and the house was nearly
							deserted.— At last <persRef ref="ferris-charles">Charles G.
								Ferris</persRef> from the city of New-York, mustered courage to make
							a very sensible and not ineloquent speech against the Bill— Ferris
							contrasts with his colleague Roosevelt. He is a heavy, coarse, vulgar
							looking man, with a slouching dress, and slovenly deportment; but civil,
							courteous, and unpresuming. He speaks seldom, but very well, and in
							pointing out the radical defect of this bill dwelt upon its great
							characteristic feature, the total disregard of the creditor— I believe
							no bankrupt Law, can in this Country be of much benefit to the class of
							Creditors— The Bankrupt Law of 1800 operated as a receipt in full for
							some hundreds of men who had large debts and nothing to pay— This bill
							will pass some thousands through the same process— There has been for
							forty years since that Law expired an overpowering prejudice against any
							bankrupt Law; and now by a sudden and unaccountable revulsion there
							comes a whirlwind to carry it through— <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Salstonstall</persRef> took the floor—the Committee rose, and at

									>r</hi> Gonon</persRef> the Telegraph man came to claim my
							assistance— In January last he presented a Memorial to Congress,
							proposing the establishment of Telegraphic signals upon his system, from
							Washington to New-York— It was referred in the Senate to their Committee
							of Commerce, who on the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February
							last made a favourable report upon it, but nothing further concerning it
							was done— On the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last he presented
							a second memorial, which was in Senate referred to the Committee on
							Military Affairs. He says that its Chairman, <persRef

							alarmed and resort again to me for aid and protection. They said it

							He speaks with great facility, without elegance—plain sound sense, but
							without striking thought or imagery, wit or humour always grave—always
							calm, always moderate—never very impressive—never original in thought or

							as coals, yet sparkling with good humour— He was for the bill, in whole
							and in all its parts.— <persRef ref="trumbull-joseph">Joseph

							and <persRef ref="mckay-james">James I. M’Kay</persRef> made a sensible
							speech against it. <persRef ref="birdseye-victory">Birdseye</persRef> of
							New-York preceded him. I went again to the City Hall— The Register of

							postponed holding his Court till the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of this month. I shewed <persRef ref="leary-michael2">Michael

							against the bankrupt bill.— Immediately after which <persRef
								ref="smith-truman">Trueman Smith</persRef> moved the Committee to
							rise; for the house to reconsider the vote to take the bill out of

							much dilatory shuffling on this subject, which nettled some of the
							whigs; but Barnard coolly assented to Trueman Smith’s motion. I asked
								<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> what all this
							meant— He said the Kentucky and Indiana delegations would vote against
							the Bankrupt bill, if the veto on the Bank should come in, and will not
							vote for it, while the veto is impending— Wise resorted to all his
							captious rules of order in vain. The Committee rose— Trueman Smith moved

						<p>The <persRef ref="tyler-john">President of the United States</persRef>,
							the members of his Cabinet, and all the members of both houses of
							Congress had received invitations to visit the line of battle ship
							Delaware lying off Annapolis, this day— <persRef ref="morris-charles"
								>Commodore Morris</persRef> who is going out in command of her, had
							given me an additional verbal invitation, and I had concluded to go,
							until the feud between the President, and the two houses of Congress,
							festering ever since a special Providence placed John Tyler in the
							Presidential Chair came to an issue, by the passage of the Bank Law,
							which it is known he intends to negative— The excitement in both houses,
							and in public is so great that I thought it no time for festivity or
							hollow hearted pageantry. The President himself appears to have become
							sensible, that this exhibition of himself to public gaze and outward
							display of adulation was ill suited to the real feelings of the time,
							and did not go.— The house yesterday, adjourned over to Monday for this
							frolic, but the Senate refused to adjourn and sat this day as usual. I
							called at the Treasury Department for the draught in payment of the Bill
							of exchange— The Warrant from the <persRef ref="badger-george">Secretary
								of the Navy</persRef> had been received, but <persRef
								ref="ewing-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ewing</persRef>
							the Secretary of the Treasury was indisposed, and had gone to his house
							leaving the warrant unsigned— I received however this afternoon the
							draught on the Receiver General at Boston, for 1500 dollars, which I
							endorsed, payable to <persRef ref="sampson-schuyler">Schuyler
								Sampson</persRef> Plymouth, or his order, and enclosed to him.
								<persRef ref="morse-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Morse</persRef> of Hanover, Massachusetts, a Constituent of mine,
							had written to me, requesting a copy of the Bankrupt Bill, as it passed
							the Senate— I went to the Office of the National Intelligencer to
							enquire for it, as I thought it had been printed in that paper— It had
							not, but <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef> gave me a copy of the printed bill itself. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales told me much about the abortive
							negotiations with the President to prevail upon him to sign, or at least
							not to veto the Bank Bill. He says that the compromise clause introduced
							at the last gasp in the Senate Bill was in the handwriting of Secretary
							Ewing— The familiar Spirit of <persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef>
							was wont to advise him negatively; not to act. Is not this the true
							Spirit for the present occasion— This afternoon <persRef
								ref="jones-ezekiel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ezekiel

							in 1839 called on me. He has been stationed on the Coast of Florida; has

							since written to me requesting my assistance to procure an appointment
							in the same service for <persRef ref="u">his son</persRef>, and he now
							repeated the request— I told him that the Secretary of the Treasury had
							assured me that there was at present no vacancy in the revenue service
								<persRef ref="hague-thomas">Thomas Hague</persRef> who styles
							himself and Astro-meteorologist, was here, and put many questions to me
							for his horoscope— He is an Irishman, and publishes monthly a small
							pamphlet under the title of a horoscope full of silly prognostications
							from the stars about individuals, and me among the rest— He intimated to
							me that I should be seriously sick in my 78<hi rend="superscript"

							and gave me a copy of his horoscope for the present month—</p>

						<p>The turn of the Season to the autumnal temperature has taken place, and
							the atmosphere is cool. I have never known it to fail in this city from
							the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 20<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of August inclusive— This morning at the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Presbyterian Church <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef> preached from John
							8.51 [“]Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he
							shall never see death.”— This is a part of that most remarkable scene in
							the temple, when Jesus announced himself to the people as pre existent
							to <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>—as the light of the world—as
							proceeded forth and come from God, and asserting his eternity, as <hi
								rend="italic">I</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">am</hi>—the name by which Jehovah had named himself to
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>—I am!—no past—no future, one
							eternal existence, personified— And in this same discourse, after
							defeating the plan to entrap him into a collision with the Levitical law
							in the case of the woman taken in adultery, he had exasperated to the
							highest pitch the people whom he addressed, against himself, charging
							them with seeking to kill him, and reviling them as liars, thieves,
							murderers—among the most provoking things of this whole discourse was
							this solemn and emphatic averment that a man who should keep his saying
							should never see death— How could he be understood but literally— How
							could they believe but that he was a maniac—or had a devil? how could it
							end otherwise than it did by their taking up stones to cast at him.— Of
							all this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore took no notice— He
							explained nothing— Not even what was meant by never seeing death, or by
							keeping his saying— There is indeed a sense in which this glorious
							promise is true beyond all controversy— Were it possible for a man to
							perform all the precepts of Christ, he would be perfect, as God in
							Heaven is perfect, and Death to him would have no sting— In the
							afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the tenth Sunday after Trinity and a delicate, feminine
							young gentleman, a stranger preached from 2. Corinthians 5.20—the latter
							part of the verse—[“]we pray you, in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to
							God.”— In the former part of the verse, <persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul</persRef> speaking of the Apostles says— Now then we are
							Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us—which the
							preacher modestly thought proper to omit: but in addressing his
							auditory, he assumed as of course that they were in a state of enmity
							with God, and told them so— This commonplace of gospel preaching, would
							have been more suitable, from a spiritual teacher, less perfectly
							satisfied with himself. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley gave
							notice of two lectures to be delivered, the first to morrow evening in
								<persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrie’s</persRef> church upon the religious ceremonies of the
							Jewish Law— <persRef ref="talbot-adelaide">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Talbot</persRef> was here to visit the <persRef

							People, but submitted— <persRef ref="snyder-john">Snyder</persRef>
							offered a Resolution for adjournment next Monday; but some one said wait
							for the veto— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> made half
							a dozen motions to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, but yielded the floor for various other motions, among which was
							one of <persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W. Irwin</persRef> from the
							retrenchment Committee, for leave to sit during the recess of Congress,
							with power to send for persons and papers, and to report at the next
							session by bill or otherwise— Andrews moved to lay the resolution on the
							table—carried by yeas and nays 139 to 40.— The census bill was taken up
							and passed with <persRef ref="randall-alexander">Randall’s</persRef>
							amendment to print 20000 copies of the compendium—carried by yeas and
							nays 121 to 63. At last the house went into Committee of the whole on
							the state of the Union, upon the Bankrupt Bill— <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> in the Chair.
								<persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac E. Holmes</persRef> of Charleston
							S. Carolina made a long-studied hour speech against the Bill— Holmes is
							a pompous Orator fancying himself a very profound statesman—he has a
							pickpocket habit of looking askance from the corner of his eyes while he
							is speaking, and he affects deep logical deduction— <persRef
								ref="james-francis">Francis James</persRef> of West-Chester
							Pennsylvania, a plain downright wet quaker followed him for the bill,
							succeeded by <persRef ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef>, and
							he by <persRef ref="howard-jacob">Jacob M. Howard</persRef> of Michigan.
							Their speeches were made with less than 40 members in the hall— The
							flock were in the Senate to hear the veto upon the Bank-bill, delivered
							there this day at Noon. When Howard finished, no other member rose to
							speak. Barnard moved the Committee to rise, and gave notice that he
							should to-morrow Morning move to take the Bill out of Committee at Noon—
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved to amend the motion
							for the Committee to rise, by adding “and report the Bill.”— The
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> at first decided that
							this amendment was in order, and afterwards that it was not— The
							Committee rose and the house adjourned shortly after 2. When the veto
							message was read in the Senate there was some slight disorder in the
							galleries, whereupon <persRef ref="benton-thomas">T. H. Benton</persRef>
							made a ridiculous scene, till a man was taken into custody, and the
							doughty knight of the stuff’d cravat abated his manly wrath— The veto
							message and its inevitable consequences will utterly prostrate the
							administration, and the party by which it was brought in. It surrenders
							the Country to the profligate political swindlers so recently driven
							from power! There is a Providence in the fall of a sparrow. <persRef
								ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef>

							carried his Resolution to take the Bankrupt Bill out of Committee at
							Noon this day— In Committee he replied to the various objections against
							the Bill—followed by <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett"
								>Saltonstall</persRef> for it, and a final blast of <persRef
								ref="sprigg-james">Sprigg</persRef> of Kentucky against it. At Noon
							the debate ceased: a multitude of foolish amendments were offered and

							was in the house and voted for the call, and then retired,
							indisposed—that question too was taken by yeas and nays 113 to 74. a

							the question came back on <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"

							<persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> Resolution was taken

							insisting that he had seen the error of his ways, and become a convert
							to democracy dyed in the wool— He then attempted a feeble panegyric upon
							himself, and a pompous one upon Prentiss, a worthless and malicious

						<p>At the Presbyterian church this morning, a stranger preached from John
							3.16. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
							that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting
							life.” It is an abuse of this text, to pursue it into inference
							revolting to the moral sense of the hearer— “Whosoever”—said this young
							man—mark that word “whosoever[”] however numerous—however atrocious may
							have been his crimes—let him but believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, he
							shall not perish, but have everlasting life.— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef> was in the pulpit, and
							gave notice, that a communication had been received from the pastor of
							the church, for the consideration of which there would be a meeting of
							the members of the Society to morrow afternoon at 6 O’Clock, which all
							were invited to attend— At S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church
							this afternoon, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the evening service for the
							eleventh Sunday after Trinity, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Krusay</persRef> of Philadelphia
							preached from John 14.2. “In my Father’s house, are many mansions.”—
							This discourse was not badly written; but contained nothing of any
							practical utility—commentary upon the import of the words <hi
								rend="italic">house</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">mansions</hi>—also
							upon the word many— The mode of delivery was as cold as the substance of
							the Sermon— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here at
							tea— Evening visits from <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Winthrop</persRef>—and afterwards from <persRef ref="bates-isaac"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac C. Bates</persRef>, one of
							the Senators from Massachusetts for a confidential consultation— He
							shewed me an amendment to the Land-bill so called proposed by <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berrien</persRef>
							of Georgia, and without which he announces that he will not vote for the
							bill. The amendment is that if at any time the impost duties should
							exceed 20 percent ad valorem, the distribution of the proceeds of the
							sales of the public lands shall be suspended, so long as such excess
							shall continue— The object of which is to force the continuance of what
							is called the compromise act of Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1833—
							He asked my advice, whether to vote for the bill should this amendment
							be adopted? I said I certainly should not— But he will— He complained
							bitterly of the manner in which injustice and indignity are heaped upon
							New-England—but heard the whole delegation from Massachusetts will
							submit to any mortification, while <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> shall continue to be
							secretary of State; and he will remain Secretary of State till he shall
							be positively removed from the office— There is now every probability
							that this must soon happen; but the interval will be filled up with
							humiliating compliances— The first and meanest of these was that which
							disgraced the late vetoed bank-bill I disdained submission to it, and
							voted against the bill— But the whig portion of the delegation
							yielded—even those who had flinched at the revenue bill— Let it not be
							forgotten— </p>

							chastened eloquence. Wise’s ghastly face, was convulsed with torture
							under it, and his laugh was the laugh of an excruciated fiend.
							Marshall’s hour expired in the midst of one of his most beautiful
							flights of Fancy— Wise was upon the rack. Another hour would have

								<persRef ref="reynolds-john">Governor Reynolds</persRef> of Illinois
							had just been sworn in by the <persRef ref="white-john6"

							a kitchen cabinet, which <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had given out covertly,
							in his speech last week on the veto.— Gilmer has just talent enough to

							upon some misunderstanding between him and the Legislature of the State,
							relating to his mismanagement of the controversy with the <persRef
								ref="seward-william">Governor of New-York</persRef>— Proffit of
							Indiana came next—having made a complete Somerset over to the democracy—
							The People of his State have just done the same, by a sweep almost total
							from whiggery. Proffit follows their lead. He is a self made man; with a
							grave, stern forbidding face, and a sly, shrewd, caustic humour, which
							when he speaks never fails to convulse the house with laughter. He is
							rather low in stature, but well proportioned, with an air of restless
							anxiety, which contrasts with the pungent drollery of his sarcasms— He
							is altogether a very pleasant member of the house, but not a trusty one
							to any thing but his own humour— He made now a bitter speech against the
							bill, succeeded by a more effective one of <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> in its favour— Then

							the debate— At 4. p.m—the questions began to be taken. Sundry foolish
							captious amendments were moved and rejected by tellers. The bill finally
							was screwed through all opposition, but Wise made a speech of half an
							hour on a motion to reconsider the amended title 125 to 94. The house

						<p>After the reading of the journal <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W.

							popular meetings within their respective districts, protesting against a
							National Bank, a Bankrupt Law: a Law for the distribution of the
							proceeds of the public Lands—the Loan Law and to all the restorative
							measures introduced and in progress during the present Session of
							Congress. Jones said that as those presented by him had been printed by
							order of the Senate, he would only ask that they should be laid on the
							table which was done; but Cary demanded that those which he presented
							should be read, which they were, and ordered to be printed which they
							were not— <persRef ref="coles-walter">Coles</persRef> of Virginia
							presented a memorial from his district against a bankrupt Law— Other
							members presented memorials by general consent, and I presented five
							abolition petitions received since the<space/>of July the last day upon
							which I had presented any—3 of these were partly received— Boardman from
							the Committee on the public buildings and grounds made a report against
							the petition of the Stone-cutters for employment. <persRef
								ref="saunders-romulus">R. M. Saunders</persRef> from the judiciary
							Committee reported the Senate bill for the distribution of the census

							These and other small matters scarcely consumed the morning hour, when
							the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef> in the Chair—
							The bill to make an appropriation of 497657 dollars to pay the debts of
							the post-office Department was taken up and produced a running fire of
							four hours, against the <persRef ref="granger-francis">Postmaster
								General</persRef> chiefly from <persRef ref="floyd-john3">John G.

							yesterday said he should vote against the whole bill, and would not vote
							a dollar, no, not a cent, to pay the contractors, for they knew when
							they made the contracts that they must depend upon the funds of the
							department for payment and every tub should stand upon its own Bottom—
							He said too that not only the Postmaster General, but the whole Cabinet
							ought to resign— The <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> could
							have no confidence in them— And if they refused to resign, the President
							ought to give them their walking papers— The sooner the better— Just
							after 3. on motion for the committee to rise, there was no quorum
							voting—they rose therefore; the chairman reported the fact, and the
							house adjourned— <persRef ref="trumbull-joseph">Joseph
								Trumbull</persRef> told me that the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> told him this morning, that he had appointed
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef> chairman of the
							Committee of foreign Relations, at the special request of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							bitter as gall declaring that he would not appropriate a dollar to the
							service of the Post Office, while <persRef ref="granger-francis"
								>Granger</persRef> should be Postmaster general— <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> of Tennessee broke out in a
							counterblast of an hour against the miserable wretch at the other end of
							the Avenue, whom he considered as a Traitor to the whig party and to the
							cause of the country.— He spoke so loud, and vehement, and impetuously,
							that his articulation became indistinct, and I could not hear much of
							what he said— He was call’d to order by <persRef ref="roosevelt-james"
								>Roosevelt</persRef> and <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"
								>Winthrop</persRef>: and was decided by the Chairman Everett, to be
							out of order, for using expressions, disrespectful to the President of
							the United States. Arnold appealed, and the chairman began to put the
							question, whether his decision should be affirmed, when I rose and said
							that if the Committee were to vote on the appeal, as the call to order
							for words spoken, the rule required that the words should be taken down—
							They were accordingly taken down, and the decision was so manifestly
							wrong, that Arnold to save the chairman the mortification of a nearly
							unanimous reversal, withdrew his appeal, which <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Ingersoll</persRef> immediately renewed; but
							at Arnold’s earnest request also withdrew— <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Stanly</persRef> followed in a speech of sharp rebuke to Arnold,
								<persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, who retorted, followed by
								<persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> who preached peace,
							where there was no peace, by a swarm of dirty slave-breeders, and the
							winding stair-case of <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb
								Cushing</persRef>— The debate closed for the day by a regular set to
							between <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Tom Marshall</persRef> of
							Kentucky, and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>—each for one
							hour, amusing enough— But Marshall was too spirited—and Wise’s endless
							egotism less sprightly than usual— It was little short of 6. O’Clock,
							when <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Andrews</persRef> of Kentucky, moved
							the Committee to rise, and the house adjourned— The whig party is in the
							agonies of dissolution, and this day disclosed many symptoms of its
							approach— We are in the hands of a being—good and wise! </p>

						<p>A young man, clerk in a German house at Baltimore himself a German named
								<persRef ref="berg-otto">Berg</persRef> called on me this morning
							and gave me a somewhat curious document— A sort of Consular certificate,
							dated at Konigsberg in the kingdom of Prussia, 22. April 1837. signed
								<persRef ref="berg-olof">Olof Berg</persRef> Swedish and Norwegian
							Consul for East Prussia, and sworn translator in the royal high Courts
							of Konigsberg. It is a recommendatory Letter or Passport for his Son, to
							which is annexed as a voucher, an original Letter from me to the house
							of Schwinck and Koch dated at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg
							18/30 July 1810. recommending to them <persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi

								<persRef ref="groves-william">Captain William Groves</persRef>,
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray had despatched for Konigsberg,
							and which was expected to arrive there— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Olof Berg says that he was then a chief Clerk in the house of <persRef
								ref="schwinkandkoch">Schwinck and Koch</persRef>—that they are both
							since dead. that upon the dissolution of their house in 1824. he became
							possessed of this Letter, and annexes it to his certificate to serve as
							a Letter of recommendation to his son 16 1/2 years old, coming to
							America— He is now in his 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year, and
							situated to his satisfaction in the house in Baltimore— He had also and
							gave me another Letter from <persRef ref="meyer-jc">Mayer</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="bruxner-george">Bruxner</persRef> to the same house of
							Schwinck and Koch dated S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg 29.
								Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1815. being a Letter of credit for
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— He enquired
							what prospect I thought there would be for a younger brother of his to
							come over in search of employment as an Overseer of a farm; but I could
							give him no encouragement for this— At the house, before I got there,
								<persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> moved a resolution to
							cease debate on the Post-Office appropriation bill, and to take it out
							of Committee at Noon this day. Linn moved a call of the house, which I
							entered while the question of the call was taking by yeas and nays it
							was then carried and when 150 members had answered to their names it was
							superseded—all postponing amendments to Briggs’s resolution were
							rejected and the resolution itself carried— <persRef
								ref="andrews-landaff">Andrews</persRef> had the floor but yielded it
							for an explanation to <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef>, who
							accepted the challenge of <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb
								Cushing</persRef> to discuss the conduct of <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef> relating to the Bank
							Bill; not now—but when the second Bank veto will come, as come it will—
							Andrews said little on the bill and <persRef ref="watterson-harvey"
								>Watterson</persRef> consumed the last forty minutes against it—
							After engrafting upon the bill an useless amendment it was reported to
							the house—passed for engrossment and passed— Then the bill for paying
							the expenses of <persRef ref="harrison-william">President
								Harrison’s</persRef> funeral; and then the bill for placing <persRef
								ref="greenough-horatio">Greenough’s</persRef> Statue of <persRef

							Adjourned at 3. p.m.— Rainy evening. </p>

						<p><persRef ref="campbell-john7">John Campbell</persRef> of South Carolina
							offered a Resolution directing the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk of

								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> moved to suspend the rules, which
							the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said by a special rule
							of this Session was not in order during the morning hour— In the course

							and <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> offered as a
							substitute a direction to the Clerk to have all the desks except the
							outer circle removed and then the numbers of the Seats drawn for the
							members in alphabetical order. after much chaffering the Resolution was
							laid on the table— Campbell told me that he would make an exception for
							me; but the real cause of all this heart-burning about the Seats was
							that by the good-will of <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
								Garland</persRef>, he gave me when he left the house at the close of
							the first Session of the last Congress, the right to his Seat, one of
							the best, instead of one of the worst which I had occupied during that
							Session— There was a multiplicity of small business transacted in the
							house this day. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union
								<persRef ref="shepperd-augustine">Augustine H. Shepperd</persRef> in
							the Chair— Bill for the suppression of Indian hostilities in Florida;
							taken up and laid aside, Levy the Delegate from Florida who introduced
							it not being present— It ought not to pass— Bill making appropriations
							for purchasing sites for fortifications, making surveys &amp;c— After
							some discussion concerning a supposed claim of the United States against
							the State of New-York it was laid aside, and afterwards in the house the
							Committee of the whole was discharged from the further consideration of
							it, and it was referred to the Military Committee— The Land Bill was
							returned from the Senate with many amendments—an attempt was made to
							take it up for consideration which was only so far successful as to
							order the printing of the bill as amended— A joint solution for the
							distribution among the States of 700 copies of the digest of Patents was
							adopted and an appropriation bill, for the outfits and Salaries of
							sundry diplomatic agents was much debated and finally passed. Ingersoll
							moved to strike the outfit, and Salaries out for the missions to Naples
							and to Sardinia— I opposed this motion, but offered a Resolution
							instructing the Committee of foreign Relations to enquire into the
							expediency of reducing the expenditures of the diplomatic department by
							diminishing the foreign Missions— This was adopted— A Bill passed for
							repairing the Potomac Bridge—and one for re-paving Pennsylvania Avenue
							stop’d at the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> reading. Adjourned.

						<p>Yesterday Morning I took to the judge of the Orphans Court at the City
							Hall the Letter from <persRef ref="leary-michael2">Michael
								Leary</persRef> to me of 18 June last, with the certificates on it
							that he is the father of the late <persRef ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy
								Leary</persRef>, and the judge entered a minute on the Letter, that
							upon payment to the father this Letter will be received as a voucher for
							allowance of the Administrator’s account— The Man <persRef
								ref="stokes-john">Stokes</persRef> who came here last evening was
							the same who came to me nine years ago, and for whom I then procured a
							copy of the Will of <persRef ref="stokes-john2">John Stokes</persRef>
							from Raleigh, North-Carolina— He lately applied to <persRef
								ref="staples-seth">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seth M.
								Staples</persRef> of New-York with whom I have had a correspondence
								<hi rend="strikethrough">at New York</hi> upon the subject—but
							Stokes who says he has been living several years in Charleston
							South-Carolina, says he has lost the copy of the Will which I procured
							for him, and he is now wandering about the country seeking for another
							copy. He did not even remember the place where it was registered till I
							told him it was Raleigh. Nor did he know that two other members of the
							family, a man and his wife from London had been here three or four years
							ago, in the same pursuit as devisees of John Stokes. The case of these
							claimants really deserves compassion— <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							Gentlemen from New-York, who were here last Evening have taken the loan
							of one Million of Dollars opened by the <persRef ref="ewing-thomas"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> at the annual interest of 5 1/2
							per cent— At the House this morning, the first thing done was a call of
							the house, pursued till 170 members answered to their names, and then
							superseded— The Bill making an appropriation for paving the Pennsylvania
							avenue with wood was then rejected by yeas and nays 69 to 103. The Bill
							to amend the act of 12. June 1840. to carry into effect the Convention
							of 11. April 1839 with Mexico— I believe there is an insidious purpose
							in this Bill, but it passed, after considerable discussion, and with an
							amendment proposed by <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>—
							Soon after Noon the House adjourned, absolutely for want of something to
							do.— I asked the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> what had
							become of the <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef>
							Resolution— He said it was on the table. But there was a laugh in the
							house, and some one said it was in nubibus— After the adjournment and
							some casual conversation, I went into the Senate chamber where they were
							debating amendments to the Revenue bill from the house. Upon a question
							of exempting Sumach from duty, there was a sparring of a full half an
							hour, with sharp personalities between <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry
								Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.

						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane</persRef> was the preacher for
							the day; and his text was from Isaiah 54.17. [“]No weapon that is formed
							against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against
							thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.” There was apparently some allusion
							to the condition of the Church, in this text; but none except of general
							cheering and encouragement in the discourse— The preacher gave notice
							that he should preach there this afternoon—that the communion would be
							administered there next Sunday morning by <persRef ref="smith-edward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> pastor of the
							presbyterian Church in 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Street, and that
							the Presbytery taking into consideration the condition of the Church,
							now vacant, would, as they had done before on a like occasion supply the
							pulpit, until the Society shall have the opportunity of providing
							themselves with a permanent pastor— The communication from <persRef
								ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef>
							therefore, announced from the pulpit last Sunday, and upon which a
							meeting was called for the evening of the next day, was, and I supposed
							it to be, a valedictory to the Society— From the scattered and prostrate
							condition of the church, nothing else could be expected. There were not
							more than fifty persons present— Most of them women. As I was returning
							home, passing by the foundery Methodist Church, the congregation were
							pouring out by hundreds—it seemed almost as if by thousands: Men, women,
							children, with not one of whom I was personally acquainted, but all
							decently, neatly and not a few of them tastefully clad— The crowded
							Churches in this city are all methodists or Roman Catholics.— After
							dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krusay or Courcy</persRef>
							(from <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley’s</persRef> pronunciation of his name I could not tell
							which,[)] read the evening prayer for the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity and preached from 1. Corinthians
							15.29. “Else, what shall they do, which are baptized for the dead? if
							the dead rise not at-all. Why are they then baptized for the dead?” This
							text is hard to be understood, and the commentary of the preacher did
							not clear it to my mind from its obscurity— I know not what is meant by
							being baptized for the dead— There is no such rite in any Christian
							church now, but I suppose the allusion must be to some practice of the
							primitive Christians, when <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> wrote this
							Epistle— The whole Chapter is at once argumentative, sublime, and
							awfully mysterious— After Church I called at <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson’s</persRef> but he had not returned from his ride— I visited
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> at his lodgings.— <persRef
								ref="thornton-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> and <persRef ref="talbot-adelaide">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Talbot</persRef> spent the evening
							with us and <persRef ref="hoops-adam">Major Hoops</persRef> a tottering
							more than octogenarian relic of the army of our Revolution, gave me also
							a transient call— I received from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>my wife</persRef> a Letter dated last Thursday, with most painful
							intelligence concerning the health of <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son’s</persRef>

								Bell</persRef>, and would speak to him again. On looking over
							yesterday the printed journal of the house for the present Session, I

							rules, excluding petitions, during the present Session—the question was
							taken on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June, and this
							falsification of my vote is on page 120. of the journal— I went to the
							Capitol this morning at 9 to clear the matter up— I found that the error
							was in the manuscript Journal and on the list of yeas and nays taken
							upon the question— But <persRef ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef>
							who keeps the minutes of the Journal remembered that I had voted against
							the Resolution, and the Journal itself shewed that I had voted ay upon a

							yeas as 106 while the names including mine are but 105. and the nays 60.
							while the names without mine were 61— <persRef ref="burch-samuel"

							evening, a regular deputation was sent over to the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> house, to constrain him to

								<persRef ref="triplett-philip">Triplett</persRef>—they went
							over—roused him, if not from bed, after the house had been closed for

							fashion; led him over to Crittenden’s, in triumph, where Clay received
							him at the door, with—Well M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> President,
							what are you for—Kentucky Whiskey, or Champagne.— He chose Champagne,
							and entered into the Spirit of this frolicsome <unclear>ag</unclear>ony,
							as if it was congenial to his own temper. But all this was as false and
							hollow as it was blustering and rowdyish.— At the house I attempted to
							call up the <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> Resolution,
							But <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> who had the floor
							upon it, was at first not there, and when afterwards he came in the

							Stocks; but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said it was
							petition day— He therefore called the States over for Petitions, but

							Land-proceeds distribution bill were reported back by Morrow from the
							Committee on the public Lands and <persRef ref="clark-john">John C.
								Clark</persRef> instantly moved the previous Question— Most of them
							were adopted— The amendments to the fortification bill succeed— The
