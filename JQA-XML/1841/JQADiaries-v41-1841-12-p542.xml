                        <p>As fellow passengers in the Cars from Boston to Springfield on Monday we
                            had <persRef ref="bronson-david">David Bronson</persRef> a Member of
                            H.R.U.S. from Maine, and <persRef ref="bronson-augusta">his
                                wife</persRef>.— He is the successor of George Evans; he came and
                            spoke to me, but I did not at first recognize him, even when he told me—
                            In the streets of New-York I met and spoke to <persRef ref="hunt-hiram"
                                >Hiram P. Hunt</persRef>, and saw <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb
                                Cushing</persRef>, who passed by, looking straight before him, not
                            to see me.— At the ferry boat I met <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas
                                Wright</persRef> the Senator from New-York with <persRef
                                ref="wright-clarissa">his wife</persRef>, and <persRef
                                ref="roosevelt-james">James L. Roosevelt</persRef>, a member of
                            H.R.U.S. from the City, who joked with me about his being a loco foco,
                            and introduced <persRef ref="roosevelt-cornelia">his brother</persRef>
                            to me— <persRef ref="childs-timothy">Timothy Childs</persRef> too,
                            member from Rochester was there and they all came with us in the Cars to
                            Philadelphia— This morning the first person whom I met in the bar-room
                            was <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>, then
                                <persRef ref="slade-william">William Slade</persRef>, then <persRef
                                ref="young-augustus">John Young</persRef>, all members from
                            Vermont—and at the breakfast table I saw <persRef ref="osborne-thomas"
                                >Thomas B. Osborne</persRef>, member from Connecticut with <persRef
                                ref="osborne-elizabeth">his wife</persRef>— We took this morning at
                            8. the Cars for Baltimore— On the way <persRef ref="allen-william3"
                                >William H. Allen</persRef>, Senator from Ohio, came and spoke to me
                            more civilly than I expected— The last Night, and this day were severely
                            cold, and from the time when we started from Boston Monday Morning, till
                            we alighted at my house in F. Street Washington between 6 and 7. this
                            evening, my constant effort has been to screen myself from contact with
                            the external air— A journey of nearly 500 miles has been performed in
                            three days— Sleeping one Night at Hartford, and one at Philadelphia.
                            Travelling in vehicles warmed like the parlour of a dwelling house, and
                            regularly taking meals as when at home. One exception to which occurred
                            this day, by our passing through Baltimore without stopping to dine— The
                            Railways have been somewhat clogged by the fall of snow on Monday and
                            the subsequent frosts— The general progress of the trains has been
                            considerably slackened, and at some passages almost arrested; once
                            particularly this day in passing through Wilmington, Delaware. It was
                            more than half past 3 this afternoon when we reached the depot at
                            Baltimore; and at 4 the cars started for Washington— All the
                            arrangements for the keeping and conveyance of the baggage have been
                            made through out the whole way by <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
                                Son</persRef>, so that I have had nothing to do but to step from Car
                            to Cab, or from steamer to street and from street to ferry-boat or
                            hotel— Of the external world one white sheet from Boston to Washington
                            is all that I have seen— Had there been a bandage over my eyes the whole
                            three days it could scarcely have intercepted all vision of the country
                            or towns through which we have passed— A jovial company of young Ladies
                            and gentlemen, apparently returning from a wedding party 8 or 10 Miles
                            North of Baltimore to that city, joined us in the Cars, displacing some
                            of the occupants of the seats, while others were obliged to stand in the
                            passage way without seats— We had the happiness to find our families at
                            Washington, well, with some slight and casual exception. [symbols].</p>

                        <p>My Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa Adams</persRef>
                            13—</p>

                        <p>I called with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> at the
                            President’s house to visit <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef>, but he was engaged in
                            cabinet Meeting—and did not receive us— We then called on <persRef
                                ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
                                Baker Johnson</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef> brother and
                            found him in better apparent health than he has been these two years,
                            but complaining as usual— I stop’d at the Franklin Insurance Company
                            Office, and received the dividend of 5 per cent on the half year ending
                            last Month, 316.75 by check on the Patriotic Bank bills payable in
                            Virginia Bank Bills at a discount of 6 per cent— We then went to the
                            Capitol, where in the Post Office of the house I met <persRef
                                ref="rhett-robert">Robert Barnwell Rhett</persRef> of
                            South-Carolina, and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Nicholas
                                Tillinghast</persRef> of Rhode-Island; members of the house.— Nobody
                            in the Clerks Office— We viewed in the Rotundo <persRef
                                ref="greenough-horatio">Greenough’s</persRef> Colossal Statue of
                                <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, which at
                            first sight sympathetically struck Charles and myself as too close an
                            imitation of the Jupiter of <persRef ref="phidias">Phidias</persRef>.—
                            The hero is seated in a Chair like an antique Car, laboured like
                            filagree with bas-reliefs and miniature sculpture. He is naked to the
                            loins and thence downward covered with a blanket or coverlet—his right
                            elbow resting on the arm of the chair; the arm lifted and pointing with
                            the forefinger to the sky—the left hand on the hilt of a sheathed sword
                            lying on his lap, and in the act of pushing it from him— We met there
                                <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Winfield Scott</persRef>, with
                                <persRef ref="jones-roger">Adjutant General Roger Jones</persRef>,
                            and his brother Commodore <persRef ref="jones-thomas">Thomas ap Catesby
                                Jones</persRef>, and <persRef ref="henry-thomas">Thomas
                                Henry</persRef>, a member of the House from Pennsylvania. The statue
                            is placed in the centre of the Rotundo, on a pedestal 9 feet high; upon
                            which it was raised yesterday— The opinions with regard to its merit are
                            greatly diversified—mine are highly favourable to it.— Returning home I
                            stop’d at <persRef ref="taylor-frank">Taylor’s</persRef> bookstore, and
                            took a volume of Wyoming for <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
                                >Mary-Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi

                            for myself— It was Mary-Louisa’s birth day—always of intense anxiety to
                            me, for her future destiny.— She had an evening party of her friends,
                            schoolmates and family relations— The children kept up their dancing
                            till 11, at Night.</p>

                            has seen the new Secretary of that Department Upshur, and has received
                            from him fair promises as he had from his predecessor; but nothing more.
                                <persRef ref="upshur-abel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Upshur</persRef> told him that he had sent to the <persRef
                                ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> only two names for navy
                            chaplaincies; one of whom was <persRef ref="tyler-william">William
                                Tyler</persRef> a nephew of the President— I intended to have called
                            this morning on one or more of the heads of Departments; but it rained
                            the whole day—so steadily that I could not go out till the dusk of
                            evening. The rain was then succeeded by a thick fog— I walked out—left
                            my Chronometer with <persRef ref="montandon-j">Julien
                                Montandon</persRef> to be repaired. found my old servant <persRef
                                ref="giusta-antoine">M. A. Giusta</persRef> with him— I then called
                            upon another old acquaintance the shoemaker <persRef
                                ref="thumblert-william">Thumlert</persRef> and ordered a pair of
                            Slippers which he promised to send me next Monday. I stop’d at the
                            Office of the National Intelligencer, where they gave me three Boston
                            Newspapers— Neither <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> nor
                                <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> was at the Office—

                            was here this morning, but declined dining with <persRef
                                ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and <persRef
                                ref="buchanan-robert">Captain Robert C. Buchanan</persRef> came in
                            the Evening to take leave—his furlough has expired, and he has been
                            ordered to Florida, upon duty. I received this day two Letters from
                                <persRef ref="palfrey-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John G.
                                Palfrey</persRef> Editor of the North American Review, intimating in
                            a very delicate manner his unwillingness to publish in that periodical
                            journal, my lecture upon the War between Great Britain and China— And in
                            a Letter to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, he proposes
                            to return the manuscript— The excitement of public opinion, and feeling
                            by the delivery of this lecture far exceeds any expectation that I had
                            formed, although I did expect that it would be considerable. It is a
                            loud and peremptory admonition of prudence to me, in the course that it
                            will behoove me to pursue, through the impending session of Congress—
                            Between the obligation to discharge my duty to the Country, and the
                            obvious impossibility of accomplish any thing for the improvement of its
                            condition, by Legislation, my deliberate judgment warns me to a
                            systematic adherence to inaction, upon all the controverted topics,
                            which cannot fail to be brought into debate— Upon the rule question I
                            cannot be silent but shall be left alone as heretofore— I await the
                            opening of the session with great anxiety—more from apprehension of my
                            own imprudence than from a belief that the fortunes of the Country will
                            be much affected for good or evil, by any thing that will be done— There
                            is neither spotless integrity nor consummate ability at the helm of our
                            public ship and she will be more than ever the sport of winds and waves,
                            drifting between breakers and quicksand.— May the wise and good disposer
                            send her home in safety.</p>

                                Skirving</persRef> brought and shewed me two drawings of furnaces by
                            which he proposes to warm, and ventilate the Hall of the House of
                            Representatives— He afterwards sent me his report to the Commissioner
                            and Architect of the public buildings, and several coloured drawings of
                            plans for cottage houses— I cabled this morning at the War department
                            and had a long conversation, with the new <persRef ref="spencer-john"
                                >Secretary John C. Spencer</persRef> upon three several and diverse
                            topics.— I delivered to him the application of <persRef
                                ref="lebaron-francis">Francis Le Baron</persRef> of Plymouth for a
                            warrant of Cadet at the Military Academy at West Point, together with
                            the recommendations of him addressed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Spencer himself—and I requested that the youth’s name might be entered
                            on the files of the Department as a candidate for admission at the
                            Academy— He enquired if there was a vacancy of the appointment for the
                            District, and I told him there was not—that <persRef ref="wood-william6"
                                >Wood</persRef> had entered last June and that the vacancy was not
                            to be expected before 1845. I also told him of the promise given me by
                            the late Secretary of <persRef ref="bell-john">War Bell</persRef>, of a
                            warrant for<space/><persRef ref="derby-george">Derby</persRef> next
                            June, of which he took note. 2. I read to him the Letter of <persRef
                                ref="larrabee-charles">Major Charles Larrabee</persRef> to me of 6.
                                Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> last, and the passage of his
                            pamphlet, in which quoting a paragraph, in <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
                                >Andrew Jackson’s</persRef> Message of 8. December 1829. he says it
                            charges me with a crime— It was certainly a base and malignant attack
                            upon my administration which like others, from the same quarter I have
                            treated with silent contempt: but with regard to the charge of an order
                            from the War Department which he said he had revoked, as illegal, I had
                            never known what the facts were, and wished now to ascertain them from
                            the records of the Department— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer
                            said he would direct an examination of the records, and cause the
                            results to be communicated to me. 3. I said I had received a Letter from
                                <persRef ref="seward-william">Governor Seward</persRef> of New-York
                            enclosing a copy of a Letter from the Governor to him on the subject of
                            the debts of the States. We had then much discourse upon the State
                            debts, from which I infer that the policy of <persRef ref="tyler-john"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef> is to have
                            nothing to do with them, and that he is not prepared with any system of
                            measures in relation to them— I have now only to wait for the message—

                        <p>I attended the morning public worship at the second presbyterian church
                            where a young man named <persRef ref="clark-rufus">Clark</persRef>
                            preached from John 3.3. “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily,
                            verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the
                            kingdom of God.” <persRef ref="nicodemus">Nicodemus</persRef>, a ruler
                            of the Jews, had witnessed or heard of the miracles performed by Jesus
                            and from them had inferred as a certainty that he was a teacher come
                            from God— He assigns expressly the miracles as the proof of the divine
                            mission— Jesus then emphatically announces to him that except a man be
                            born again he cannot see the kingdom of God—but what is meant by being
                            born again and what by seeing God— They are both figurative expressions
                            applicable to the man who came to make the enquiries, and to the other
                            men of that age and country— It was necessary that a jew, born under the
                            Mosaic dispensation, and bred to the Levitical Law, should become a new
                            creature, should set aside his whole system of religion and morals,
                            before he could understand, adopt and practice upon that code of Laws,
                            which the teacher come from God was then promulgating.— The answer to
                            Nicodemus was purposely obscure and typical— Nicodemus did not
                            understand it; or he affected to understand the words in their literal
                            sense, and enquired how it was possible that an old man should be born
                            again— In the sequel to the discourse Jesus declared that his meaning
                            was all spiritual—that God had sent his only begotten son into the world
                            to save the world, but that the world would not receive him—and although
                            this was before the imprisonment of <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John
                                the Baptist</persRef>, Jesus distinctly intimated that his own life
                            must be forfeited before his new system of religion could be fully
                            unfolded— Now the whole tenour of this conference seems to me
                            exclusively applicable to the condition of that age and country and to
                            have no possible reference to times and places and men where the kingdom
                            of God, or in other words the Christian system of religion and morals
                            has been established for ages— This is not however the Calvinistic
                            doctrine and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark taught us all that we
                            must be born again before we could see the kingdom of God, without
                            explaining to us how we were to be born again or what it was to see the
                            kingdom of God— No definite idea was left upon the mind— <persRef

                        <p>Twenty-seventh Congress, Second Session commences— The seat of my
                            complaints is shifting, but my only relief is from one pain to another—
                                <persRef ref="skirving-joh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Skirving</persRef> came, this morning, and took back his report and
                            drawings. <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Leavitt</persRef> called. He comes to report the proceedings of the
                            house of Representatives for his Newspaper. He spoke of the state of
                            Negotiations in relation to the Republic of Texas, of which there is a
                            new project of annexation to these United States— I rode to the Capitol,
                            and at 12 O’Clock, Noon the Speaker <persRef ref="white-john6">John
                                White</persRef> of Kentucky took the Chair, and the roll of members
                            was called over by States<space/>Answered to their names.— <persRef
                                ref="dodge-henry">Henry Dodge</persRef> was sworn in as Delegate
                            from the Wiskonsin territory, and <persRef ref="granger-francis">Francis
                                Granger</persRef>, as a member from the District in New-York which
                            he formerly represented, and by which he has been re-elected since his
                            short tour of duty as Postmaster General— The Secretary of the Senate
                                <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef> came and
                            announced that the Senate were assembled and ready to proceed to
                            business— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef>
                            rose to request the Speaker not to appoint him on the Committee of
                            public lands—and while he was up, offered a Resolution to adopt the
                            rules of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress pro tempore— I
                            had prepared a Resolution to adopt the rules as on force at the close of
                            the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, except the 21<hi
                                rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule; excluding abolition petitions and
                            offered it as an amendment to Johnson’s. <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
                                >Stanley</persRef> in concert with <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
                                >Filmore</persRef> offered as an amendment to my amendment a
                            Resolution to adopt the rules of the last Session for fifteen days; and
                            in the mean time to take up and decide upon the Committee’s revision of
                            the rules reported on the last day of the last Session—and then Stanly
                            called the previous question— I objected that the previous question
                            could not be applied before the adoption of any rules.—the Speaker
                            decided that it could, by Parliamentary Law, and former practice— I
                            appealed from this decision, and called the yeas and nays— His decision
                            was sustained 144 to 17., both parties joining against me to suppress
                            all debate on this subject— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> had
                            got this discussion suspended to get himself appointed on the Committee
                            to notify the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> that the two
                            Houses were assembled and ready to receive a communication from him— And
                            he reported that the President would make a communication at Noon
                            to-morrow. Stanlys resolutions were rejected 84 to 87. mine by precisely
                            the same numbers, and Wise immediately moved to adjourn, which was
                            carried a quarter past 2. <persRef ref="starr-albert">M<hi

                            chaplaincy in the Navy, has not yet been crowned with success. <persRef

                            and I introduced him on the floor of the house, as a member of the
                            Legislature of Massachusetts— Immediately after the <persRef

                            of the Journal of yesterday, the <persRef ref="tyler-john"

                            <persRef ref="tyler-robert">Son and Secretary</persRef>, delivered his
                            annual Message, which was read by the Clerk <persRef ref="clarke-mathew"
                                >Matthew S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair Clark</persRef> and
                            took an hour and twenty minutes in the reading— Wise moved the printing
                            of the usual number with the documents and ten thousand copies extra, of
                            the Message alone. <persRef ref="mason-samson">Sampson Mason</persRef>
                            enquired if the advertisement of the Congressional Globe added to the
                            printed message in some of the copies distributed by the boys among the
                            members was included in this motion to print— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
                                >Wise</persRef> took this up, as an attack upon the President, and a
                            tart colloquy followed between him and Mason—but his motion for printing
                            was adopted after being modified to the precedent of the last Session.
                            Then <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson’s</persRef>
                            Resolution to adopt the Rules of the last Congress, till the report of
                            the Committee of the last Session upon the rules shall be acted upon, a
                            modification which he took up at last at the suggestion of <persRef
                                ref="fillmore-millard">Millard Fillmore</persRef> was taken up— The
                            Speaker said that the questions upon <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
                                >Stanly’s</persRef> proposition and mine yesterday had not been
                            taken under the previous question—but Johnson now moved the previous
                            question, and it was carried by 101. votes and his resolution was
                            adopted by yeas and nays 97 to 95. and the right of petition is again
                            suppressed for the remainder of the present Congress.— An order passed
                            for the appointment of the standing committees, and to fix the hour of
                            daily meeting at 12. O’Clock, and the house adjourned. Johnson came to
                            my seat to introduce some friend, and joked about his victory for three
                            or four days—but it is for the Congress; and bitterly does it try my
                            temper— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef

                            to me, and strenuously urged my consent to act again as Chairman of the
                            Committee of Manufactures—to witness the prostration of the whole
                            manufacturing interest by the faction combined of Southern
                            Slave-breeders, and the Northern democracy— I despair— At least for my
                            own time— The day of redemption will come—but it is not destined for me—
                            Charles was distressed by a Letter from <persRef ref="frothingham-ann"

                            been taken ill with the scarlet fever.— It damped the enjoyment of a

                            before their departure to return home— There was Piano music and dancing
                            till near midnight.</p>

                                Cushing</persRef> came this morning according to appointment, and
                            said that the Speaker <persRef ref="white-john6">John White</persRef>
                            had expressed to him the wish that he would resign the station of
                            Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations in my favour.— That
                            having occupied that station at the last Session, it would have the
                            appearance of personal hostility to him, if he should be now removed
                            from it, and he therefore came now to ask my advice, what he should do—
                            That the whigs were a party entirely broken up— That the portion of the
                            whigs who attended the caucus at the close of the last Session, who
                            issued the address against the President did not exceed fifty, but that
                            there was no administration party in the house— Meaning to intimate that
                            as a friend of the administration of <persRef ref="tyler-john">John
                                Tyler</persRef> he felt bound to adhere to the station of chairman
                            of the Committee of foreign relations— I said to him that it was a point
                            upon which I was hardly competent to give him advice— That I had no
                            desire to be chairman of the Committee of foreign relations, and had
                            never directly or indirectly intimated such wish to the Speaker— That
                            after most reluctantly serving ten years, as Chairman of the Committee
                            of Manufactures, I had at the last Session requested the Speaker not to
                            put me on that Committee— He said he would not and asked me if I had any
                            objection to serving on the Committee of foreign relations— I said that
                            should be as he pleased, and the next day, he Cushing was announced as
                            Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations, and I of the Committee
                            of Indian Affairs, more odious than that of Manufactures— The house had
                            at my request excused me from serving on the Indian Committee, and I had
                            been on no standing Committee throughout the Session— I should be
                            perfectly satisfied with the same dispensation throughout the present
                            Session.— As to his being chairman of the Committee of foreign
                            relations, I must in candour say to him that after the rancorous
                            hostility of his feelings against England, not only with reference to
                            the Northeastern boundary question, but upon numerous other points on
                            which I believed England more sinned against than sinning, I could not
                            say that I had much confidence in the course of that Committee with him
                            at its head.— He knew that my advice to <persRef ref="webster-daniel"

                            place last September when all the other heads of Department resigned,
                            was founded exclusively on the belief that M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Websters signally conciliatory temper and disposition
                            towards <pb n="551" type="ms"/>England was indispensably necessary to
                            save us from a most disastrous and calamitous War, upon that wretched
                            question about the State-right of New-York to hang <persRef
                                ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef>— That most fortunately that
                            stimulant to instant war was removed, but the temper of the two
                            Countries was still so embittered and exasperated that it would still
                            require the most soothing spirit and the coolest blood to preserve the
                            peace between them— That in the differences between M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler and the <persRef
                                ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> Cabinet I had taken no
                            part; and had no feeling of hostility to the administration; but he knew
                            that in advising M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster to retain his
                            office as Secretary of State I had expressly disclaimed all obligation
                            or intention to defend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler’s treatment
                            of the Cabinet, or his executive measures during the late Session— I
                            added that my personal feelings towards him Cushing had invariably been
                            and still continued to be altogether friendly. That I had believed him
                            to be uniformly friendly to me. (He said it was certainly so.) And that
                            so strong and earnest had this feeling been that although there several
                            points of policy of vital importance, upon which my opinions differed
                            totally from those expressed by him, I had not on a single occasion
                            manifested that difference in the house; nor sought any discussion with
                            him in private— He said he regretted that I had not— And that he had not
                            been aware of my differing from him excepting, in what I had <hi
                                rend="italic">lately</hi> said of the affair of the Caroline— I
                            repeated that I had studiously avoided all altercation with him, from
                            that overruling friendliness of disposition— That he could not but have
                            observed that when he undertook to sanction and adopt the tariff
                            compromise, and to speak not only for himself, but for the whole
                            commonwealth, Governor Lincoln, openly and explicitly declared his
                            dissent from that declaration; and that I said nothing—though I
                            certainly differed from him, more widely even than <persRef
                                ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>. To all this M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing made no explanatory reply; but
                            said he should not mention to the Speaker the substance of our
                            conversation, but should be quiescent, and leave the Speaker to act as
                            he may please— That is he clings to the chair of the committee, and
                            compels the Speaker to appoint him— So be it. This morning, I found the
                            house in Session.— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>

                                Cushing</persRef>, was of a character requiring more detail on the
                            record than the usual space of one day would allow. At the commencement
                            of the last Session of Congress, <persRef ref="white-john6"
                                >White</persRef> the Speaker intended to place me as Chairman of the
                            Committee of foreign relations—he gave me notice of that intention; and
                            the next day appointed Cushing; at the special request of <persRef
                                ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>— Cushing thought that
                            inflammatory declamation against England, upon all possible topics was
                            the short cut to popularity; and he speechified accordingly— It appears
                            that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White is now again disposed to place
                            me on the Committee of foreign relations.— I suppose he came yesterday
                            with an expectation that I would authorise him to say to the Speaker
                            that I wished him to be placed again as chairman of the Committee of
                            foreign relations, or to ascertain whether I had any concert with the
                            speaker on this occasion— At the house this morning <persRef

                            of the Midshipmen’s station were full and over flowing. I was—but
                            understanding that an increase of the navy was in contemplation, I
                            supposed that an additional number of midshipman might very soon be
                            appointed. He said recommend such an increase in advance of the building
                            of the ships; for it would be worse than useless to build the ships and
                            then have no officers to manage them— I spoke to him also in behalf of

                            Minister of the Church in 4 1/2 Street preached from Luke 15.10—
                            [“]There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
                            that repenteth.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich is a native of
                            Boston, and an orthodox calvinist of the straitest sect— He commented
                            largely on the nature and causes of the joy in heaven over repenting
                            sinners— It was joy in the presence of the Angels of God—not only their
                            own joy, but the joy of God himself—joy distinctly felt and upon
                            separate grounds, by each of the three persons of the Godhead—by the
                            father by the son, and by the holy spirit.— This idea, for which there
                            is no warrant—whatever in Scripture M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich
                            borrowed from a hymn of <persRef ref="u">Watts</persRef>—the 101<hi
                                rend="superscript">st.</hi> of the first book; which he gave out to
                            be sung— Like many other calvinistic quiddities, it bordered so closely
                            up on the burlesque, that I could not for my life resist the
                            recollection of <persRef ref="stanhope-philip">Chesterfields</persRef>
                            profane and profligate song upon this passage— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Rich’s enquiry into the motives for joy in Heaven over one
                            repenting sinner was little less ludicrous— He said it was because every
                            repenting sinner, added to the multitudes of God’s blissful kingdom; and
                            drew nearer the destruction of this Globe of earth, which must be
                            intensely desired by the Angels—for they must consider it owing to its
                            foul corruption the vilest of the heavenly orbs, and a mere blot on the
                            face of creation. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich gave notice of

                            is written in the book of the words of the <persRef ref="isaiah"
                                >Esaias</persRef> the prophet, saying, the voice of one crying in

                            5. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
                            brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways
                            shall be made smooth: 6. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”

                            discourse with conscious eloquence, and with a careless facility of
                            utterance as if he had been aware that it was an occasion for the

                            commission, as confidential Agent of the State of the Isthmus, a new
                            South-American Republic self-detached from that of New-Grenada— He says
                            this Republic has existed as much as two years and has established a
                            regular Constitution, not recognized by that of New Grenada, but
                            independent of it de facto. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff
                            asked my advice with regard to presenting himself to the <persRef

                            I advised him to see the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of

                            letter—and desire him to take the decision of the President whether he
                            will think proper to receive him— <persRef ref="kavasales-photius"
                                >Kavasales</persRef> came in, and I told him I had spoken for him to

                            indemnity for French spoliations prior to 1800. a claim which has been
                            forty years before Congress, and is now one of the burdens of the
                            Committee of foreign relations.— At the house <persRef

                            of Ways and Means moved for leave to the Committee to employ a

                            bill making a partial appropriation for the expenses of the two houses,
                            and the pay and Mileage of the members— Committee of the whole on the
                            state of the Union, <persRef ref="pope-john">John Pope</persRef> in the
                            Chair— The bill passed through that and all other stages in less than
                            half an hour, and was sent to the Senate— Then the presentation of
                            petitions was resumed at the State of New-York and went Southward
                            through all the States— The Territories were not called— A great number
                            of abolition petitions and remonstrances were presented in very
                            diversified forms,—some excluded, some referred to Committees, and many
                            laid over for debate. I gave notice personally to all the members of the
                            Committee of foreign relations to meet at 11— O’Clock to morrow morning
                            in the chamber of the Committee— I declined an invitation to a party

                            Committee of Foreign Relations, in their chamber adjoining that of the
                            Committee of Manufactures— The members present were Adams, <persRef

                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Proffit</persRef> I proposed to keep
                            minutes of the meetings, entering the name of each member present at
                            every meeting which was agreed to—and to hold a regular meeting once a
                            week on Tuesday morning’s at 10. O’Clock— I read the Letter from the
                                <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> and its 3
                            enclosure, respecting the hunter’s lodges on the Canadian frontier.— An
                            objection was started that this subject had not been referred by the
                            house to the Committee— The Chairman was instructed to move the house to
                            refer to the Committee the two Messages from the <persRef
                                ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> which had been referred to the
                            Committee at the last Session, and not reported on by them.— Adjourned
                            to Tuesday Morning. It was apparent that Everett and Granger were both
                            averse to the revival of the Act of 10. March 1838. recommended by the
                            President’s Message of 21. July last, and urged by the Letter of
                                the<space/>inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> from the Secretary of
                            State— At the house the call for petitions was completed by the
                            delegates from the three territories. <persRef ref="yulee-david">David

                            the petitions laid over was then in order, but I consented to its
                            postponement, until the house shall have passed on the Resolutions
                            offered by <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            without going into committee of the whole and to distribute the several
                            parts of the Message at once to the appropriate committees— Questions of
                            conflicting jurisdictions immediately arose— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
                                >Wise</persRef> and Cushing were jealous of the Committee of Ways

                            commenced a dead set against the reference of the Tariff to the

                            search of an hour and a half, in which I found the minute of the
                            petition, as entered when I presented it but not the petition itself. I
                            had received a Letter from <persRef ref="homer-eleazer">Eleazer

                            I called at the Pension-Office where the <persRef ref="edwards-james"

                            copy of the answer—the claim is rejected as it had been in 1835—and
                            Homer has shewn no rational ground for reviving it— I called at <persRef

                            out of his chamber though much better— He has been absent from his seat

                            a design to revive the project of annexing Texas to the United States—
                            They said there was a long article in the New-York Courier and Inquirer
                            recommending it, by arguments addressed first to the abolitionists, and
                            then to others— And they asked if anything could now be done to
                            counteract this movement— I know of nothing, but to make it as soon and
                            as extensively known as possible— There is apparently in this movement a

                            the North American confederacy. The developements of this project are
                            not yet sufficiently clear and explicit to know how to meet and
                            counteract it— My old servant <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
                                >Giusta</persRef> came this evening, raving distracted, and
                            threatened with a brain fever— Talking in the most insane manner without

                        <p>My poor <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> came this
                            morning, sobbing and sighing as if he would burst his heart, and
                            imploring my forgiveness and pity— He had not slept a wink the whole
                            night and his brain had been unceasingly running upon trinity, unity,
                            God, 1. 2. 3. one in a ring, my motto of Toil and Trust, upon a ring; my
                            advice to him and kind treatment of him on sundry occasions, and other
                            meditative fantasies which have unsettled his mind. I endeavoured to
                            sooth him without direct contradiction, and urged him to consult a
                            physician, and take some composing medicine, to induce sleep, which he
                            finally promised to do— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi

                            Morning worship in the Hall of the house of Representatives, where the

                                Septimus Tustin</persRef>, the chaplain of the Senate preached from
                            Revelation 22.5. first clause of the verse— “And there shall be no night
                            there.”— The sermon was short; and not so impressive as the text— A
                            region of eternal day, opened a field for a description of Heaven well
                            suited to eloquent declamation— But in the promise of Heaven there can
                            be nothing specific. To beings of flesh and blood, eternal day, is not
                            identical with eternal felicity— The vicissitudes of day and night are
                            more congenial to the mortal nature of man than the glare of eternal
                            daylight—but the how, as well as the where of eternal, uninterrupted
                            unalloyed happiness is as inconceivable to the mind as it is contrary to
                            the earthly experience of man— <persRef ref="pope-john;pope-francis"

                            me this morning, only four days from Boston, and to return thither after
                            a day or two more.— He said that just before he left Boston <persRef

                            ask me, if I would sign a petition from inhabitants of Quincy for a
                            charter to a company for making a rail-road from Boston to Quincy.— As
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy is elected a member of the
                            Senate from Boston in the State Legislature, and will probably be
                            President of the Senate, he is unwilling to head the petition for the
                            Charter with his name, and wishes me therefore to occupy that place— I
                            asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson, if he had the petition
                            here— He had not— I said I would cheerfully sign the petition, if I
                            could be satisfied that the railroad would contribute to the prosperity
                            of the town of Quincy; and that would depend upon the issue whether the
                            income of the road, would pay for its cost, expenses and maintenance, a
                            point not entirely clear— He thought it would and supposed that M<hi

                            observed that the practice had always been to abstain from all
                            interference with the action of the Executive upon matters pending in
                            negotiation, unless at the instance of the Executive himself.— This was
                            precisely the course that I was desirous of pursuing— <persRef

                            and the Southern members of the Committee acquiesced in it, and relieved
                            me for the present from the burden of sharp and heavy discussions. We
                            then took up references of private claims— A petition of a <persRef

                            from the further consideration of the subject, and that it be referred
                            to the Committee on the judiciary— The Petition of <persRef

                                >William Carmichael</persRef> came next. There was a report of the
                            Committee, at a former Session against the claim; and a minority report,
                            signed by Cushing and Everett in its favour— I very earnestly
                            recommended it to the favour of the Committee and proposed referring it
                            to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett for a new report, which was
                            voted— Everett said the practice had been for the chairman to charge
                            each member of the committee with any particular subject at his
                            discretion— I told him he might if he pleased take it as a charge direct
                            from me— The claims on France prior to 1800 were postponed <persRef

                            the Committee adjourned till next Tuesday— In the house the unfinished
                            business; the tariff, the manufactures and the Ways and Means, occupied
                            the day.— <persRef ref="sollers-augustus">Sollers</persRef>, <persRef

                            Speaker said every member had already a right of appeal from the
                            decision of the Speaker to the house and Marshall said he had offered to
                            yield the floor to Barton who declined to take it— <persRef
                                ref="taliaferro-john">Taliaferro</persRef>, afterwards announced
                            that the whole matter had arisen from mutual misunderstanding between
                            Barton and the Speaker, which had been explained and adjusted, and no
                            more was to be said about it.— Marshall made a beautiful speech of an
                            hour and a half in favour of the manufacturing interest, and <persRef
                                ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> a ranting one against it.
                                <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> then took the
                            floor, and the house adjourned— No letter this evening from Boston— Hope
                            and prayer may yet not cease.</p>

                        <p>I had received a Letter from <persRef ref="wright-william2">William
                                Wright</persRef> of Boston, enquiring of the present condition of
                            his petition presented at the second Session of the 26<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, for an investigation of a
                            settlement made by the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
                                Buren</persRef> Administration, with the Commonwealth’s Bank at
                            Boston— It was referred when presented to a select Committee of 5
                            members, of whom <persRef ref="bond-william2">W. K. Bond</persRef> of
                            Ohio was Chairman— That Committee though continued through the second
                            Session of that Congress were never permitted to report. I had the
                            papers found this morning in the clerks office, and saw that of the
                            Committee of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, only two of
                            the five members are members of the present Congress <persRef
                                ref="hall-hiland">Hiland Hall</persRef> and John H. Brockway, and I
                            took the papers to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall, and requested
                            him to call them up and move their reference to a select Committee; but
                            he declined— <persRef ref="brockway-john">Brockway</persRef> did the
                            same; and I was obliged to make the motion myself; requesting that I
                            might not be placed on the Committee myself.— My motion for the
                            reference was adopted— I had the papers on the petition of <persRef

                            of the house to the Committee of Claims.— A number of other petitions
                            and resolutions were smuggled in before the order of the day was
                            regularly called and then <persRef ref="atherton-charles"
                                >Atherton</persRef> of New Hampshire made a crabbed speech, he can
                            make no other, of an hour and a half, against the manufactures; followed
                            by <persRef ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> of Illinois, a
                            coarse, vulgar, ignorant, cunning, knavish democrat who has been
                            Governor of that State, and is a standing favourite of the democracy,
                            his buffoonery keeps him afloat— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
                                >Arnold</persRef> of Tennessee replied to them both, and played at
                            cut and thrust with them somewhat in their own style.— Arnold is a bold,
                            honest, warm-hearted and hot-headed whig, born down by the weight of
                                <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> name and influence
                            in the State—too fair and candid for the Slave-breeders, and rather too
                            vehement for the timid and time-serving abolitionists of the North— When
                            he finished <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> of Ohio took the
                            floor, and the house adjourned over to Monday; which <persRef
                                ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> had seized on an unguarded
                            moment of the house to move, and had been carried by the <persRef
                                ref="white-john6">Speaker’s</persRef> hardness of hearing to the
                            call for yeas and nays.— There had been hard frost last night; and there
                            was a glare of ice in the streets this morning—the chill of the
                            atmosphere relaxed throughout the day till the evening closed with
                            floods of rain— I had been all day brooding over anxious expectation of
                            Letters from Boston; three days of dubious cheering having been followed
                            by one, of inauspicious interval.— The letter came; not from <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> which had been promised; but
                            from <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>—a report of
                            two days—the first deeply discouraging—the second faintly reviving hope,
                            but too clearly foreshowing the fatal close.</p>

                                Baldwin</persRef> came this morning and took back his protest
                            against the Convention of indemnities, with Mexico, and against all the
                            proceedings of the joint Commission under it now sitting in this City—
                            The Convention itself, and all the proceedings of the Commissioners, are
                            of so very extraordinary a character that I cannot resist a strong
                            suspicion that it was intended by the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
                                Buren</persRef> administration, not to obtain indemnification for
                            citizens of the United States upon Mexico, but to keep open the sore,
                            and breed a war with Mexico, as machinery for the annexation of Texas to
                            the United States— There is not a step in the whole series of
                            transactions, which has a tendency to the satisfaction, or even to the
                            adjustment of the claims— The convention itself is a mockery— The
                            commission under it, an imposture— I have received two pamphlets, one of
                            charges against the two Mexican Commissioners <persRef

                            the other, by the same person containing a statement of facts, presented
                            to the President of the United States relating to the man’s claim on the
                            Government of Mexico. The claim is of a Neapolitan Marquis turned into a
                            North American Democrat, of damages for having been twice banished from
                            Mexico, for setting up periodical journals in that city and preaching
                            party politics. D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Baldwin’s claims I have

                        <p>Christmas.</p>
                        <p>This is among Christians of many denominations a festive day; and
                            although born and bred to the creed of the puritans which excluded all
                            consecrations of particular anniversary days to religious celebration, I
                            have from my youth up, been always inclined to make exception of this
                            and Easter, day. More than once however in the course of my life the
                            circumstances of the times have saddened the days which the remembrance
                            of the birth and resurrection of the Saviour would have filled with joy—
                            So has it been this Season. The approach of Christmas has been
                            embittered by the long suspense, from the day when <persRef

                            us to this, hanging over the fate of his <persRef ref="adams-henry4"
                                >lovely boy</persRef>—every day has been a day of anguish, and every
                            night a night of fainting hope and momentary relief from awful
                            expectation to learn that the child was gone. The mail from Boston due
                            last Night, did not arrive till this day at Noon— It brought a Letter
                            from <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
                                Brooks</persRef>, of Wednesday Morning, of feeble and precarious
                            general hope, with which I suffered myself to be elated beyond all
                            reason, and enjoyed a day of delusion still cherished by Letters one day
                            later, of Thursday morning, from the father and mother of the dear
                            agonizing child— They too were indulging hope against symptoms of the
                            deepest alarm— To be prepared for the will of God, in resignation or in
                            joy, is the only prayer that I can address to the throne of Heaven; and
                            to say in humility of Soul thy will be done. <persRef

                        <p>I attended public worship this morning at the second presbyterian church
                            where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark preached from Hebrews 12.1.
                            [“]Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of
                            witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
                            easily beset us, and let us run with patience, the race that is set
                            before us.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark is a young man with a
                            clear strong voice, steeped in Calvinism to the lips, with the rusticity
                            of deportment, dress, and stoop of a fresh country graduate of a yankee
                            college, the type of whose pronunciation is measurable by the incessant
                            repetition of the name of <hi rend="italic">Gaud</hi>— He appears
                            however to have captivated the worshipers of the second presbyterian
                            church, in whose bosoms he seems to have infused a new portion of zeal.
                            Besides the ordinary services of the Lord’s day he has set on foot a
                            course of lectures, most of which are to be delivered by himself, and
                            some for variety by others—He gave notice of several of these lectures,
                            four of which are upon <persRef ref="bunyan-john">Bunyan’s</persRef>
                            pilgrim’s progress, and also that he should repeat at 7 O’Clock this
                            evening a sermon upon the last judgment, which he delivered last Sunday
                            evening. His morning sermon this day contained some scanty notices of
                            the character and ceremonial of the antient <hi rend="italic"
                            >races</hi>, to which the figurative language of the apostle, in this
                            text alludes— After church we had as morning visitors <persRef

                            Bigelow</persRef>, who charged him to say to <persRef

                            recovery of our dear <persRef ref="adams-henry4">grand child</persRef>,
                            whose most unfavourable symptom then was a total want of appetite— We
                            had received last Night, one day later when this most fearful symptom
                            still continued and abashes all the hopes with reasonable expectation,
                            which the abatement of other fatal symptoms might encourage— <persRef

                                Thornton</persRef> called in also before dinner— In the afternoon,
                            at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
                                ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
                            preached from Isaiah 4.5. [“]And the Lord will create upon every
                            dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke
                            by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by Night: for upon all the
                            glory shall be a defence.—” He had read evening prayers for the first
                            Sunday after Christmas— It is somewhat curious that M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley seems to have a special impulse for
                            taking his texts from the prophet Isaiah— We had no letter this evening
                            from Boston Let me yield to hope that the silence forebodes not evil
                            tidings.</p>

                                Leavitt</persRef> brought me a New-York evangelist a Newspaper of
                            which he said he was formerly the editor— It contained the protest made
                            at New-Orleans of <persRef ref="gifford-zephaniah">Zephaniah C

                            the American brig Creole a Slave-trader, bound from Norfolk Virginia, to
                            New-Orleans with a cargo of tobacco, and 135 slaves— On Sunday the 7<hi

                            mutinied, and after a fight in which one Slave trader and one mutineer
                            were killed, and several others on both sides were wounded, the
                            mutineers prevailed, and compelled the white crew to navigate the vessel
                            into Nassau New Providence—where 19 of the self emancipated cargo were
                            arrested and imprisoned upon charges of mutiny and murder, and the rest
                            were received and landed as free; except five who refused their freedom,
                            and returned to the brig, and were landed at New-Orleans— This is a
                            remarkable event, and will be followed by momentous consequences—

                            information concerning our relations with Hayti—and one of 19. June
                            last, for aggregate returns of the Census.— He knew nothing about either
                            of them— <persRef ref="markoe-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Markoe</persRef> could give no account of the Hayti call— <persRef

                            Message as relates to the British claim to the right of search of
                            American vessels on the coast of Africa— At the last meeting of the
                            Committee Rhett being the only member absent, the Committee had without
                            dissenting voice agreed to take no action upon the President’s message,
                            unless upon special call from the house or the executive.— Rhett was now
                            very impatient— I requested him to reduce his motion to writing, which
                            he did. I think the majority of the Committee will be against his
                            motion, but never was an occasion when I had more need of accurate
                            perception, thorough knowledge, cool and dispassionate judgment,
                            inflexible firmness, intrepid perseverance, imperturbable serenity, and
                            courtesy of deportment than now. That I have eternal right on my side is
                            certain— Let me never for an instant forget that [“]He that is slow to
                            anger is better than the mighty: and he that ruleth his spirit than he
                            that taketh a city.” My cause is the Peace of my country, and the rights
                            of human nature— In the house <persRef ref="hudson-charles"
                                >Hudson</persRef> finished his excellent speech in favour of a
                            protective tariff— He was followed by <persRef ref="payne-william3"
                                >Payne</persRef> of Alabama, <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Edmund

                                Eastman</persRef> both of New Hampshire, all anti-protective— Burke
                            read his Speech, in so low a tone of voice that he was heard by scarcely
                            any one, but it was retaliatory upon <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
                                >Arnold</persRef>, and drew a ludicrous parallel between the States
                            of New-Hampshire, and of Tennessee, especially East-Tennessee, from
                            which Arnold comes. Eastman is a sprightly speaker, and belaboured
                            Arnold, with equal venom and more power and effect— He did not finish.
                            The house adjourned about 3. At the meeting of the Committee of foreign

                                Fessenden</persRef> of Portland, Maine had mentioned to me
                            yesterday, that Captain Hatch had a letter to me, and wished I would
                            name a time when he could see and have some conversation with me— I
                            fixed 9. O’Clock this morning, and at that time he came with a letter of
                            introduction from Alden Bradford— This Captain Hatch is the brother of
                                <persRef ref="hatch-george">George M Hatch</persRef>, also Master of
                            an American Vessel who in July last had the misfortune to cause the
                            death of a riotous, drunken, and insulting American sailor at Rotterdam
                            in Holland, who belonged to another vessel, and was forcing his way on
                            board of Hatch’s vessels in defiance of his orders— For this homicide
                            Captain Hatch was tried by the Court of criminal jurisdiction of that
                            country, and sentenced to have a sword swayed over his head, and to five
                            years imprisonment— The other Masters of American vessels at Rotterdam,
                            sympathising sailor fashion with their countryman called in a tone
                            rather peremptory upon the <persRef ref="bleecker-harmanus">American
                                Chargé d’Affaires Bleecker</persRef> to interpose, and claim

                                >r.</hi> Bleecker declining to assert this pretension did interpose
                            by solicitation for a pardon, but without success. Captain W. B. Hatch
                            has now brought with him; and presented to the Secretary of State
                            numerous petitions, praying the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President of
                                the United States</persRef> for his interposition to obtain the
                            discharge of the prisoner.— And he came to me for advice— I told him
                            that we could not question the jurisdiction of the dutch court—but the
                            President might efficaciously interpose by solicitation for pardon— He
                            said his brother’s <persRef ref="u">wife</persRef> had thought of going
                            to solicit for him, and he had proposed <hi rend="strikethrough">this by

                            must be made, or the Treasury must suspend payments— He moved therefore

                            might have made the necessary provision; but a motion was made to

                                Whittlesey</persRef> called this morning, and introduced a boy,
                            about twelve years old named <persRef ref="washington-william">William
                                    <unclear>M’Pherson</unclear> Washington</persRef>, son of one of
                            the <persRef ref="washington-perrin">Clerks</persRef> in the general
                            Post-Office; he had a new splendid Album with the name only of <persRef
                                ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> entered in it and he asked me
                            for mine, which I gave with an admonition to the boy from <persRef
                                ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>. The ways of Wisdom are ways of
                            pleasantness, and all her paths are peace— There is a passion for Albums
                            and Autographs spreading all over the country like the yellow fever or
                            the Cholera. <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Kavasales</persRef> came to inform me, that the
                            President had sent to the Senate last week a nomination of 5. chaplains
                            in the Navy, upon which his name was the last— He has some apprehension
                            that its confirmation may be resisted in the Senate, and he solicited my
                            influence with any of the Senators whom I may see before their next
                            Meeting. <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Hassler</persRef> came and informed me that his report in answer to
                            a Resolution of the House, of the last Session moved by <persRef
                                ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef> (25 June 1841) relating
                            to the Coast Survey, was sent in yesterday and he wished me to move that
                            it should be printed; and that a certain number of copies should be
                            furnished to him as had been done on a former occasion— Cushing’s
                            Resolution was moved and carried in a spirit of hostility to Hassler—
                            Nor will he be satisfied by the report— I called at the Department of
                            State and had a three hours conversation with the <persRef
                                ref="webster-daniel">Secretary</persRef> upon foreign Affairs.— I
                            received at the Department a Session pamphlet copy of the Acts of
                            Congress at each of the last three Sessions. Upon the State of the
                            Canadian frontier he gave me some information and expressed a strong
                            desire for the revival of the act of 10. March 1838— The calls of the
                            house for documents respecting our relations with Hayti and for the
                            aggregates of the census have not yet been, but will be answered— There
                            is no regular communication, of the Department, with China— The Consul,
                                <persRef ref="u">Snow</persRef>, is in this Country. A man named
                            Delano, sometimes writes from Macao. No late information from thence—
                            None from Mexico.— They know not even how <persRef
                                ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa Anna</persRef> comes to be at the head
                            of the Government there— Nor what to do with the Commission of indemnity
                            now sitting here under the Convention of 11— April 1839— I enquired if
                                <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew Stevenson</persRef> had ever
                            informed the department of his Letters to <persRef ref="hull-isaac"
                                >Commodore Hull</persRef> in March last, advising him to run away,
                            and make the best of his way home, to escape from the clutches of the
                            British Lion— He did in June last communicate copies of those Letters,
                            written in March— But the President thought it best not <pb n="574"
                                type="ms"/>not to communicate to Congress that portion of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Stevensons diplomatic atchievements. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster himself thought that the other
                            part of the Negotiations might have been permitted to slumber in the
                            same oblivion—he considered Stevenson as having surrendered the question
                            at issue on the right of search, by assuming untenable ground against
                            it. This was my own opinion— He remarked on the extra ordinary
                            circumstance of the correspondence between Stevenson, and <persRef
                                ref="temple-henry">Lord Palmerston</persRef>, when they were in
                            substance, both out of office, and under no responsibility.— The term of
                            Stevenson’s mission having actually expired, and the Ministry of which
                            Palmerston was a member having been dismissed while the correspondence
                            was in progress— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster says that the
                                <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the Navy Upshur</persRef> is
                            a very considerable man, and utterly disapproves Stevenson’s pretensions
                            about the right of search— After full and free conversation I found
                            every particle of opinion avowed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Webster on this controversy about the right of search perfectly
                            concurring with my own. I told him that my own disposition with regard
                            to all questions in negotiation with Great-Britain was essentially
                            pacific, and especially averse to every thing irritating in form or
                            offensive in language; and against every thing of War tendency,
                            excepting the boundary question; and upon that we should be inflexible—
                            To this he made no reply.— I meant to give him fair warning—and then
                            added that my most earnest desire as chairman of the Committee of
                            foreign affairs was to move in perfect harmony with the Executive
                            administration, and to give to its measures my cordial support— He
                            received this overture with cold hearted thanks; but the great
                            difficulties of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster are not with the
                            foreign Affairs; nor with any thing in that Department— Money, public
                            and private is the insuperable obstacle to his successful progress, and
                            will finally at no distant day turn him out upon the world, and prove
                            the ruin of this administration as it did of the last.</p>
                        <p>I spent this last evening of the year in my own chamber, writing a letter
                            of humble hope, gratulation and comfort to my <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2;adams-abigail4">dear children</persRef>, and in
                            fervent prayer for them and their offspring, and for <persRef
                                ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and the family around
                            me—including my neighbours, relatives, friends—my country, and the world
                            of mankind— The last moments of the departing year were cheered with a
                            letter from <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>,
                            written on Wednesday morning and encouraging the expectation so long and
                            so nearly believed beyond redemption extinct that the dear child
                                <persRef ref="adams-henry4">Henry</persRef>, will yet soon be
                            convalescent, and spared for useful life on earth, by the merciful
                            dispensation of God.—</p>
