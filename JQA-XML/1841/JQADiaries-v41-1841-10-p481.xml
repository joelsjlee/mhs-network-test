                        <p>Transition to an autumnal Northwester-morning frost and clear sky, but
                            with a border of black cloud along the eastern horizon, and intercepting
                            the view of the rising Sun— The day differed altogether from its two
                            immediate predecessors, by a constant series of interruptions from
                            visitors, and consequent loss of time— <persRef ref="oliver-henry">M<hi

                            published in the National Intelligencer of my inability to deliver

                            for the New-York Lyceum— He said also that they proposed requesting me
                            to sit for my portrait, but had not fixed upon the painter— They thought
                            of <persRef ref="peale-rembrandt">Rembrant Peale</persRef> at
                            Philadelphia— I said he had painted me once, and was not very successful
                            in the likeness. And I told him definitively that it was so very
                            uncertain when I can deliver any lecture, that it is impossible for me
                            to contract any positive engagement; but that if on my way to Washington
                            I should find it practicable to stop a day or two at New-York I have
                            invitations from several other associations in that city, which would
                            have a prior claim upon my compliance to that of the Lyceum, before
                            which I have already delivered two Lectures. <persRef

                                ref="teasdalesymesandweston">Teasdale Symes and Weston</persRef>,
                            urging the necessity of our executing as Executors of <persRef

                            declined to do— On reading over the Letter of the Solicitors I thought
                            it furnished additional reason for us to persist in declining to sign

                            Curtis concurred in that opinion— I promised to prepare a reply and to

                            removing with his family from Princeton to Providence Rhode-Island, and

                            turns out a poor farmer, and makes no headway on the Estate at

                            on the first of next December— I asked President Quincy for the last

                            me— He is well satisfied with the present condition of the University
                            where they have now 240 undergraduates—and the law school flourishes
                            beyond all former example numbering this day 120 pupils— The
                            astronomical observatory is less fortunate; a troublesome person having
                            purchased a lot and removed a barn to cover it directly intercepting
                            their Meridian line— So that they have been obliged to change the site

                            and I pray God your spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto
                            the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” entire sanctification was the
                            subject of the discourse, and the various ways in which it is attended
                            with imperfection were pointed out and exposed by
                            deficiency—indifference to religion—by excess running into enthusiasm
                            and fanaticism—by erroneous direction absorbed in unprofitable
                            speculation, or swelling into overweening confidence and self
                            justification— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave notice that the
                            administration of the communion which should have been on this day, was
                            owing to the severity of the weather postponed until next Sunday— The
                            afternoon Sermon was from Genesis 12.1. “Now the Lord said unto Abram,
                            Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s
                            house, unto a land that I will show thee.”— The wonderful character and
                            history of <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> was presented in a
                            summary of the principal events of his life recorded in the book of
                            Genesis.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt dwelt with proper emphasis
                            upon his faithfulness and remarked upon most of the trials to which it
                            was subjected. Abram was of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            generation in descent from <persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>; but his
                            immediate parents had degenerated into idolatry— It pleased Almighty
                            God, to make him the chosen vessel through which his unity and
                            omnipotence was revealed to mankind, and so fired in their hearts and
                            minds that it should never again be extinguished. Why this special
                            revelation was reserved for one man and his posterity for many ages, the
                            holy Scriptures do not disclose; nor why that other revelation of man’s
                            immortality and the retributions of a future life were withheld from
                            Abraham and his descendants for so many ages and finally divulged by a
                            lineal descendant from him in the person of Jesus Christ— From Abraham
                            dates the doctrine of one supreme omnipotent creator of the universe and
                            of man— From Jesus Christ dates the doctrine of eternal life and future
                            rewards and punishments, those two first principles are the sources of
                            all that is good and great in the Nature of Man, and for these two
                            principles the world is indebted to the Hebrew Nation.</p>

                        <p>The storm continued through the Night, and the whole of this day with
                            great violence; and when I went this morning to the wood house for wood
                            to make my fire I found snow was falling— Here, it melted as it fell,
                            but in our neighbourhood it momentarily bleached the ground and at
                            Worcester, fell it is said four inches deep. Not quite so terrific as
                            that which I witnessed in this same house on the 9<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> of October 1804. but more like it than any thing I have
                            met with since— It confined me all day to the house— Towards evening as
                            the gale subsided, and the rain somewhat abated I was preparing to go up
                            the hill to <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, but
                            he, and <persRef ref="adams-charles7;adams-john17">his two elder

                                >Martin</persRef>—and I read to her the same chapters in the common
                            English Bible— She also takes a lesson every morning in <persRef

                            she came of her own accord to me, and requested me to teach her the use
                            of logarithms— I would cultivate these dispositions, and supply to her
                            the place of a father—but how adequate can my power possibly be to my
                            will? How deep are the disappointments of education! I have on hand at

                        <p>The gale has subsided but not the storm. I am reading with my
                            Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> the first
                            book of Chronicles, she in French and I in English, alternately five
                            verses at a time. We are studying also the vulgar fractions in <persRef
                                ref="fenning-daniel">Fenning’s</persRef> algebra, and I am
                            endeavouring by giving her tasks to copy to improve her hand-writing,
                            which has been neglected— I take this occasion to renew the attempt I
                            have heretofore, more than once made to form a collection of the
                            numberless trifles in verse that I have written— There is no small
                            number of them the manuscripts of which are mislaid, and for which I
                            lost again much of this precious day in a luckless pursuit— But in
                            ransacking over my old papers I found six Stanza’s of a version of
                                <persRef ref="rousseau-john">John Baptist Rousseau’s</persRef> ode
                            to Fortune—deemed in the golden age of French Literature, the most
                            beautiful Lyric effusion in that language. I had written these lines I
                            think in the Summer of 1804—at all events more than thirty years ago,
                            with the intention of completing the Translation, and sending it to
                                <persRef ref="dennie-joseph">Joseph Dennie</persRef> for publication
                            in the Port-Folio.— But after the sixth Stanza, My Muse deserted me— I
                            stuck in the mire, and gave up the remainder of the task in Despair. I
                            had forgotten that I ever had made the attempt; but now, with the
                            exception of two or three inadmissible and wretched lines, the rest was
                            too good to be lost, and I renewed the attempt to finish the Ode.— Of
                            course there was nothing else to be done this day; and before going to
                            bed I had struck off four of the nine remaining Stanzas, and taking the
                            fifth with me to bed, had it all upon the brain before I slept— The
                            version now is not so close as was that of the first six Stanza’s— The
                            allusions to antient history, Greek and Roman, must be rendered rather
                            by paraphrase than by translation— The Ode to Fortune is confined to the
                            Fortune of War— Its theme is vicissitude, and invective against heroes—

                            the whole Ode. It would now be a task for a sagacious critic to discover
                            which part of my version was made at the age of 37. and which at the age
                            of 74. and perhaps if I had made due progress in the art of self
                            knowledge I might give an account why a task which at the former period,
                            I gave up in despair, I found now upon resuming it, so easy to
                            accomplish— The facility of composition is incomparably greater to me
                            now, than it was then; but of original thought I have less now than
                            then— In cases of translation the thoughts are all found ready to your
                            hand, and all you have to do is to clothe them— <persRef

                        <p>So did Rousseau in this Ode— The Poem is far more contracted than its

                            Ode— But on the other hand perhaps the admirable 12<hi

                            guerriers magnanimes”—contains the substance of all Johnson’s 32 lines.—
                            Rousseau generalizes— Names no one but old Greeks and Romans, Goths and
                            Vandals— Johnson specifies modern and controversial names— Is not this
                            an indication of the different Governments under which the two Poets
                            wrote— My translation and the original ode, are like a coarse broadcloth
                            English frock coat, compared with an embroidered velvet habit de cour of

                        <p>At length one fair day succeeds to the terrible gale which has made so
                            many widows and orphans within the last four days— I read the Bible this
                            morning with <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">my two
                                Granddaughters</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary

                            the use of Logarithms— They absorb much of my time, but I am willing to
                            believe, that none of my time was ever more usefully employed— Would
                            that I could faithfully discharge my whole duty to this child!— My
                            poetics are far more questionable, and it is much against my will, that
                            they encroach so much upon my proper labours— This afternoon I planted
                            in my seminary patches a number of black oak acorns, and peach stones
                            which I brought with me from Washington; and I gathered perhaps a half
                            gallon of shagbark walnuts wind fallen from my old tree in the garden;
                            the nut of which was planted by my own hand about the 10<hi

                            first part of which was published last Saturday— On comparing it with
                            the pamphlet edition I detected and marked several egregious errors of
                            omission, which Green promised to have corrected. <persRef

                            assistance to obtain repayment to him of a sum paid by him for his
                            passage from Gibraltar in 1825. He was sent home from the Mediterranean
                            Squadron then commanded by <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore
                                Rodgers</persRef>— He made application for this claim, upon the late

                            evidence. He has now an affidavit from the Master of the vessel which
                            brought him. I advised him to add his own statement upon oath, and then
                            send the papers to me—promising to do all I can to obtain payment of his
                            claim— He told me that he had heretofore been intemperate in his habits,
                            but was now wholly reformed.— <persRef ref="bemis-jonathan">D<hi

                            Boston, before my return to Washington, and there should be an Evening,
                            which I could devote to the purpose, I would do it— <persRef

                            according to the approved fashion of declinatures of the present day— My

                            of my father’s Letter, and he enquires whether I have among my fathers
                            papers found Governor Langdons reply—and if so requesting a copy of it
                            with permission to make use of it in his Register, if deemed expedient.

                            for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard, but with it was found another
                            Letter from Governor Langdon of 8. July 1813. in answer to one from my
                            father of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of that month, with which
                            he had enclosed “sketches of the Naval history of the United States.—”
                            Here was another source of enquiry opened, which induced me to postpone
                            the answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard for the present.
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston and

                        <p>I went into Boston this morning, with <persRef ref="gillet-simon"
                                >Gillett</persRef>, in the Quincy Stage; the rain yet drizzling, and
                            with every appearance of continuing through the day. The ride was short,
                            for I was hammering all the time upon an autograph for <persRef ref="u"
                                >Miss Warner</persRef>. I first stop’d at <persRef
                                ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
                                Foster’s</persRef>; and there left my outside Cloak—then called on
                                <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob
                                Bigelow</persRef> whom I consulted concerning my health, and
                            particularly the tumour on my head—he advised me to see a Surgeon, and I
                            accordingly saw <persRef ref="warren-john">D<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Warren</persRef> at his house— He advised the removal of
                            the tumour, and that it should be at the house of some friend of mine at
                            Boston— I said I would come next Thursday, unless I should prefer to
                            postpone it for some weeks, which I afterwards concluded to do, having
                            on reflection no friend at Boston, whom I could willingly impose the
                            burden of allowing the performance of an operation in his house— When I
                            called first at D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Warren’s he was not at
                            home— I went twice to the shop of <persRef ref="mitchell-francis"
                                >Mitchel</persRef> the engraver; and gave him the coloured drawing
                            of the Johnson arms to be engraved as arms on a cushion-form Cornelian
                            stone— In State Street I saw them working with the machine to raise one
                            of the enormous Pilasters in front of the Exchange building and
                            proceeding down to the bottom of the Street at the right hand, and at
                            the head of long whack composed of Quincy Granite and indifferent
                            bricks, I met there a young <persRef ref="bridge-edmund">M<hi

                            of the building which are massive enough, but not yet far advanced
                            towards completion. I paid a visit of half an hour at <persRef

                            trustees of the agricultural Society at <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott"

                                Fosters</persRef> for my Cloak, I returned to Quincy just in time to
                            attend the morning service of public worship.— <persRef
                                ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef>
                            morning text was Luke 7.47— [“]Wherefore, I say unto thee, her sins,
                            which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much: but to whom little is
                            forgiven, the same loveth little[”]— The discourse according to M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s usual mode of composition,
                            introduced, and commented upon the narrative of the occasion upon which
                            these words were spoken— The moral of the tale, is the same with that of
                            the prodigal son— The parable is more simple in its incidents, and far
                            less affecting, than that—the peculiarities of this are the stress laid
                            upon the personal devotion of the woman to him contrasted with the cold
                            and distrustful civilities of the pharisee—the authority openly assumed
                            by Jesus to absolve individuals from their sins—the astonishment
                            naturally expressed by the other guests at this assumption—the
                            ascription of this forgiveness of her many sins to the intensity of her
                            love, and the final declaration to her, that her Faith had saved her.—
                            This power of forgiving sins, seems to me to present the strongest of
                            all the arguments presented in the life of Jesus to sustain the doctrine
                            of his divinity— Must we not all say who is this that forgiveth sins
                            also?— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt administered the communion;
                                <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Whitney</persRef>, the senior though present and partaking took no
                            part in the administration. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s
                            afternoon text was 1. Kings 21.20— [“]And <persRef ref="ahab"
                                >Ahab</persRef> said to <persRef ref="elijah">Elijah</persRef>, hast
                            thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee; because
                            thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord.” This is
                            the terrible story of <persRef ref="naboth">Naboth’s</persRef> vineyard— The most remarkable part of
                            which is to shew the efficacy of repentance, by the postponement of the
                            awful judgment upon the house of Ahab, from him to inflict the
                            punishment upon his son— Yet the personal denunciation that the dogs
                            should lick his blood in the place where they had licked the blood of
                            Naboth was fulfilled—and the total destruction of the house of Ahab was
                            effected some years after his death by <persRef ref="jehu"
                                >Jehu</persRef>— My Lunt gave Notice of the change of the time of
                            meeting to half past ten for the morning and a quarter before 2. for the
                            afternoon service— <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>

                            places to request me to deliver Lectures at each of them— I have not
                            firmness to resist these personal applications, and have some difficulty
                            in suppressing the temptation to answer rudely, which would be
                            inexcusable— One of the applications which I received last Friday was

                            of Marshfield, for the improvement of North River— Their invitation is
                            that I would visit Marshfield, and going with many of their Townsmen to
                            the spot where they wish to operate— And they specially desire this on
                            account of my visit two years ago to Scituate.— They further propose to
                            me to meet their citizens in some house of Public Worship during my
                            visit to Marshfield for the interchangement of friendly feelings, and
                            that their children may have an opportunity to look upon the man whose
                            name is so closely connected with the honour and prosperity of their
                            country— This is a matter of public business, interesting extensively to
                            the inhabitants of several Towns in the 12<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> Congressional District, and which of course forbids my
                            declining the invitation to visit the spot— And being there I cannot
                            decently refuse to go with them to the Meeting house— But there is
                            competition between Marshfield and Scituate for the location of the
                            canal— A Speech, in the Meeting house will be indispensable; and then
                            what town in the District will not be entitled to a visit, a convocation
                            in the Meeting house and a speech? I told the Gentlemen of Milton and
                            Lynn that I could make no positive engagement but if I could make an
                            opportunity to lecture for them would do it and give them seasonable

                                >Durfee</persRef>, and the burning of the Steamboat Caroline in the

                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December 1837.—This trial, which

                            continued through the last week, and is probably not yet concluded— All
                            the Newspapers have been full of reports of the progress of the trial;
                            which involves at once a question of Peace and War with Great-Britain,
                            and of civil War, and the existence of the Union between the General
                            Government, and the Government of the State of New-York— This is one of
                            the consequences naturally flowing from the <persRef
                                ref="jefferson-thomas">Jeffersonian</persRef> doctrine of
                            nullification, and of State rights— And that doctrine had its origin in
                            that root of all evil Slavery— This in the case of M’Leod, and the
                            burning of the Caroline is complicated with the convulsive condition of
                            Canada, the fermenting spirit of insurrection against the British
                            Government in that Country—the sympathies and antipathies, always
                            existing between the bordering population of rival nations, and the
                            reckless spirit of adventure, avarice and ambition burning in the bosoms
                            of multitudes, especially of young men, having little or nothing to
                            lose, and in imagination every thing to gain by war and confusion— M<hi

                            and that of the State of New-York, where by the Government of the United
                            States, though admitting the obligation to release M’Leod, from the time
                            when the British Government avowed the act of burning the Caroline as
                            their own, have yet been disabled from effecting his release by the
                            refusal of the Government of New-York to deliver him up—whence M<hi

                            concludes, that there must be War, whether M’Leod shall be finally
                            released or not— A military conclusion— We all took tea and spent the

                            thing for me to do, was to write to Michael Leary, and authorize him to
                            draw upon me for the amount of the two notes, sending with the Bills an

                            custom house at Boston came, and said he had been informed that I had
                            visited that building last Saturday, and he regretted that he happened
                            not to have been there at the time. He invited me to come again, and I
                            should almost always find him there except between two and three O’Clock
                            afternoon. He said he should be very glad to shew me the interior
                            arrangements of the building.— He added that there would be needed a
                            further appropriation next winter, and they would want the assistance of
                            their friends— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young told me that the
                            contracts for Quincy granite for the Boston Custom-house, amounted to
                            between 80, and 90,000 dollars— He also told me that the expence of
                            building in granite was more than double that of marble—. But he said
                            granite was proportionally more durable— It is scarcely conceivable to
                            me how day after day of my time wastes away, without leaving a trace
                            behind— I had promised to deliver this Evening a Lecture before the
                            Quincy Lyceum— After some propensity to discourse upon a topic,
                            involving controversial politics, I finally determined to repeat the
                            lecture upon Society and civilization— I have had a cold, hoarseness and

                            uneasiness of indecision, disqualified me for labour this afternoon, but
                            I got comfortably through the delivery of the Lecture. The <persRef

                        <p>I went up the hill to see the Sun rise; the sky was clear, except a long
                            thick range of black cloud on the border of the Southeastern horizon
                            from which about 5 minutes after rising, the Sun emerged— A cold
                            Northwest wind, and sharp white frost. <persRef ref="gifford-clother"

                        <p>There was a bright Northern Light last Evening. This morning the Sun rose
                            perfectly clear at 6.32, as I observed from the S.E. corner of <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— Sharp white frost;
                            but the wind got round to S.W. before Noon— Moderate Showers and a
                            milder atmosphere followed.— I have a very severe turn of my catarrhal
                            cough, with hoarseness and sore throat, grievously aggravated by my
                            persisting to Lecture last Wednesday Evening.— I had a restless and
                            almost sleepless night, and rose this morning with a feverish head-ache,
                            and a dejected Spirit— I took a note from <persRef ref="welsh-harriet"
                                >Harriet Welsh</persRef> up to <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, but her cook-maid
                            told me she was gone to Weymouth which was a mistake She and Charles
                            were here this Evening. He had been this morning to Boston, and returned
                            home to dine— My library and house are choked up with pamphlets,
                            newspapers and voucher papers public and private—all in such disorder
                            that a search for any one book, paper or document is almost without
                            exception an irretrievable waste of time— I spend now hour after hour of
                            almost every day in fruitless search for papers none of which I can
                            find. The only alleviation for this is that I sometimes find what I am
                            not looking for, but which I want as much as I do the object of my
                            search. In hunting over this day the pamphlets in one of my closets, I
                            found a number of packages of the Returns of Commerce and Navigation,
                            from 30. September 1838 to 1839. reported to Congress 1. July 1840. but
                            not printed and received here till last May, when in the very few days
                            that I spent here, I had no time to direct them to the proper persons— I
                            left them here therefore, and thought no more about them, till on
                            rummaging over the closet, the last two or three days, I find them
                            encumbering the shelves. I have also multitudes of my own Orations,
                            Addresses, Eulogies and other pamphlets, for want of having distributed,
                            when they were fresh and readable, have now got to be classed with old
                            lumber, and with which I know not what to do— This confusion in my
                            library, leaves me no time for my necessary correspondence, and I
                            receive great numbers of Letters which I never answer. We have this day
                            the account that on the trial of <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander"
                                >Alexander M’Leod</persRef> at Utica, in the State of New-York, for
                            the murder of <persRef ref="durfee-amos">Durfee</persRef>, in December
                            1837. at the destruction of the Steamboat Caroline, the verdict of the
                            jury pronounced him not guilty, and he was immediately discharged— This
                            relieves us from all immediate danger of hostile collision with
                            Great-Britain, but leaves the Negotiations with that Country upon the
                            Maine boundary, the South-Sea boundary; the Slave-trade, and the
                            seizures of our vessels on the coast of Africa, thorns to be extracted
                            by purer and more skiful hands than are to be found in the

                                <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> may not be lost— A large

                            through a chaos, which will never be brought into order— I received this

                                Lothrop</persRef>, minister of the Church in Brattle square, Boston,
                            but who has a Summer residence on Milton-hill preached here at the
                            Temple, this morning from Psalm 4.6. “There be many that say, who will
                            show us any good?” The Discourse was a system of optimism— It began by
                            asserting that the transcendent Wisdom of <persRef ref="solomon"
                                >Solomon</persRef> sometimes deserted him; and this was particularly
                            exemplified in the gloomy pictures and sentiments scattered over the
                            book of Ecclesiastes. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop thinks that
                            all is not vanity, and that the physical and the moral world, are full
                            of good things, which it is the duty of man to enjoy, with gratitude and
                            praise to God who gave them— It is certain that the holy Scriptures
                            declare that the Creator himself saw that his whole creation was <hi
                                rend="italic">good.</hi>— The doctrine of the Jewish Religion in the
                            age of Solomon, and that of the Christian religion now is that all this
                                <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, was forfeited to man by his apostasy,
                            and that from that day the earth was accursed for his sake. The goodness
                            of God is celebrated with transcendent raptures of many of the Psalms of
                                <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, but others are plaintive and
                            indignant against the wicked— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop
                            however enumerated many sources of good, enjoyed by man, and exemplified
                            it by many benevolent and some pathetic illustrations—the beauties of
                            nature, the fulfilment of the duties of life,—the effusions of family
                            affections, the exercise of mutual good offices, works of charity, in
                            addition to all the prosperities which contribute to the comfort and
                            happiness of men, are all good; and all to be acknowledged as good— I
                            have myself often thought that a comparison between the youth and old
                            age of Solomon, and of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14.</persRef>
                            would explain much of the Book of Ecclesiastes— Excessive prosperity and
                            especially great ostentation of magnificence, overstrain the capacities
                            of the human frame for enjoyment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lothrop, and <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, who was
                            his Classmate at Cambridge dined with <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— The afternoon Sermon was
                            from 1. Corinthians 1.24 “Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of
                            God.”— In the text this is applied specially to Christ <hi rend="italic"
                                >crucified</hi>, the stumbling block to the Jews and the foolishness
                            to the Greeks— The reference is to the doctrine of the resurrection—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop however considered the word
                            Christ in this passage as comprehending in its meaning the Christian
                            religion, and embracing the whole power and wisdom of God— The discourse
                            was not so impressive as that of the morning, but M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop has paid great attention to the
                            polish of his style. His composition is elegant.— Returning from Meeting

                            Milton, and resides on the edge of the town next to Quincy— He came this

                            deliver a Lecture before the Milton and Quincy Lyceum. I received and
                            declined the same invitation two years ago, and then made a conditional
                            promise, to Lecture at some future time if I conveniently could— I now
                            declined, from incapacity, under my catarrhal cough, which gives no sign
                            of approaching departure— The morning was fine with promise of a fair
                            day—but clouds gathered all the morning and blew up in the afternoon a
                            long squall of successive hail snow and rain in the midst of which a
                            knock at my eastern door brought me to open it for an elderly man
                            shivering with cold, and drenched with the shower, with a carpet bag in
                            one hand a long staff in the other and a pair of old saddle-bags over
                            the other— I invited him into the parlour where for the space of three
                            quarters of an hour he warmed and dried himself, and then told me that
                            his name was <persRef ref="williams-thomas6">Thomas

                            little encouragement, and multitudes of applications— Upon the change of
                            administration the application was renewed with a recommendation from

                        <p>I had received yesterday an invitation from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
                                >President Quincy</persRef> to attend the exhibition at Cambridge
                            this day; but as it did not appear that as a member of the board of
                            Overseers, I had been chosen upon any Committee this year to visit the
                            University, as I could not go without much inconvenience and loss of at
                            least one day, I concluded not to go. <persRef ref="worthington-denison"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Worthington</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="mcmullen-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                M’Mullen</persRef> came as a deputation from the young men’s
                            association at Albany, to repeat an invitation, more than once
                            heretofore given to me to deliver a Lecture before them. They brought
                            with them commendatory Letters from <persRef ref="seward-william"
                                >Governor Seward</persRef>, from <persRef ref="vanvechten-tunis"
                                >Tunis Van Vechten</persRef>, Mayor of Albany, and from <persRef
                                ref="campbell-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. N.
                                Campbell</persRef>, the Clergyman heretofore Minister of the second
                            presbyterian church at Washington. My catarrhal cough continues without
                            any symptom of abatement, but on the contrary with evident aggravation—
                            I was therefore compelled again to decline this invitation with a
                            promise that if the cough should leave me, and I find it practicable I
                            will yet return to Washington by the way of Albany, and deliver the
                            lecture there. I had much political conversation with these two young
                            men, and spoke my mind with more freedom than prudence— The worst
                            consequence of these importunities, is their effect upon me as flattery.
                            I am so tickled with professions of veneration that I believe them all
                            sincere. It might be wiser to treat them all with contempt. But it would
                            not be so good natured— A man by the name of <persRef
                                ref="parsons-benjamin2">Benjamin Parsons</persRef> came with a
                            subscription paper for a second much enlarged edition of a very shallow
                            unitarion volume or pamphlet of whiche sent me a copy last winter or
                            Spring— He called upon me afterwards to explain his system to me— But I
                            had entirely forgotten him, and I declined subscribing to his second
                            edition— He fancies himself a first rate theologian, and has letters
                            from <persRef ref="eliot-william2">Elliot</persRef> of S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis, and from another yankee divine at
                            Louisville assuring him that his work has been very extensively read and
                            has done an immensity of good, in and about those regions, and urging
                            him fervently to publish his projected new edition— I continue my search
                            for papers without finding any of those that I want. I took up again
                            this day my commentary upon <persRef ref="grace-john">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Grace’s</persRef> heraldry and
                            genealogies, but was so much interrupted that I could make no progress—
                            I finished reading the two volumes of <persRef key="adams-john">my
                                father’s</persRef> Letters published by <persRef

                            me, by the reminiscences that they carry through with them— There are
                            some that I had not read before.</p>

                            prefer that the town, should in no case stand in the relation of a

                            before dinner, that is just before four O’Clock afternoon. While they
                            were gone, about 1. O’Clock came in <persRef ref="hughes-christopher"
                                >Christopher Hughes</persRef> our Chargé d’Affaires at Stockholm,
                            not two hours landed from the royal packet Steamer Columbia, which came
                            in this morning with 109 passengers having left Liverpool on the 5<hi

                            passage against head winds and heavy gales, in 16 days, touching on her
                            way 6 hours at Halifax. Hughes comes home, on a leave of absence for the
                            winter, and he rattled away for two hours without intermission—but could
                            not stay to dine with us, having engaged to return to Boston to dine
                            with <persRef ref="otis-harrison">Harrison Gray Otis</persRef>. He left
                            with me a budget of Notes and Letters of mere civility from the <persRef

                            of time since I last left Europe. I scarcely knew one of them by name.—

                            closely listening to all Hughes’s humours, with which they were much

                        <p>A man by the name of <persRef ref="rogers-john4">John Rogers</persRef>
                            brought me this morning a highway tax-bill at Randolph of 21 cents
                            assessed to the heirs of <persRef key="adams-john">John Adams</persRef>—
                            I enquired what and where this land was upon which this assessment was
                            made, which he could not tell, and as I knew of no such estate, I
                            referred him to the Assessors for an explanation— I despatched sundry
                            public documents and assorted a few papers; in preparation for Letter
                            writing this afternoon— I received by a special messenger a card from
                                <persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrison
                                Gray Otis</persRef>, with a note inviting me to dinner to morrow at
                            5 to meet <persRef ref="howard-george2">Lord Morpeth</persRef>, which I
                            accepted.— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to
                            Boston, and returned home to dine— We at our house had barely risen from
                            table when <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Samuel T. Armstrong</persRef> came in on a visit from
                            Boston— This Gentleman was a bookseller of Bibles and school books, in
                            which business he is said to have made a large fortune— In the year 1833
                            when the Antimasons thought proper to nominate me for the Office of
                            Governor of the State, and the federalists and Masons set up <persRef
                                ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef> against me, they wanted a
                            mechanic a Bostonian and an orthodox calvinist church member for
                            Lieutenant Governor and their convention at Worcester selected
                            Armstrong— About that time I first became acquainted with him, by
                            meeting him at dinner at <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r.</hi> George Parkman’s</persRef>, and from
                            that time there has been a very kind, and friendly intercourse between
                            us.— In 1835 when to keep me out of the U.S. Senate “honest John[”]
                            Davis was chosen, Armstrong became acting Governor for the year, but
                            when the election for the next year came Armstrong no longer suited the
                            party.— They took <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>
                            for Governor; and he being a Bostonian Unitarian, they chose <persRef
                                ref="hull-george">George Hull</persRef> of Sandisfield a western
                            Calvinist for Lieutenant Governor, and eased off M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Armstrong, by making him for one year Mayor of Boston: after
                            which they put him two or three years on the Senatorial ticket for the
                            County of Suffolk in the Legislature of the State and then dropped him
                            altogether.— It was by his agency that in 1836 I was invited by the city
                            Government of Boston to deliver the Eulogy upon <persRef
                                ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>— He is a very religious
                            man, and a good citizen— His visit was followed by that of <persRef

                            me a pressing invitation to stop in the City to-morrow night at their
                            house, which I almost accepted.— There is to be a great whig Caucus, at

                            person, and as the patronymic name of Adams is borne by myriads of
                            persons in this Country—and in England, either a double Christian name,
                            or an unusual one is necessary to indicate the individual—double
                            Christian names are inconvenient by their length, and although now
                            almost universal have given rise to the very awkward practice of using
                            only the initial of the middle name, defeating the very purpose of
                            identification for which the middle name is intended.— A short, single,
                            unusual, not odious or ridiculous Christian name, harmonizing in sound
                            with the surname, is most convenient for the wearer and for all who have
                            intercourse with him—when therefore my son asked my advice, I told him I
                            would name the child Alfred or Arthur—he chose the latter, and may the
                            blessing of God rest upon the infant who now bears the name— Immediately

                            through, he asked for my opinion upon the subjects discussed in it— I
                            told him that the Book of Revelation was to me profoundly mysterious,
                            and I had never seen any explanation of it as prophesy, satisfactory to
                            my mind— That I doubted whether it ever had been correctly explained,
                            and that I was therefore not competent to pronounce upon the soundness
                            of his speculations.— The man has every other appearance of a sober
                            intelligent modest consciencious minister of the gospel— He is one of a
                            class who may pass by the general denomination of apocolyptic
                            monomaniacs.— This morning <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached from John
                            9.25. [“]He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not;
                            one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.” M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt according to his usual manner read
                            the whole chapter whence he took his text, and expounded the narrative
                            of the restoration of sight to the blind man, on the Sabbath day. The
                            questions by the disciples whether the man was born blind, for any sin
                            of his own or of his parents received an answer of universal
                            application, that natural physical infirmities, are not to be considered
                            as inflicted in punishment for sin— A moral principle of great
                            importance— But from the remainder of the answer, Jesus seems to say
                            that the blindness of that particular individual, was preordained to
                            furnish the occasion for the performance of a miracle by him, by giving
                            sight to the blind. There is something remarkable in the manner of
                            performing this miracle, which was noticed by M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lunt, but without much comment— The pharisees took exception
                            to it as a violation of the Sabbath; and the Jews instead of being
                            converted to faith were exasperated against all who were and had
                            proscribed from the Synagogue everyone who confessed Jesus as the
                            Christ— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from
                            Revelation 12.1. “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven: a woman
                            clothed with the Sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
                            crown of twelve stars—” The text was used only as introductory to a
                            discourse upon the character of the Apocalypse, as one of the canonical
                            books of the holy Scriptures. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
                            considers it merely as an allegorical representation of the calamitous
                            and persecuted condition of the Church in the early part of its
                            struggles with the Jewish and heathen world— The woman, the Dragon,
                                <persRef ref="michael">Michael</persRef> and his angels, and the
                            wars in heaven he viewed as the mere personifications of the conflict
                            between the spirit of good and the spirit of evil— M<hi

                            gratitude to God. On rising this morning I was surprized by the

                        <p>The first object that struck my eye on entering my Library this morning
                            was Arcturus, about 10 minutes risen— The Thermometer on the South side
                            of the house was at 20 just before Sunrise, and the same at <persRef

                            rising of the Sun— I never witnessed here the thermometer so low so
                            early in the Season. A man by the name of <persRef ref="simmons-charles"
                                >Charles Simmons</persRef> came, and after accosting me with a
                            nauseous compliment proposed to me to subscribe to a new edition of the

                            partially to overhaul and assort my pamphlets and papers, I am losing
                            all trace of the arrears of my correspondence. I have been nearly six

                            since I began writing in the form of a Letter some remarks upon them— I
                            finished the work this morning, by a sort of convulsive exertion, and
                            after dinner I took it with my Letter-book to Charles’s house to be
                            copied. I had received a Letter from <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            them. Charles brought the packet containing them from Boston; and I read
                            them all this Evening.— They are twenty-four in number, with part of one
                            more. Their dates are from 4. April 1800 to 15. May 1814. and relate
                            chiefly to invitations of mutual visiting, between Scituate and Quincy;
                            obituaries of common friends, and allusions to the most prominent
                            political incidents of the times as they successively occurred. M<hi

                            of my mother’s early life— The first Letter of this collection was

                            Justice of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a
                            place which my father had declined— At the first organization of the
                            Courts of the United States, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing was
                            transferred from the State Bench of Massachusetts and appointed a judge
                            of the Supreme Court of the United States, which station he held until
                            his death, in September 1810. One of these Letters is of condolence upon
                            his decease.</p>

                            gave us a very good restorative breakfast, after which we rode about two
                            miles farther to the house of <persRef ref="rogers-luther2">M<hi

                            the adjoining towns of Pembroke and Hanover— I rode with M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Luther Rogers down to a Bridge, where we
                            embarked in a Gondola or Scow in which we were tow’d by one sail boat
                            and one row boat about a mile down towards the mouth of the North river.
                            We landed on the Situate beach, part of which is a high bluff bearing
                            upland grass and part a ridge of loose stones like those on Cohasset
                            Beach, and over which in every North-eastern storm the surf rushes into
                            the river— It lodges also settlements of sand in the bed of the river,
                            and makes shoals, which stretch downwards (the channel of the river,[)]
                            and carry its mouth more and more Southerly.— We saw two new vessels
                            fast bedded in the sands of shoals made by storms of the last winter,
                            and it is apparent that ship-building must hereafter cease to be an
                            occupation for the People of Marshfield— We returned to a temperance
                            dinner at the house of Luther Rogers— <persRef

                            whom I addressed in a cold speech of an hour, then shook hands with them
                            all—returned to Luther Rogers, and then with his son Clift hastened back
                            and reached home at 7. P.M. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My

                        <p>I return to my habitual occupations, but with the aggravated pressure of
                            two days of life to record, and with proportional inability to
                            accomplish any thing else— I opened my black leather Portmanteau trunk
                            just received from Washington, and found it filled with files of Letters
                            of the last and present years, and a great increase of old pamphlets and
                            newspapers to be assorted, if ever I should have time to undertake it—
                            Now it is utterly impossible— I am endeavouring only to collect the
                            superfluous copies of my own publications, of which I have almost enough
                            to stock a booksellers shop, and to pack them in one or two chests or
                            boxes, for as many of them as I now have, I scarcely know where to look
                            for any particular one, when as not unfrequently happens I receive a
                            Letter from a stranger requesting a copy of any one of them— While I
                            find it impossible to arrange my own papers <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef

                            the papers of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>— I received
                            last Monday a Letter from <persRef ref="bancroft-george">George
                                Bancroft</persRef> mentioning that he had seen a Letter from
                                <persRef ref="warren-james2">James Warren</persRef> of Plymouth in
                            which he says he had written to my father an account of the Battle of
                            Bunker hill—and if such a documents exists, M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Bancroft requests a sight of it— He says he has other
                            curious revolutionary papers, bearing testimony of my father’s merits
                            and services. Bancroft professes too much desire to do honour and
                            justice to my father.— I distrust him— The principles of his history are
                            in direct collision with those to which my father adhered through life,
                            and whatever of approbation he may affect to bestow upon my father, will
                            only be to cover some insidious attack upon his memory.— Charles found
                            the Letter from General Warren which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Bancroft desires to see, and sent it to him— This afternoon <persRef

                            last Spring upon this subject, and I had the young man’s name entered as
                            a Candidate for admission, but I was obliged to tell M<hi

                            afternoon.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday and this delay belong to a different climate from that of the
                            whole preceding part of the month and the change to warm weather brought
                            with it to me an attack of lumbago, from which I have been for several
                            years exempt.— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached this morning from 1 Corinthians
                            13.13. “And now abideth Faith—Hope—Charity, these three; but the
                            greatest of these is charity.—[”] All religion, and all virtue is
                            contained in this verse.— The whole chapter is an amplification of the
                            transcendent virtue of charity— There is something remarkable in the
                            mode of expression—and now abideth—the verb in the singular
                            number—Faith—Hope—Charity—each separately abideth—forever— These
                            three—what? The apostle gives them no qualification— He calls them not
                            virtues, or graces— He says each of them abideth— The word imports
                            eternity. These three—what?—what of them? What figure of speech is this?
                            What volume of declamation could equal in emphasis these few words,
                            which embrace the whole duty of Man upon earth—but the <hi rend="italic"
                                >greatest</hi> of these is charity— The greatest what? the greatest
                            virtue—why the greatest? because it is the only active virtue. It
                            consists in action; in doing good.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
                            observed that these three virtues corresponded with the three elementary
                            qualities of the human character— Faith being an attribute of the
                            Understanding—Hope of the Imagination, and Charity of the Heart; but the
                            language of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
                                Paul</persRef> imports that their union is indispensable to the
                            perfection of the Christian character. The foundation of them all is
                            Faith—active and passive— Hope is the natural result of Faith, as
                            Charity results from the Union of Faith and Hope— For without Faith
                            there can be no hope; and without Faith and hope no Charity— <persRef

                            Corinthians 4.2. [“]Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be
                            found faithful,” and his doctrine was that in the spirit of
                            Christianity, every man is a steward, or trustee, and not the proprietor
                            of life and of every other blessing that he receives from the hand of
                            God— He noticed the propensity of the Corinthians to divide themselves
                            into factions, and also their proneness to vain boasting and
                            self-sufficiency, which the apostle rebukes very severely.— This
                            principle, that life and all its powers, blessings and enjoyments are
                            trusts of which a strict account is to be given hereafter is one of the
                            foundations of the Christian system of morals.— I made some enquiries of
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand respecting the number and the
                            cost of the Railroads which within the last fifteen years have been
                            constructed in this State— They are fourteen in number, and have cost at
                            a rough estimate 22 millions of Dollars.— I would pursue these
                            researches, upon a far more extensive scale, but that my remnant of life
                            is too short— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> here after
