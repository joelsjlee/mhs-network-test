						<p><persRef ref="leary-john">John Leary</persRef> was to have gone with the
							morning Cars to Baltimore; but was by a few minutes belated, and went in
							the afternoon— He left in deposit with me 160 dollars 80 cents in gold
							for which I gave him a receipt and a promise to pay that sum to his
							order on demanded— I went and delivered at the orphans Court the
							inventory and appraisement made by <persRef ref="pendergast-jeremiah"
								>Jeremiah Pendergast</persRef> and <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas"
								>Thomas Dumphy</persRef> of the goods and effects of <persRef
								ref="leary-jeremy">Jeremy Leary</persRef> on Saturday Evening—
							Thence I went to the Supreme Court and concluded my argument in the case
							of the Amistad captives— I spoke about four hours, and then closed
							somewhat abruptly; leaving almost entirely untouched the review of the
							case of the Antelope, which I had intended and for which I was prepared—
							It would have required at least an hour, and I had barely reached it
							when the usual time of the Court’s adjournment came— I was unwilling to
							encroach upon the time of the Court for half of a third day, so that I
							cramped into a very brief summary, what I had to say upon that case, and
							finished with a very short personal address to the Court. They
							immediately adjourned, and went into the hall of the house of
							Representatives— They had not yet re-assembled after the recess— But
								<persRef ref="stone-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								L. Stone</persRef>, Editor of the Commercial advertiser of New-York
							came to the apologize to me, for two heavy Letters addressed to him from
							New-Orleans, under cover to me at this place, for my frank— I put them
							into the Post-Office without franking them, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Stone had to pay the postage for them— He came to me to say
							that he had spoken to me of certain manuscript public documents for
							which he had desired the privilege of my frank—instead of which his
							correspondent had written him Letters. <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Blunt</persRef> came very abruptly to

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles King</persRef>, who was
							anxiously desirous of obtaining the Office of Postmaster at New-York,
							and wished me to use my influence in his favour— I told him I had no
							influence to use in favour of any one; and that I had no right to
							recommend any one. But consider said he, that he threw himself into the
							breach for you— Not at all I replied, and you may tell M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles King that I consider myself under
							any thing but obligation to him— Oh! I only meant to say— I stop’d him
							short, and said I would hold no further conversation with him on the
							subject—left my seat and came home to dinner— Returned after dinner, and

							delivered<space/>planting the standard against that of <persRef

							this morning to revise it, and only finished hastily the revisal this
							morning.— It needs a more thorough revisal— <persRef
								ref="freeman-russell">Russel Freeman</persRef> here. Shewed me copy
							of his application for restoration to the Collectorship of New-Bedford.
							His anxiety intense—piteous. Visit from <persRef ref="jackson-william2"
								>William Jackson</persRef> of Newtown with <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							at the Office of the National Intelligencer and left with <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>
							the Report of my Speech—but it will not be published within a week.
							H.R.U.S. The house yesterday resolved to meet the two remaining days of
							the Session at 10. of the morning; and to devote 2 hours each day, from
							10 to 12 to private business. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost
								Johnson</persRef> renewed his attempt to call up the District Banks
							bill from the Senate and failed again— Committee of the whole on private
							Bills, <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the chair— At
							11. I went into the Supreme Court. The judges <persRef ref="catron-john"
								>Catron</persRef> and <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef>,
							delivered each one decision of the Court, and <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef>, two— That of Wayne, was in

							delivered by judge Story reversed the decision of the U.S. Circuit Court
							in Missouri in the case of U.S. vs <persRef ref="gratiot-charles"

							was stop’d by <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief-Justice
								Taney</persRef>, who said the Court would hear no argument upon that
							claim until after their decision upon the motion to dismiss the appeal
							of the U.S.— The <persRef ref="gilpin-henry">Attorney General
								Gilpin</persRef> then closed the argument on the part of U.S. in
							about 3 hours—reviewing with great moderation of manner, chiefly
								<persRef ref="baldwin-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin’s</persRef> argument, and very slightly noticing mine— When
							he finished, the Court adjourned— The judges present were Taney, Story,

								>Baldwin</persRef>, Wayne and Catron— <persRef ref="barbour-philip"

						<p>These Gentlemen detained me so that I was belated at the House— All was
							confusion as usual at the expiration of a Congress.— Private Bills under

							told me that he had been invited to come here, upon a very numerous, and
							respectable recommendation of young men, altogether unexpected and
							unsolicited by him—but that when he arrived here he found that <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Levi Lincoln</persRef> had step’d
							forward and ranged himself among the candidates— That there was some
							objection to him as a member actual elect of Congress; but that from his

							appointed— I know not why, but it seemed to me as if Levi Lincoln,
							shrunk in all his proportions into the dimensions of a pigmy, from a
							nine years Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to a Collector
							of the Customs at Boston— Solomon Lincoln said he should not stay to see

							mentioned to me also <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef>

						<p>Inauguration <lb/>William Henry Harrison P.U.S.</p>
						<p>The inauguration of <persRef ref="harrison-william">William Henry
								Harrison</persRef> as President of the United States was celebrated
							with demonstrations of popular feeling, unexampled since that of
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> in 1789. and
							at the same time with so much order and tranquility, that not the
							slightest symptom of conflicting passions occurred to disturb the
							enjoyments of the day. Many thousands of the people from the adjoining
							and considerable numbers from distant States had come to witness the
							ceremony: the procession consisting of a mixed military and civil
							cavalcade and platoons of volunteer Militia companies—tippecanoe clubs,
							students of colleges and school boys, with about half a dozen veterans
							who had fought under the hero in the war of 1800, with sundry aukward
							and ungainly painted banners and log cabins, without any carriages or
							showy dresses was characteristic of the democracy of our institutions,
							while the perfect order with which the whole scene was performed and the
							absence of all pageantry was highly creditable to them— The numbers were
							not comparable to those of the military assemblage at Baltimore upon the
							reception of <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef> in 1824. nor
							was there any thing now of the pride pomp and circumstance of that day.
							The coup d’oeil of this day was showy-shabby— The procession passed
							before the windows of my house— General Harrison was on a mean looking
							white horse in the centre of seven others, in a plain frock coat or
							surtout, undistinguishable from any of those before, behind, or around
							him. He proceeded thus to the Capitol; where from the top of the flight
							of steps at the Eastern front, he read his inaugural address, occupying
							about an hour in the delivery; and before pronouncing the last paragraph
							of which the Oath of Office was administered to him by <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief Justice Taney</persRef>— The
							procession then returned to the Presidents house, and he retired to his
							chamber, while an immense crowd of people filled for an hour or more all
							the lower rooms of the house. I saw the procession pass from my chamber
							windows— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leavitt</persRef> was with me, and we were reading the opinions of
							the judges <persRef ref="davies-william">Davies</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="johnson-william">William Johnson</persRef>, in the case of the
							Antelope.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt departed by the Cars

								rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="duralde-martin">Duralde</persRef>, <persRef ref="nye-seth"

								<persRef ref="ogle-charles">Charles Ogle</persRef>, who since

								>General Harrison</persRef> himself of which Lay doubted whether he

								ref="whipple-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

							against Massachusetts for sundry towns on her borders— He was harping
							upon an alledged <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi> by Commissioners who
							settled the question 122 years ago— The pleader is worthy of the cause—
							I went into the Office of the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk of the
								House of Representatives</persRef>, and looked over the documents
							transmitted with the Message communicating the Slave trade
							correspondence; and particularly that of <persRef ref="trist-nicholas"
								>Trist</persRef>, which is enormous— I read rapidly through <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett’s</persRef> report upon
							Trist’s official conduct at the Havanna— It is perfectly conclusive of
							the guilt of Trist, in conniving at, aiding and abetting by all means in
							his power the African Slave trade by Americans, Portuguese and
							Spaniards— I came home at 3. P.M— <persRef ref="pendleton-nathanael">E.

								<persRef ref="pendleton-edmund2">his brother</persRef> from the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coxe</persRef>, and between

								Crittenden</persRef> the new Attorney General, and <persRef
								ref="key-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Key</persRef>,
							upon certain pending cases, but of little interest— The <persRef
								ref="gilpin-henry">ex-Attorney General Gilpin</persRef> was there,
							shorn of his beams, and having apparently nothing to do— Walker of
							Mississippi came to me and said he wondered how any one could ever have
							thought that the case of the Amistad had any thing to do with
							abolition.— <persRef ref="peters-richard2">Peters</persRef> is too
							confident of a decision of the Court in our favour— My anxiety for it is
							intense, and deeply distrustful— I went into the Office of the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk of the house</persRef> and spent two hours
							in reading over <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">Trist’s</persRef>
							correspondence which is indescribable, and inconceivable.— There is
							great disorder both in his head and heart; each of which panders to the
							other— He complains of an affection of the head.— When I came home I
							found at my house a black man, named <persRef ref="cook-john6">John
								Francis Cook</persRef>, who left a Letter handsomely written by
							himself, with an engraved Portrait of <persRef ref="cinque"
								>Cinque</persRef>, sent me as a present by <persRef

							utterly disappoint the public expectation.</p>

						<p>I attended divine service this morning at the second Presbyterian Church,
							where <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef> preached from Genesis 49.10—[“]and unto him shall the
							gathering of the people be”—one of the most remarkable passages, of that
							most mysterious and incomprehensible chapter— This passage is generally
							understood as referring to the Messiah— But why he is called by the name
							of Shiloh; why it is said that the Sceptre shall not depart from Judah
							when it was held by <persRef ref="benjamin">Benjamin</persRef> in the
							person of <persRef ref="kingsaul">Saul</persRef>, before it came to Judah in
							the person of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>—when ten tribes
							passed from <persRef ref="judah">Judah</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="ephraim">Ephraim</persRef> in the persons of <persRef
								ref="rehoboam">Rehoboam</persRef>, and <persRef ref="jeroboam"
								>Jeroboam</persRef>, and when both the Sceptres departed in the
							Assyrian and Babylonian captivities from four to five hundred years
							before Shiloh came; who, if the Messiah, paid, himself tribute to
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, as Jesus Christ in
							his human character was a lineal descendant from David, his kingdom
							might be truly called in a spiritual sense the restitution of the
							Sceptre of Judah, but how it could be said not to have departed till he
							came, implying that it <unclear>did</unclear> depart when he came, I cannot readily
							discern— I heard on Christmas day, I think 1788. a Sermon from <persRef
								ref="bass-edward">Bishop Bass</persRef> at Newburyport, about this
							Sceptre of Judah, and Shiloh, of which I have longed for a clear
							exposition ever since—for it excited without satisfying curiosity. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood now of course understands Shiloh, to
							mean the Messiah, and his discourse presented a parallel and a contrast
							between the gathering of the People to the Messiah and that to <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> at his
							inauguration during the past week as President of the United States—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood has an idea quite sufficiently
							exalted and not a little exaggerated of the magnitude and importance of
							the induction of a President of the United States into office, and he
							dwelt faithfully upon the infinite superior importance of the gathering
							of the people to the Sceptre of the Messiah— He called upon his people,
							pathetically, affectionately fervently to join this gathering upon which
							he said their eternall salvation depended— The house of worship was very
							thinly attended; as it was after dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s church.— There the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morgan</persRef>, read the Evening service for the second Sunday in
							Lent, and preached from 1 Corinthians 3.11. [“]For other foundation can
							no man, lay, than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ”— This gentleman
							is not very eloquent, nor very logical—but there is an air of deep
							sincerity in every thing that he says, which is better than eloquence—
							We had evening visits from my neighbour <persRef ref="parris-albion"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="willis-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Willis</persRef> of Portland Maine— Letter to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> from <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>—part of whose report, as
							chairman of a joint Committee of the Legislature of Massachusetts on the
							Northeastern boundary question, I read. It was unanimously adopted by
							the Committee and adopted by the two houses—and it is very creditable to
							him.</p>

								<persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary Thomas Ewing</persRef> of
							Ohio— I spoke for and was promised a Register for the Schooner Amistad,
							for which an Act of Congress passed at the late Session. I left <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker Hunter’s</persRef> due bill for the
							balance of my pay 573:60. at the Department, and the money was sent to
							my house in the course of the morning. I spoke of the application of
								<persRef ref="sampson-schuyler">Schuyler Sampson</persRef> for
							renomination as collector at Plymouth, but found that the complaints
							against him for interference in the late election’s had blasted his
							expectations. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ewing did not directly say
							so; but I saw it in his manner— I said I had heard there were complaints
							against some of his inspectors in other towns, but not against himself;
							and I remarked that a considerable majority of the people of the town of
							Plymouth were friends of the late Administration— I spoke also of the
							Smithsonian fund and of its mismanagement, but said I would see him
							again on that subject when he should be more at leisure— <persRef

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster to say that I wanted copies of
							those papers, and should be glad if he would furnish me with them— If he
							thought they could not be furnished without a call from Congress, I
							should be under a necessity of moving a call at the next Session— While
							I was at the Office, <persRef ref="garland-rice">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rice Garland</persRef>, and <persRef ref="chinn-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chinn</persRef> of Louisiana

								Nourse’s</persRef> Office and exchanged 40 half-eagles for Virginia
							Bills at 3 1/4 per cent discount. Met in the Capitol a second time a

							of an old coat, as a reward, for having as he alledged caught and
							secured my horses at that dreadful disaster of the 18<hi

						<p><date>12. V:30. </date>Friday—</p>
						<p>Snow— Sleet— Rain— the whole day.</p>
						<p>Yet I could not confine myself entirely to the house— I called at
								<persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> to have some
							conversation with <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef>, who is in the confidence of
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and is in frequent consultation with <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">President Harrison’s</persRef> cabinet.— I
							asked him if their system of administration was settled, and
							organized—not yet— Was the revenue to be bared on the compromise of
							1833—between <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, the South and the West, to the
							total exclusion of the North, and especially of New-England? He thought
							not. Certainly not with his consent— I said <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef> was supposed
							to be more in the confidence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster
							than any other member of the Massachusetts delegation in the house; and
							Cushing had offered in the house to take the basis of the compromise,
							which had instantly been seized upon by the whigs of the South, who were
							for nailing us down to it; till <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> was forced to declare his dissent to it— I had
							said nothing but had not felt the less— As M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster was now at the head of the Cabinet, I was assured
							that the interests of New-England would have their due weight in it, and
							to such a compromise would give my hearty assent and support—but to
							nothing based on the compromise of 1833. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lawrence said that Cushing’s declaration was unauthorised and
							injudicious— That there was a Letter written on the same occasion,
							published in the Boston Atlas, and an editorial Article countenancing
							that same statement of Cushing’s— That <persRef ref="haughton-richard"
								>Haughton</persRef> the Editor of the Atlas afterwards came here,
							and was taken sick. That he M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence,
							asked him what he meant by publishing those Articles, and Haughton had
							told him it was all a mistake done in his absence, without his knowledge
							or consent. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence said that he and
								<persRef ref="appleton-nathan">Nathan Appleton</persRef> had both
							corresponded with <persRef ref="rhett-robert">R. B. Rett</persRef> of
							S.C. concerning the Tariff—and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhett had
							written to him that he should consider any departure from the compromise
							as a breach of faith— He looked for the copy of his Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhett to shew me, but could not find it—
							He said he would converse with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster
							and see me again— At <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton’s</persRef> office I found they
							had not received from <persRef ref="carroll-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll</persRef> the copy of the
							opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of the Amistad. I went to the
							Capitol, and with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll collated the
							copy with the original draught by <persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge
								Story</persRef>.— We noted two or three mistakes to be minuted— A
							copy of the decree was added and I took it to the Office of the National
							Intelligencer and delivered it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales.—
							He informed me that the Senate had adjourned over to next Monday, after

						<p>Fair and mild morning—rain afternoon North west Sky-scraper at the going
							down of the Sun for a hard frosty night— Morning worship at the
							Presbyterian church— Heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> from Isaiah 55.6 “Seek
							ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near”—
							The composition<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> of the old and new
							Testament must not be examined by the Grecian Schools of Rhetoric or of
							Logic— The unities of <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef> have
							no more application to Hebrew Literature than his syllogisms have to
							their reasoning— The Old Covenant from the narrative of the creation in
							the book of Genesis to the prophet <persRef ref="malachi"
								>Malachi</persRef>, has constant reference to the advent of the
							Messiah, and the whole new Covenant is an exposition of his life and
							doctrines, and of the first sixty years of their history— Every part of
							these books should be read with an historical and chronological <unclear>. .
							.</unclear>.— The books properly historical are from Genesis to <persRef
								ref="nehemiah">Nehemiah</persRef>, and bring the history down to the
							rebuilding of the temple about 450 years before Christ— The prophets
							come down about 50 years later— There is an interval of 400 years
							partially supplied by the Wars of the Maccabees— At the birth of Christ
							Judea is a Roman Province, governed by a tributary dependent Prince and
							by Roman Proconsuls— The Books of the sixteen prophets were all written
							immediately preceding or during the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities—
							The greatest of them all is <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>,
							which is at once history, prophecy, and Poetry— There is in it no unity
							of composition, and it might as well be divided into 20 books as
							compiled in one— It comprizes a period of nearly 60 years, and between
							the different parts of the book there is no apparent connection— The
								54<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 55<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> chapters are written in a tone of cheering and rapturous
							enthusiasm— Its power in the original hebrew can be conceived only by
							reflecting how immeasurably all poetical beauty withers in any
							translation. Yet the verse selected by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wood for his text seems to have no peculiar connection with the rest of
							the chapter in which it is found. His application of it was to the all
							absorbing doctrine of the atonement; and he waged it in the solemn and
							gloomy tone which is perhaps is the temper of a mind brooding over
							disappointment— After the morning service I walked to the Office of the
							National Intelligencer, and desired <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> to discard from the
							publication in to-morrows paper of the opinion and decree of the U.S.
							Supreme Court in the case of the Amistad, a note which I had left with
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef>, to rectify what I supposed to be a mistake in the
							date of the decree of the District judge—stated to be the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of January 1830. and which I thought was
							on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— The opinion of the judge was
							delivered on that day—but the decree was issued on the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi>— Evening service at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s—<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the prayers for
							the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday in Lent and preached from
							Acts 8.21. [“]Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy
							heart is not right, in the sight of God.”— Evening not sufficiently
							cheerful.</p>

						<p>The Missionary to China <persRef ref="parker-peter">D<hi

							morning, and told me he was to leave the City to-morrow morning, for
							New-York, and thence to China, by the way of England. He read to me a
							Letter which he has written to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, urging what he had
							recommended before the appointment of a Minister from the U.S. to China;
							and without naming, yet designating me as peculiarly suited for such a
							mission.— He enquired if the <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>President</persRef> could not institute the mission without an act
							of Congress— I said not without an Appropriation— He said that the time
							of the year was essential to depart not later than the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of June, to accommodate the voyage to
							the Monsoon.— I said it would at all events be impossible this year,
							even if there should be a special Session of Congress this summer— I
							observed that <persRef ref="hawes-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawes</persRef> and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>, members of the
							Committee of foreign Affairs had asked me if I would go on such a
							mission if tendered to me, and whether I would support in the House a
							motion for such a mission— I had said that I could not answer the
							question whether I would go, before it was asked—neither could I support
							a motion for the mission, knowing that it might be offered to me— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker supposes that the offer of our
							mediation between Great-Britain and China, might be useful and highly
							politic—but the time has not yet come either in our own history or in
							that of China, for a diplomatic mission, from the United States to the
							celestial empire, nor are our own relations with Great-Britain on a
							footing to make an offer of mediation from us, between her and another
							power acceptable.— Morning visits from <persRef ref="weaver-casper">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Weaver</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burch</persRef>
							both of whom are candidates for office to whom I wish well— I called at
							the Treasury, where <persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M<hi

							acting as Chief Clerk informed me that instructions had been given to
							the <persRef ref="crawford-igoldsby">Collector at New-London</persRef>,
							to issue a Register or enrollment for the Schooner Amistad— At the

						<p>I am wasting time and doing nothing. After near a fortnight since the
							expiration of the Session of Congress I have not yet been able to assort
							and file one half the Letters and papers which have accumulated on my
							table— This morning a young man named <persRef ref="u">Taylor</persRef>
							came to ask for an answer to repeated Letters of invitation from a
							temperance Society at Baltimore to deliver a Lecture before them. I had
							just answered a Letter from <persRef ref="lee-charles4">Doctor Charles
								A. Lee</persRef>, in behalf of a Temperance Society at New-York of
							the same purport. I declined in both cases— <persRef
								ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kavassales</persRef> came to renew his solicitation to obtain an
							appointment of chaplain in the Navy to be stationed in the
							Mediterranean— I called at the Office of the <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Postmaster Granger</persRef>, and left with
							him, Letters, from <persRef ref="hobart-elihu">Elihu Hobart</persRef>
							claiming restitution as Postmaster at Abington, from <persRef
								ref="shattuck-isaac">Isaac Shattuck jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> same at West-Cambridge, and a Petition from
							Wareham for the removal of <persRef ref="nye-david">David Nye</persRef>
							as Postmaster and the appointment of <persRef ref="murdock-bartlett"
								>Bartlett Murdock</persRef> in his place— This I received in a
							Letter from <persRef ref="murdock-jesse">Jesse Murdock</persRef> at
							Carver which I retain. I had also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="moorhead-james2">James Moorhead</persRef> of Indiana
							Pennsylvania, expressing a wish for the appointment of Postmaster there.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger read this and said it would
							be necessary that it should be backed by recommendations— The Office was
							crowded expectants while I was there, and I made my way out as soon as I
							could. Among the other visitors, were <persRef ref="monroe-james2">James
								Monroe</persRef> and <persRef ref="curtis-edward">Edward
								Curtis</persRef>; both members of the late House of Representatives
							from the city of New-York— <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Ogden
								Hoffman</persRef> has received the appointment of District Attorney
							for the Southern District of New-York— I went next to the Navy
							Department, meeting on my way thither <persRef ref="macomb-alexander"
								>General Macomb</persRef> who said he was perfectly well, but who is
							generally supposed to be apoplectic, and <persRef ref="hodgson-william"
								>Alexander Hodgson</persRef> who is a candidate to go again to
							Constantinople, as dragoman to the Legation of the United States— I
							submitted to <persRef ref="badger-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Badger</persRef> the desire of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Kavassales to receive an appointment as chaplain in the Navy and
							suggested his peculiar qualifications as a native of Greece, and as
							conversant with the Arabick and other oriental languages of that region—

							of Navy Agent at Norfolk or at Washington—a Letter from <persRef

							Portsmouth New Hampshire, and one from <persRef ref="burch-samuel"

							disburthened myself. <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnes who is a Quaker told me sundry

						<p><persRef ref="adams-leonard">Leonard Adams</persRef> is an inhabitant of
							this City about 65 years of age, originally from Massachusetts, but who
							has resided many years, here and raised by laborious industry a family
							of ten children, five of whom are yet living. He has been these two
							years working as a labourer at the Patent Office, and came now to ask my
							influence to obtain for him some place in one of the Departments as a
							watchman or Messenger— I might as well undertake by my influence to
							obtain for him the Office of Porter at the gate of Heaven— I looked into
							the massive Volumes of Correspondence, communicated to the British
							Parliament, and found several documents relating to the case of the
							Amistad, and large portions of the correspondence of <persRef
								ref="trist-nicholas">Nicholas P. Trist</persRef>— Much of the day
							wasted in this reading, with very little progress made. I went to the

								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">late Secretary of State</persRef>, and
							the <persRef ref="holabird-william">U.S. District Attorney in

							to the draught of a Letter from the Secretary of State to the <persRef

								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1840. is also erased—but no record of the

							Letters from Holabird to Forsyth of 5, 9. and 21. Sept<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1839 are all garbled in Document 185— I
							asked <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>President</persRef> could not authorize a public vessel going to be

							Pirates, not Robbers, yet having taken from them the vessel found in
							their possession, indispensable to them for the accomplishment of their
							voyage home, and her cargo, their lawful prize of War, and which
							furnished them with ample means for their return to Africa— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster appeared at first startled at the
							idea, that the Amistad and her Cargo were the property of the Africans,
							but afterwards upon my urging the equity of sending them home, and its
							conformity to the policy of the Slave trade acts of Congress, he said he
							saw no objection to furnish them with a passage in a public ship, and
							would speak of it to morrow to the <persRef ref="badger-george"

							Letters of invitation to deliver Addresses, Discourses and Lectures.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="swift-joseph">General Joseph G. Swift</persRef> is one of
							the numberless Office hunters, blockading the President’s house and all

							the first of the Cadets educated at the public expence— Then an Officer
							of the Engineer Corps— Then, disturbed in his prospects of promotion by
							the admission of <persRef ref="bernard-simon">General Bernard</persRef>
							into the Corps, and petted by <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef> when Secretary of War, for his sycophancy, he

								>President Monroe</persRef>; and superseded by me in Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1827. when <persRef ref="stagg-peter"
								>Peter Stagg</persRef>, two months after Swift’s Commission had
							expired. Swift’s conduct had been in many respects questionable and he
							was involved in dark and suspicious money jobbing.— On the 15<hi

							this person requesting me to inform <persRef ref="harrison-william"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Harrison</persRef> that he

							took no notice of this—about a fortnight after this some friend of his

							alledging that <persRef ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef>

							told him that I had said that if Swift could clear himself of the

							right to expect a certificate from me, that the motive for omitting to
							renominate him was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in consequence of any
							participation by him in those transactions— The impudence of this thrice
							repeated call on me, to help him in this Office-beggary, almost ruffled
							my temper. My recollection of the reasons for not renominating him is
							quite indistinct; but my impression is that the principal reason was
							that which he wants me now to certify that it was not— I called at the
							Treasury Department and enquired for the correspondents relating to
							appointments in 1826. and 27. but was informed by the <persRef
								ref="young-mcclintock">Chief Clerk M’Clintock Young</persRef> that
							all those papers were destroyed in the fire of 1833.— I called on M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye at his office and explained to him my
							inability to give the certificate desired, and my denial of his right to
							expect it— At the Navy Department The <persRef ref="badger-george"

							outfit to be removed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster is not
							altogether reconciled to this bestowal of honour and profit upon Duff
							Green, but there is a pressure upon the gratitude, and perhaps upon the

							preference and that with the exception of the climate, either of them
							would be preferable to the bottom of the boot at Naples— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lay delicately intimated to me again his
							wish that I would recommend him for the place at Naples, to President
							Harrison— I have a hard struggle to resist these applications from
							worthy and kind friends, for my influence to befriend them— But
							independent of the humiliation of asking favours, where I have no
							service to alledge, I have the intimate conviction that <hi

							exclude the individual recommended from <hi rend="italic">any</hi>

						<p>Fire in my chamber first intermitted this Season—</p>
						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church, heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> from Exodus 14.15. “And
							the Lord said unto <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, wherefore
							criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go
							forward.” This was a very rational, though not what I should call a very
							orthodox calvinistic discourse— It inculcated with energy the doctrine
							of efficacious works— It laid down in explicit terms, the absolute
							impotence of faith without corresponding action. It assumed
							unequivocally the position that faith does not consist in praying to
							God, for that which it is our duty to do ourselves— This Church has
							become heretical to the Presbyterian Creed; but it is dragging out a
							lingering and helpless existence. On this beautiful day, the very
							personification of Spring there were not 60 persons present— In the
							afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, I heard
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the service for the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday in Lent, and preach from Revelation 22.12. [“]And
							behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man
							according as his work shall be.” The preacher remarked how universally
							all men worked for reward which he illustrated by sundry specifications,
							but never bethought himself of the Slave— If he had thought of it, he
							would not have ventured to take the verse for a text— The courtly
							preacher never mentions hell to ears polite— <persRef
								ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef> sometimes preached to the
							conscience of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14.</persRef> but no
							minister of the word of God South of Mason and Dixon’s line, ventures to
							preach one word against Slavery— Not a few preach Slavery itself— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley gave notice that from this time
							forth the afternoon service would commence at 4. O’Clock P.M— <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here in the evening— I am
							yet, and shall be I scarcely know how long absorbed in the drudgery of
							assorting filing and endorsing Letters which I have been receiving
							during the whole Session of Congress, and two thirds of which when
							received I had not even time to read— I am compelled to read them now
							and groan under the waste of time consumed upon such trash. There is not
							one in fifty of them worth the paper upon which it is written; and if I
							begin to read any thing else, daylight fades into twilight and twilight
							into darkness before I am aware that the day is gone and I have done
							nothing— I this day took up and made a minute of 8. folio pamphlet
							documents containing about 1300 pages of papers communicated to the
							British Parliament in 1839 and 40. relating to the Slave trade divided
							into Classes A. B. C. D. two sets of each. What can I do with them?— It
							is impossible to separate the discussion upon the African slave-trade,
							from the moral and political aspects of Slavery; and that is with us a
							forbidden topic— I apprehend this is the rock upon which the <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> administration will drift
							and go to pieces; as it is the Quicksand upon which that of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> was stranded— The tariff
							and the bank are but suckers from the root.</p>

						<p>Chilly rain all the morning— I had a very bad night and feel as if my
							Constitution was breaking up. I received two days since a Letter from a
							Stranger advising me now to retire from the world, the only reason for
							my postponing which is that I cannot afford it. There is another which I
							should have much trouble to overcome, but which I would encounter— That
							is the vacuity of occupation, in which I could take an interest— More
							than 60 years of incessant active intercourse with the world has made
							political movement to me as much a necessary of life as atmospheric air—
							This is the weakness of my nature, which I have intellect enough left to
							perceive, but not energy to controul— And thus while a remnant of
							physical power is left me to write and speak, the world will retire from
							me before I shall retire from the world— <persRef ref="bogan-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bogan</persRef> was here again this
							Morning to ask for his petition, which I had looked up, and had ready to
							give him. He asked if it could be presented at the extra Session of
							Congress— I said I could offer to present it; though I could not promise
							that the house would receive it. He desired me then to keep it, and I
							concluded to speak to the <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> upon the whole subject of the employment of work
							men on the public buildings— But I was compelled to postpone my visits
							to the Departments of State and of the Treasury— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott</persRef> was here and I agreed
							with him to deliver a Lecture to-morrow evening, at <persRef
								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie’s</persRef>
							Church at 1/2 past 7—a tax that has become perfectly odious to me. He
							asked me if I should have any objection to their taking up a collection
							after the Lecture— I said no, provided it was understood that no part of
							it was to come to me— They want the money for contributions to their
							library— I went to the City Hall to enquire at the Registrar’s Office,
							for the registry of <persRef ref="whitlow-drady">Drady Ann
								Whitlow</persRef> a free mulatto woman who is living with us as
							Cook; but her name could not be found on the register— She has a
							mutilated certificate from Charles County Maryland, from which the name
							of the certifying clerk is torn off; and she is now liable to be taken
							up and sold every day of the year for want of papers. I went next to the
							Capitol, and enquired at the Office of the <persRef ref="dickins-asbury"
								>Secretary of the Senate</persRef> for a Document written by
								<persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leavitt</persRef> and ordered by the Senate to be printed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt had written to me requesting me to
							procure a copy, or copies of it for him— But it is not yet printed— At
							the Office of the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk of the
								House</persRef>, I received two sheets of the journal drawing to the
							close of the Session— The sky cleared up towards evening and I walked
							round the President’s Square— The filing, assorting and answering my
							budget of Letters in arrear proceeds sluggishly absorbing precious time,
							and heaping Pelion upon Ossa for future struggles never to be
							successful— I received this Evening a long Letter from <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, with much heraldry from a man
							named <persRef ref="grace-john">Grace</persRef>, at the Havana—</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martindale</persRef> heretofore,
							several years a member of Congress from the State of New-York. It was
							sometime before I recollected his name, and had forgotten, that as late
							as the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress he was with me a member
							of the Committee of manufactures. <persRef ref="u">M<hi

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayer</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="proud-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Proud</persRef> of Baltimore followed with an invitation from the
							Mechanical Library Association at that place to deliver a Lecture there
							which I was obliged to decline— <persRef ref="benedict-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Benedick</persRef> came next.
							Heretofore 25 years a Baptist Minister at Pawtucket Rhode Island, now,
							and for the last<space/>years Postmaster at that place he is uncertain
							whether he will be retained or removed— A year ago he says there were
							petitions for his removal because he was thought too much of a whig— Now
							there are others because he is thought too much of a democrat— He has
							been with <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">Heman Lincoln </persRef>as a
							Baptist delegate to Virginia— They are to have a triennial general
							convocation; and are apprehensive of abolition dissensions: but he
							thinks they will compromise and say nothing about it. He gives a very
							unpromising account of the Columbian College debt, and little prospect
							of its speedy payment. I visited the Department of State and left with
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> a Letter from <persRef ref="jones-r">Richard B.
								Jones</persRef>, soliciting the appointment of Consul at Havana. I
							said I hoped it would be seriously considered of very great importance
							to the honour and reputation of this Country that the Consul to be
							appointed there should be proof against the temptations of connivance at
							the African Slave-trade— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster said he
							would speak to the <persRef ref="harrison-william">President</persRef>
							on the subject to-morrow— He directed <persRef ref="webster-fletcher"
								>his Son</persRef> also to send an Instruction to the <persRef
								ref="wilcox-luis">Marshal of the District of Connecticut</persRef>
							to amend his return of the Amistad Africans, on the census as Slaves— I
							searched with <persRef ref="derrick-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Derrick</persRef> for the correspondence relating to the
							Acts of the Legislature of South-Carolina of 21. December 1822. against
							the admission of free coloured men into the State found only part of it—
							Postpone further search till to-morrow.— I found also the Letter from
							the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of State Forsyth</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist</persRef>, then Consul at
							Havana of 6. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1840. which was not sent—
							At half past 7. O’Clock this Evening I delivered at <persRef
								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrie’s</persRef>
							church my Lecture upon Faith— The house was crowded, but so dark that I
							could see not more than five or six persons in the front pews— On no
							previous occasion of discoursing have I ever witnessed so little
							interest taken in it by the auditory— <persRef ref="cutts-richard2"
								>Richard Cutts jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> and
								<persRef ref="cutts-mary">his Sister</persRef> came home and spent

								Blunt</persRef> is a native of Newburyport, and a practising lawyer
							and active politician in New-York, whose position in Society it is
							difficult to define. He has fine talents as a political writer, and has
							for twenty years been a political drudge— His pretensions always very
							high are never gratified— Perfectly good natured, and always satisfied
							with himself he has an obtrusiveness of manners which it is almost
							impossible to tolerate, and not less so to resist.— He wrote to me very
							earnestly to urge his claim to the appointment of U.S. district Attorney
							at New-York— Came here himself to obtain it—but finding it pledged to
								<persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Ogden Hoffman</persRef>, told me he
							would not accept it with the compensation reduced not to exceed 6000
							dollars a year. I asked him if he came for something now. He said no but
							he would take if offered to him the appointment of Charge d’Affaires at
							Berlin or at Naples—though he might expect something better—he was
							surely not below <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef>. I called at the Treasury Department, and
							found the <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary Ewing</persRef> so
							oppressed with business that I could have with him only a very short
							conversation— I enquired into the present condition of the Smithson fund
							and shewed him my 3. Resolutions offered to the House on the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December last, and the Letter to me
							of <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Levi Woodbury</persRef> of the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of January— Upon enquiry of <persRef
								ref="young-mcclintock">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maclintock
								Young</persRef> it appeared that the interest of the last year on
							the Arkansas bonds was invested in Illinois Stocks at 79. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ewing said he would call at my house to
							converse with me on this and other matters— I left with him applications
							for appointments of <persRef ref="currier-solomon">S. H.

								<persRef ref="williams-seth">Seth Williams</persRef> at Fall-river,

							<persRef ref="ferson-william">William Ferson</persRef> as Deputy Collector at Gloucester—and he read at my
							request the petition of <persRef ref="bogan-john">John A. Bogan</persRef> and 5 bricklayers, whereupon I
							intreated him to reform the stupid and gross mismanagement of the whole
							concern respecting the public buildings.— He said it was under the
							consideration of the Cabinet— At the Department of State I communicated
							to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> the Letter from <persRef ref="buckingham-joseph">J. T.
							Buckingham</persRef>, with the Resolutions of the Bunker-hill Association of the

							Rhode-Island—an of <persRef ref="greenough-john">J. J. Greenough</persRef> to be continued and promoted as a
							Clerk in the Patent Office— I found also the papers of which I was in
							quest relating to the Acts of the Legislature of South Carolina,
							excluding negroes from coming into the State by Sea; with additional and
							important papers on the same subject— I took the Letter from <persRef ref="johnson-william">judge

							opinions of the Attornies general, <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>, <persRef ref="berrien-john">Berrien</persRef> and <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Taney</persRef>; and the

						<p>This <persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Miss Pierce</persRef> was twice here, and finally some needle work was found
							to give her employment— In the tedious process of assorting and filing
							the mass of Letters that I have received since the commencement of the
							present year, the frivolous character of nearly the whole of them
							presses itself upon my attention— The applications and solicitations for
							office are numerous— A class of correspondents from the burden of whose
							intimacy I had been for the last twelve years almost entirely relieved—
							They have now revived, without the revival of the power to gratify even
							one of them in a hundred. All the good office I can render in them is to
							submit the applications themselves to the respective heads of
							Departments— I took therefore this morning to the <persRef ref="granger-francis">Post-master General
								Granger</persRef>, a copy of a Letter from <persRef ref="bradley-abraham">Abraham Bradley</persRef> of 16. Oct<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1829 to <persRef ref="low-joseph">Joseph Low</persRef>, removed from the
							Office of Postmaster at Concord New Hampshire, and who now applies to be
							restored— I had already left there the Letter of solicitation from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Low himself— A Letter from <persRef ref="weston-gershom">Gershom B.
									Weston</persRef> of Duxbury recommending <persRef ref="ellison-william">William Ellison</persRef>, for Postmaster at that
							place—and a Letter from <persRef ref="clark-sylvester">Sylvester Pendleton Clark</persRef> applying for
							restoration to the Post-Office at Pendleton, in the State of New-York,
							whence he had been removed without alledged cause by the <persRef ref="niles-john">late Postmaster
								General, John M Niles</persRef>, last October— I had another Letter from <persRef ref="hyde-daniel">Daniel T.
									Hyde</persRef> at Annapolis—urging the restoration of <persRef ref="munroe-grafton">Grafton Munroe</persRef>, removed from
							that Post-Office— This M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger read, but
							I took it back, as he had other applications direct in behalf of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Munroe— <persRef ref="peck-luther">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
									Peck</persRef> from New-York, was with him, and at the door of <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse’s</persRef>
							Office I met <persRef ref="monroe-james2">James Monroe</persRef>. I called at the Office of the National
							Intelligencer, to enquire for 50 copies of my Speech on the Treasury
							Note Bill— Neither <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> nor <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> was there, but the foreman found the
							copies of my speech, which he will send to the capitol to be folded. At
							<persRef ref="peyton-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peyton’s</persRef> where I went to visit <persRef ref="ogle-charles">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ogle</persRef>, the Negroe man at the door told me
							that he was better, and was riding out— I walked round the President’s
							square at Evening twilight, and waded along nearly through <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist’s</persRef>
							Dissertation Philippic addressed to the British Commissioners at the
							Havana in the form of a Letter dated 2. July–29. Aug<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> 1839—an elaborate, insolent, crafty,
							hypocritical treatise to sustain and justify the African Slave-trade and
							Negro Slavery under hollow professions of deep detestation of them both—
							This paper and the whole of Trist’s correspondence and his conduct as
							U.S. Consul at Havana, are among the most remarkable phenomena of the
							death struggle now in continual operation between the Spirit of Liberty
							and the Spirit of bondage on this Continent of North-America— Trist has
							the Ambition to act a prime part in this great convulsion.</p>

						<p>Germinating weather— <persRef ref="thornton-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> the Minister
							of the foundery methodist chapel preached this morning, at the second
							Presbyterian church, for <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef>— His text
							was from 1. John 2.1—[“]If any man sin, we have an advocate with the
							Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. 2. And he is the propitiation for
							our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole
							world.” A regular calvinistic discourse of the old presbyterian school—
							Jesus is here an Advocate with the father; being himself the
							propitiation for the sins of the whole world— But if he is the advocate
							how can he be the judge? and if he is the judge how can he be the
							propitiation? The rigid calvinists consider the atonement by the death
							of the man Christ Jesus, as the vital part of Christianity, and that
							whoever disbelieves it is no Christian.— It is an example of what the
							human mind may be brought to believe as a creed in conflict with common
							sense— It is too absurd to bear one ray of the Sunbeam concentrated
							through the burning glass of reason— There is an atonement for sin by
							the blood of Christ, proclaimed in the New Covenant, and largely set
							forth in the Epistles of <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef>. But it is not the calvinistic creed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton urged with great earnestness that
							repentance could of itself have any efficacy to obtain the pardon of
							sin— But what is sin? <persRef ref="mott-lucretia">Lucretia Motte</persRef> to convince me that nothing less
							than the immediate abolition of Slavery could satisfy her, said to
							me—why ’tis a <hi rend="italic">Sin</hi>! Now if it be a Sin, has it
							been atoned for by the blood of Christ? and if it has been atoned for,
							what need is there either for the abolition of Slavery, or for
							repentance to take away the Sin? The most incomprehensible thing to me
							in the calvinistic atonement is how the crucifixion of Jesus more than
							1800 years ago, could atone for all the sins of all mankind from that
							time forth till the end of the world— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thornton said he had promised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood that
							he would see to his pulpit’s being supplied during his absence— And as
							<persRef ref="waugh-beverly">Bishop Waugh</persRef> would preach for him at the foundery chapel this morning,
							he had concluded to take M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood’s place
							himself— After the service, walking home I witnessed a greeting between
							M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton, and <persRef ref="penrose-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Penrose</persRef> of Pennsylvania the new Solicitor of the Treasury.—
							They had been old acquaintance at Carlisle— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening prayer for the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday in Lent, and preached from Job
							31.14. “What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,
							what shall I answer him?” Well was it for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley that with this verse he did not take the one immediately before
							and the one immediately after it. <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
							Connell</persRef> was here this evening, much improved in Spirits; but he says the
							<persRef ref="harrison-william">President</persRef> is in great perplexity about the appointment of a Collector of
							the Customs at Philadelphia— The President has been yesterday and this
							day confined to his bed with a vernal chill— I received this evening a
							Letter from <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis Tappan</persRef> of New-York and
							another from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> <persRef ref="jocelyn-simeon">Jocelyn</persRef>, <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">Leavitt</persRef> and
							Tappan the Committee for the Amistad captives, which furnishes matter
							for much deliberation, and deliberate meditation for me.</p>

						<p>Fire</p>
						<p>Rain the greater part of the last night, and of this day, with a chilling
							east wind requiring a small fire in my chamber, just enough to be kept
							burning— <persRef ref="munroe-e">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Munroe</persRef> was a stranger from
							Boston, who brought a parcel for <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>. I completed the assortment
							and filing of my Letters received since the beginning of this year, and
							find myself with a task before me perfectly appalling— I am yet to
							revise for publication my argument in the case of the Amistad Africans,
							and in merely glancing over the Parliamentary Slave-trade papers lent me
							by <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef>, I find impulses of duty upon my
							own conscience, which I cannot resist, while on the other hand, the
							magnitude, the danger, the insurmountable burden of labour to be
							encountered in the undertaking to touch upon the Slave-trade— No one
							else will undertake it— No one but a Spirit unconquerable by Man Woman
							or Fiend, can undertake it, but with the heart of Martyrdom— The world,
							the flesh, and all the devils in hell are arrayed against any man, who
							now, in this North-American Union, shall dare to join the standard of
							Almighty God, to put down the African Slave-trade—and what can I, upon
							the verge of my seventy-fourth birth-day, with a shaking hand, a
							darkening eye, a drowsy brain, and with all my faculties, dropping from
							me, one by one, as the teeth are dropping from my head, <hi
								rend="strikethrough">one by one,</hi> what can I do for the cause of
							God and Man? for the progress of human emancipation? for the suppression
							of the African Slave-trade?— Yet my conscience presses me on—let me but
							die upon the breach— I walked about half an hour for exercise before
							dinner, and called at the house of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. H.
							Fox the British Minister, to have some conversation with him— It was 2.
							O’Clock P.M. The Servant at the door told me that he was not up, and
							that he was unwell. I enquired at what time he was usually visible—he
							said between 3. and 4. I had heard that his usual hour of rising was 3.
							In my second walk after dinner I met <persRef ref="miller-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jesse D. Miller</persRef>, first Auditor of the Treasury; from which Office it is
							said he is to retire at the close of the present month and quarter.—
							This evening I answered an old and repeated invitation to deliver a
							Lecture at Richmond Virginia; and postponed answering the Letters
							received last Evening from the Amistad Committee, and from <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef>—
							I read <persRef ref="betts-samuel">judge Betts’s</persRef> opinion upon the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Section of the Tariff-Act of July 1832—and the reversal of his decision
							by <persRef ref="thompson-smith">judge Thompson</persRef>— And I made several minutes from the Parliamentary
							Slave trade papers Class A. 1839–40. shewing the enormous extent to
							which that trade was in those and the two preceding years, carried on in
							American vessels under the patronage of <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist</persRef>.</p>

							administration for the colour of his political coat, afterwards employed
							three several times by direction of the Senate, as a draughtsman to
							protract the lands surveys came to shew me a machine of his own
							invention for protracting surveys made by the chain and compass— His
							dismission according to his statement was one of the first steps to that
							Chaos of Confusion into which the whole management of the Office has
							fallen— The extent of which may be imagined from the necessity of an act
							of Congress actually passed at the recent Session to legalize the whole
							mass of the land Patents issued for several years.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gordon wants restoration to his place—
							<persRef ref="homer-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Homer</persRef> came to set forth his
							equitable claims to a clerkship in one of the Departments here,
							consisting 1. In his wants 2. In his misfortunes; having failed in
							business as publisher of a compound Newspaper in Boston 3. In the fact
							that there is not a single Bostonian in any of the subordinate public
							offices. His purpose is to be a Letter-writer for sundry Newspapers; for
							which a Clerkship will be a convenient location. He had a recommendation
							signed by <persRef ref="choate-rufus">Rufus Choate</persRef> and some others, but <persRef ref="bates-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bates</persRef> had neglected him; and it was said the Members of the
							Massachusetts were not so zealous in supporting the applications of <hi
								rend="italic">their</hi> constituents for office as others, but <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> had advised him to apply to <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">M<hi
										rend="superscript">r</hi> Ewing</persRef> and <persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Granger</persRef>, whose Departments had much more patronage than his, but said
							that if he should fail with them, after all, <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
							would take care of him. He promised to send me a copy of his address to
							the Boston Charitable Mechanic Association in 1836.— <persRef ref="thomas-james3">Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> James Thomas</persRef> was here and gave me many
							details of the competitions for Office, and for the bestowal of Office
							some of which are humiliating.— <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> likewise called— <persRef ref="hallowell-benjamin2">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hallowell</persRef> and <persRef ref="janney-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Janney</persRef> came with a Carriage from Alexandria, and took me
							down there, where I dined with <persRef ref="lee-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edmund
							Jennings Lee</persRef> and a party of ten of his family and friends among whom
							were Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <persRef ref="u">Fowle</persRef>, <persRef ref="dana-charles">Dana</persRef>, the Episcopalian

							daughter, besides M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lee <persRef ref="u">Hallowell</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Janney</persRef>
							and two or three others— After dinner, with most of the same company and
							some others, we took tea at Benjamin Hallowell’s—then at half past seven
							we went to the Lyceum where I delivered my Lecture on Society and
							civilization to a crowded auditory after which there was a debate on the
							question whether phrenology is a Science useful to the community. The
							meeting broke up between 10 and 11. and I returned with M<hi

							the Marine Corps, who told me that he had been in command at Boston,
							from 1802 to 1805. and had afterwards resigned his commission— And that
							he had been appointed by me a magistrate for the County of Alexandria;
							and still held the same Office— He was coming upon some business at the
							general Post-Office; and asked me if I could direct him to the house of
							<persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard Cutts</persRef>—which I did, passing by
							it on my way home— We reached the landing below the bridge about a
							quarter before 10. and I had barely reached my chamber, when <persRef ref="hodgson-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hodgson</persRef> came in, and represented his

							I should think it better to retain him as translating Clerk in the
							Department. <persRef ref="chisholm-ad">A. D. Chisholm</persRef> came again and has written to me again about
							his preposterous claim— He writes and talks so as to leave me in doubt
							whether he is a lunatic or an imposter. I intreated him never to write
							to me or to call upon me again— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whittlesey</persRef> visited me with two of his friends from the State of Ohio,
							whom he introduced to me, but whose names I lost— <persRef ref="morsell-richard">M<hi

							dollars in Virginia Bills, and asked indulgence till the 1<hi

							what he paid me now, giving my consent to wait till the 1<hi

							marking that all future payments are to be in Specie or its equivalent.
