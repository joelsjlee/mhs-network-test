                            the horizontal variation and dip of the needle, the construction of
                            which I still do not thoroughly understand— I could perceive only the

                            observer told us the magnet was much disturbed by the keys and penknives
                            that we carried in our pockets— There is a small transit-instrument but
                            no telescope— An opening on the roof of the house, and an observable
                            monument at the distance of 9 miles on the blue hills— They have also a
                            barometer of recent and improved construction— We visited next the newly
                            erected Quincy Granite Hall, intended for the library— A heavy mass of
                            Gothic Architecture— All in one Apartment, overarched so as to remind me

                            present library is but of about 40000. The building is to be warmed by
                            one furnace in the cellar heating four stands of iron pipes on the floor
                            of the hall to be filled with boiling water.— We afterwards visited the
                            old Library—Philosophy chamber, lecturing room, and mineralogical
                            collection— Then the Hall and Library of the Dane Law School, and then

                            concerning it. We returned to Boston before Sunset— <persRef ref="u"

                                Gould</persRef> brought me last Evening a letter for recommendation

                                Abbott Lawrence</persRef>. The meeting next Wednesday Evening which
                            he invited me to attend and to address was of the Mercantile Library
                            Association, and it is called at the instigation of <persRef

                                Vattemare</persRef>, to consider of a proposal for an union of that
                            and sundry other similar Institutions in this City into one, to form a
                            common library, and collections of Natural history, geology, medals,
                            coins, and the like— I could not refuse my attendance at the Meeting.—
                            Nor to address them, for the fashion of talking in public “a tort et à
                            travers,[”] has become a sort of indispensable duty to every public man;
                            but the position of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vattemare himself is
                            something between a public benefactor and a Charlatan, and I have
                            introduced, countenanced and supported him quite as much as was
                            consistent with a due regard for my own reputation— I am not so sanguine
                            as he is in the expectation of great results from the exchanges of
                            duplicate books, manuscripts and the like, and as to his project of
                            melting up here all the literary associations into one, I am not so well
                            satisfied of its utility, as to give it a public commendation— I found
                            myself this morning with hoarseness much increased, a heavy cold, and
                            troublesome sore throat— But the morning was fair and promising, and

                            in connection with an argument to dissuade the Galatians from practising
                            the rite of circumcision. as they stand with the context their meaning
                            is somewhat obscure—but D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Frothingham
                            generalised the import of the remark, and considered the cessation of
                            the Offence of the Cross in all its various aspects, through the whole
                            range of the history of Christendom— It was communion day, and I
                            remained, and took the communion in <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi

                            ceremony, was solemn and edifying; uniting gracefulness of manner with
                            all the simplicity of the usual congregational mode of performing it—
                            The afternoon service was by <persRef ref="gray-thomas2">D<hi

                            preaching has much changed since his younger days, but his enumeration
                            of the various ways in which men may become partakers of the sins of
                            others, and his exhortations against them all, held forth sound and
                            profitable doctrine— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks invited me to
                            spend the Evening at his house, but the weather was so unfavourable that
                            it confined us to the house— I made some progress in the revisal of my
                            Amistad Speech, and spent the Evening in conversation, my hoarseness and
                            sore-throat increasing. [symbols]</p>

                            hoarseness hard of utterance— By good advice I kept house the whole of
                            this day, further admonished thereto by a fall of snow all the morning,
                            and cheerless cold till the clearing up at Night— My resort was to a

                            flax-seed tea— The day passed in no wise tediously away; but I could
                            devote very little of it to labour of writing or even of reading—

                            three hours— His conversation is vastly entertaining; but his flattery
                            is maukish, his Vanity, hardly supportable, and his system a perpetual
                            bore— He left with me a manuscript in English of some seventy pages, and
                            which he says will cover six columns of the Notion, the largest
                            Newspaper in the World—being the Address which he is to deliver at the

                            which I am obliged to decline— So much of this day was absorbed by these
                            visitors, that very little of it was left to make progress in the
                            revisal of my Speech on the Amistad captives case; now my most
                            oppressive burden. In the Courier of this morning is published the first

                        <p>I had a good night’s rest, and was so much relieved of my sore-throat,
                            hoarseness and cough, as to be able to go out; the weather being fair
                            though cold. I bespoke from a Seal engraver named <persRef
                                ref="mitchell-francis">Mitchell</persRef> a Seal, with the Arms of
                            Adams, taken from the double seal which <persRef key="adams-john">my
                                father</persRef> had made after the Peace of Paris in 1783, with his
                            forest and fishery device on the other side; and which Seal my father
                            gave to my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>—and from him it
                            passed to his widow, <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Catherine
                                Adams</persRef> to whom it now belongs.— There are families of Adams
                            in almost every County of England, Wales and Ireland. These arms are of
                            the family in Lincolnshire, which my father believed to be those of his
                            paternal ancestors, though he always used those of the Boylston,
                                <persRef ref="hall-susanna">his mother’s</persRef> family— As there
                            is in the family now only one seal bearing these arms, I have determined
                            to get another engraved, and to leave it with <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, so that the tradition may not
                            be lost.— As I was coming out of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Mitchell’s shop, I met <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi

                            from the inhabitants of the Town, to me, to deliver an Eulogy, on the
                            late <persRef ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef>, on

                            decease— Having declined the same invitations from Dorchester and
                            Brighton I had no alternative but to do the same with Quincy, to which
                            the present state of my voice further concluded— I called on <persRef

                            throat— I had been prevented yesterday by this condition of my health
                            from attending the exhibition at Cambridge to which I had been cordially
                            invited by <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>— For

                            promotion of Science. After dinner, I rode out with <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in his gig to Quincy, and
                            found there much to do, but no time in which to do it— <persRef
                                ref="kirk-john;kirk-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
                                    M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Kirke</persRef> were there; but
                            the house was cold, and I had concluded to return this Evening to the
                            city— We came in about Sunset, now 7. O’Clock— The aspect of the country
                            is almost as dreary as at mid winter. A few leaves beginning to shoot
                            forth from the bushes and trees; but not a blossom yet open— The Season
                            is said to be from a fortnight to three weeks later than usual. After
                            tea Charles went and attended the Meeting; and I had an evening visit
                            from <persRef ref="dexter-franklin">Franklin Dexter</persRef> who has
                            recently received the appointment of U.S. District Attorney— This visit
                            was unexpected.— In a time of depression and trouble to me, in 1829.
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin Dexter joined with twelve
                            other men, who had been my friends in profession, in a dastardly
                            combination and conspiracy against my character and reputation; under
                            false pretences of self defence from charges, not against them, but
                            which their consciences appropriated to themselves— Dexter had not the
                            shadow of a pretence for joining in this league; and I have had no
                            personal intercourse with him since that day. <persRef
                                ref="dexter-catherine">His mother</persRef> has repeatedly told me
                            that she disapproved of his participation in that cabal, and that she
                            had urged him to visit me— I suppose he came now in compliance with her
                            wishes— I have forgiven them all, and abstained from publishing a reply
                            to their last manifesto, to which they could have made no rejoinder for
                            posterity— Their policy which I encountered, and exposed, has long been
                            buried fathom deep, never to rise again.</p>

                            is now living with her— She expressed herself highly gratified that her
                            Son <persRef ref="dexter-franklin">Franklin Dexter</persRef> had called
                            upon me— The Steamer Britannia came in at 2. O’Clock yesterday morning
                            after a passage of sixteen days from Liverpool. She sailed on the 20<hi

                            being ever heard from hereafter— The Britannia brings accounts of a
                            settlement of the quarrel between Great Britain and China— Six Millions
                            of dollars of indemnity to be paid by the Chinese— An Island ceded to

                            it was not too comprehensive— He promised to call again early next week
                            and to bring some of the previous correspondence with Petty Vaughan, to
                            account for the expediency of our executing this Indenture of Release

                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef> morning Sermon
                            was from Proverbs 9.10—[“]the knowledge of the holy, is understanding.”
                            From the tenor of the discourse D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Frothingham, appeared to consider the words <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">holy</hi> as referring here not to persons, but to
                            things—the knowledge of holy things— But according to the Latin vulgate
                            and the French translation of <persRef ref="martin-gregory"
                                >Martin</persRef> the reading of this text should be—the Science of
                            the Saints is Prudence,— After some remarks upon the direct meaning of
                            this passage as understood by him the Doctor said there was an inference
                            derivable from it, of knowledge, which is not understanding; which can
                            be no other than the knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">unholy</hi>— He
                            laid it down therefore as a theme for illustration that the knowledge of
                            the <hi rend="italic">un</hi>holy is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            understanding— He then divided the unholy into the <hi rend="italic"
                                >frivolous</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">dishonest</hi> and the <hi
                                rend="italic">forbidden,</hi> from an ingenious and fanciful
                            analysis of which he drew copious arguments to show, that the knowledge
                            of them is not understanding—not useful but pernicious—the acquisition
                            of it idle and culpable waste of time—the curiosity to acquire it,
                            misapplication of the thirst for knowledge, itself a virtuous
                            propensity— The use of it tending to dangerous and evil temptations, and
                            he pointedly referred to the command of God to our first Parents in
                            Paradise to abstain from tasting the fruit of the tree of the knowledge
                            of good and evil planted in the middle of the garden.— D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s manner of treating his
                            subject is original, and perhaps too intellectual to be popular— His
                            composition is beautiful, and with exquisite passages in the every
                            discourse, but not always equably sustained— His Sermon this afternoon
                            was from <persRef ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef>. 9.8. [“]But when the
                            multitude saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given
                            such power unto men.” This is said on the occasion of the miracle
                            performed by Jesus, in healing the palsied man, to demonstrate his power
                            to forgive sins. But D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham
                            considered it as an exemplification of the amazement of the multitude,
                            at the power, bestowed by the almighty upon the race of men— But this
                            was the mistake of the Multitude.— The power exercised by Jesus of
                            healing the palsied man, and of forgiving his sins, was not given unto
                            men— It was the peculiar and exclusive power of the Messiah; and the
                            latter was never conferred by him, even upon the Apostles— D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s Discourse was an eloquent
                            declamation upon the contrasted powers and impotence of the human race.
                            A subject upon which an abundance of antithetical amplifications
                            naturally came up, and were formed into periods of elegant composition;
                            accompanied by doctrines of the purest morality— <persRef

                            influence in his favour before I left Washington, and now he came to ask
                            a Letter to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> not
                            of recommendation, but to intimate my wish that he may be appointed— It
                            was painful to refuse; yet I could not depart from a general and
                            necessary rule. I said I expected to see Governor Lincoln, and would
                            speak to him. <persRef ref="french-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            They asked me to give it a name, but I declined. French brought me a
                            budget of Letters and Newspapers which absorbed my time as a spunge

                            and enquired for the Journal of U.S. Senate for 1839–40— They had not
                            received it, though they have the journal of the house for the same
                            Session— I found the first Message P.U.S to S.U.S. on the cases of the

                        <p><persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went again to Quincy, but
                            my labour on hand kept me here, and visitors kept me almost the whole
                            day from my work. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef> came
                            with a written memoir of three sheets of paper to prove that the

                            preference to New-York or Philadelphia. As he has settled the matter to
                            his own satisfaction, in his own mind, I heard him read his memoir and
                            his argumentative exposition of it; and he promised me a copy of it. His
                            information upon commercial subjects is very great, and his opinions are
                            swayed as usual by his personal interests. He was with me about two
                            hours, when <persRef ref="paine-robert3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            as Secretary of Legation in Germany, France or Italy, to pursue in the
                            leisure of his official functions the same studies further.— I wish he
                            may be gratified— He spoke of the construction of Astronomical
                            instruments; the best of which he thinks are now made at Munich— He
                            thought the best Telescope in this Country, one lately imported for the

                            told me a story of filthy corruption and fraud in the settlement of
                            public claims, involving the moral honesty of men in the highest
                            dignities in both the great political parties, and whom I do not venture
                            here to name, though he named them to me; because having no evidence
                            against them other than his declaration and public notoriety, I will not
                            blast them upon this record without more conclusive testimony— M<hi

                            He promised to send me some documentary evidence of the facts— And said
                            he should himself go to Washington during the approaching Session of
                            Congress. At 11. this morning I attended with <persRef

                            stand before God[”]— He alluded to the National thanksgiving in 1815 for
                            the Peace with Great-Britain just after his settlement as Pastor of the
                            Church; and to the National fast in 1832 for the Cholera—and after
                            contrasting and comparing those occasions with the presents he observed
                            that whatever of Eulogy was due to the memory of the late <persRef

                            them without adequate cause— His afternoon discourse appeared to have
                            reference to his own circumstances, and the points of view in which he
                            presented the temper of mind adapted to take the suffering of shame for
                            the name of Christ were quite affecting— I resumed the task of writing
                            immediately after the afternoon service, till the approach of Sunset,
                            which I went over to witness from the porch of Charles’s house— <persRef

                            that for the Sabbath morning. I found and gave him a copy of the first,

                        <p>Cloudy morning, threatening foul weather and I saw not the rising of the
                            Sun—but I pursued the labour of reviewing the case of the Antelope with
                            a short half hour of intermission, till past 1. p.m. and then visited my
                            Garden— I was so much absorbed in occupation the last Autumn, that I
                            sowed scarcely any seeds, and find nothing up, but about a dozen
                            apple-seeds just out of the ground— Of the trees of preceding years,
                            some have died—numbers have been transplanted by <persRef
                                ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef> to <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >my Sons</persRef> place on the hill; many were crop’d by the
                            mower’s scythe last summer, and are perishing. a few are just shewing
                            their leaves and promise growth this Season— The two best grown
                            Apple-trees of 1834. which bore blossoms, and one of them 3 or 4. apples
                            last Summer, bear none this Season— The seedling Apple-tree fronting the
                            Southeasternmost study window, one of my darlings, has been nearly
                            girdled in the course of the winter by field mice, but survives and will
                            make wood this Season— One plum just before the Southwest corner of the
                            house is in full blossom, and a few of the peach trees in the garden—
                            The cherry-blossoms are opening, but those of the Apples and Pears are
                            not yet visible— The Season is three full weeks behind its usual
                            advancement.— My Son has leased the Mount Wollaston farm to a man by the
                            name of <persRef ref="u">Eaton</persRef>, and the Penn’s hill farm to
                            the <persRef ref="spear-charles">Son</persRef> of <persRef
                                ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef>.— I shall have no time
                            to make arrangements for them, and must leave all the management of them
                            to him. He came out with his family before dinner this day, and they are
                            to stay with me till my departure for Washington— Meanwhile this house
                            is undergoing some repairs and fresh outward painting. <persRef

                                Greenleaf</persRef> came after dinner—brought home some German books
                            that he had borrowed, and will come to-morrow for more. He pointed out
                            to me the white blossoms and green wood of the white Magdalen peach
                            trees. I found the volume containing my Sabbath-morning hymn, and took
                            it to <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            the Parish—my 104<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and perhaps 149<hi

                            former visit.— He brought now an earnest recommendation of him, signed
                            by 21 respectable inhabitants of Dukes County— I advised him to prepare

                            lengthened document of seven closely written folio pages, and concluded
                            that there is no occasion or necessity for us to sign it; and still less
                            to require the signatures of John Lane Boylston and his two sons— M<hi

                            him to us— He promised to come over here again on Saturday. The
                            remainder of the day—I was deeply engaged on the review of the case of
                            the Antelope, which I fear I shall yet be obliged to abridge, or to
                            leave unfinished.— I closed this evening a short Letter to <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— Charles went to

                            Curtis says there was a frost last night, and looking into a Calendar of
                            1834 I found an entry under date of 17. May of a hard frost in 1794— I
                            have so many things to do, before next Thursday week when I must depart
                            for Washington, that I fear I shall do not one of them— I have not even
                            time to select the most urgent of the calls upon me, or to make such
                            arrangement of my private affairs as may extricate them from confusion,
                            in the event of any sudden unexpected accident to myself.</p>

                            The Inhabitants of that Town have determined to have a fair copy made of
                            their old Record book of Births, Marriages and Deaths from the
                            incorporation of the town in 1640 to 1776.— The book of which <persRef
                                key="adams-john">my father</persRef> had a copy made in 1823.— I
                            turned to the entries in my Diary of 25 Sept<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r.</hi> and 1. October of that year, and found the record of my
                            visits to <persRef ref="wales-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Wales</persRef> then the Town Clerk of Braintree, and of our
                            discovery then of that book— He had the copy of it made shortly after—
                            It was then in poor condition, and is now so defaced and mutilated that
                            they find difficulty in making out a fair copy of it— I received the
                            week before the last a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B. V.
                            French requesting the loan of my copy to assist them in making out
                            theirs— I lent it to them accordingly this day, and with it the old
                            original Record book of the town’s expenses, which I have had many
                            year’s without knowing to whom it belonged— They offered me a receipt
                            for the books, which however I did not require. But I told them that I
                            should make a minute of their having received them this day, and that I
                            should expect they would be returned when they should have used them at
                            their convenience for the benefit of the town; which they promised. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> B. V. French said that many of the
                            inhabitants of the Town had been much disappointed, in the failure of
                            the Resolutions of the three towns, inviting me to deliver a centennial
                            address last May, and were yet very desirous that I should at some time
                            convenient to myself deliver a historical discourse on the town of
                            Braintree—and they had been appointed a Committee together with <persRef

                                Thayer</persRef> to give me the invitation— I said I would very
                            readily comply with it, if I could foresee the time when I should be
                            able to prepare such a discourse;—but that was now out of the
                            question—nor could I anticipate when it would be otherwise. He said that
                                Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Minot Thayer could not come with
                            them this day, being detained by the severe illness of his Sister who
                            lives with him, and deeply distressed at the malady of his brother

                            it was almost surprizing that I should find alive; but who are in

                            younger than I am, and has lived through greater hardships.— At M<hi

                            English grammar, poetry and belles Lettres— From the moment I entered
                            the chamber M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell put the examination
                            wholly upon me, and in parsing the Greek and Latin I wanted a little of

                            examination, but their pronuntiation both of Greek and Latin was
                            barbarous and the teacher himself appeared to have no conception of
                            prosody, or of rhythmical quantities. But I did not tell him of it,
                            being unwilling to mortify him in the presence of his school— At noon I

                        <p><persRef ref="percival-john">Captain Percival</persRef> of the Navy who
                            now resides at Dorchester came this morning to request my attention to a
                            Bill before Congress relating to Pursers in the Navy—reported by
                                <persRef ref="reed-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
                                Reed</persRef> from the Committee on naval affairs, but left without
                            action of the house upon it at the late Session of Congress— It was
                            founded on a memorial from a number of Seamen, praying for an increase
                            of their pay, and complaining of abuses in the charges of Pursers— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed did not present the memorial but
                            introduced the Bill. Captain Percival stated to me numerous cases of
                            gross abuses in the charges of pursers, and said the Bill if passed
                            would prevent them in future— He spoke also of impositions and frauds
                            upon the public, by collusive practices between Navy Agents and Store
                            keepers; and said that several Navy Agents in the course of four or five
                            years had passed from poverty to opulence upon salaries of 2200 dollars
                            a year. The present Navy Agent is <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard
                                Jarvis</persRef>: but a new appointment is expected, and of the
                            several candidates he warmly recommended a young man named <persRef
                                ref="u">Rogers</persRef>, perfectly honest and having property
                            sufficient to guard him from the temptation of becoming suddenly rich
                            upon rapine— I requested Captain Percival to make a statement in
                            writing, as far as he thought proper of what he had now communicated to
                            me, and to furnish me with a copy of the memorial from the Seamen which
                            he had now with him, which he promised to do, and I promised to devote
                            to the subject in Congress, all the attention in my power. Percival
                            himself is not without imputations, prepossessing against him as a
                            reformer; and his representations must be received with a grain of salt—
                            But they lead to extensive enquiry, and to confirm my desire to escape
                            from topics as ungrateful to me as they are dangerous— <persRef

                            cleaned both our Clocks, of the kitchen, and the western chamber entry,
                            and new hung their weights, the suspending cords of which had broken,
                            and drop’d them. He said they had been eaten off by moths; but I thought
                            it was a flaw in the cord— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull

                            reached home last Evening, in good health and Spirits. <persRef

                            with their application now, and that I had already declined recommending
                            others. Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lunt</persRef> this morning; from 2. Peter 1.5. And besides this
                            giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge—
                            A dissertation upon the natural progress of the Christian graces—Faith,
                            virtue—knowledge, and upon the imperfection of character of those who
                            possess only two of the three qualities; such as Faith and virtue
                            without knowledge, or virtue and knowledge: Faith being essential as the
                            foundation of the whole, and virtue and knowledge, as successive
                            additions to it— At the close of the Discourse M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lunt gave a summary narrative of the Apocryphal book of
                                <persRef ref="tobit">Tobit</persRef>, which he considered as an
                            allegorical fable; representing the ordinary vicissitudes, temptations
                            and trials of human life from childhood to the grave. His afternon text
                            was from 2. Peter 2.15. [“]Which have forsaken the right way, and are
                            gone astray, following the way of <persRef ref="balaam">Balaam</persRef>
                            the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness. 16. but was
                            rebuked for his iniquity[”]—a very interesting Discourse on the
                            character and history of Balaam—one of the most extraordinary parts of
                            the old Testament. Treated admirably by <persRef ref="butler-joseph"
                                >Bishop Butler</persRef>, and now very ingeniously by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt; but there is yet one point of view,
                            in which it needs illustration to me— Balaam is represented as a true
                            prophet—sent for by <persRef ref="balak">Balak</persRef> king of Moab to
                            defend his country from being overrun and conquered by the Israelites,
                            by cursing them— Balaam consults the Lord is forbidden to go and refuses
                            to go.— Balak sends for him again—he consults the Lord again—who bids
                            him to go, but to speak what he shall tell him, and yet sends an angel
                            to arrest him, and gives voice to the Ass to remonstrate with him, and
                            yet lets him go.— Balaam finally pronounces a magnificent blessing upon
                            Israel, instead of the curse which Balak sent for him to deliver, and
                            there it ends.—except that we are afterwards told that he gave evil
                            counsel to the children of Israel, and that they slew him with the
                            sword. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De

                        <p>The last day that I can remain at Quincy has come, and my review of the
                            case of the Antelope, with the close of my Amistad Speech was not
                            finished. In the anxiety of long protraction I devoted to it the whole
                            of this day, and finished it in a hurried manner, so that it is not yet
                            in a condition to be sent to the printers. A scene of ludicrous distress
                            ensued, for after finishing, I proceeded to collect together the printed
                            slips of newspapers and the manuscript sheets of my revisal, when the
                            first and most essential of the manuscripts with four of the fifteen
                            slips between its leaves was missing—and I had a regular hunt for them
                            of about two hours in a state of nervous excitement at my own
                            carelessness, as blamable as the carelessness itself— <persRef

                                Charles</persRef> was all the time assisting me in the search, and
                            Charles was packing my trunk in the operation of which he finally found
                            my missing papers, under a load of books on the bed.— <persRef
                                ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
                            called and returned to me, my manuscript version of the Psalms, and the
                            Book containing the Sabbath morning hymn, and he gave me a list of my
                            productions which he proposes to introduce into his new hymn book. He
                            takes the whole or parts of about ten of my Psalms—the Plymouth hymn of
                            22 December 1803. written the year before. the Sunday hymn; written at
                            Ealing in 1816— The hour-glass, written at Meridian hill in the Spring
                            of 1829. sung at the centennial Church celebration<space/>September
                            1839.—and two of the Stanza written in sickness in 1831— He does not
                            take the whole Book of Psalms— Very few whole Psalms— But short Psalms,
                            and fragments of some long ones, all as hymns intermingled with the
                            others in portions just sufficient for singing at one time each— I
                            questioned the expediency of abandoning the old practice of using the
                            whole book of Psalms, and printing it separately from the collection of
                            hymns.— But this is now the fashion— I had a long conversation with M<hi

                            to him to deliver a discourse upon the moral and literary character of
                            the Book of Psalms, illustrated by the history of David’s
                            institution—his composition of many of the Psalms—the lost Songs of
                                <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>— The Psalms of <persRef

                            bewailing the Babylonian captivity— And discussing the influence of this
                            institution not only upon the Jewish Nation but upon Christianity,
                            Christendom and civilized man— He said it would be a good subject for a
                            preliminary discourse to his hymn book. <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"

                            returned to dine— I had concluded not to leave home till after dinner,
                            but being obliged to pack my trunks to be sent by <persRef
                                ref="gillet-simon">Gillett</persRef> as early as eight in the
                            morning, I was left with several hours of leisure— Visited the seedling
                            trees in my garden, nursery, seminary and Orchard, many of which from 2
                            to 12 years of age have acquired indiduality quite interesting— There is
                            an English Oak from the Acorn, and a shellbark walnut from the nut in
                            the small plat which I gave to <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
                                Louisa</persRef> in the Seminary, each in its third year, which I am
                            very desirous of raising.— They are very slender and when I first came
                            out this spring I could not find them; they have now both put forth
                            leaves, and I wish to preserve their lives.— To preserve their roots
                            from the withering heat of the Sun, I have covered their bed with a
                            foliage of Strawberry vines, and there are several flourishing apple
                            seedlings of the same age with them.— In the Nursery a seedling Apple
                            tree twelve years old is covered with blossoms, and five others
                            including one pear tree of the same age have a considerable number of
                            blossoms.— I picked up from under the great elm tree by the road side

                            Acorns, and shellbark walnuts which have wintered in my closet. I told
                                <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef> to plant within a week
                            more of the elm-seeds from the great elm— I went to the Quincy Stone
                            Bank, and took my book balanced— <persRef ref="billings-oliver">Oliver

                            he has been a three years cruize in that ship— <persRef

                            he borrowed last fall; and took out others. At half past two immediately
                            after dining, Kirk took me, in Charles’s Gig, with one of my horses into
                            the depot of the Stonington railroad.— The cars started precisely at 4.
                            with between two and three hundred passengers—men, women children—a
                            Microcosm— The passage money from Boston to New-York, has been reduced
                            to 2 dollars; by a double competition, of a line from Boston through
                            Worcester to Norwich and down the Thames into Long-island sound, and the
                            other from Boston to Providence, and round Point Judith— We passed the
                            ferry at Providence soon after six, and reached Stonington at half past
                            8. There the Narragansett Steamer <persRef ref="u">Captain

                            The day had been warm and fine; but with Evening came on a thick fog,
                            and we were scarcely out of the harbour of Stonington when we were
                            obliged to anchor for the Night— Of my numerous, or rather innumerable

                            at Anchor befogged till half past two this morning, nearly 6 hours, and
                            the noise of the engine and of the paddles being quieted I slept in by
                            birth N. 19. secured to me by the ticket taken for me yesterday morning
                            by my Son—till they got under weigh about four hours; and then lay
                            awake, idle and barren till 5. when I rose.— the fog prevailed till the
                            dawn, the morning was calm but cloudy, threatening rain— The breeze,
                            scarcely enough to ripple the surface of the water was South of West;
                            directly ahead; and I was struck in fronting the wind on the upper
                            deck—it felt as if a brisk gale was blowing, while the surface of the
                            water was glassy. I had some conversation with <persRef

                            a member elect from the State of Maine of whom though also a member of
                            the last Congress, I took so little note, that I did not recognize him,
                            among the passengers till this morning.— There were several other
                            passengers who recognized me as an old acquaintance, whose names and
                            faces were equally unremembered by me— <persRef ref="u">Bunker</persRef>
                            the pilot I did remember— We landed at New-York just before noon,
                            instead of 6 or 7. in the morning, the contribution to the maid of the
                            mist— I had my two trunks, carried to the Office of the Camden Railway,
                            foot of Liberty-Street, and went to the Astor house to dine— Meanwhile I
                            sallied forth in search of <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">Joshua

                            where after some time M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt came in— I
                            told him that the revisal of the Amistad Speech was finished, but in so
                            hurried a manner that I wished to look it over once more before
                            committing it to the Press, and would send it to him from Washington.—
                            He spoke of the repeal of the nine months Law, by the Legislature of
                            New-York, and of his own visit to Albany last week— He said <persRef

                            would call with him at the Astor house to see me before 3. but they did
                            not come— I dined at the Ladies table at the Astor-house and met there

                            requesting me to answer on the paper, merely yes or no— I wrote on the
                            paper “impossible”—a quarter before 5. p.m. crossed the ferry at the
                            foot of Liberty Street and took Seat in the cars, by the Camden rail

                            we lodged, I opened my trunks, took out my diary and abridged as much as
                            I was able its arrears— At 7 we breakfasted and immediately after
                            proceeded to the Rail road Office in Market Street— Took tickets for
                            Baltimore, and reached that City after 7 hours of locomotion from half
                            past 7. to half past 2 p.m.—the ride is tedious although so rapid.—

                            for his sweet heart— He was talking politics all the way, and he told
                            me, he should raise the question of the constitutional right of M<hi

                            indifferent fare heretofore, and preferred waiting till I got home— The

                            took a ticket for Washington, and wandered about the purlieus of the

                        <p>Whitsunday— I attended public worship this morning at the Unitarian
                            Church, and heard <persRef ref="bulfinch-stephen">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef> preach from
                            Philippians 4.8. “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,
                            whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
                            things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
                            good report: if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, <hi

                            <hi rend="italic">on</hi>

                            <hi rend="italic">things</hi>.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch
                            took only the last words of the verse for his text, and considering
                            these things as comprehending the sum of all religion, made his sermon
                            merely an earnest exhortation to thoughtfulness on the subject of
                            religion, and of fervent and affectionate remonstrance against religious
                            indifference, inattention and neglect— The discourse therefore ran into
                            generalities and preceptive common-place.— These things on which
                                <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>
                            with feeling so intense urges the Philippians to think are the things
                            previously enumerated in the verse—the true, the honest, the just, the
                            pure, the lovely, the gracious—virtue and praise—the καλον και αγαθον of
                                <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef> these are the things which Paul
                            teaches his readers to bear in mind—to have them always in their
                            thoughts—and how profoundly they were in his own thoughts is
                            sufficiently demonstrated by the redundancy of repetition in the
                            charge.— What a lesson of morality, rather than of religion— If men
                            would but habitually and incessantly think of these things, how small
                            would be the calendar of crime—how much more secure would be the
                            condition of men in Society— The great majority of all crimes are
                            committed in drunkenness or intoxication, which disables a man from
                            thinking of these things.— Many are committed for want of education
                            without which it is scarcely possible to think of abstract moral virtue
                            and praise— The proportion of crimes committed from the wants of nature
                            is very small, and they are not the crimes which strike at the existence
                            of Society— But it is the duty of every one and of course my own,
                            according to his respective condition to think of these things— I had

                            those rumours were greatly exaggerated, and that whatever occasion there
