							the decision of the Supreme Court, and that was sufficient— It did not
							touch the merits of the question as between the two Governments, and
							that was to be avoided if possible— But if M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><persRef ref="nail-joel">Nail</persRef>, the Choctaw chief, came last
							evening with his two companions to request my assistance in getting
							through the house, a bill from the Senate, to indemnify him and his

							promised him whatever aid might be in my power.—This morning <persRef

								Stokely</persRef>, a member of the House from the State of Ohio came
							with a young man named <persRef ref="u">Schaeffer</persRef> a German
							Pennsylvanian—a friar mendicant for the establishment of some common
							school for the Germans in Western Pennsylvania— The Pennsylvania Germans
							are among the most thriving portions of the population of this Union,
							and ought not to resort to beggary to maintain their common schools.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schaeffer presented me a subscription

								Tyler</persRef> down for 50 dollars, and <persRef

								ref="bell-john">J. Bell</persRef> each for 20. I declined
							subscribing. <persRef ref="homer-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Homer</persRef> came much distressed for a loan of 20 dollars to pay
							for his board— He said he had written to Boston for money which he
							should receive in a very few days, and would then faithfully repay me— I
							have heard such before; but I lent him the money; took his promissory
							note payable on demand, and entered the sum in my book of household
							expenses— At the house, <persRef ref="dodge-augustus">August C
								Dodge</persRef>, delegate from the territory of Ioway took his seat,
							and <persRef ref="halstead-william">Halsted</persRef> Chairman of the
							Committee of Elections, reported that <persRef ref="yulee-david">David

							stating that he was necessarily called away, and asking that another

							Elections—ordered accordingly— <persRef ref="gentry-meredith"
								>Gentry</persRef> obtained leave of absence for <persRef

							calling on the <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary of the

								ref="harrison-anna">widow</persRef> of the late <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef> was taken up— I
							moved to strike out the limitation of two ounces or under, which was

							Resolution, and was followed by <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace

							seat to request a conversation with me at some convenient time, about a
							plan which he has formed for settling by a compromise the great Slavery
							question, and he wishes me to undertake— His views are pure and
							benevolent; I promised cheerfully to see and hear him on the subject
							without fixing the time— In the Senate my Bill to prohibit further
							investments of U.S. public funds in Stocks of the States was no sooner
							read than <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Woodbury</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="sevier-ambrose">Sevier</persRef> the contractors of the bargain
							consummated by the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of the

							Committee of finance, of which <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry
								Clay</persRef> is chairman, and I commended the Bill to his care.—
							He referred me to <persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> a

							certainty that it will be vetoed by <persRef ref="tyler-john">President
								Tyler</persRef>— I was dallying in conversation with several members
							in the house, when the vote was taken— I went in soon afterwards and

								>Boardman</persRef> had moved yesterday to lay the <persRef

							the yeas and nays had been called— I had been urged by several members
							to speak on this question, and had hesitated whether I would or not,
							down till I entered the house this morning— In my hesitation I had made
							no preparation to speak, and had not one line, noting the topics to be
							touched upon. I finally asked Boardman if he would withdraw his motion
							to lay the Resolution the table— O yes, if I would renew it— I said I
							could not do that, if any one should wish to reply to me— Well he
							withdrew his motion without condition— I then rambled through a Speech
							with out method or compass till the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker’s</persRef> hammer came down announcing that my hour was
							out—several motions were made for permission to me to proceed, but I
							declined— I scarcely know what I said; but <persRef ref="wheeler-henry"

							would send them to me— He told me too that his nubibus hic tumidus,
							fluctibus ille minax was from an ode of <persRef ref="horace"

								>Stevenson</persRef>, whom I had lashed, and I intreated that he

							question before the house; and they refused to hear him now— Boardman
							renewed his motion to lay the resolution on the table and it was carried
							by yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>— Wise then asked leave to offered a
							Resolution calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>
							for copies of Stevenson’s dastardly Letter to <persRef ref="hull-isaac"
								>Commodore Hull</persRef>—he was told that it had been communicated
							to the Senate, and was published in their documents— The majority was
							for suspending the rules, but not two thirds— Wise will hang his defence
							of Stevenson upon some other question, when I shall not be allowed, or
							not prepared to reply to him.— The house adjourned before 12. <persRef

							made myself more than one of Locke’s commonplace books; but never used
							any one of them. I had learnt and practised <persRef ref="byrom-john"
								>Byrom’s</persRef> short hand writing; but no one could read it but

							other man living, without ever being able to pack up my knowledge or my
							labours in any methodical order, and now doubt whether I might not have
							employed my time more profitably in some one great well compacted
							comprehensive pursuit, adapting every hour of labour to the attainment

							“Righteousness exalteth a Nation.” he left out the other part of the
							verse—“but sin, is a reproach to any people”— It was a valedictory

							corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on
							immortality.”— A discourse upon death— Always a grave subject— At my

								ref="gamble-roger">Gamble</persRef> and <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> took part in the debate till half past one, when
								<persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef> moved to adjourn, and it was
							carried— A man named <persRef ref="u">Taylor</persRef> came to my seat
							and invited me to go at 5 this afternoon and witness some experiments of
							submarine explosion at the Navy-yard— The <persRef ref="wheeler-henry"
								>reporter</persRef> sent me his notes of my speech of Saturday upon
							the <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> Resolution, so
							wretchedly put together that it will take me almost as much time to
							write them out, as if I had no notes at all— Immediately after dinner I
							rode down to the Navy-yard, and witnessed some of the submarine
							experiments— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor had just returned
							from an excursion of about ten minutes, at the bottom of the river, say,
							about 20 feet deep, and I saw him uncase himself in his cumbrous armour,
							something like that of a Roman Soldier or a feudal knight— The next
							experiment was the successive explosion of three barrels, to shew the
							different operation of the upward downward and lateral impetus— Then the
							destruction of a small scow in the stream, by a torpedo under her
							bottom; and lastly the firing of three explosive swivel balls at a
							target—but they did not explode— After a short visit to <persRef
								ref="kennon-beverley">Captain Beverly Kennon</persRef>, I came home,
							and found <persRef ref="miller-thomas2;miller-virginia">D<hi

						<p>I have been not a little perplexed in coming to a conclusion upon the
							case of <persRef ref="yulee-david">David Levy</persRef>, the Delegate
							from Florida—on his contested election— There is no competitor—the
							objection is that he is not a citizen of the United States— I fear he
							will not be able to prove that he is; but it is perhaps equally hard to
							prove that to be a citizen of the United States is a qualification
							indispensable for a delegate from the Territory of Florida. The question
							was taken this morning upon his application for time till the Winter
							Session, and it was carried 123 to 44. the members of the house yet
							present being reduced nearly to 170.— <persRef ref="harris-william5"
								>Harris</persRef> of Virginia, together with <persRef
								ref="goode-william2">W. A. Goode</persRef>, presented anti-session
							democratic resolutions from Clarke County in that State—laid on the
							table—he complained that the house would neither hear, read, nor print
							them. <persRef ref="owsley-bryan">Owsley</persRef> of Kentucky offered
							two resolutions of amendment to the Constitution—one to restrict the
							Presidential office to one term of service— The other to make a majority
							of the whole number of members of both houses, paramount to a veto—
								<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> objects, and the
							resolutions are not received.— <persRef ref="russell-william">William
								Russell</persRef>, a plain, sensible, Ohio farmer, who sits at my
							right hand presented Resolutions of a whig convention of delegates in
							that State—laid on the table— He told me he was in a state of extreme
							agitation, at hearing the sound of his own voice in that Hall. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-william">W. B. Calhoun</persRef> offered a Resolution
							of Instruction to the Committee on the public buildings to enquire about
							ventilation— <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">Taliaferro</persRef> offered

							pay as a member to <persRef ref="smith-william14">William
								Smith</persRef> who contests the election of <persRef
								ref="banks-linn">Linn Banks</persRef>, because the Committee of
							Elections at the request of Banks had allowed him time till the next
							Session to take further testimony—the balance of the evidence being at
							this time against him, and in favour of Smith—. The Resolution was now
							received; but the Committee had made no report, and they had not the
							power to allow Banks time till the next Session to take testimony,
							without the sanction of the house— I objected to the Resolution as not
							in order, but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said it
							had been received by general consent and the objection was now too late—
							Banks made a passionate speech which nobody heard or heeded— <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> move to lay the Resolution
							on the table— Carried— <persRef ref="ferris-charles">Ferris</persRef>
							reported from the Committee of foreign relations a resolution requesting

							propriety of entering into negotiations with the British Government, to
							procure the release of the citizens of the United States, transported to
							Van Diemen’s Land for participation in the Canadian Insurrection— This
							Resolution was sliding down without a dissenting voice when I stop’d the
							Speaker as he was putting the question, and remonstrated against it.
								<persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> of South-Carolina, as

								>Ferris’s</persRef> Van Diemen’s land Resolution, was called up by
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>, immediately
							after the reading of the Journal, as the unfinished business of
							yesterday. Everett made a short Speech, and said he had assented in the
							Committee of foreign relations to report this resolution, under an
							impression that it was offered in a conciliatory spirit, and with the
							hope that it might have that tendency— But after Ferris’s Speech in
							support of the Resolution yesterday, his opinion concerning it was
							entirely changed, and he moved to lay the Resolution on the table—
							Ferris immediately intreated him to withdraw the motion, to give him an
							opportunity to explain; which Everett did, on condition, that he would
							renew the motion to lay the resolution on the table which Ferris
							promised to do. His explanation was a mere hollow-hearted denial of all
							intention to inflame the irritation between the two countries; and an
							assurance that his intention was altogether conciliatory— <persRef
								ref="wood-fernando">Fernando Wood</persRef> of New-York urgently
							begged Everett to withdraw the motion to lay on the table, and allow him
							to speak— Everett declined; the question to lay on the table was
							rejected by yeas and nays 80 to 81. almost every member from the State
							of New-York, whig or democrat voting against laying on the table— Wood
							then made an incendiary speech, and <persRef ref="mckeon-john">John

							expired and <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved the

						<p>H.R.U.S— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved a call
							of the House— But <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> for
							the same purpose moved to adjourn and asked the yeas and nays to give

							Hopkins himself— The unfinished business was the motions for
							reconsideration of the votes of yesterday, exempting from duty Salt,
							Sugar and cotton— All reconsidered by yeas and nays. Salt 95 to 79.
							Sugar 101 to 80. Cotton 119. to 60.— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> then withdrew his motion to amend the Senate’s
							amendment by exempting salt, and <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Stanly</persRef> withdrew his motion to exempt sugar and cotton.
							The amendment of the Senate exempting tea and coffee was concurred in
							178 to 7. of which my vote was one— There was an amendment of the Senate
							excluding all duties over 20 per cent ad valorem, to which Fillmore
							moved an amendment which was carried— The house went into Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="mason-samson">Samson
								Mason</persRef> in the chair, on the amendments of the Senate to the
							Diplomatic appropriation bill—there was one striking out the item for a
							chargé d’Affaires at Naples; disagreed to after a long debate in the
							midst of which <persRef ref="tyler-robert">Robert Tyler</persRef> came
							in, and the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> took the chair.
							R. Tyler then announced that the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> had signed three Bills, and then, a message in
							writing— It was the veto—to the fiscal corporation Bill, which was
							immediately read— <persRef ref="morrow-jeremiah">Jeremiah
								Morrow</persRef> of Ohio then rose and moved that the message be
							entered on the Journal of the house—printed for the use of the members
							of the house, and that to morrow, at 12 O’Clock be appointed, to
							reconsider the Bill, which was adopted unanimously; Mason then resumed
							the chair of the Committee of the whole, and <persRef ref="mckeon-john"
								>M’Keon</persRef> finished a speech which he had before begun in
							favour of agreeing with the amendment of the Senate, which struck out
							the appropriation for the mission to Naples. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef>
							<persRef ref="steenrod-lewis">Steenrod</persRef>, Wise took part in the
							debate— I urged the house to disagree to the Senate’s amendment—
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Ingersoll</persRef> followed and
							Stanly made some cutting remarks upon Wise— Fillmore followed, but had
							said only a few words, when Wise crossed from his seat to that of
							Stanly, began by hectoring and finished by insulting him, whereupon
							Stanly called him a <hi rend="small-caps">Liar.</hi>— Wise struck or
							attempted to strike him, and a fight ensued; a rush of members to spot,
							whether to separate the combatants or to take sides with them, it was
							difficult to say— The Speaker took the Chair and roared Order—Order—but
							no order came— Many cried out the Sergeant at Arms! the Sergeant at
							Arms! but no Sergeant at arms appeared— After about 5. minutes of Chaos,
							Wise appeared in his seat— Addressed the Speaker—said he was perfectly
							cool, and most humbly begged pardon of the house; and told how he had
							gone over to remonstrate with Stanly—that words had ensued, till Stanly
							had applied to him a word which he could not brook and he had struck
							him— Stanly said he had no pardon to ask of the house— That he had told
							wise he was a Liar, and would have chastised him severely, if other
							members had not interfered— Ingersoll offered a Resolution to
							investigate the <hi rend="italic">rencontre</hi>—a Committee of 7.
							adopted— Adjourned about 4.</p>

							because he had expressed an opinion on the transaction, yesterday, but
							the house refused to excuse him— After the hubbub was over yesterday I
							moved the house to Committee of the whole on the State of the Union to
							take up the amendments of the Senate to the Diplomatic Appropriation
							Bill—done— <persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef> in the chair— I took
							part in the debate, to disagree to the amendment striking out the
							Neapolitan Mission, and to agree to the amendment making an
							extra-allowance of 3 Months pay for this Session to the Officers of the
							two houses, succeeded in both— Then the Committee took up the amendments
							of the Senate to the Smithson fund bill, with which the house at my
							motion agreed, and so the bill has gone through both houses. <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> was here last evening,
							and <persRef ref="kavasales-photius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kavasales</persRef>, who told me that <persRef ref="badger-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Badger</persRef>, the Secretary
							of the Navy had promised to recommend him for a chaplaincy in the Navy.
							This morning, there was much business done before noon. <persRef
								ref="dawson-william">W. C Dawson</persRef> announced with great
							satisfaction, that the sudden and transient difference between M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Stanly had been entirely adjusted by the intervention of their common
							friends, to their mutual satisfaction, and that the former friendly
							relations between them are restored.— At Noon <persRef ref="botts-john"
								>Botts</persRef> called up the Veto message; and the reconsideration
							of the fiscal corporation bill, and he pronounced a severe philippic of
							one hour upon <persRef ref="tyler-john">President John Tyler</persRef>;
							whom he accused of Treachery and Perfidy to the whig party. He was
							answered in another hour speech by <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Thomas
								W. Gilmer</persRef>, who was not less personally severe upon Botts;
							who resented it more in temper than in words. He referred to a bet of
							10000 dollars upon the last Presidential election—which Botts avowed
							that he had made—and Gilmer used the term jockey with indirect reference
							to some horse-trading of Botts not generally known to the house but felt
							by him—some time after <persRef ref="stuart-alexander2">Alexander H. H.
								Stuart</persRef> announced that this difficulty had been adjusted by
							the intervention of mutual friends, and read a written statement to that
							effect— The debate on the bill was continued by <persRef

								>Lane</persRef> of Indiana, <persRef ref="mason-samson"
								>Mason</persRef> of Ohio, <persRef ref="jones-isaac">Isaac D.

						<p>The meeting at <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster’s</persRef> last evening was at his request— He
							stated that the Secretary of the Treasury <persRef ref="ewing-thomas"
								>Thomas Ewing</persRef>, the Secretary of the Navy, <persRef
								ref="badger-george">George E. Badger</persRef> of North-Carolina and
							the Attorney General <persRef ref="crittenden-john">John J.
								Crittenden</persRef> of Kentucky had called on him this day and
							informed him that they, and <persRef ref="bell-john">John Bell</persRef>
							of Tennessee, had determined to send in their resignations of their
							respective Offices (the latter of Secretary of War) to <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef> at 11. O’Clock to-morrow
							Morning.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster then addressing me,
							said, that being thus placed in a peculiar position, and seeing no
							sufficient cause for resigning his office he had requested this meeting
							to consult with the members of the delegation, and to have the benefit
							of their opinions, assuring them that as to the Office itself it was a
							matter of the most perfect indifference to him whether he retained or
							resigned it—a declaration which it is possible he believed when he made
							it— But he had prefaced it by stating that he saw no cause sufficient to
							justify his resignation. It was like <persRef ref="falstaff-john"
								>Falstaff’s</persRef> recruit <persRef ref="bullcalf"
								>Bullcalf</persRef>. “In very truth, sir, I had as lief be hang’d
							sir, as go; and yet, for mine own part, sir, I do not care: but, rather,
							because I am unwilling, and for mine own part have a desire to stay with
							my friends: else, sir, I did not care, for mine own part, so much.” I
							asked him what reasons his colleagues had assigned for their
							determination to resign—he said they were various— The Secretary of the
							Treasury Ewing thought he had been disrespectfully treated by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler—and further that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler claimed some authority concerning
							the management of the Treasury which Ewing thought contrary to Law. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crittenden had personal relations with
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> which rendered his position now as a confidential
							member of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler’s administration
							specially irksome, and to which he thought he could no longer submit.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Badger were sensitive to some part of the Deportment of the
							President to them which they thought manifested a want of confidence in
							them— At least M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Badger, for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell was not with the others when they
							came to him this day, and he had not stated what his reason for
							resigning was— For himself M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster said
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler had never treated him with
							disrespect, and he had no doubt it was his desire that he should remain
							in the Department of State. He gave a very brief narrative of the
							progress of the two bank-bills and intimated his own belief that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler would have signed the second bill,
							but for the publication of <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts’s</persRef>
							Letter to the Richmond Coffee house— Inquiry was made how that most
							intimate confidential intercourse between the President and the
							correspondent of the New-York Herald was to be considered coupled—with
							the continual ferocious and scurrilous abuse in that paper upon all the
							members of the Cabinet, including M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster
							himself.— He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler had <persRef
								ref="tyler-robert;tyler-john3">two indiscreet Sons</persRef>, and he
							believed that the exceptionable intercourse has been established and
							carried on through them—but the joint resignation of the four heads of
							Departments together was a <hi rend="italic">Clay</hi> movement to make
							up an issue before the people against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tyler. We all agreed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster would
							not be justified in resigning at this time, but we all felt that the
							hour for the requiem of the whig party was at hand.</p>
						<pb n="459" type="ms"/>
						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster told us last evening, that the
							Postmaster General <persRef ref="granger-francis">Francis
								Granger</persRef>, desired and intended to remain in office; but he
							resigned this morning to-gether with the four other heads of
							Departments, leaving Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, the sole
							remnant of the <persRef ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef>
							administration, alone in his glory.— At the House this morning, a
							message was received from the Senate, announcing that they had agreed to
							the Resolution of the house to adjourn, on Monday next, striking out the
							words at 11. O’Clock A.M—with which the house immediately concurred—
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>
							presented a report from the Committee appointed to investigate, the
							attack and assault by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> upon
								<persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> in his seat, which
							Ingersoll’s resolution called a rencontre— The report commenced with a
							written statement of the facts by each of the two parties, not
							materially differing from each other— Then the report concludes with
							several Resolutions— 1. That the whole report and the two statements of
							facts should be spread upon the Journal of the house, as <hi
								rend="italic">a reprimand</hi>—and then other resolutions that
							hereafter if any member shall strike another, he shall be expelled and
							if any one shall insult another he shall be fined 100 dollars And upon
							this report <hi rend="strikethrough">Wise</hi> Ingersoll moved the
							previous question— I asked him to withdraw it, and he refused— I then
							moved to lay the report on the table, but withdrew it on a promise from
							several members that the previous question should be voted down— I rose
							and enquired to whom this reprimand to be recorded on the Journal was
							meant to apply— Ingersoll answered by a sneaking, insidious,
							inflammatory, equivocating Speech, without naming either of the parties,
							finally said that every one might apply it as he pleased— Stanly
							enquired of him whether the report was intended to apply the term
							reprimand to him; and he said he could not tell— He said the Committee
							were all elderly men and had agreed unanimously to the report, but three
							of them, <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef>, disowned it, and
							Caruthers said he had moved or intended to moe, and he did actually move
							in the house to add to the word reprimand the words to Henry A. Wise—
								<persRef ref="warren-lott">Warren</persRef> moved as a substitute a
							resolution to expel Wise, who with a forlorn and crafty affectation of
							humility said he hoped the house would not pass any vote of censure upon
							Stanly, and that for himself he would submit to any judgment the house
							would pass upon him; for there was but one man in the house, whose
							judgment he was unwilling to abide by, and that was me— He thought by
							this insult to provoke me to an intemperate retort which would divert
							the attention of the house from himself to me— I retorted only by
							disclaiming all personal hostility to him, and by opposing any vote of
							censure upon him.— <persRef ref="stuart-alexander2">Alexander H. H.
								Stuart</persRef> at last moved the recommitment of the report, with
							instructions to report a Resolution that as Wise had apologised to the
							house, and settled with Stanly, the house would take no further order on
							the subject, which was adopted by yeas and
							nays<space/>to<space/>Adjourned about 3. p.m.</p>

						<p>As I was going to church this morning, I met <persRef ref="cutts-mary"
								>Miss Cutts</persRef> who put into my hands a note which she had
							received requesting her, if she could by any female diplomacy, obtain
							from me this day before night a copy of my verses addressed to the
								<persRef ref="bruce-ellen;bruce-sally">two Misses Bruce</persRef>
							written at the request of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef> and given
							by me to him, with my permission to have them published if he pleased in
							the Southern Literary Messenger, a Quarterly periodical, published at
							Richmond Virginia— I found that the Note was from <persRef
								ref="payne-john">John Howard Payne</persRef>, a poetical, dramatic
							and political adventurer, now here, an applicant for an appointment as
							Secretary of Legation, to any of our foreign missions—a most familiar
							and intimate acquaintance of <persRef ref="tyler-john">President
								Tylers</persRef> two Sons <persRef ref="tyler-john3">John</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="tyler-robert">Robert</persRef>, and a confidential
							correspondent of <persRef ref="bennett-james2">James Gordon
								Bennett’s</persRef> New-York Herald, a paper in which the most
							secret proceedings of the President and his cabinet have for the last
							six weeks been divulged, with the most fulsome adulation to President
							Tyler, and the most unbounded and scurrilous abuse upon every member of
							the Cabinet— This paper has at the same time had almost daily notices of
							me; sometimes minatorial, but for the last ten days nauseously
							flattering.— Some three weeks since, the Herald’s correspondent having
							heard of my verses to the Misses Bruce, promised Bennett a copy of them
							for publication the next week—and the next week said that he could not
							furnish them yet; but he should have them— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Payne’s note says that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cost
							Johnson had promised him a copy of the verses, but afterwards said that
							he had lost it— Miss Cutts came this afternoon for an answer to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Payne’s request. I told her that I would
							with much pleasure comply with it, but that I had given the verses to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson with permission to dispose of
							them at his pleasure, and did not feel myself at liberty to give another
							copy without his permission.— I have no doubt that Payne wanted the copy
							to send to Bennett, so that the Herald might get the start of the
							Southern Literary Messenger in the publication.— At the presbyterian
							church this morning a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Lane</persRef> preached from John 3.3. “Jesus answered and said
							unto him, verily, verily, I say unto thee— Except a man be born again,
							he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Quintessence of Calvinism.— In the
							afternoon, at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, at 4
							O’Clock, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the 14<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Krusay</persRef>, preached from 1.
							Peter 4.17. [“]For the time is come that judgment must begin at the
							house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them
							that obey not the gospel of God?” On the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> of May last, being Whitsunday, the day after I arrived here
							to attend the present Session of Congress, and the day before the
							Session commenced, I heard at the same S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church, a sermon from this same text by <persRef

								Armstrong</persRef> of Wheeling. what a strange co-incidence of

								Kavasales</persRef> called this morning, and said that <persRef

								Southard</persRef> had advised him to request me to apply this
							morning to <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef>, and urge
							him to send into the Senate the nomination of Kavasales, as a chaplain
							in the Navy— I told him that I had never applied to the President in
							behalf of any person for an appointment, and should not feel myself
							justified in doing so now.— He said <persRef ref="badger-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Badger</persRef> the late Secretary of
							the Navy had told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard that the
							nomination was already to be sent in.— An Irishman by the name of
								<persRef ref="mcgarry-marcus">M’Garry</persRef>, a graduate of the
							University of Dublin with his Diploma, and sundry commendatory
							certificates came as a common beggar, without means to procure his daily
							bred— He has been ten years in this country, as a teacher of classical
							schools— There must be some great deficiency or incompetency to account
							for his present condition, but I could only see his want.— H.R.U.S.
							There was no Quorum—but the journal was no sooner read than <persRef
								ref="weller-john">John B. Weller</persRef> of Hamilton, Butler
							County Ohio a prince of the mock democracy, now called Loco focos,
							called up <persRef ref="ferris-charles">Ferris’s</persRef> Van Diemen’s
							land Resolution— I objected to its being considered without a Quorum,
							and said if a quorum could be obtained, I should move to lay it on the
							table— <persRef ref="graham-james4">Graham</persRef> of North-Carolina
							moved a call of the house— Yeas and Nays 52 to 33. The call was
							commenced but soon superseded and there was no quorum the whole day.
							Several Resolutions were offered, but none received except a motion by
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef> for the usual
							Committee to be joined by one from the Senate, to wait on the President
							and inform him that if he had no further communications to make the two
							house were ready to adjourn.— Everett, <persRef ref="williams-lewis"
								>Lewis Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina, and <persRef
								ref="ward-aaron">Aaron Ward</persRef> of New-York were the Committee
							on the part of the House— A recess was then taken by the house, first
							till noon, and then till 5. p.m. during which I came home and dined— I
							returned to the house at 5. in the mean time several other members had
							gone off in the Cars— The Committee on the part of the Senate to wait on
							the President were soon after appointed; but they waited some time for
							the President to receive them at the Capitol and Lewis Williams would
							not and did not go with them. About dusk <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3"
								>Thomas F. Marshall</persRef> of Kentucky rose and enquired of the
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>, if it would be in
							order for him to make a motion, on any subject whatever— The Speaker
							said it would— He moved that 5000 copies of the veto message be printed,
							and then made a speech of nearly an hour and a half in his own peculiar
							style of eloquence, sublimated by no thin potations.— Bitter invective
							upon John Tyler— Extravagant commendatory vituperation upon <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, lofty sentiment, comprehensive
							views, and alcohol evaporating in elegant language constituted this
							speech, at the close of which he withdrew his motion— Everett from the
							joint Committee soon after came in and reported, and about eight O’Clock
							the Speaker adjourned the house without day.</p>

							suited to the condition of the writers, and to the sentiments adapted to
							the diversities of that condition, the seduced, betrayed and deserted
							maid, and the faithful, affectionate, anxious and devoted wife mother

							the Merchants bank at Boston, for 400 dollars; 425 dollars in gold and
							60 cents in silver.— I exchanged at <persRef ref="nourse-charles"

							offering repeated motions for his expulsion— I went to the Capitol and

							heard, or not to have thought of that Resolution— But he said he would
							attend to it, and that he would write to the Secretaries of the several
							States to collect the information— I then returned to the Department of
							State, and found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, who told me he
							was very unwell, and who appeared to be in no very good humour— Neither
								<persRef ref="weaver-william">Weaver</persRef>, nor any one of the

							too late, when it was not 3. O’Clock, and I had been there an hour

							read, <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fox’s</persRef> note of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this
							month upon the case of <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef>—
							It is an instruction deeply earnest to Fox from his Government, upon the
							opinion of the judge of the Supreme Court of the State of New-York;
							reminding M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster that he had admitted
							the exemption of M’Leod, from all individual criminality for acts done
							under the authority of his Government, and expressing the deep anxiety
							of the British Government, for the preservation of Peace and their
							reliance upon the corresponding disposition of the President. Towards
							Evening I called to see <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson</persRef> who was not at
							home— I then called on <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Bell</persRef>, the late Secretary of War, whom I
							found with a large coal fire in his room— I had some conversation with
							him; but we were twice interrupted by other visitors—the second time by
								<persRef ref="crump-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crump</persRef>, who I supposed came on business, and therefore took
							my leave— I received this Evening from the National Intelligencer Office
							the proof slips of my speech on the M’Leod Resolution.</p>

						<p>After a long spell of dry weather we had a moderate cool rain nearly all
							this day, and the setting in of autumn. I revised the proof slips of my
							Speech delivered on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> on the <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander"
								>M’Leod</persRef> Resolution, the language of which wholly
							extemporaneous is mean and tautological, full of repetitions and
							desultory, but has the merite de l’apropos. The Speech has for the time
							saved <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> from the
							catastrophe which has befallen his colleagues— It has given him the
							means of saving himself from ruin, and his country from a most
							disastrous and cruel War— My reward from him will be professions of
							respect and esteem speeches of approbation and regard for me to my
							friends, knowing that they will be reported to me; secret and deep laid
							intrigues against me, and still more venomously against <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>— Such is human nature, in the
							gigantic intellect, the envious temper, the ravenous ambition, and the
							rotten heart of Daniel Webster— His treatment of me has been, is, and
							will be an improved edition of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson’s</persRef> gratitude— But these are things according to
								<persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef>, not to be told in the
							biographies of great men— I took the slips to the office of the National
							Intelligencer, and left them with <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi

							to-morrow. Gales says that <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb

							house, nor <persRef ref="burch-samuel">Burch</persRef> was there— I
							bespoke the remaining sheets of the Journals of both houses, and the
							indexes to be sent to me at Quincy— I called at <persRef
								ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef>, and took a Letter
							from <persRef ref="cranch-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Cranch</persRef> to Quincy. He had not yet read my two heroids; but
							promised to send them back to me before next Monday— He liked the

							came home, I had a long call from <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi

						<p>I had received while <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer</persRef>
							was here a Letter from <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elisha
								Whittlesey</persRef>, auditor of the general Post-Office making some
							enquiries concerning the solvency of <persRef ref="white-simeon">Simeon
								White</persRef> late Postmaster at East Randolph— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer promised to make enquiry on his
							return home— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey had called on me,
							three days ago for an answer—day before yesterday I received M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer’s report, and this morning
							communicated it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey at his
							Office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White is solvent but careless.— I
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey why the annual report of
							the receipts from the post Offices had been for several years
							discontinued—he said he did not know; but had two clerks now employed in
							making it up. There has been none since 1835. My next call was at the
							Treasury Department where I requested of the Secretary, <persRef
								ref="forward-walter">Forward</persRef>, a more particular statement
							of the State Stocks in which the Smithsonian funds principal and
							interest have been invested. At the Department of State I returned to
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fox’s</persRef> note of the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>— He said he thought of
							answering it by saying that <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander"
								>M’Leod</persRef> would be tried, at his own solicitation by jury on
							the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month—and that if he
							should not be acquitted, there will be an appeal to the court of Errors
							of the State of New-York, and from them to the Supreme Court of the
							United States— My Speech on the M’Leod Resolution was published in the
							National Intelligencer this morning. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Webster asked me to have it published in a pamphlet and said he would
							order 1000 copies of it, for circulation— He said the Great Western had
							arrived at New-York— That the New Parliament had assembled in England—
							That the address against the Ministers had been carried in the house of
							Commons by a majority of 91. and the <persRef ref="victoria"
								>Queen</persRef> had sent for <persRef ref="peel-robert">Sir Robert
								Peel</persRef>, and authorised him to form a Ministry at his
							discretion— That the subject of M’Leod’s detention had been noticed in
							Parliament, and he read me in the New-York Herald of yesterday an
							extract from a Speech of <persRef ref="temple-henry">Lord
								Palmerston</persRef>, fully confirming the statement made in my
							Speech that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster’s Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox of<space/>April, and the Instructions
							to the Attorney General, had softened down and conciliated in an eminent
							degree the bitterness and exasperation provoked by the previous
							communications from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren</persRef> administration, and <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
								>Pickens’s</persRef> report last winter— I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, if <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef> fully concurred in the
							proceedings of the administration, upon this subject before the decease
							of <persRef ref="harrison-william">President Harrison</persRef>— He said
							he did, and reminded me that his Letter to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fox was dated some weeks after M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tyler had assumed the Office of President of the United
							States— The census aggregates were not ready for me, but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster promised and directed that a copy
							of them should be made up, and sent to me at Quincy, next week— From the
							Department <hi rend="italic">of </hi><pb n="468" type="ms"/>of State I
							passed over to the President’s house and saw M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tyler— His Son <persRef ref="tyler-robert">Robert</persRef>
							was with him and <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> of
							Alabama the man mountain, with <persRef ref="lewis-susan">his
								wife</persRef>, on a take leave visit like mine— They soon withdrew,
							and I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler about the
							Smithsonian fund, and the debts of the States.— There are now 620000
							dollars invested in State Stocks bearing an interest of 6 per cent a
							year, payable half yearly— I told him I had at length succeeded in two
							measures at the recent session of Congress.— one by introducing into the
							bill for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, the
								4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> section whereby the portion coming
							at any time to any State, shall be first applied to the payment of any
							debt principal or interest from the State to the United States; and the
							other by the repeal of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of
							the West Point Appropriation act of 7. July 1838. which required the
							investment of the accrueing interest in States Stocks, and substituting
							the investment of them in Stocks of the United States— Though this has
							been attended much against my will with authority to the Secretary of
							the Treasury to reduce the interest from 6 per cent a year which the
							State bonds now bear to not less than 5— The Secretary of the Treasury
							has obtained one Million or a Million and a half of the 12 million loan
							authorised at the recent session of Congress at 5 1/2 per cent—but he
							wants already two millions more and has no prospect of obtaining them at
							a rate lower than 6 per cent, if at that; and I said if there should be
							an investment of the next semi-annual interest I hoped it would not be
							taken at a lower rate of interest than 6. per cent. But I was extremely
							desirous that the United States should not assume but resume the whole
							responsibility of that fund, and look themselves to the States for their
							punctuality of payment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler, in general
							terms approved of these observations, and assured me, that he would
							co-operate cordially with me for the faithful application of these funds
							to the purposes of the testator— He said he had my Letter to the late
								<persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Secretary Ewing</persRef>, and had read
							it.— I spoke also of the call of H.R.U.S. on the Secretary of the
							Treasury, for a report on the State debts, and gave him some of my views
							upon that deeply interesting public concern— He certainly did not concur
							with them; neither did he controvert them. When I suggested to him the
							certainty that the European Governments will ultimately hold the United
							States responsible for these State debts, he looked grave but made no
							remark.— I went lastly to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and
							requested <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Seaton</persRef> to print my M’Leod Resolution Speech, in a
							pamphlet, and send me 100 copies of it to Quincy. I told him that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had said he would order 1000
							copies. Seaton lamented the manner in which the whig presses are
							assailing Webster— I spent an hour of this Evening with <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas B.
								Johnson</persRef>.</p>

						<p>At the second presbyterian church this morning <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Lane</persRef> preached from John
							14.27— “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
							world giveth, give I unto you.” This is a most affecting text, and a
							suitable them for a pathetic discourse; but it is not peculiarly adapted
							to the calvinistic creed, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane did
							not make much of it— In the afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s church, a Stranger, quite a young man read the Evening service
							for the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and the
							Bishop of Maryland <persRef ref="whittingham-william"
								>Whittingham</persRef>, preached from John 4.10. “Jesus answered and
							said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is, that
							saith to thee, give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he
							would have given thee living water.” and John 7.37. “In the last day,
							that great day of the feast, Jesus stood, and cried, saying, if any man
							thirst, let him come unto me, and drink 38. He that believeth on me, as
							the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
							water”— The meaning of the words living water, he said in both these
							passages was identical; and was explained in the next verse of the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter 39. (But this spake he of the
							Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy
							Ghost was not yet given: because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) The
							whole reference of both passages was to the outpouring of the holy ghost
							on the day of pentecost, as related in the second chapter of the Acts—
							And this gift of the holy ghost was the prototype and origin of the rite
							of confirmation which he was about to administer— The whole argument of
							the Sermon was to maintain the rather untenable position that this
							ceremony of confirmation was in substance the same thing with that gift
							of the holy ghost to the apostles on the day of Pentecost— There is not
							a little ecclesiastical presumption not to say arrogance in this
							pretension— It implies the authority of the right reverend bishop to
							confer the gift of the holy ghost. And the only difference which he
							recognized between the miracle of the day of Pentecost, and his laying
							on of hands, for confirmation, was the descent of fire from heaven on
							the former occasion which he called a paltry circumstance; and repeated
							the words— He finished by administering this rite of confirmation
							successively to ten women, among whom was <persRef ref="forsyth-clara"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, and three
							men, one of them at least 60. years of age; all with profound, and
							dignified episcopal humility. Returning from Church, I met <persRef

								Hoffman</persRef> of Baltimore and <persRef ref="u">her
								daughter</persRef>, returning from the Virginia Springs. In the

								<persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard

						<p><persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Jonathan Elliot</persRef> came this

								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sewall, leaving us, at Baltimore,
							where we arrived at 20 minutes after 8. <persRef ref="binda-giuseppe"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binda</persRef> was also one of
							our fellow travellers from Washington— Without leaving the depot at
							Baltimore, we took the Cars for Philadelphia. <persRef
								ref="buchanan-robert">Captain Robert M. Buchanan</persRef> came to
							see us at the Cars, having been released from arrest at New-York, and
							had his leave of absence till December restored to him. He is quite
							resentful for the arrest, and assured me that he should push the matter
							further; but said not what he proposed to do— We started from Baltimore
							at 9. and reached Wilmington in Delaware just before 1. Here by a recent
							arrangement, instead of proceeding by land, the passengers left the
							cars, and embarked in the Steamboat Robert Morris in which we dined at
							leisure; and landed at 20 minutes past 3. at the Spruce Street wharf,
							Philadelphia— Our baggage was transferred immediately to the
							Walnut-Street hotel and wharf, where we had to wait a long hour before
							crossing the river to Camden, where at 5 we departed in the Railway Cars
							for New-York.— Nearly the whole of this journey is performed between
							Sunset and midnight— There is in these cars an apartment partitioned
							off, as a private Ladies apartment, but the agent of the proprietors at
							Philadelphia, who told me that he was a native of Gloucester,
							Massachusetts and had known me by sight many years ago, and that his
							name was <persRef ref="u">Bradshaw</persRef>, led me to the apartment of
							the Ladies and gave me possession of it, with my two companions— One
							other Lady came in very young, with her husband reasonably old, and
							forming between them an exact personification of January and May—
							Another lady, with a baby about 6 months old came in, and having some
							nursery duties to perform, took umbrage at my presence and complained to
							Mary; observing, though not in my hearing, that no male was admissible
							there. I took a seat in the other part of the Cars, nearly the whole

							named <persRef ref="u">Brinnell</persRef> with Cab. N. 203. took us and
							our baggage from the landing of the boat at New-York, to the Astor
							house, in Broadway. There the bar-keeper at first said they had no room,
							but on recognizing me, said <persRef ref="curtis-edward">M<hi

							Numbers 41 and 47. which we occupied at 20 minutes before 12.</p>

						<dateline>Norwich Thursday 23. September 1841. Boston. Quincy.</dateline>
						<p><date>23. I.30. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>A gentleman by the name of <persRef ref="u">Clark</persRef> and an
							ingenious eccentric mechanic from Newark New-Jersey, both going to
							Boston to visit the exhibition of the mechanic association now open
							there entered into conversation with me last evening, in which I could
							not take much interest— The night was fair and almost calm—the boat
							swift—the furnaces roaring with combustion of dry pine wood and
							anthracite coal combined so that the atmosphere of the upper deck was
							heated nearly to the temperature of boiling water. I turned in, before 9
							O’Clock but got no sleep— Soon after one in the morning the boat
							stopped— I rose and on going upon deck found she was along side of a
							wharf at New-London— Fair weather, and the sky alternately glowing with
							the splendors of Orion, the two dogs and the twins Southward, with the
							two Bears and the Dragon Northward, and veiled with vapours perceptible
							only by the disappearance of the Stars.— The boat after an interval of
							perhaps ten minutes started again, and in the darkness of night ascended
							the river Thames, 16 miles to Norwich, where at half past two we landed
							and immediately entered the train of railway cars, which brought us in
							three hours, at half past 5. with dawning day 58 miles to Worcester—and
							thence in two hours more at half past 7. 40 miles to Boston— A hackman
							named <persRef ref="u">Hastings</persRef> was at the depot, whom I
							immediately engaged, and he brought us out to Quincy. At a quarter
							before 9 this morning we alighted, safe, and scarcely weary, at my own
							house, after traversing in 51 hours little less than 500 miles from my
							house in Washington— We found <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								dear wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.
								Smith</persRef>, My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>
							and <persRef
								ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-louisa3;adams-henry4;adams-arthur"
								>five children</persRef>, all in good health, for which as for safe
							and easy performance of our own journey, gratitude to heaven is not
							forgotten— My Son went into Boston, taking with him his daughter Louisa
							Catherine, who is going to spend some days with <persRef
								ref="brooks-sidney;brooks-frances">her uncle and aunt Sidney
								Brooks</persRef> at Watertown— After three successive sleepless
							Nights and the whirligig motion of Railroad Cars and Steamboats, over
							500 miles of travel there is an agitation of the brain which requires
							time to settle into composure. In the tediousness of solitary wakeful
							hours, I sometimes struggle to beguile the time by hitching together
							rhymes, and thus in the cars this morning between Norwich, Worcester and
							Boston I composed three Stanzas of eight lines as disjointed as the
							state of my own mind— I committed them to paper in the course of the
							day, and that was all I could do— I could not even resume the broken
							thread of my diary— I visited my Garden, Orchard, Nursery and seminary
							to see the ravages of drought, worms and caterpillars among my seedling
							trees, which are greater than they ever were before, in proportion as
							the Season is more advanced.— Charles returned from Boston, before
							dinner. He and his wife passed the Evening with us. His Sons John Quincy
							and Charles Francis were here, most of the day— Henry Brooks, not
							out.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="green-john3">John A. Green</persRef>, editor of the Quincy

							upon which was printed about half the Stanzas of my ballad upon “the
							Wants of Man” He was reprinting it from the United States Gazette, which
							had taken it from the Albany Evening journal, which first made it
							public, from the copy sent by <persRef ref="morgan-christopher"
								>Morgan</persRef> to <persRef ref="weed-thurlow">Thurlow
								Weed</persRef>. Many errors of the press had crept into it, and it
							was without the eighth Stanza, written after Morgan had sent off his
							copy, and first published in the National Intelligencer. I revised M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Green’s slip, and gave him a copy of the
							additional Stanza— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green sent me this
							Evening the slip containing the remaining Stanza’s the whole now being
							26.— Nothing that I ever wrote was half so popular, though it was chance
							begotten, to make autographs for poor <persRef ref="ogle-charles"
								>Charles Ogle’s</persRef> Note paper, and though the full copy had
							remained in my Port-folio fourteen months, to dumb forgetfulness a prey;
							till I accidentally mentioned, it and afterwards lent it to <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef> to read— What a lesson
							this might be to me, if I knew how to improve it!— A youth of 15. named
								<persRef ref="grafton-edward">Edward Clark Grafton</persRef> came
							out from Boston, and brought me a Letter of introduction from <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">P. P. F. Degrand</persRef>— He is an applicant
							for a midshipman’s warrant, and came to solicit my influence. Talked of
							going himself to Washington, which I told him would in no wise advance
							his suit— There was rain great part of this day, and a sultry, drowsy,
							South-west wind. I attempted time after time to sit down, and write to
							retrieve the arrears of this diary from last Monday, and found myself
							dropping asleep over the page— I wrote nevertheless to <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> for a copy of the full returns of the census— And
							to <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">William S. Smith</persRef>
							enclosing a key of the black leather trunk, which I had packed up at
							Washington to bring with me; and which I was then obliged to leave
							behind because the key of it could not be found— I request him to lock
							and ship off the trunk, and to send me back the key by the Mail— And
							this afternoon, finding that I could not write, I walked to <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams’s</persRef>— Met on my way the <persRef ref="lunt-william"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef>, who was coming to pay me a visit, but
							turned back and returned home. Between <persRef ref="miller-edward">M<hi

								<persRef ref="foster-frances">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

						<p><persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> sent me this morning a

							of 300 Letters from <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef> from 12 May 1774 to
							16. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1801. This is a sequel to the
							previous publication by him of my mother’s Letters to my father and
							others, made about this time last year in one duodecimo volume, and of
							which the second and third edition in two volumes, are already nearly
							exhausted. An excellent memoir of my mother’s life, precedes the
							collection of her Letters; and a short but very judicious preface
							accompanies this second compilation— In the interval between the two,
								<persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Caroline Amelia De Windt</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-abigail">my
								Sister’s</persRef> only daughter, of Cedar grove Fishkill Landing,

							and France, together with a memoir of the life of her husband <persRef
								ref="smith-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> William
								Stephens Smith</persRef>, and a few Letters to her from him and from
							other persons. These volumes have brought our family into public notice
							more than they ever had been before, and impose upon all those of us who
							survive, or who may hereafter bear the name a redoubled obligation, if
							not to prove worthy of it, at least to preserve it from disgrace by vice
							or crime. The weather continued sultry, with successive showers till
							this afternoon towards the setting of the Sun when it cleared up with
							promise of a cool fair day to morrow— I called at the Quincy Stone bank,
							and deposited the draft of 400 dollars from the Bank of the Metropolis
							at Washington, upon the Merchants Bank in Boston; and we all, that is,
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, my daughter
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John

								Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.
								Smith</persRef>, dined with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and his family on the hill— They were
							disappointed in the company they had expected from Boston, <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="downing-andrew;dewindt-caroline2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Andrew Jackson
								Downing</persRef> of Newburgh in the State of New-York. We took tea
							and spent the Evening also at Charles’s house—where in the course of the
							evening, <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>
							came in with her brother the passed midshipman Joseph Harrod. I made out
							this day to recover one day of my journal’s arrears— My excusatory
							Letter, to invitations from Colleges, Lyceums and other Literary
							Associations which I had left unanswered was published in the National
							Intelligencer on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> inst<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> that I left Washington— On the same day
							was published in the same paper the Letter of <persRef
								ref="badger-george">George E. Badger</persRef>, late Secretary of
							the Navy, assigning his reasons for resigning that office— In that
							Journal, of the next day appeared a Letter from <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>John Bell</persRef>, the late Secretary of War, with a statement of
							facts, for the same exculpatory purpose on his part.— Two Letters from
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, Secretary of
							State, one to the <persRef ref="gales-joseph;seaton-william"
								>Editors</persRef> of the Intelligencer, and the other to <persRef
								ref="ketchum-hiram">Hiram Ketchum</persRef> of New York, have
							assigned to the public his reasons for not resigning his office— The

							but its inevitable result will be the total overthrow of the whig party
							throughout the union. Victrix causa Dis placuit.</p>

							that Religion, is a reasonable thing, and no evidence of insanity, in

							to prove that, but it was urged with much earnestness by the preacher—
							Not however with much reference to the Laws of Nature and of human

								>Newton</persRef>, <persRef ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef>,

							“commence with parade[”]—and <persRef ref="martin-gregory"

							breakfasted with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, at his

							volume a Treatise on the theory and practice of Landscape gardening,
							adapted to North-America; with a view of the improvement of country
							residences: containing historical notices and general principles of the
							art, directions for laying out grounds, and arranging plantations, the
							description and cultivation of hardy trees, decorative accompaniments to
							the house and grounds, the formation of pieces of Artificial water,
							flower gardens &amp;c with remarks on Rural Architecture, illustrated by
							engravings— This book he did me the honour of dedicating to me. M<hi

								<persRef ref="dewindt-john">John Peter De Windt</persRef>, and of
								<persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">Caroline Amelia</persRef>, only

								<persRef ref="smith-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								William Stephen Smith</persRef>—</p>
						<p>This morning I had a visit from our aged Minister, <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef>, my junior by four years at Harvard University
							where he entered the same year, that I was graduated 1787—now 72 years
							old, 40 of which he has been settled as pastor of the first, and until
							within a few years the only congregational religious Society in Quincy.
							His present condition is a memento to me of my own— All his physical
							senses failing, he still attempts occasionally to preach, and stumbles
							through his service as he can— The duties of the office are performed by
							his colleague, <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef>. This afternoon <persRef
								ref="freeman-russell">Russell Freeman</persRef> came out from Boston
							with <persRef ref="adams-george5">George Adams</persRef>, brother of
								<persRef ref="adams-joseph6">Joseph T. Adams</persRef>, sometime
							Editor of the Boston Centinel, and now a hopeless applicant for office
							at Washington. Freeman has been a constant applicant for re-appointment
							as Collector of the Customs at New-Bedford, ever since he was removed
							from it in the first year of the reign of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Andrew Jackson</persRef>— It has been ever since in faithless
							hands, and has been now recently trusted to others probably not more
							trustworthy— Freeman is very indignant, but still more imploring— He
							came in search of encouragement to go again to Washington, having
							already been there twice since the downfall of the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> Administration, and
							resided the weeks each time, and as he says at an expense of near 500
							dollars— I advised him not to go, and assured him, that if he should he
							would meet with nothing but disappointment— He shifted his trumpet; but
							did not take snuff— I saw the Sun rise and set from Charles’s house; the
							Southern declination already too great, rising and setting 7 minutes
							after and before 6. I met <persRef ref="palfrey-john">D<hi

								ref="palfrey-mary">his wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="palfrey-sara;palfrey-hannah">two daughters</persRef> coming
							down the hill from Charles’s, returning to Boston— The <persRef

								Cornell</persRef>, heretofore pastor of the orthodox, so called
							congregational church in this town, and now teacher of a private school
							visited me this morning—he is also this year President of the Quincy
							Lyceum, and came to invite me to deliver the introductory Lecture before
							that Institution, in the last week of next Month, or the first or second
							week in November to the course for the winter—which I agreed to do. In
							the summer of 1835. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cornell a graduate
							of Brown University then very recently settled as the first minister of
							the Calvinistic church, just before erected, in the overflowings of
							missionary zeal wrote some strictures upon the moral and religious
							character of the inhabitants of Quincy at which the felt themselves much
							aggrieved and they held two town meetings and appointed a committee of
							which I was chairman to vindicate their good name— They had a
							correspondence with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell from which he
							extricated himself as well as he could; and the Committee reported
							resolutions, accepted by the town, declaring the imputations cast upon
							them by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell slanderous— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell’s conduct throughout that
							transaction, was not more remarkable for candour than for Christian
							charity—but he continued to preach Calvinism a year of two longer. He
							then discovered that the performance of his pastoral duties was
							unpropitious to his health, resigned his office and opened a private
							school, which he still keeps, with good reputation, and some success— He
							says he has now forty scholars and the aid of an assistant.— It was
							through him, and at my recommendation that <persRef ref="wood-henry2"
								>Henry Wood’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="wood-william6">son</persRef>, obtained admission this year
							as a Cadet at the United States Military Academy at West-Point— Since
							his retirement from the clerical profession, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cornell has associated himself with the democracy as they
							call themselves, and by their means once attempted to obtain a vote of
							the town to expunge from the town records the resolutions of 1835.
							against his pious calumnies— He has also had aspirations to election as
							a representative of the town in the State Legislature— During the whole
							of this time he has fawned upon me, and acted with the party hostile to
							me. He often invites me to visit his school, and I actually attended one
							of his exhibitions last Spring— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell
							is a worldly minded Saint—a character in no wise rare— I walked over the
							hills this afternoon, and under a large, sound, beautiful black oak tree
							found, fallen from their cups on the ground, about a pint pot full of
							acorns. I have been many years endeavouring to gather acorns from this
							tree, and have never been able to find any sound ones before— A parcel
							of boys were at the same time gathering shagbark walnuts from the trees
							in a row with my superb Oak— I did not disturb them in their pilfering,
							for there is a sort of Yankey common Law, which gives up hickory nuts as
							lawful spoils for the boys!— <persRef key="adams-charles2"

						<p>What a transition it is, from the bustle and excitement, diversified in
							its objects from day to day, during a Session of Congress at Washington,
							and the stagnant green surfaced pool of life, in this rural retreat!— I
							have been this whole day without the interruption of one visitor— At
							evening twilight I walked up the hill, to see <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and his family, and he and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> afterwards came,
							and passed the remainder of the evening with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>.— I have brought up the
							arrears of this Diary, and with pressing necessary occupations
							especially of correspondence, an irresistible impulse continually
							entices me away, like the hare in his race with the tortoise, sometimes
							into flowery, often into thorny paths, till night overtakes me, with the
							proper business still to do, and time wasted in idleness— I have a
							passion for writing in verse, and want invention for fixing upon a
							subject— I awoke this morning, just before the old clock, in the entry
							adjoining my bed-chamber, struck four— I strain’d from hard bound brains
							eight lines an hour, and when the Clock struck five, which from the
							intensity of toil in working up the Stanza, seemed scarcely an interval
							of ten minutes, I rose, and upon lighting my lamp with a friction match,
							I sat down and wrote out the stanza— I discovered that it was nonsense!
							This frequently happens to me, and is very discouraging.— I read ten
							Letters each morning of the new collection published by my Son, and this
							evening I read some of the miscellaneous collection published by my
							niece <persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Caroline Amelia De Windt</persRef>— Her book is dedicated to me, and
							contains one Letter from me to her, and several from <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>—with part of <persRef
								ref="smith-abigail">my Sisters</persRef> journal while she was first
							in Europe, and Letters to her from <persRef ref="smith-william">her
								husband</persRef> on his excursion from London to Spain and Portugal
							in 1787. This afternoon by way of exercise, I went over to the farm
							house to search for documents of my own composition among the books and
							papers transmitted last Summer from Washington. I found only a chaotic
							mass, of pamphlets and consumed the time till day light disappeared, in
							unavailing efforts to separate them into some kind of order— I wrote a
							Letter of five lines to <persRef ref="sampson-schuyler">Schuyler
								Sampson</persRef> at Plymouth, enclosing one from the Commissioner
							of Pensions <persRef ref="edwards-james">James L. Edwards</persRef>
							concerning a claim to a Pension of <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goddard</persRef> widow of a <persRef
								ref="goddard-john">Surgeon</persRef> in the Navy, who died in 1803—
							At the close of evening I looked into the first volume of <persRef
								ref="rousseau-jean">Rousseau’s</persRef> Nouvelle Héloïse, for the
							Letter containing the sneer upon the Science of blazonry—found it in the
							second and twentieth Letter, skim’d over all that preceded to
								<unclear>fi</unclear>nd it— I first read this book when I was twelve
							years old and did not understand it— I read it again at 16. and thought
							the most exquisite portraiture of love that ever was written. It looks
							to me now like an ugly caricature.</p>

						<p>Heavy rain last evening and almost the whole night through— This was the
							day of the monthly Meeting of the Massachusetts historical Society,
							which it was my design to have attended—but the sky was so overcast with
							clouds and so threatening that I gave up the visit to Boston, and passed
							another quiet uninterrupted day, till towards evening, when I walked to
							see <persRef ref="greenleaf-john;greenleaf-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and<hi rend="superscript"> </hi>M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> John Greenleaf</persRef>, and their eldest daughter
								<persRef ref="dawes-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lucy
								Dawes</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf is nearly
							80 years of age, 70 or more of which he has been totally blind; and for
							several years past he has been losing by degrees the sense of hearing—
							His wife was Lucy Cranch, second daughter of <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">my Mother’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="cranch-mary2">elder sister</persRef>. She was born at
							Salem in September 1767. two months after me— They have both been for
							years with scarcely a spider’s thread hold upon life, but are now in
							health, much improved over that in which I saw them last Spring.
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> were here this evening; but
							he left us to pay a visit to <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>— There was a bare
							sprinkling of rain this afternoon and it cleared off for a Sunset
							promising fair for to-morrow— <persRef ref="green-john3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John A. Green</persRef> sent me for
							revisal a slip of the Quincy Patriot for next Saturday, with about a
							third part of my Speech in H.R.U.S. on the <persRef
								ref="mcleod-alexander">M’Leod</persRef> Resolution, for my revisal.
							He came for it late this evening, and I returned it to him— I read this
							morning ten of <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Letters
							to my mother written in 1775 and 1776. and this evening I finished
							reading those in the volume published by <persRef ref="dewindt-caroline"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De Windt</persRef>. The latter,
							none of which I had before seen affected me beyond measure— If ever
							there were angels upon earth they were my mother and <persRef
								ref="smith-abigail">my sister</persRef>— If ever an Archangel it was
							my mother— The Letters to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De Windt
							herself are among the most precious of the collection— Taking the
							series, from that of 5. October 1761. to <persRef ref="storer-hannah"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> H. Lincoln</persRef>, to that
							of 23. March 1818. to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De Windt, a period
							of 57. years, and what a life do they display—from 17. to 74—the last
							written but 7. months before she died.— The virgin daughter—the
							friend—the wife—the sister—the mother, the grandmother—the neighbour—the
							stranger—the Patriot—the Christian; is there a relation between human
							beings, of which a perfect model might not be drawn by analysing the
							composition of these Letters?— How small by their side are those of
								<persRef ref="derabutin-marie">Madame de Sevigné</persRef>, all
							charming as they are, or those of <persRef ref="montagu-mary">Lady Mary
								Wortley Montague</persRef>, sprightly and intelligent, but cold
							hearted and sarcastic as they are— And how comprehensive—how
							energetic—how profound are the Letters of my father! They overawe me— I
							dare not turn upon them a critical eye— Take the three compilations
							together, and the English language cannot shew their parallel— Will my
							country understand them?— I began a Letter in answer to <persRef
								ref="grace-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grace</persRef>.</p>
