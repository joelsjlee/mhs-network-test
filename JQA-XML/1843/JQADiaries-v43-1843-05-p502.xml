						<p>The last day before departure</p>
						<p>Always busy, agitating, anxious, and as years advance every time it
							happens more confusing than the last— As I am this time to travel alone
							I concluded to take with me but one trunk and an umbrella— Hesitating
							about the last article, so often needed for shelter from rain or sun;
							but so liable to be lost, stolen or broken by the way, that about twice
							out of three times mine is missing at my journey’s end— This days
							occupation with aid of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-isaac">nephew</persRef> was
							packing up my chest of books and pamphlets and my files of Letters for
							the last two years to be shipped by the first coaster to Boston, and my
							strong trunk to be taken with me— <persRef ref="heap-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Heap</persRef> called on me this
							morning, and I returned him his papers, but partly read: He told me he
							was going by the Cars to-morrow morning, without prospect of any further
							public employment, and equally unwilling to seek and hopeless to obtain
							further personal access to <persRef ref="tyler-john">President
								Tyler</persRef> or <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary
								Webster</persRef>— I received a note from <persRef
								ref="page-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page</persRef> the
							Daguerrotype artist requesting me to call again this day as he was not
							satisfied with the shades taken on Saturday— I did call accordingly
							twice, and he took my similitude twice but neither time with much
							success. At one time he and <persRef ref="west-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> West</persRef> took two impressions of
							me at one sitting, upon two camera obscura’s standing side by side, and
							shewing the face as by two different angles of refraction. I stop’d at
								<persRef ref="keyworth-robert">Keyworth’s</persRef> and took my old
							silver sleeve buttons relinked after fifteen years of wear— I paid my
							last visit to <persRef ref="burnell-barker">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Burnell</persRef> with whom I found as usual <persRef
								ref="burnell-judith">his faithful wife and Nurse</persRef>— They

							embark in the Vandalia Sloop of War to be landed at Chagres thence to
							traverse by land the Isthmus to Panama, and thence to proceed in some
							vessel of our Pacific Squadron to the seat of his mission to the Hawaÿan
							Islands. I walked on to the Capitol and there received from <persRef

							the last sheet of the House journal of the recent Session, and from
							young <persRef ref="u">Cutts</persRef> two or three other Documents; but
							neither the Senate Journal of the last Session; nor the collective house
							documents of the preceding Session the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>

						<dateline>Washington Tuesday 2. May 1843. Baltimore— Sydenham</dateline>
						<p><date>2— IV.30. </date>Tuesday</p>
						<p>At 6. O’Clock this morning I left the City of Washington in the train of
							Cars for Baltimore— My nephew <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull
								Adams</persRef> accompanied me to the Railway depot; remaining here
							to come on with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Adams</persRef> and her daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef> in June. At the Cars I met <persRef
								ref="heap-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heap</persRef> who
							came on only as far as Baltimore <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Williams</persRef> of the army. <persRef ref="newhall-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Newhall</persRef> of Lynn, and sundry
							others who claimed I have no doubt justly, old acquaintance, but whom I
							do not even now recollect— The morning was clear and fine but cold and
							there was a white-frost on the ground till we had passed beyond
							Bladensburg— We reached Baltimore, about a quarter past 8.—and alighting
							from the Cars, walked immediately to the Steam boat wharf and step’d on
							board the Steamer Constitution, <persRef ref="chaytor-james">Captain
								Chaytor</persRef>. I think it was over 6. years since I had seen
							him, and his skin hung about him like an old lady’s loose gown— I asked
							him if he had been sick—he said no—he was drying up— He had within the
							last four years, dried off sixty pounds of flesh and I have no doubt he
							weighs that much less than he did the last time I made a passage in his
							boat— I scarcely ever saw such a change; and his face looks like a wet
							cloth ill laid up. In the steamer I saw for a moment the Secretary of
							the U.S. Senate <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickens</persRef>,
							but he was about to return to Washington; <persRef ref="russell-david"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef> of the
							interior of the State of New-York; a member of two or three Congresses
							including the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> now returning home from
							Washington, where he told me he saw yesterday <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> at the Department of State—and he told him he
							intended to retire from the Department within ten days. <persRef
								ref="sanderson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sanderson</persRef> the first publisher of the biography of the
							signers of the declaration of Independence; a work of which the first
							expense was very heavy upon him, and which he was upwards of 5 years in
							getting through, but of which he afterwards sold the property and the
							plates, and of which more than twenty Editions have now been published,
							and the plates have been four times renewed. The last edition is in one
							octavo volume— Sanderson, said he now kept a public house, in Chesnut
							Street Philadelphia—the Franklin house, where he would be glad to see
							me— There was also in the boat <persRef ref="u">Captain Payne</persRef>
							of the Navy and his Sister—and a <persRef ref="fessenden-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fessenden</persRef>, who said he lived
							at Jamaica Plains, and was now a constituent of mine— We reached
							French-town at half past 1. then came in the railway cars in 50 minutes
							to Newcastle, and thence in the Steamer Robert Morris to Philadelphia—at
							half past 4. I took chamber N. 16. at <persRef ref="jones-john10"
								>Jones’s</persRef> Union Hotel Chesnut Street— In a quarter of an
							hour more in <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richard Rush’s</persRef> carriage, with his Son <persRef
								ref="rush-benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef>, I came out to Sydenham, his
							residence, dined with him and a party of his friends, and agreed at his
							kind and hospitable invitation to pass the Night here— I retired soon
							after 11. O’Clock.</p>

							Sovereigns, Monarchical or popular always will deal with corporation
							property— The dividends now made are only the proceeds of sales of the
							Company’s property— The Legislature gave them the alternative of having
							another bridge built close at the side of their own, or of surrendering
							their charter for a compensation of about 75 per cent of the par value
							of their stock which was at 30 per cent advance in the market, that is
							they gave them about half the value of their stock, as a consideration
							for not taking away the whole, by another parallel bridge— After long

							I found at last with the help of a young Quaker whom I met in the
							Street, and after all it was the old Office which I had visited at least
							ten times.— He paid me three dividends amounting to 96. dollars, by a
							check on the Philadelphia Bank— Another search for that, which I found
							with <persRef ref="toland-george">George W. Toland</persRef> whom I met
							twice in the street; first with <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">S. D.

						<dateline>Philadelphia Thursday 4. May 1843. New-York— Steamer
							Cleopatra.</dateline>
						<p><date>4. V. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>There are two lines of daily conveyance— One, departing at 7. in the
							morning, which after crossing the river to Camden proceeds to Amboy by
							the Railway to Amboy, and thence in a Steamboat to New-York—arriving
							there between 2 and 3 O’Clock P.M. The other, crossing the river at 9.
							and proceeding by the Railway to the Ferry at Powle’s hook, or Jersey
							city, and arriving at New-York between 3 and 4 P.M— I had determined to
							take the early line, and for that purpose rose at 5. and wrote till past
							6. then breakfasted alone; but being visited while at breakfast by an
							old ex member of Congress whose name I did not remember was delayed till
							I had scanty time to reach the wharf— My trunk carried in a hand cart by
							a man from the hotel but I missed my way, and going first to the chesnut
							Street and thence to the market street wharf, finally returning to the
							true walnut street wharf saw the ferry-boat move off from it and lost my
							passage to Camden— The carrier from <persRef ref="jones-john10"
								>Jones’s</persRef> had just turned round with his cart and was
							taking my trunk back to the hotel, when by a short race I overtook him,
							and made him lodge my trunk in the corner room where the ticket office
							is kept, and it being a public house, engaged a chamber till the next
							boat should go. had my trunk taken up in the chamber; and there finished
							writing the journal of yesterday.— I thus avoided the ennui and waste of
							two lost hours of time and how many such hours I might have saved had I
							throughout my life resorted to similar expedients— Nine O’Clock came and
							I had lost no time, and made no arrears of journal— Crossing the river
							to Camden I met <persRef ref="furness-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Furness</persRef> the Unitarian Minister escorting
								<persRef ref="u;u">two of his nieces named Osborne</persRef>, who
							were returning from a visit of some weeks to him, to their home in
							Connecticut—he introduced them to me, and recommended them to my
							attentions.— He left them seated in the Cars, and I took a seat near
							them. I met too in the boat a man by the name of <persRef ref="u"
								>Bradshaw</persRef> a native of Massachusetts, who claimed old
							acquaintance with me, and charged me with having forgotten him, which
							was true, but which I promised him, should not happen again— In the Cars
							also there was <persRef ref="whitney-sophia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Whitney</persRef>, wife of one of <persRef
								ref="whitney-john3">my neighbours</persRef> going home from a visit
							to her daughter— The cars rolled steadyly and smoothly on to the ferry
							boat at Jersey city, on crossing which to New-York, a <persRef ref="u"
								>young man</persRef> a brother of the two young Ladies met them and
							escorted them to the Steamer Cleopatra bound to Norwich, in which I also
							<unclear>engagement?</unclear> was finally to embark— My trunk had been first shipped in
							the Steamer Rhode Island bound to Stonington, lying on the other side of
							the wharf I walked round the battery and to the exchange, where I paid a
							visit to <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">Lewis Tappan</persRef>, who
							introduced to me the <persRef ref="raymond-william2">Rev<hi

						<p>From my visit to <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Lee</persRef> of Philadelphia claiming old acquaintance which I
							remembered not, and a <persRef ref="parker-john9">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John G. Parker</persRef> who
							introduced himself to me, as thankful for very great obligations which I
							had equally forgotten— He said he was a native of Massachusetts but had

							groundless suspicion of being actively concerned in the insurrection
							against the British Government and sent to England for trial. That a
							number of Gentlemen here had signed a representation in his favour, to
								<persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fox</persRef> the British Minister at Washington; which he had
							transmitted to his Government, and in consequence of which he Parker had
							been discharged— My name he said was signed among others to the
							representation, and he was happy to have this opportunity to thank me
							for the favour.— Un bienfait n est jamais perdu— How delightful it is to
							discover that you have rendered happy grateful hearts, by good offices,
							not even remembered by yourself— The weather was so fine, and the sea so
							smooth that the motion of the boat was scarcely perceptib while she was
							going at least 12 miles an hour. Supper came, which I made to answer for
							my dinner, and about 8. O’Clock I turned in to my berth N. 69, which the
							Captain had assigned to me as one of the best in the boat.— After about
							5 hours of sound and quiet sleep I awoke soon after one this morning,
							arose, dressed, washed and was shaved, and went on the deck where I
							found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams just ready to land with
							his son at New London— He took leave of me with a kind invitation, to
							his house, if I should ever come there again— The sky was cloudless, and
							the Great and Little Bear, the Scorpion, Balance and Sagittary, the
							Lyre, Eagle and Dolphin all splendid overhed, but when we landed at
							Norwich at 1/2 past 2—it was already beclouded. We had barely time to

						<p>I have accepted an invitation from the Massachusetts historical Society,
							to deliver on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month a
							discourse before them, on the second centennial anniversary of the
							confederation of the New-England Colonies, and I have come here without
							and before my family, for the purpose of preparing it— I have paid so
							little attention to that portion of our history that I scarcely knew the
							sources at which the principal facts relating to it were to be found—nor
							have I any clue to the aspect in which it should be viewed for any
							useful purpose at the present time— <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope</persRef> makes it a point of self-glorification, that not in
							fancy’s maze he wander’d long, but stoop’d to truth and moraliz’d his
							song— I believe that moral principle should be the alpha and omega, of
							all human composition—poetry or prose scientific or literary written or
							spoken—and emphatically of every discourse An Epic Poem, a Drama,
							Pastoral, Georgic or Fable, Ode, Sonnet or epigram should alike spring
							from one vital seminal principle of morals and so should every History
							Dissertation, Treatise, Discourse or epistle— Pen should never be put to
							paper, but for the discharge of some duty to God or man— How then shall
							I best discharge the duty which I have undertaken of discoursing to my
							co-associates of the historical Society, and to my fellow Citizens on
							the New-England Confederation of 1643? What was that confederation—its
							uses, its origin, its history, its termination—its influence upon the
							colonies, between whom it was formed; upon their relations with the
							Indians, with the other English Colonies, with England the mother
							Country, with the neighbouring Colonies of other Countries; and with the
							rest of mankind?—and from the result of all these enquiries what sound
							and useful moral principle can be deduced for the entertainment and

						<p><persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> preached this morning, from 1. Corinthians
							1.18—The whole verse reads “For the preaching of the cross is to them
							that perish foolishness: but unto us which are saved, it is the power of
							God”— But the text was only “The preaching of the cross, is the power of
							God,” and the sermon was a most ingenious and deeply pathetic
							declamation upon the power of the cross, as a symbol of the sufferings
							of Christ, and of the doctrines of Christianity— The use of this symbol,
							has been of the sharpest points of controvery between the Roman Catholic
							and Protestant Churches.— It has been heretofore a source of much
							internal dissension in the episcopal church of England, and is even now
							revived with ominous agitation both in England and here— It extends even
							beyond the bounds of the episcopal church, and I was somewhat surprised
							at the vivacity and zeal with which D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham seems to have entered into it— Certain it is that the
							writings of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef>, from which the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> cited
							several most impressive passages, countenance a reverence for the cross,
							which endangers the indulgence of idolatry, as all substitution of
							attachment to the symbol for the love of the object represented, is
							prone to do— Of these trappings of Roman Catholic worship the Church of
							England has discarded many and retained more than enough— She has
							retained the sign of the cross only in the administration of the rite of
							baptism, where it is made by the finger of the priest over the forehead
							of the infant, leaving no trace of it behind— But there is at this very
							moment a bitter struggle in the episcopal church of England to return to
							the emblematic worship of popery— There was a passage at the close of
							the Doctor’s discourse, which alluded without censure to the Roman
							Catholic worship of the <persRef ref="mary">virgin mother of
								Christ</persRef>, which belongs to the same School of the adoration
							of the cross— After the morning service, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham administered the communion with admirable and affecting
							solemnity— I came home through a shower of heavy thunder and sharp
							Lightening with a mere sprinkling of rain— After dinner D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothinghams text was from the words
							“whose seed was in itself” from Genesis 1.11. The discourse as usual;
							ingenious, fanciful, and copious of analogies with a touch of gentle
							interrogation, as to the value or efficiency of religious missions to
							distant foreign lands— After church I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence</persRef>, who invited me to dine with him on Tuesday.
								<persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Miss Harriet Welsh</persRef> took tea
							here— And with <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> I spent the Evening

						<p>On awaking this morning I found my sore throat, hoarseness and catarrh
							returned upon me in all its severity, and in sitting down to write my
							hand shaking so that it was with extreme difficulty that I could hold my
							pen; yet my only labour under the sun is writing, as I have little time
							to spare in preparation for the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I
							devoted all the early morning to <persRef ref="hazard-ebenezer"
								>Hazard’s</persRef> collection of the records of the United Colonies
							of New-England— They extend from the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of May 1643 to the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March 1678—35
							years—including the Colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut and
							New-Haven. Rhode Island applied for admission to the confederacy but was
							refused. During its continuance New-Haven was merged into the Colony of
							Connecticut; after which the Confederate Colonies were but 3.— From the
							beginning there were only two Commissioners for each Colony; at first
							annually chosen, for yearly meetings; but of later time meeting only
							once in three years— The records occupy three fourths of a large quarto
							volume; but as I have to consult many other sources of information, I
							skimmed over the whole surface of this compilation, and could of course
							pry deep into nothing— Yet the morning was gone, and I had yesterday’s
							journal yet to write; which I nevertheless did accomplish— I then
							sallied forth and at N. 220. Washington Street found my old shaver of
							last fall, by the name of <persRef ref="cadmus-william">Cadmus</persRef>, after
							passing through whose hands, I went to the Emancipator Office, and had a
							long conversation with <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef>— He is to embark
							next Tuesday in the Steamer for Liverpool, to attend as a delegate from
							the American, Anti-Slavery Society the second triennial meeting of the
							World’s convention, for the promotion of the abolition of Slavery and
							the Slave trade throughout the Earth— I urged him very earnestly to
							observe with unremitting care the movements of the British Government
							with regard to Mexico and Texas— I told him I distrusted them
							altogether— I believed their real policy far from desiring to favour the
							abolition of Slavery either in our Southern States, or in Texas. I
							suspect on the contrary, that for a suitable equivalent they will
							readily acquiesce both in the annexation of Texas to this Union, and to
							the perpetuation of Slavery here to weaken and to rule us.— <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.
								Brooks</persRef> and <persRef ref="brooks-peter2">his Son</persRef>,

							and I began at a perfect hazard to write my discourse.</p>

						<p>The Catarhh has become feverish, and cruelly torturing— I was twice up in
							the Night before the time for rising came; and this whole day I have
							been upon the rack— I find it difficult to sustain my Spirits and have
							concluded to go out to Quincy next Monday— As my first and most
							indispensable object is to be prepared for the discourse of the 29<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> I find it necessary to begin the day
							with writing upon it— I wrote accordingly and wasted the morning until
							Noontide without coming to any point upon which I can dilate, to fill up
							the time necessary for the delivery The confederacy of the New-England
							Colonies was a system of concert between the several jurisdictions, for
							the common defence against the French colonial establishments at the
							North—the Dutch at the South but especially, and above all against the
							Indians— Shortly before noon, I went locked myself up in the chambers of
							the historical Society, and searched for notices of Indian wars and the
							New England confederacy— I soon found abundance of materials for
							enquiry, and spent nearly three hours in search, rather for the sources
							of information than in the examination of what I found— I had no time
							for that— It was some time before I detected the history of the War with
								<persRef ref="metacom">Philip</persRef>—Sachem of Mount Hope— It
							forms the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> book of <persRef
								ref="mather-cotton">Mather’s</persRef> Magnalia— This work deserves
							great consideration as a sample of the literary, political, moral and
							religious condition of the New-England colonies at that time— It is a
							collection of biographical anecdotes; a nauseous panegyric upon all the
							principal founders civil and ecclesiastical of the New England colonial
							settlements. With a history of Harvard College, and a narrative of
							Indian wars, down to the close of the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							century— The Style is pedantic; motley coloured with perpetual allusions
							to the bible, and to the Hebrew, Greek, Latin and English Poets— Among
							the rest, I was surprised to meet a quotation from the Paradise Lost— I
							found also numerous articles relating to the Pequot, Mohegan, and
							Narragansett tribes of Indians—upon all which my discourse should have
							been preceded by a regular and systematic six months course of reading,
							for which I have less than three weeks— After 2 I came home and went and
							dined with <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Abbott Lawrence</persRef>. Besides <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine"
								>his family</persRef>, there were his Sister <persRef

								<persRef ref="u">Miss Leslie</persRef> the <persRef
								ref="leslie-charles">painter’s</persRef> Sister, and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thacher</persRef> of Bangor—

						<p>A much disturbed night succeeded by an uncomfortable and unprofitable
							day— After a visit to <persRef ref="cadmus-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cadmus</persRef> the barber, I called at <persRef ref="foster-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef> and
							saw <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								ref="foster-elizabeth2">Elizabeth</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="foster-louisa">Louisa</persRef> and <persRef ref="foster-mary"
								>Mary</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster was not at
							home, and <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> was gone
							to Medford.— <persRef ref="felt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Felt</persRef> had agreed to meet me at 11. O’Clock this morning at
							the Secretary’s Office in the State house— But I had misunderstood him
							that he would call at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef>
							house for me, and would go with me.— After waiting for him till near
							noon I went to the State house to the room which he formerly occupied,
							when employed in collecting in volumes, and indexing the records of the
							general Courts, and the archives of the State. But this office has been
							suppressed since the first of March.— He was not there and I came home.
							He was at the same time in the Secretary’s Office where I neglected to
							call and enquire for him— He was informed that I had been to the other
							office after him and he then came to Charles’s and accompanied me to the
							Secretary’s Office— I examined the volume of Records containing the
							proceedings of the Commissioners of the United Colonies of New-England—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Felt made two extracts for me; but I
							found little, other than what is printed in <persRef
								ref="hazard-ebenezer">Hazard’s</persRef> collections, and the
							manuscript writing of that age is so difficult for me to read that I
							shall obtain little or no assistance from these original records— One of
							the extracts is a vote of the general Court of 8. Sept<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1642. appointing a numerous Committee of
							Magistrates and deputies, to treat with any Commissioners from Plymouth,
							Connecticut or New-Haven [“]about the Union and concerning avoiding any
							danger of the Indians—and to have power to do herein what they shall
							find needful for common safety and peace, so as they enter not into an
							offensive War without order of this Court.”— So that the primary object
							of the Union was the common defence against the Indians— I was able to
							write only a few lines of my address this day; and at one O’Clock with
							my Son and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> with their
							son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John</persRef> we took up <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.
								Brooks</persRef> at his Office, and went out and dined with <persRef
								ref="brooks-gorham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gorham
								Brooks</persRef> and <persRef ref="shepherd-ellen">his
								wife</persRef> at Medford— This day was pleasant, but with an
							easterly wind, and its cold bath temperature, peculiar to this region at
							this Season of the year— After dinner we walked round M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C. Brooks’s garden, just beginning to
							give signs of vegetable life— The desolation of winter still heavy upon
							it— About Sunset we returned to the City and received notes of
							invitation from <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef>, for this
							Evening— We had engagements already at <persRef ref="parker-samuel">M
								Samuel D. Parker’s</persRef> my Son’s next door neighbour; but I was
							so unwell that an excuse was sent into M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Parker’s, and I wait for to morrow to apologize to M<hi

							lives in a large and elegant house a life of ease and indolence, without

								Lunt</persRef> of Quincy called to see me and spoke of the very
							sudden decease in the course of the late winter of his aged Colleague
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">Peter Whitney</persRef>— I passed the

								ref="minerva">Minerva</persRef> upon my address for the historical
							Society, unable even to get through with my daily task of two pages, and
							seeing as yet no point of departure for the discourse. hitherto I
							stumble one after another upon preliminary points of doubtful propriety
							to the occasion and more doubtful adaptation to the taste and prejudices
							of the day.— I find continual occasion to resort to books which I have
							not at hand— In discussing a confederacy of New England Colonies the
							subject leads to remarks upon the propriety of the name upon the special
							sympathies with the condition and characteristic properties of the
							mother Country old England and to a comparative notice of the elementary
							composition of the other colonies which now constitute jointly with us
							the North American Union. This has already brought me upon debatable
							ground, and upon the accursed domain of Slavery. What shall I do with
							it? I am upon the breakers, and know not how to draw off from them— The
							relations of the Colonies with the Indians also constitute another shoal
							which I have not yet reached but upon which I shall be in imminent
							danger of stranding.— I can scarcely express how in my weakened
							condition these thoughts weigh me down.</p>

								ref="quincy-eliza2">his eldest daughter</persRef> called to visit
							us, and the day was assiduously, but very unsatisfactorily occupied in
							search reading and writing upon my task— I am still on the preliminaries
							of my subject—still struggling for some heart of argument, not already
							fagged into common-place— My first spring of thought has been to
							discriminate between the Colonies of New-England, and the others which
							constitute our present confederate Government— In commenting upon this I
							meet the necessity of knowing, exactly the primitive titles of the
							several New-England Colonies— <persRef ref="felt-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Felt</persRef> has lent me a volume
							published at Hartford in 1836. by <persRef ref="hinman-royal">R. R.
								Hinman</persRef> Secretary of the State of Connecticut, consisting
							of Letters from the kings and Queens of England, to the Governors of the
							Colony of Connecticut, with their answers from 1635. to 1749— Much of
							this day was consumed in turning over the leaves of this book, to trace
							the origin of the colony of Connecticut, which is yet left to be
							accomplished— I found it also necessary to examine the first Volume of
								<persRef ref="hazard-ebenezer">Hazard’s</persRef> State Papers, but
							had not time to look into it— After labouring till close upon one
							O’Clock in this alternation of reading and writing, I went to M<hi

							the keys of the historical Society’s chambers. I found M<hi

							chambers when I was obliged to return home to dinner. Charles dined at
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s— After dinner I wrote
							the journal of yesterday— Then read the remainder of <persRef

						<p>There is no abatement of my Catarrhal cough, although there is some of
							the symptoms of other diseases with which it is complicated— I slept
							last night till the crepuscular dawn, which is now about half past 3 in
							the morning, and then awoke under a load which the racking cough of half
							an hour could only lighten but not cast off— It continued through the
							day without sign of mollification. I wrote with heavy heart and drooping
							spirits the journal yesterday—and then a Letter to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, which I could not
							even enliven with fancies to please her, as a man ought always to do in
							writing to his wife— <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> paid me a second
							visit and I gave him the diagnostics of my present condition— His advice
							is still, ale and good living. I had a long visit from <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua
								Leavitt</persRef>— Long conversation with him. He is to embark next
							Tuesday in the Steamer Britannia, to attend the second triennial world’s
							convention to promote the abolition of Slavery throughout the world to
							be held next month in London— I urged him to make close observations, so
							far as he should have opportunity, to ascertain the real policy of the
							British Government on this subject; entertaining as I do strong doubts
							of a compromise between their commercial and their moral policy, much
							too obsequious to the cause of Slavery for real fidelity to the cause of
							justice and of man— I desired him to say to <persRef ref="buffum-arnold"
								>Arnold Buffum</persRef>, and to <persRef ref="sturge-joseph">Joseph
								Sturge</persRef> from me, that I intended to have written to each of
							them by him; but am prevented by my indisposition— And I intreated him
							as long as he should be there to keep his eye fixed upon Texas, Mexico,
							California, and especially on the Island of Cuba. He intimated to me
							that he intended as appropriate to his character he intended to bring
							before the Convention for consideration certain primary principles
							asserting the personal rights of men as always transcending the
							corporate right of Sovereignty— As I was going out I met at the door
								<persRef ref="downes-john;downes-maria">Commodore and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Downes</persRef> coming to visit
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">daughter</persRef>— Downes told me he did not
							know I was in the City. After shaving I went to the chambers of the
							historical Society where I found neither <persRef ref="church-benjamin"
								>Church’s</persRef> history of <persRef ref="metacom"
								>Philip’s</persRef> War, nor <persRef ref="adair-james"
								>Adair’s</persRef> history of the Indians which I wanted, but I did
							find an original edition of <persRef ref="smith-john13">John
								Smith’s</persRef> history—and a collection of Old Colony Documents
							recently published by <persRef ref="young-alexander">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander Young</persRef>. I had but a
							short hour at the Rooms, and on coming home, found <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Joseph H.
								Adams</persRef> who dined with us— Under orders for Norfolk and is

						<p>An uncommonly beautiful day— Summer like, but for a dash of
							East-wind—cool without being chilly. But not the least abatement of my
							Catarrh. Rather a heavy aggravation. Heard <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> this morning. From 1. Timothy 2.4. “Who will
							have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth”—
							The universality of the Christian faith was the subject but the sense in
							which the words should be used was to be understood To be saved in this
							passage, meant evidently to be converted to Christianity, and thereby
							come to the knowledge of the truth— But what was meant by <hi
								rend="italic">all</hi>? very few— All included neither the
							inhabitants of Africa nor of Asia, the greater or the less, nor of a
							great portion of the rest of the earth nor even Palestine where Christ
							himself was born— But <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in this text referred
							to the various classes and conditions of men, and its object was to shew
							how the blessings and promises of the gospel were adapted to every age,
							to either sex, to every class of human kind, and in that consisted the
							universality of christianity whereby the knowledge of the truth is
							obtained— The doctrine deduced from the discourse was the obligation
							upon all to devote themselves to the purposes which the gospel is
							destined to report. There was a notice read by D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frothingham of a meeting to be held by the Society next
							Thursday for considering a plan to alter and repair the Church—
							Immediately after the service, I called with <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> on <persRef ref="brooks-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edward Brooks</persRef>, whom we saw
							with <persRef ref="brooks-francis">her Son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="brooks-anne">daughter</persRef>— The house belongs to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>, and is that in which
							he lived while he was Governor of the Commonwealth. When he went to
							Europe, it was occupied by <persRef ref="brooks-sidney">Sidney
								Brooks</persRef> who with <persRef ref="brooks-frances">his
								wife</persRef> has a passion for elegant furniture, and when they
							also embarked last November for England, they left all their splendid
							furniture in the house which <persRef ref="brooks-edward">Edward
								Brooks</persRef> took with more costly articles of his own, and now
							they all constitute the joint display of the lower rooms. They are
							monuments of the vanity of riches— They look like a cabinet makers shop
							in a Sculptor’s studion, and a painter’s gallery. Crimson satin sophas
							and curtains, easy and rocking chairs. Statues from a Colossal <persRef
								ref="apollo">Apollo Belvidere</persRef> to a naked woman on her
							knees, modern portraits and Italian paintings— Engravings of the
							Transfiguration and <persRef ref="reni-guido">Guido’s</persRef> Aurora,
							with <persRef ref="durand-asher">Durand’s</persRef> Declaration of
							Independence, and <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Trumbull’s</persRef>
							Bunker hill were all clustered together but well disposed by the taste
							of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edward Brooks— After dinner, a very
							young man preached from Ecclesiastes. 1.–2 “All is vanity.” Soon after
							that services a succession of visitors— Closed the day— <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef> at tea— Then <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.

								Savage</persRef>, President of the Massachusetts historical Society
							called and I had a long conversation with him; chiefly upon a question
							fit only to make a learned body ridiculous by forming a subject for
							divided opinions and even of controversy. That is, on the day for the
							ceremony.— The day of the confederation was 19. May 1643— The day chosen
							for the celebration is the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May
							because at that time the difference between the Calenders was only ten
							days— But the difference is now two days more, and I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage that as the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May of old Style of the present year
							is the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of the new Style, I thought
							they should take the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> for the
							celebration— But he and <persRef ref="davis-john">judge Davis</persRef>,
							have settled the point between themselves upon principle— He argued it
							with me astronomically and politically with such lucid illustration,
							that I lost the thread of his syllogism, and finally did not understand
							him at all. I went to visit <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef>, who was not at
							home, and I called on <persRef ref="bancroft-george">George
								Bancroft</persRef>. I found <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef> with him, and of course we talked history— They
							were endeavouring to ascertain the relation between <persRef
								ref="temple-john">Sir John Temple</persRef>, Winthrops grand-father
							and the Grenville family—of which I was surprized to see, Winthrop
							apparently not at all informed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft
							had a number of manuscript Letters, which <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Edward Everett</persRef> has collected for him, from <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund">Burke</persRef>, <persRef ref="fox-charles"

								<persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin</persRef>, <persRef ref="lee-arthur">Arthur Lee</persRef>
							&amp;c written in 1774—and among the rest a copy of <persRef
								ref="hutchinson-thomas">Thomas Hutchinson’s</persRef> account of his
							private interview, with <persRef ref="george-iii">King George the 3<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi></persRef> in July 1774. on
							Hutchinson’s first arrival from this country— He was introduced by
								<persRef ref="legge-william">Lord Dartmouth</persRef>, and was
							upwards of two hours long with the king— Much of the dialogue, was upon
							the detection and exposure by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin of
							Hutchinson’s Letters, upon which the king said that there was not a word
							in them at which any just exception could be taken— Bancroft told me
							that from this paper and all the other disclosures to which he has
							obtained of the real character of Hutchinson, he had come to the same
							conclusion that <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> did—that
							he was a bad man.— This afternoon I had again a long professional visit
							from <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef>, and a discussion upon the proper regimen and
							treatment of the incurable disease with which I am afflicted, and for
							which I believe great abstemiousness and he thinks good living the
							appropriate, and only appropriate palliative remedy— He still persists
							in his opinion, and I shall conform myself to it, as long, and as well
							as I can— <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George Parkman</persRef> came to see me. He did not know that I was
							in the city till this morning— My intercourse with him is always
							friendly without alloy, and nothing more— At close of day I went with
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> in to their next door
							neighbour’s <persRef ref="parker-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>My catarrh gives me not the slightest encouragement to expect relief from
							its visitation— The weather of yesterday and this day has been unusually
							fine, with a bright Sun and a balmy breeze— <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">My daughter</persRef> received last Night the
							intelligence of the death of her brother <persRef ref="brooks-horatio"
								>Horatio Brooks</persRef>, at Brattleborough, Vermont— His life has
							been unfortunate, and yet his decease is afflictive— I packed up my
							trunk and sent it out at Noon by the Stage to Quincy.— Then wrote my
							journal for yesterday—and had written one page of my address, for the
							anniversary day—after a call on <persRef ref="cadmus-william">Cadmus</persRef>, I
							took the last turn to the chamber’s of the historical Society where I
							found at last <persRef ref="adair-james">Adair’s</persRef> History of
							the Indians— I could not take it out— But I did take out a copy of the
								8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> series of the publications of the Society
							the volume recently published, and for which I left with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> directions to pay. <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> was here great part of
							the morning. Shortly before noon, one of the black men concerned in
							publishing the Emancipator, brought me a note from <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua
								Leavitt</persRef>, taking an affectionate leave of me, and enquiring
							of the state of my health, being on the point of departure in the
							Steamer Hibernia for Liverpool to attend the Meeting of the World’s
							Convention— I wrote on a small scrap of paper a few words, bidding him
							God speed and praying for him a happy return— A man by the name of
								<persRef ref="howard-john3">John Howard</persRef> from Springfield
							in this Commonwealth; came and made some enquiries about the Land in
							Guysborough Nova-Scotia, belonging to the Estate of the late <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward N.
								Boylston</persRef>, which land M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howard
							said he was told last year, when he was there, belonged to John Quincy
							Adams.— I told him I had no other interest in it than as an Executor and
							Trustee of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s last Will; and
							referred him for further enquiries to <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>; but
							this incident reminded me that I have yet much to do for the settlement
							of that estate, and probably only the season now before me for doing it—
							Immediately after dinner, at 1/2 past 3. my son took me in his Gig out
							to my own residence at Quincy, where I found <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>John Kirk</persRef> and <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">his
								wife</persRef> ready to receive me— I have returned once at least
							every year for the last 15 years, to this calm retreat from public
							labours and boisterous passions with extasy of delight— Now dashed with
							a presentiment that it may probably be for the last time, and that the
							most imperious of my duties now is to set my household in order, and
							prepare for my last change. Charles returned to Boston— I walked round
							my Garden, Nursery and Seminary where I found a few of my young seedling
							trees which will still deserve my attention— The <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">Rev’d M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> called and spent an hour of the Evening with me— I
							easily found occupation till 10. O’Clock and then with a severe fit of
							<unclear>coughing retired to bed</unclear></p>

						<p>No Relaxation of my disease— The repose of the Night broken as it has
							been every night since the return of my complaint.— But I rose this
							morning at 4. and was on my way to see the Sun rise from the S.E. corner
							of <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house; when I found
							half his disk above the horizon— His first ray appeared <hi
								rend="strikethrough">4</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">:</hi><hi
								rend="strikethrough">37.</hi>— I wrote upon my address for the
							anniversary—without any satisfaction, and under a deep impression of
							dulness beyond all redemption— The day was fair and the weather on the
							whole warm—though I had a small fire made. I visited my seedling trees—
							For these fifteen years I have seen, every year sowing in confusion
							which I have often and vainly endeavoured to methodize, the seeds of
							many fruit and forest trees— I have been here only a part of every year,
							and I have never paid due scientific regard to them— I have neglected
							all the instructions of <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="forsyth-william">Forsyth</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="loudon-john">Loudon</persRef>, and the other writers upon
							planting and dendrology— The result is that after numberless
							disappointments and the thorough failure of about 9/10<hi
								rend="superscript">ths.</hi> of my experiments I have perhaps one
							hundred trees growing from seeds sown by my own hands, and which if left
							unmolested where they now stand may survive me a full century and bear
							fruit for those who shall come after me— Of these, the only ones in
							which I now take much interest, are young apple trees, some just
							beginning to bear and others fit stocks for engrafting good fruit upon
							them.— About half a dozen pear stocks—one red oak 12 feet high and one
							foot in circumference, a dozen or more other Oaks, black, white and
							chesnut all neglected— Sundry elms and ash of which I might have a
							forest. Sundry cherries, most of them in bloom, but not having yet born
							fruit— Three maples the seeds of which I brought from Philadelphia in
							May 1836. and sowed on the first of June of that year. It is a comfort
							to me to leave these growing upon my grounds, and the sight of my trees
							bursting into bloom gives me the solitary pleasure that I enjoy in
							returning to this peaceful abode. I dined alone; and this afternoon my
							Son came out from Boston, with <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4;adams-louisa3;adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4;adams-arthur"
								>all his family</persRef> to keep house with me, till he can get his
							own house upon the hill prepared for their reception— I got through my
							daily task of yesterday’s journal, and two pages of my address for the
							centennial— But this last sickens me to the heart and must prove a
							grievous failure— I am now wading through a comparative statement of the
							democratic ingredients of the four New-England Colonies which united in
							the confederacy of 1643. and find it hard to labour through.</p>

						<p>I took last Night before going to bed by way of experiment a tumbler of
							wine whey, and it did not succeed— It aggravated my cough, and heated me
							without producing a perspiration— I rose in time to go over and see the
							sun rise from the corner of <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house at 4.36. The restlessness of the Night
							somewhat dispirited me for punctuality to my labours so that I did not
							complete the two pages of my address for the day, nor finish my diary
							for yesterday, but by writing this evening till my bed time. But I spent
							between two and three of the best hours of the day, in going with
								<persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef> round my Garden and
							Nursery—trimming some of my trees, plucking up others, and preparing for
							clearing off the useless trees now stunting the growth of the precious
							ones—those for which I anticipate the longest lives are the shagbark
							walnuts of which I have about 20 from 12 to 2 years old, and the sight
							of which is a reward for all the labour I have wasted in raising tree,
							from the seed— In making up my summary of the 4 New-England Colonies
							which formed the confederacy of 1643. I have to consult numerous writers
							as well those nearly cotemporaneous as of later ages— <persRef
								ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson</persRef> is my standing leader,
							and often after finding, a very brief notice of my special object of
							enquiry, in him, with a reference to others for further enquiry, I
							stroll off to <persRef ref="hazard-ebenezer">Hazard’s</persRef> State
							papers, to <persRef ref="hinman-royal">Hinman’s</persRef> Connecticut
							Antiquities, to <persRef ref="farmer-john">Farmer’s</persRef> Registers

							Collections of the Historical Society—and to others which I have not yet
							been able to gather. I return to the short notice in Hutchinson, and
							perceive not that I have much enlarged my stock of knowledge— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes’s Annals are copious of facts—and
							they are what I want to know with most precision— I seek particularly
							the why and the when the Colonies of Connecticut and of New-Haven were
							organized and established— There is much modification of the history
							caused by the various phases of the revolution and restoration in of the
							Stuart family in England— I took up this day the Volume of <persRef
								ref="bancroft-george">Bancroft’s</persRef> history recently
							published, and find a new colouring given to every incident, and a new
							gloss to every character— There is in every line of Bancroft a struggle
							to magnify the importance of events and of persons giving an air of
							pomposity to his whole Story— This afternoon I took a ride in the
							Carriage with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef>, to Braintree, where she finally

						<p>Having no time to spare for the composition of my address for the
							Massachusetts historical Society, and deeming it necessary for the
							filling of the time allotted to the discourse, that it should consist of
							32 pages, occupying two pages or thereabouts I begin the day with that
							labour, and prescribing to myself to write two pages each day till I get
							through— I began therefore this morning as soon after rising dressing
							and making my fire was practicable, and with the interval of half an
							hour for breakfast kept incessant alternate reading and writing, till
							the village bell rung for noon before my task for the day was completed—
							In the course of my treatment of the subject I was this day brought to
							the consideration of the character of <persRef ref="williams-roger"
								>Roger Williams</persRef> and the establishment of the Colony of
							Rhode-Island— It has in recent times become a sort of literary fashion
							to extol the character of Roger Williams, by disparaging those of the
							Massachusetts with whom he contended. I have suspected that there is in
							this much injustice; and the more minutely I examine his controversy
							with them, the more firmly this opinion fixes itself in my mind— Roger
							Williams was a Welshman— He came sharpened for controversy, a polemical
							porcupine from Oxford, an extreme puritan quilled with all the
							quarrelsome metaphysical divinity of the age— He arrived eight months
							after <persRef ref="winthrop-john2">Winthrop</persRef> and his company
							and began by preaching at Salem that the Charter was of no avail,
							because the king had no power to grant the lands because they belonged
							to the Indians, and that the Church was no true Church because she had
							not proclaimed her repentance for having held Communion with the Church
							of England before the Emigration— These doctrines struck at the vitals
							of the Massachusetts Colony, civil and ecclesiastical— If there is any
							thing surprizing in their treatment of him, it was their lenity towards
							him— His principle of liberty of conscience admirable in itself, was
							utterly at variance with itself in his excommunication of the colonial
							church for not excommunicating the episcopal church of England—
							Altogether he was a mere boute-feu and they were amply justified in
							getting rid of him. I see that <persRef ref="bancroft-george"
								>Bancroft</persRef> tells his Story with extreme partiality to puff
							him up—not only to a Saint and Hero; but to a transcendent Genius— A
								<persRef ref="newton-isaac">Newton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="kepler-johannes">Kepler</persRef>, or <persRef
								ref="copernicus-nicolaus">Copernicus</persRef>. His principle of
							Toleration was the inspiration of a strong mind, and his success in
							settling a small colony where it was carried into practise gives lustre
							to his name— The recent revolution in Rhode-Island, is the Euthanasia of
							his system— <persRef key="adams-charles2">My son</persRef>, took his
							daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa</persRef> to Boston with
							him to Boston and returned to dine. And after dinner I took a ride in
							the Carriage with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> and
							youngest son <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>20. III.45. </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>My nightly cough begins to subside and I am encouraged with a hope of
							temporary relief from the peripneumona notha which I suppose is to
							finish me upon earth—for the respite I desire to bless the name of God,
							and with it I must pray for a good deliverance from my tedious task of
							the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— I am still entangled with the
							character and history of <persRef ref="williams-roger">Roger
								Williams</persRef> and his democracy of the Providence Plantations.—
							I fear to do him injustice in the anxious desire to do justice to his
							adversaries— I cannot but think him the aggressor against the
							Massachusetts Colony from the day of his arrival— I cannot acquit him of
							the ambition of supplanting <persRef ref="cotton-john">John
								Cotton</persRef> as the high priest of the Colony— He shuffled and
							equivocated in apologizing to the general Court for his first Treatise
							against the Charter and in offering it to them to be burnt— His
							excommunications were all intolerant. his refusal to take the oath of
							allegiance was factious—his preaching against it seditious— He appears
							to have prevaricated on the subject of his conversion to the anabaptist
							denomination.— And his last controversial writings against the Quakers
							might as well have been omitted— Yet his inflexible and finally
							triumphant principles of universal toleration makes him a name and a
							praise for all future time— I see sharp points shooting out from every
							side of the subject— I received this day 1. A Letter from <persRef
								ref="barnard-robert">R. F. Barnard</persRef> President of the
							Berkshire County Agricultural Society, dated Sheffield May 18. inviting
							me to prepare and deliver an address before them at their annual Fair to
							be held on the first Wednesday and Thursday of next October. 2. A Letter
							from <persRef ref="sedgwick-charles">Charles Sedgwick</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="dewey-daniel">Daniel N. Dewey</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">George N. Briggs</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="sturgis-franklin">Franklin Sturgis</persRef> dated 17. May,
							referring to the above Letter of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard
							and adding their very earnest solicitations to me, to visit that part of
							the Country. 3. A Letter from <persRef ref="lowell-charles">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Charles Lowell D.D.</persRef>
							Secretary of the Massachusetts Historical Society, dated Boston 18. May,
							requesting me to write an hymn or ode for the celebration of the 29<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> 4. A further printed circular Letter
							from <persRef ref="loring-ellis">Ellis Gray Loring</persRef> dated 13.
							May, as Treasurer of the United States Hotel company, apprizing me of
							some new arrangements to be made by the Stock holders— All these Letters
							require answers— They should be immediate answers; but I have no time to
							write them— I wrote and despatched a short Letter to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="lunt-william;lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef> were here on a
							visit this afternoon— I took a ride with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>my daughter</persRef> and her baby <persRef ref="adams-arthur"
								>Arthur</persRef> this Evening— We left M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Lunt at the door of her house, and came out where the
							Quarry railway crosses the road in Milton—</p>

						<p><date>21. IV. </date>Sunday</p>
						<p>My cough has very much subsided, and I went to bed last Night without a
							fit of coughing, and awoke this morning with a very light one— <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							preached this morning from Luke 12.15—[“]for a man’s life consisteth not
							in the abundance of the things which he possesseth”—and Romans 8.6.—“to
							be spiritually minded is life and peace.”— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt considered the second of these texts as an exposition
							of the first— The life of man he said was different from that of all
							merely material beings— The life of beasts and birds and fishes and all
							the animated creation consisted of the circulation of material
							elements—and in this sense there was a life in plants—perishable by the
							lapse of time but life in man was the conscious existence of the
							immortal soul, and therefore could not consist in the abundance of a
							man’s earthly possessions.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave
							notice that the afternoon service would be performed by a blind person
							named <persRef ref="bowen-benjamin">Bowen</persRef>—who had been
							earnestly recommended to him by several of his professional brethren at
							the South, as every way, worthy of encouragement and kindness. He said
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowen, had been admitted to the
							pulpits of many churches in this neighbourhood, and had preached as he
							was informed to general acceptance.— He had thought it his duty to give
							him the same opportunity, and as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowen
							had no other means of providing for his subsistence, after his discourse
							a collection would be taken up for his benefit— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> walked home with me— After dinner, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowen, the blind man preached from John
							9.2. “And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
							man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 3. Jesus answered, neither
							hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should
							be made manifest in him.”— Is there not in this answer an explicit
							declaration that the phyical infirmities and diseases of men are not to
							be considered as visitations of heaven upon them in punishment for
							transgression— Yet it is scarcely to be denied that there are
							punishments inflicted by heaven for sins upon earth— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowen’s discourse was intellectual as much
							as might be expected from one habitually living with knowledge at one
							entrance quite shut out.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowen gave some
							statistics of blindness in different countries, and presented their plea
							for compassion without overcharge or exaggeration.— In thanking the
							auditory for their patience he repeated the notice given this morning by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt, that he had no other means of
							obtaining his subsistence, but his preaching, and a liberal contribution
							was taken up for his benefit—</p>

						<p>I find myself with the most unremitting labour unable to accomplish the
							daily task of writing two pages of my address, and equally so of fixing
							any point of view, in which the New England Colonial confederacy can be
							made interesting.— My acquaintance with the details of the original
							settlement of New England is very slender, and being now under the
							obligation to look them up, the streams of information are so copious,
							that they absorb all my time— The confederacy of 1643 was a defensive
							league against the Indians—my first duty was to trace the separate
							origin of the five New-England Colonies, including that of Rhode-Island
							and Providence plantations, which was not admitted into the league— Then
							I was cast upon the controversy concerning the life and character of
								<persRef ref="williams-roger">Roger Williams</persRef>. Next I came
							to the investigation of the Colonial Wars with the Indians— This plunges
							me into the historical collections of the Massachusetts, and of the
							Rhode Island historical Societies—of the Massachusetts Collections there
							are 28 volumes already published and of the Rhode Island collections 4:
							The Massachusetts collections are rich in original publications
							respecting the New England Indians, and the Wars of the European
							Colonists with them. In the first volume there is a work by <persRef
								ref="gookin-daniel">Daniel Gookin</persRef>, entitled Historical
							collections of the Indians of New-England of which I made this day the
							discovery, and which occupied hours of my time— The work is dedicated in
							December 1674. to <persRef ref="charles-ii">Charles the 2<hi
									rend="superscript">d</hi></persRef> with an Epistle to <persRef
								ref="boyle-robert">Robert Boyle</persRef> and the Society in London
							for propagating the gospel among the Indians, and another epistle to the
							reader— In the second Chapter of this work there is an enumeration of
							five tribes embracing all the tribes inhabiting New England when the
							English colonies were first settled, and continuing to exist half a
							century afterwards when Gookin wrote— This Daniel Gookin was father to
								<persRef ref="quincy-elizabeth3">Elizabeth Gookin</persRef>, second
							wife of the second <persRef ref="quincy-edmund2">Edmund
							Quincy</persRef>, ancestor of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Josiah Quincy</persRef>. His first wife was <persRef
								ref="quincy-joanna">Joanna Hoare</persRef>, mother of <persRef
								ref="quincy-daniel">Daniel Quincy</persRef> and thereby my ancestor—
							I am yet to explore the narratives of the Indian Wars as originating
							causes of the New-England confederacy, and in the mean time, my address
							drags its slow length along. I took a ride this afternoon round through
							Braintree with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">my daughter</persRef> and
							her baby <persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> took tea here.
							They came from Medford on Saturday. We have the melancholy tidings of
							the death of <persRef ref="whittemore-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"

							for sale, and five or six men, and sundry children— The Fair is a small

							expedient of beggary humble enough but growing stale— I purchased two or

							August 1779 from the pinnace of the French frigate La Sensible on the
							same beach—65 years have passed away since the first of those events—
							Nearly 64 since the second— What changes of the globe and of man in that

						<p>Disastrous fire in Quincy—</p>
						<p><persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin

							inventions for raising the wind— His principal project now is an
							engraved print for a temperance pledge certificate, ornamented with the

							vocabulary, inebriates— He also convinced me by dint of persuasion, to
							let him varnish some of my old pictures. A person by the name of
								<persRef ref="stow-alexander">Alexander Wolcott Stow</persRef>,
							formerly of Connecticut, now of Milwaukie, in the territory of
							Wiskonsin, came to see me and to have some conversation with me; as he
							said merely for the pleasure of it— A friend of Liberty <persRef
								ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef> called also, and proposed
							to me at some future day to visit my territories, to which I agreed
							without naming a day. There was a fire in the Town this day, between
							Noon and One O’Clock, which consumed several dwelling houses, at some
							distance from each other— First caught from a foul chimney, and then
							carried by the wind in burning cinders from house to house.— <persRef
								ref="rogers-clift">Clift Rogers</persRef> and <persRef

								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.

								Tyler</persRef> continues his varnishing atchievements and this day
							dined with us— An Irish woman of one of the families burnt out of the
							Faxon house came to plead her own cause with all the eloquence of
							distress, but she could not pronounce her own name so that I could
							remember it.— After dinner I rode with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> to Roxbury to the garden of an Englishman named
								<persRef ref="walker-samuel2">Walker</persRef> at Roxbury, where he
							has sundry beds of tulips after the fashion of those at Haerlem in
							Holland— In one bed under a glass-frame there were 1200 bulbs with the
							stalk and cups, in every variety of colouring and of cost— We met there
								<persRef ref="brooks-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boott</persRef>, <persRef

							week— In one part of the bed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks was
							noticing two of the tulips near together, as being remarkably handsome,
							when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker observed that the difference
							in value between them was of fifty cents and fifty dollars— I thought
							the fifty cent one the handsomest of the two— The wild and extravagant
							and most capricious taste for tulips is not yet extinct— Returning home
							just after crossing Neponsett Bridge, my fingers were so pinched with
							cold that I alighted from the carriage and walked two miles home;
							Charles’s son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> came
							down from the Coachman’s box, and walked with me— The day for the
							delivery of my address is now so near at hand that I am excessively
							pressed for time to conclude. I have come at last to an abstract of the
							Articles of the New England confederacy with the view of closing by a
							parallel between them and the present North American confederation of
							the United States—but the attempt has brought me to a conviction of

						<p>The Sun rose clear, but I was yet in bed. And the sky soon clouded up for
							a Northeaster with showers of rain through the day— I came in my address
							to the parallel between the New-England confederacy of 1643. and the
							North-American confederacy of 1774.— I had some hopes on approaching
							this topic to bring up some interest with it—but it sinks under me— Not
							one of the motives which stimulated the puritans of 1643 to their
							confederacy of 1643 had the slightest influence in actuating the
							confederacy of 1774. The parties to the New-England Union were
							homogeneous— Those of the North-American Union were not only of
							heterogeneous but of hostile elements; and in the latter there was the
							ingredient of Slavery which poisoned the whole composition— I have
							touched upon it in this address; but on revisal propose to strike out
							all that I have written relating to it— This afternoon I rode with
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">my daughter</persRef> and her son
								<persRef ref="adams-charles7">Charles</persRef> to Weymouth to
							enquire of the state of <persRef ref="tufts-mercy2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mercy Tufts</persRef> who has been
							very dangerously ill with the Erisypelas— We saw her two daughters
								<persRef ref="tufts-mercy">Mercy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tufts-susannah">Susan</persRef>, who told us she was somewhat
							better, though still confined to her bed— We rode home with a sprinkling
							rain and the evening was wintry cold— This family of Tufts are all that
							now remain of my childhood’s remembrance of Weymouth— Some of the
							earliest of my recollections are there, and the localities which remain
							unchanged bring them back, with a pungency for which I scarcely know how
							to account— I have no such reminiscences in Boston, because every thing
							there is changed; but spots of the old road through Braintree and
							Weymouth are precisely as they were seventy years ago—and a return to
							them seems to sweep away the interval of time, and to make me again a
							child— But there is not one individual of my grandfather <persRef

						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> from Hebrews. 1.1. [“]God, who at sundry
							times, and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the
							prophets.”— A Dissertation upon the Hebrew prophets. This subject has
							perhaps not been fully explored— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
							noticed the division made by the Jews of their sacred books into the
							historical, the poetical and the prophetical— The latter including only
							the books of <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jeremiah">Jeremiah</persRef>, <persRef ref="ezekiel"
								>Ezekiel</persRef>
							<persRef ref="daniel">Daniel</persRef> and the twelve minor prophets—
							But the term prophet is of much more extensive signification in the old
							testament than to include the authors of the sixteen prophetical books.—
							The Patriarchs <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>
							<persRef ref="isaac">Isaac</persRef> and <persRef ref="jacob"
								>Jacob</persRef> were prophets— The kings Saul and <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef> and <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef> were prophets. During the time of the judges the
							prophets were called Seers; and in the case of <persRef ref="balaam"
								>Balaam</persRef>, there is a description of the manner of their
							visions (Numbers 24.16) The prophet fell into a trance, but had his eyes
							open—and then he saw visions, and heard voices—and what he heard he was
							obliged to repeat— In the days of the kings there were schools of the
							prophets whence it would seem it was considered as an art or Science to
							be taught by human instruction. But the word of the Lord came
							indiscriminately to persons of all conditions, and the prophet <persRef
								ref="amos">Amos</persRef> was among the herdmen of Tekoa— One of the
							greatest prophets was <persRef ref="elijah">Elijah</persRef>, of whom
							there are now no writings left and it is remarkable that the 16.
							prophets whose writings are included in the Bible, all lived very
							shortly before or during the Babylonian captivity. By the Law of
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, (Deuteronomy 13 and 18) a
							false prophet if he spoke in the name of the Lord—and a true prophet if
							he spoke in the name of any other God were to be put to death— The test
							of a true prophet who spoke in the name of the Lord was that his
							predictions should come to pass— And there was a promise that the Lord
							would raise up a prophet, like unto Moses; but it was not said when and
							the modern Christian commentators have concluded that this promise was
							fulfilled by the advent of Jesus Christ— But he, and by his declaration
							even <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John the Baptist</persRef> was more
							than a prophet. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave notice that the
							communion would be administered next Sunday. <persRef
								ref="brooks-edward2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Brooks
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> came out from Boston
							and dined with us. After dinner <persRef ref="hall-nathaniel2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef> of Dorchester preached
							from Acts 16.30. “what must I do to be saved?” There was something
							startling in the text, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall thought
							it a question, which every Christian ought to put to himself, every day
							and every hour of his life.— But he did not very distinctly define what
							he understood by being saved— He is no believer of eternal damnation— I
							this day painfully brought to a conclusion my address, to be delivered
							to-morrow before the Massachusetts Historical Society.</p>

								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s</persRef>. There by a mistake rather ludicrous I was
							shown into his study where were assembled a number of persons, who I
							supposed were the Massachusetts historical Society though I could not
							conceive how they came there— <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C. Brooks</persRef> was
							presiding, and they settled their Treasurer’s Accounts, made all their
							annual elections, and chose the <persRef ref="gannett-ezra">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Ezra Stiles Gannett</persRef> as a
							member of their corporation in the place of the late <persRef
								ref="channing-william">Doctor William E. Channing</persRef> before I
							discovered that it was a meeting of the Massachusetts Congregational
							charitable Society— When they had finished their business <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> who was there took
							me in his barouche to the chambers of the historical Society, where a
							meeting well attended was held— The President <persRef
								ref="savage-james">James Savage</persRef> moved that the meeting
							should adjourn to his house at 8 O’Clock this evening and gave a general
							invitation to all the members present to attend there— A Procession was
							then formed in which I walked with President Savage to the first Church
							in Chauncey Place where I delivered the address to the Massachusetts
							Historical Society, in celebration of the second centennial anniversary
							of the New-England colonial confederacy of 1643.— The performances began
							precisely at 11. O’Clock, with an appropriate prayer by D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham the Minister of the Church—
							Then the Psalm 107. of the New England version of 1640. was sung— I then
							delivered my address, beginning at 20 minutes past 11. and closing at 5
							minutes past 1.— One hour and three quarters; omitting about one eighth
							of what I had written— It was very well received; and there was no
							manifestation of what I most dreaded, a sense of weariness on the part
							of the auditory— The attention was general and unremitting to the last—
							The house was well filled but not crowded— Excepting the members of the
							Society about as many women as men— After the Address, Psalm 44 of the
							New England version was sung, and the benediction was pronounced by D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham.— <persRef
								ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Beach
								Laurence</persRef>, <persRef ref="jay-john3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Jay</persRef>, and several other gentlemen were

							Connecticut and Maine. I went with Charles and dined at D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s— <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">Charles’s wife</persRef> dined at her brother
								<persRef ref="brooks-edward">Edward Brooks’s</persRef>. At 4 in the

							<persRef ref="u">son</persRef>; part Editor of the Courier asked the

							but I excused myself from attendance at the President’s evening
							party.</p>

								Greenleaf</persRef> called on me this morning, with a copy of a
							lease executed in 1839 of a lot of land belong to the Adams temple and
							school corporation for 20 years on a ground lent of 6. dollars a year—
							There was a condition inserted in the draught of the deed that at the
							termination of the lease, if the parties could not agree upon its
							renewal the corporation should take the buildings erected by the lessee,
							at an equitable apprizement— The supervisors of the fund disapproved of
							this condition; and directed that another should be done. But from the
							loose and careless manner in which the business of this corporation, and
							indeed of most others is transacted the conclusion of the deed has been
							neglected and protracted to this day—once signed and sealed by the
							selectmen, and acknowledged before a justice of the peace; but by
							unaccountable negligence without signature of witnesses; so that it must
							be done all over again— An admonition which ought not to be overlooked—
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went into Boston to
							attend a Collation furnished by the Unitarian laymen of Boston to the
							Clergy of their denomination. This is a yearly festival; at which there
							were this day 815 persons of both sexes present— Charles presided as a
							delegate from <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef> Society at one
							of 8 tables.— The entertainment consisted of cold meats, tea and coffee—
							No wine or Spirits, but addresses and songs— I rode this afternoon with
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef>, her Sons <persRef ref="adams-charles7"
								>Charles</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-henry4">Henry</persRef> and

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Greenleaf</persRef> and their

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary Dawes</persRef>—after which we
							rode round the Braintree square, and when we reached home found Charles
							returned from Boston— I visited my garden, Nursery and seminary, and
							examined my seedling trees, many of which exhibit appearances, for which
							I cannot account— Almost all my peach-trees are winter killed; and among
							them several of two and three years old; and till now of the fairest
							promise— On the other hand the cherries all flourish more than I have
							ever known them to do before— The black walnuts often before blighted
							are uncommonly thrifty now: and the oaks and Shagbark walnuts differ so
							much that numbers of them have put forth a vigorous growth, while others
							after opening a beautiful foliage have already withered and are
							irretrievably blasted— The apples make as yet the fairest show.</p>

							New-Orleans Bee of 15 and 16. May containing several long Articles,
							sounding the trumpet of alarm at the symptoms recently manifested in
							Texas of a strong party with a fixed design to abolish Slavery— The Bee
							has the name of <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> on its
							first page nominated as its candidate for the presidency but its groans
							at the prospect of abolition in Texas are agonizing.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrews is a native of Massachusetts, but
							at present an inhabitant of Texas— He is the person mentioned in the
							Letter from <persRef ref="eve-joseph">Joseph Eve</persRef>, to the
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> shewn to
							me by <persRef ref="hunter-william7">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hunter</persRef> on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April—
							Eve related that this person had come from Austin to Galveston to make a
							speech in public urging the expediency and necessity of abolishing
							Slavery. But that an assemblage of people had gone to him at his
							lodgings, taken him by force and landed him at Virginia point on the
							opposite bank of the river. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrews says
							this was true; but that the men who committed this outrage upon him were
							a gang of not more than 20 persons; not at all authorised or supported
							by the People—and that he afterwards returned to Galveston, openly
							avowing his abolition opinions without meeting any ill treatment or
							opposition— He says he knows that the Texan President <persRef
								ref="houston-samuel">Houston</persRef> is in favour of the
							abolition— He is now about to embark in the Steamer Caledonia to morrow
							for England, with a view to obtain the aid of the British Government to
							the cause— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan asked me if I would
							furnish him with Letters of recommendation, which I declined having no
							correspondent in England with whom I could take the Liberty: but I bade
							him God speed and told him, that I believed the freedom of this country
							and of all mankind depended upon the direct, formal, open and avowed
							interference of Great-Britain to accomplish the abolition of Slavery in
							Texas. But that I distrusted the Sincerity of the present British
							Administration in the Anti-slavery cause. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Andrews offered to write to me, to inform me how his propositions may be
							received, which I accepted— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan told
							me he had himself been urged to go to England and asked my advice what
							he should do— I declined advising; but said I wished he would go; were
							it only for the possibility that he might contribute to advance the
							cause— <persRef ref="brooks-edward;brooks-elizabeth">Edward and M<hi
