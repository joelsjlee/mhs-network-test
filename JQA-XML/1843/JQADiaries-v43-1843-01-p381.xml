						<p>I attended public worship this morning at the hall of the house of
							representatives— <persRef ref="tiffany-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tiffany</persRef> read the short
							episcopalian service of the circumcision morning without the litany, or
							any part of the communion, or the first lesson of the day: and from the
							second lesson, he took his text. James 4.13. [“]Go to, now, ye that say,
							To-day, or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a
							year, and buy and sell, and get gain: 14. Whereas ye know not what shall
							be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that
							appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 15. For that ye
							ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that.” The
							uncertainty and instability of human life, and the propensity in human
							nature to forget or cast aside this Law of its own existence is the
							perpetual admonition both of the old and of the new Testament. It is one
							of the common places of Christian morality, upon which there is nothing
							new to be said, and upon which what has been said cannot be too often
							repeated— It is one of my subjects of self reproach, that conscious as I
							am of this tenure of my existence I continue to disguise it to myself,
							and instead of setting my house in order, I live on as if my end were
							yet remote, unprepared for the inevitable hour. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tiffany’s exhortation was edifying—but not very impressive.—
							After the service, on my way home, I visited <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john3">Kennedy</persRef> in 3<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="gordon-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel

								ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Taliaferro</persRef>. <persRef ref="maynard-john">M<hi

								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Morgan</persRef>, with <persRef

								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> B. O. Tayloe</persRef>—from
								<persRef ref="sedgwick-theodore3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							read the evening service of the day, and premising that he had been
							disappointed in the expectation of assistance from a professional
							brother to preach for him, he gave a brief extemporaneous exposition
							from Isaiah 11.2. “And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the
							spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
							spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord”—all of which he
							considered as applicable to the Messiah— This is not now universally
							admitted; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley had no time to
							discuss it controversially— After church I visited <persRef

						<p>Morning absorbed in reading the Newspapers of the last Night’s Mail and
							the Globe of Saturday evening upon my table— It contains the speech of
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef> in the Senate
							of the United States last August in favour of advising and consenting to
							the ratification of the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty— Calhoun
							is the High Priest of <persRef ref="moloch">Moloch</persRef>— The
							embodied Spirit of Slavery— He has resigned his Seat in the Senate of
							the United States to take effect from the close of the present Congress
							the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March next—and immediately upon
							the acceptance of his resignation by the Legislature of South-Carolina,
							they unanimously nominated him as a Candidate for election, as President
							of the United States for four years from the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of March 1845. His speech is remarkable for one of those
							glaring, unblushing dare-devil inconsistencies, which as far as I know
							are peculiar to the doctrinal school of Slavery— He begins by a broad,
							explicit, unqualified declaration that he has always believed the claim
							of Maine upon the North-eastern boundary question just; and then
							proceeds with an elaborate argument to prove, that on that same
							identical boundary question the title of Great-Britain is clear, to more
							than she has ever claimed— On the subject of Slavery and the
							Slave-trade, the negotiation itself was a Scapinade— A struggle between
							the Plenipotentiaries to outwit each other, and to circumvent both
							countries by a slippery compromise between freedom and Slavery— Calhoun
							crows about his own success in imposing his own bastard Law of Nations
							upon the Senate by his preposterous Resolutions, and chuckles at
							Websters appealing to those Resolutions now after dodging from the duty
							of refuting and confounding them then— Calhoun concludes upon the whole
							to put up with the ticklish truce, patched up between the Treaty and the
							correspondence; and this was what in fact reconciled him to the
							ratification— There is a temperance in his manner obviously aiming to
							conciliate the Northern political sopranos who abhor slavery, and help
							to forge fetters for the Slave— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> is still confined to her bed, and was more unwell
							this day than yesterday— There were however none the less of female
							visitors, who were well received by <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef>— Our late
							minister to France <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass</persRef>, was
							among them; and told me that shortly before he left France he had a
							conversation with <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">old</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">friend</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<hi rend="italic"><persRef ref="louis-philippe">king</persRef></hi>,
							concerning me, which he wished to tell me; and he was beginning to do
							so, when other visitors came up and interrupted him— He said he would
							call again some evening and tell me— They say the crowd at the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> this day was unexampled— I
							did not go out. <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>
							dined with us. <persRef ref="campbell-archibald">Campbell</persRef>
							dined at the President’s and came in after dinner, and gave us some
							music with <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="greenough-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenough</persRef> left with me a Memorial to Congress; and poor
								<persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">Hassler</persRef> was raving about
							the treatment of him in the house—</p>

							understand that it was desired that I should make the motion in the
							house; that she might have the use of the hall— I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kurtz to say to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Motte, that I remembered with much pleasure the hospitality
							which I had once, some years since enjoyed at her house, and the social

								ref="mott-james">her husband</persRef>, and other friends— That I
							should be happy to see her at my house, and if she desired it would make
							the motion in the house that she should have the use of the hall— But I
							observed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kurtz that M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Motte was known as a distinguished
							abolitionist of Slavery, that there was little difference between her
							opinions upon the subject of Slavery and mine: but he knew how obnoxious
							I was here both in and out of Congress for that very thing: and he would
							consider whether the application for the use of the hall would not be
							more likely to succeed if made by another member— I added that <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker White</persRef> told me last Saturday that
							application had been made to him, for the use of the hall by M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Motte, and that he had granted it— M<hi

							should be a necessity for asking the leave of the house for the use of
							the hall, it would be more likely to succeed if moved by some other
							member than by me—and said he would deliver faithfully my message to

						<p>The weather yesterday morning was so mild that I rode to the capitol,
							without taking an outer garment—but in walking home I found it severely
							cold and as evening came on, I found the Catarrh upon me, I fear for the
							residue of the Winter— This morning I went to the general Post-Office,
							with a Letter of remonstrance from<space/>a minister at South Dedham,
							against the establishment of the Post-Office at that place, for which I
							had applied, with the Petition of <persRef ref="ellis-isaac">Isaac
								Ellis</persRef> and others and a Letter from <persRef
								ref="ellis-william2">William Ellis</persRef> of Dedham— <persRef
								ref="wickliffe-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wickliffe</persRef> promised to suspend the establishment of the
							Post-Office petitioned for, till further information shall be obtained—
							At the house <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne’s</persRef> Resolution to
							instruct the Committee on the judiciary to report a prescribed bill to
							refund <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> fine,
							with interest, to morrow, was debated through the morning hour, a motion
							to lay it on the table having been lost by yeas and nays—91 to 107 There
							is already a Bill on the Calendar, reported by the judiciary Committee
							at the last Session, and referred to the Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, but Bowne wants to signalize himself by the
							combustion of his zeal for the old hero. This has got to be a mere party
							foot-ball; and Bowne is attempting to carry the measure by storm.— And
							it is quite probable he will succeed— The <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>speaker</persRef> against all principle decided that Bowne’s motion
							to instruct the judiciary Committee to report another Bill, while there
							is already one reported by the same Committee now in Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, was in order, has prostrated all rule
							upon the subject, and a succession of previous questions, stifling all
							discussion of the principles involved in the bill is probably the only
							way by which it can be carried— The expiration of the hour however, put
							off the decision again for this day; and Bowne took the floor again for
							the immediate repeal of the Bankrupt Law— He was followed by <persRef
								ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef>—he by <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, and he by <persRef
								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, with intermediate

								>Cushing</persRef> till past 3. O’Clock when <persRef
								ref="gordon-samuel">Gordon</persRef> took the floor, and the house
							adjourned— Cushing’s national venom was ransacked and held up to scorn
							by Meriwether and Pickens, notwithstanding his vehement disclaimers and
							challenges as for specifications— Proffit did all he could to help him
							out of his trouble, and piteously implored the house to allow Cushing an
							hour to explain the real meaning of his speech— But it was too
							bare-faced and flagrant; and if had an hour for explanation he would
							need a week to explain the explanation itself— <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> dined abroad— <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> was here and I had a

							Committee of elections—and <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>
							that it should be printed, which was carried— <persRef

								>President</persRef>— It was referred to the Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union— <persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W.
								Irwin</persRef> moved a resolution instructing the judiciary

							of the retrenchment acts of the last Session, prohibiting the
							publication by the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of

							Missouri— Barnard had moved an amendment, to instruct the Committee to
							report the facts and principles of the case; and <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> had moved to refer the
							Resolution to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—
							Gwin’s speech was a rancorous and malignant party invective upon the
							whigs for a sneaking desire to give the bill the go-by, and spurring
							them to take it into consideration: <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> made a bombastic speech, about the glories of the

							the anniversary, which will be on Sunday he moved that all debate should
							cease on the bill in committee of the whole to-morrow at two O’Clock and
							the questions be taken on the bill and amendments— The <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> decided the motion to be not in
							order; the bill in Committee of the whole not having been debated at
							all— I then rose and addressed the Speaker— Cushing who had moved the
							previous question claimed to hold the floor against me for another
							motion; but the Speaker told him he could not have the floor on two
							motions at once— I spoke about half an hour, till the expiration of the
							morning hour when Everett called for the orders of the day and his

							amusing snarl between <persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Gordon</persRef> and

							commenced a Speech, but the house soon adjourned— <persRef

							announced himself as the agent of the bond holders of the debts of the

							in the payment of their debts, interest and principal. And he asked my
							opinion as to the right of the bond holders to demand this
							interposition, and as to the duty of the federal government to extend
							it— I told him that I had no doubt on either point— That the bond
							holders have the right to demand, and the duty of the federal government
							to grant their interposition to compel the States to pay their honest
							debts— But that the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President of the United

							President— That of course nothing will or can be done at present here,
							on the subject, and I therefore shall attempt nothing, having repeatedly
							expressed my opinion as to the result. He said he had written to the
							President to claim the interposition of the Government, and had not
							received an answer. That he would write to him again; and if he should
							receive no answer he would recommend to the bond holders to apply to
							their own Governments for their interposition— This morning <persRef
								ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis
								Johnson</persRef> came to enquire, if I had examined certain papers
							relating to his administration of the estate of <persRef
								ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>, and to his recovery of

							alledged that he did not approve them— I asked him, what were the parts
							which he disapproved. He said the parts which had a political party
							aspect. I said they all had indirect reference to the Slavery questions—
							At the house <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne’s</persRef> resolution to

							when <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> claimed
							the floor and the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> gave it
							to him— I claimed a whole hour upon my own motion but the Speaker

							not indulged— Nor could <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>
							get up the Bankrupt repeal bill. The rest of the day was devoted to

						<p>I sit up so late at Night reading the Newspapers and Letters, which come
							by the Mail from 9. to 10 in the evening, that I seldom reach my bed
							before midnight, which necessarily delays for two hours at least that of
							my rising— Sex horas somno—says <persRef ref="coke-edward">Lord
								Coke</persRef>, quoting from I know not whom—and that has been for
							more than forty years my rule of life—and the six hours are from ten at
							night to four in the morning— But the rule of life must be modified, by
							external causes, and by social relations with others— If I sit up till
							Midnight I cannot rise before six, and that irregularity leads to the
							laxity of the rule itself—to indulging in morning laziness encroaching
							upon the best hours of the day— <persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Lieutenant
								Wilkes</persRef> was here this morning—extremely solicitous about
							his promotion. A law of the last Session of Congress limits the number
							of Officers of each rank in the Navy that may be appointed, and that
							number is full— On the list of Lieutenants there are only four seniors
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilkes, and the appointment of him as
							a Commander would require the appointment of those also to the same
							rank— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef> has been preparing a resolution to repeal the
							restriction upon the number of officers, so as to allow the appointment
							of five more commanders than are now commissioned— And he and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilkes are urgent with me to offer the
							resolution, which I have consented to do; though I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard that I could seldom consent to

						<p>My catarrhal cough is upon me, I fear for the rest of the winter— The
							weather is so warm and sultry that great part of this day passed without
							requiring a fire in my cabinet— But it was damp and showery like an
							April day I attended the morning public worship at the Hall of the House
							of Representatives, where a Baptist clergyman named <persRef ref="u"
								>Anderson</persRef>, said to be a professor at a College in Maine,
							but now endeavouring to drum up a new baptist church in this city by
							preaching at the Apollo Hall, preached in the Speaker’s chair from 2.
							Corinthians 5.17. “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
							creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new.”
							The discourse was so confined to the first part of the verse; and it was
							the most ingenious exposition of the Christian doctrine of regeneration
							or the new birth. It was altogether argumentative and ingeniously
							metaphysical— It was evident that the preacher has been a close student
							of the school of <persRef ref="edwards-jonathan">Edwards</persRef>. In
							handling his subject he laid down his positions—then stated the
							objections of the unbeliever; and answered them successively.— He
							presented a formal division of the motives to human action—external and
							internal,—and argued that regeneration or the new birth— As conclusive
							evidence of the efficacy of vicarious punishment and thereby of the
							atonement of Christ, he said the truth of any affirmative position, must
							be tested by its effects— Then he averred that whenever the process of
							regeneration took place, it was by a change of the influence of the
							external over the internal motives to action; which he exemplified by
							allusion to the treasury of <persRef ref="arnold-benedict">Benedict
								Arnold</persRef>, produced by the influence of the external motive
							of temptation over the inner man—and by supposing what would have been
							the effect of the same external motive if it had been applied to
								<persRef ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>— The
							internal motive would have rejected the influence of the external one
							and so it is whenever by divine grace and the atonement of Christ the
							inner man is turned from sin to holiness.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Anderson was introduced to me after the service by <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Briggs</persRef>—
							Neither of the chaplains of Congress was present. <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef> dined with us— He and
								<persRef ref="campbell-archibald">Campbell</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard2">Richard D Cutts</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> were here all this
							Evening— Campbell is going off to-morrow morning for New-Orleans.— After
							dinner, I went to S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church where the
							bell rung but there was no service; a shower of rain intervening— I
							called to see <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson</persRef>, who is slowly
							reviving from a third shock of palsy, and looks all but dead— I then
							attended at the Presbyterian Church, where the new supplier of the
							pulpit preached to twenty hearers from 2. Corinthians 10.12: [“]For we
							dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some
							that commend themselves— But they measuring themselves by themselves and
							comparing themselves among themselves are not wise.”</p>

						<p>No visitors. Before going to the house this morning, I called on the
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> at his
							Office, to confer with him upon the Message of the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> relating to the Sandwich
							Islands and to China, referred by the House to the Committee of foreign
							Affairs, and by them to me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster
							referred me to the correspondence between the Commissioners from the
							Sandwich Islands <persRef ref="richards-william2">Richards</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="haalilio-timoteo">Haa-li-lio</persRef>, and himself,
							for the views of the administration favourable to the recognition of the
							Government of those Islands—with which I concurred— I concurred also
							with the recommendations of the message, respecting the expediency of
							instituting a diplomatic mission to China; but enquired what was the
							amount of appropriation desired for both objects— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster thought a salaried Consul, like
							those maintained at the Barbary States would require about 3000 dollars
							and after some conversation on the probable details of expenditure he
							thought an appropriation of 40,000 dollars, would be adequate for the
							mission to China. He said he would send me an estimate in the course of
							the day; together with a despatch from <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Edward Everett</persRef> containing some indications of the present
							views of the British Government concerning their intercourse with China—
							He accordingly sent me the papers in the course of the day, to the
							House— This conference delayed me so that the house had been a quarter
							of an hour in Session, when I reached my seat— I found new game was
							started. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> was vapouring
							against the Committee of Ways and Means, from which <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> the Chairman had reported
							an unanimous Resolution that the exchequer plan reported by the
							Secretary of the Treasury (<persRef ref="forward-walter"
								>Forward</persRef>) at the last Session, and recommended by the
							President ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be adopted (Webster’s.)
							Cushing insisted that the Committee should have reported a positive
							measure— The minority of the Committee consisted of <persRef
								ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, did report an amendment
							instructing the Committee to report a positive bill; in substance the
							sub treasury— Here was a perfect snarl, which brought out after Cushing,
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>, Pickens, <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>

								>Proffit</persRef>, who only took the floor— <persRef
								ref="irwin-william">Irwin</persRef> moved to adjourn and refused to
							withdraw it merely to take the question on printing the reports—
							Fillmore called the yeas and nays on the adjournment, and Irwin finding
							the vote going against him, withdrew his motion till the question to
							print was taken and carried. Botts had given notice that he would
							to-morrow move his charges for the impeachment of President Tyler. When
							Marshall’s speech was cut off by the expiration of his hour he said he
							would take it up again, upon any other question that may come before the
							house, and make his whole speech right through. <persRef

						<p>A person by the name of <persRef ref="u">Hoover</persRef> came and
							enquired if I had received some time last Summer a sample of ink from
								<persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> with a request that I would

							I told him I had received a box with twelve bottles of ink, part I

								>r.</hi> Hoover requesting my acceptance of the ink, and a
							certificate of its good properties.— I had used one bottle of the black
							ink, and had a second ready to be opened— It was very good ink; though
							rather pale at the first writing. I was well satisfied with it for use;
							but I never gave recommendatory certificates of articles for sale, and
							would prefer paying for the bottles of ink that I have taken, and to
							return the box with the rest— He said if I made it a rule to give no

							discussed— Meriwether thought an additional section was necessary,
							appropriation of a squadron of eighty guns to be kept for five years on
							the coast of Africa for the suppression of the Slave trade— I concurred
							in this opinion which was partially discussed, and postponed for further

							Sweetser after some examination of its merits— So was my report of my
							conference with <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> on the Chinese, and Sandwich Islands

							against this movement, and positively refused to support him in it or to
							serve upon his Committee if appointed— I voted however for the

						<p>I attended public worship in the hall of the house of representatives
							where <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef>, the chaplain of the Senate preached from Daniel
							5.27. “TEKEL. Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.”
							This is a formidable text for a preacher to manage—and especially for a
							chaplain to a house of Congress. It is in itself the key to a discourse
							of keen and searching reproof to the auditory— It is the solemn duty of
							a Christian clergyman to administer reproof to his hearers; and it is
							the duty of the hearers to listen to reproof without taking offence—
							This is the great practical obstacle to the faithful and useful
							discharge of the preacher’s duty. If he probes the sinner to the soul,
							he kindles hatred against himself; and loses his hold upon the
							conscience. If he forbears he neglects his holiest duty and betrays the
							cause of his master.— When <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14.</persRef>
							told <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef>, that he had
							often admired the splendid eloquence of other preachers but that <hi
								rend="italic">he</hi> always made him discontented with himself, he
							testified the admirable address, as well as the rare virtue of the
							bishop of Clermont. Read his Petit Carême preached before <persRef
								ref="louis-xv">Louis 15</persRef> in his childhood, and during the
							regency of the profligate <persRef ref="philippe-ii">duke of
								Orleans</persRef>, and you will see the consummate art with which
							the pulpit orator had reproved without offending; and made the vain
							glorious royal sinner ashamed of himself without incurring his
							displeasure— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin told us all that we
							had been weighed in the balances and found wanting—but this is reproach
							and not reproof like the wild goose Satire of <persRef ref="jaques"
								>Jaques</persRef>, flying unclaimed of any man. After the morning
							service I called at <persRef ref="u">M’Daniels</persRef> to visit
								<persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hudson-charles">Hudson</persRef> who lodge there, but neither

								>Clements’s</persRef> and visited <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac
								E. Holmes</persRef>, member of the house from Charleston
							South-Carolina, specially elected to Congress as a wrangler against me,
							but has always treated me with marked civility— I found with him
								<persRef ref="coles-walter">Walter Coles</persRef> an icy member
							from Virginia, and <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">George
								M’Duffie</persRef>, recently arrived, a Senator from South-Carolina,

							resigned— He looks feeble and emaciated, but of the same impenetrable

							from 2. Corinthians 5.17. “If any man be in Christ he is a new
							creature,” the same text, preached from by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson</persRef> last Sunday morning
							at the Capitol— We had long evening visits from a young man named

							I promised to speak to one of the Senators in his behalf— I went to the

								Sedgwick</persRef> came again this morning; to urge me on to call up
							the French claims bill; and to talk generally upon the political topics
							of the day— He listens with much attention to what I say, and tempts me
							to talk too much—all from vanity. At the house it was the day for
							offering Resolutions, and no sooner did the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> name the State of Maine than <persRef
								ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> started with a Resolution
							to instruct the Committee on the judiciary, to report forthwith the

							and the same is hereby repealed— There was a bill already in Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union reported by the same judiciary
							Committee— Nothing can be more explicit than the rule of the house than
							forbids this duplication of bills on the same subject— Objection was
							made by <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> to the reception
							of Clifford’s resolution—and the rule was cited; but the Speaker decided
							that Clifford was in order, and he moved the previous question.— This
							petty by-play to overreach one another, by a war of posts on points of
							order which would disgrace a court of pie-powder, is the ordinary
							practice of all the leading members of the house—a motion was made to
							lay Clifford’s resolution on the table—lost by yeas and nays—81 to 110.
							The motion for the previous question was seconded by tellers 90 to 79.
							and carried by yeas and nays 116 to 88. The Resolution itself was
							carried 128 to 78. Then Barnard referred to the rule of the house that
							Committees cannot sit while the house is in Session, without a special
							order of leave— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved a
							resolution that the committee have leave to sit during the Session of
							the house, to bring in the bill— Barnard objected that this motion was
							not in order, and the speaker so decided— Wise appealed and his appeal
							was laid on the table 104 to 91. The Speaker called Maine again for
							Resolutions and <persRef ref="lowell-joshua">Lowell</persRef> offered
							again the Resolution which had slumped in the hand of Wise—motion to lay
							it on the table lost by yeas and nays 87 to 105.— Main question ordered
							116 to 88. Resolution carried 128 to 78— Barnard went out and soon
							returned— No Quorum of the Committee had been formed, and no bill was

						<p>The hours of the morning lamp were consumed in commencing the preparation

							himself—repulsive because appulsive. Meeting of the Committee of Foreign

							mentioned that I had begun but not finished a report, and would read to

							finish it— They took up Cushing’s bill of appropriations, for carrying
							into execution the Ashburton Treaty— He wished, and had expressed the
							wish to me in a conversation at my seat last Saturday after the
							adjournment of the house, to present an argumentative report in defence
							of the Treaty, and particularly of the Article stipulating for the
							squadron of 80 guns to be kept on the coast of Africa— There was some
							objection in committee to his making this report, because it must be
							debatable in Committee and must occasion delay— Meriwether’s motion to
							add a Section with a specific appropriation for the African Squadron was
							rejected, but Everett renewed it in another form—further consideration
							postponed to the next meeting, fixed for Thursday morning the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> at 11. At the house, I have no room for

							confusion was the result— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">T. F.
								Marshall</persRef> instead of making a speech moved the previous
							question upon Everett’s bill with Cushing’s amendment which were at last

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Danforth’s</persRef> visit to me
							yesterday was to urge me with great importunity to deliver a Lecture at
							Alexandria which I assured him would be absolutely impossible during the
							Session of Congress— He still teized me with inquiries whether I would
							deliver one in March or April—to which I could only promise an answer
							when the time should come— The object is to raise a hundred dollars
							contribution to pay the debt of a beggarly presbyterian church, which he
							has spurred them on to build without means to pay for it—just as he did
							here— This morning <persRef ref="packard-alpheus">Alpheus
								Packard</persRef>, and his brother <persRef ref="packard-joseph"
								>Joseph</persRef> came with a letter of introduction, from their
							father my old classmate <persRef ref="packard-hezekiah">Hezekiah
								Packard</persRef> now 81. years of age. His eldest Son, Alpheus with
							whom he lives, is a professor of Rhetoric Oratory and classical
							literature at Bowdoin College, comes now on a visit to his brother
							Joseph the youngest son at the theological seminary near Alexandria— He
							has seven children living.— <persRef ref="newhall-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef><space/>comes from the territory
							of Ioway, about which he has written a book— He is now going to Boston,
							and thence to England; and he wants a Letter of introduction to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>— He sent me his book
							upon Ioway last fall. I received it in Quincy; but had not time to read
							it— I promised him a Letter to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef> at Boston.— At the house I moved to go into Committee
							of the whole on the State of the Union with a view to call up the bill
							for providing indemnity for the sufferers by French spoliations, before
							1801.— The house went into Committee, but twice refused to take up my
							French claims bill, both times by tellers first 78 to 80 and the second
							time 68 to 78.— The army appropriation bill was then taken up, and the
							nibblers of Economists began upon it— I heard them till I was tired out,
							and then went into the Senate chamber and spoke to <persRef
								ref="huntington-jabez">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntington</persRef> asking his favour to the bills for the relief
							of <persRef key="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="holmes-joseph">Joseph Holmes</persRef>— Huntington said that in
							the case of Holmes there was a shipping paper wanted, and said he would
							speak in behalf of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush to the Senator
							from North-Carolina, <persRef ref="graham-william">Graham</persRef>,
							with whom the bill labours.— I found <persRef ref="choate-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Choate</persRef> speaking with great
							power in answer to one of <persRef ref="benton-thomas">T. H.
								Benton’s</persRef> numberless pugnacious attacks upon the Ashburton
							Treaty— I heard Choate for about half an hour, and he had been speaking
							an hour and a half before— When I returned to the representative hall I
							found the house had adjourned— Evening visits from <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>, and from Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="u">Murray</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">van
								Wagenen</persRef>, much disappointed at the failure of the attempts
							to get up the french claims bill— I was occupied much of the Evening in
							examining the Kentuckian <persRef ref="nicholas-samuel">Samuel Smith

						<p>I finished this morning the report from the Committee of Foreign Affairs,
							to accompany two bills, in compliance with the Message of the <persRef

							to the Sandwich Islands and China— Then attended the meeting of the

								ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepherd</persRef>— Cushing’s bill to carry
							into execution the <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef>
							Treaty was amended by an additional section requiring that the cost of
							the stipulated squadron, on the coast of Africa, should be paid from the
							annual naval appropriations— By a report from the <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, in answer to a
							Resolution of the Senate his estimate of the cost of the African
							Squadron is 440000 dollars for the vessels 40000 dollars for repairs,
							wear and tear and 240000 dollars a year for maintaining it— Half a
							million of first cost, and 300000 dollars a year for the five years
							stipulated will fall short of the real cost— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cushing repeated his wish to prepare a report in
							justification of the Treaty with the bill— There was some reluctance in
							the Committee; from apprehension of delay and perhaps final dissent of a
							majority of the Committee—but I urged the fair claim of the Treaty to be
							defended by a report, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing was
							authorised to prepare one— I read my report on the Sandwich island and
							China Message, and was authorised to present it to the house, with an
							amendment suggested by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett.— The
							bills are not yet prepared.— The Committee adjourned to next Tuesday. In
							the house after the usual quantity of miscellaneous trifles, Cushing in
							the process of the call of the Committees, reported the bill of
							appropriations for carrying into execution the Ashburton Treaty, and
							bustled about with explanations speech, like to attract notice.— The
							bill was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union— The <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>-fine
							Resolution offered by <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef>, with
								<persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard’s</persRef> amendment and mine
							(the immediate question in debate[)] came up next— <persRef

							dealing this day only with <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J.
								Ingersoll’s</persRef> preposterous pretension that the Courts of Law
							have no power to punish summarily for contempt, completely demolished
							it— The morning hour expired and <persRef ref="botts-john"
								>Botts</persRef> took the floor for the next debatable day— And now
							came <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit’s</persRef> motion to
							reconsider the repeal of the bankrupt Law, made to give Cushing an hour
							for reply— He took the hour, and made his case worse by his use of the
							hour— He assailed furiously <persRef ref="fessenden-william"
								>Fessenden</persRef>, and <persRef ref="thompson-richard"
								>Thompson</persRef> of Indiana, who had severely handled him—
							Fessended replied gently, but keenly— Thompson agonized to get the floor
							but failed— <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef>
							followed, each an hour till near 5. O’Clock. The <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>, and <persRef

								ref="cowen-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cowen</persRef>
							of the committee of claims who had charge of it was willing to postpone

							Florida and on that for the relief of the heirs of <persRef
								ref="renault-philippe">Philip Renaut</persRef>, which superseded

							was again here, lamenting that the house, after going into Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union at my motion, with notice that my
							object was to take up the French claims bill twice refused to take it
							up— He told me that <persRef ref="nicholas-samuel">Samuel Smith
								Nicholas</persRef>, the Kentuckian author of the pamphlet on martial
							Law—was a relation of his—(maternal first cousin) He said he had written
							to him of his principles about martial Law, but he did not agree with
							him; and mentioned that <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">his
								father</persRef> in the defence of Baltimore in 1814 had burnt
							sundry houses of individuals— At the house, on the call for Reports from
							Committees <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C. Winthrop</persRef>
							from the Committee of commerce presented a report on the memorial of
								<persRef ref="rich-benjamin">Benjamin rich</persRef> and<space/>others
							of Boston, remonstrating against the practise of imprisoning coloured

									>r</hi> Rayner</persRef> of North Carolina had prepared a
							minority report, and the chairman of the Committee <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef>, dissenting from both
							reports would probably present his views separately— Winthrop’s report
							closed with several resolutions which were read. He moved that both
							reports be printed and laid on the table for consideration hereafter,
							and to avoid debate called for the previous question. The Slave
							representation were instantly in a flame— Rayner’s report closed with a
							Resolution that the Committee be discharged from the further
							consideration of the subject— Kennedy moved that 5000 copies of both
							reports be printed. <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Jacob
								Thompson</persRef> objected and Kennedy withdrew his motion but

							objected to the printing of the majority report at all, and moved to lay
							the motion to print on the table—lost by yeas and natys 72 to 114—
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved to cease

						<p><persRef ref="whitney-franklin">Franklin Whitney</persRef> brought with

							complaining against <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">Henry L.

							and asking for the appointment of a select committee with power to send
							for persons and papers to investigate the charge— I told him that I
							would read the petition, and if he insisted on it would present it, but
							if a Committee should be appointed it would be impossible for me to
							serve upon it— The party at <persRef ref="kerr-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr’s</persRef> last evening was of
							Gentlemen—members of Congress and others— <persRef ref="kerr-elizabeth"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Kerr</persRef> was there—and
								<persRef ref="greenough-louisa">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Greenough</persRef> the <persRef ref="greenough-horatio"
								>sculptor’s</persRef> wife—no other Lady.— I was none the better
							this morning for the supper of last evening— <persRef
								ref="fauntleroy-thomas">Major Fauntleroy</persRef> of the second
							regiment of dragoons came this morning, most urgently to remonstrate
							against the conversion of that regiment into a dismounted rifle regiment
							which by the act of the last Session of Congress is to take effect on
							the next 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March. This was one of the
							Southern compromises screwed by the Senate upon the house, which had
							directed the regiment to be disbanded; and there is now before the house
							a resolution moved by <persRef ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> of
							Mississippi, to repeal the provision for dismounting the regiment— The
							major says that if they are to be dismounted they had better be
							disbanded at once— He gave me much useful information concerning the
							character of that western population, of which the yankee nation do not
							even dream—but it thoroughly convinces me that the regiment ought to be
							disbanded; and that it will not even be dismounted— At the house, on the
							call for reports from Committees, several of them were upon subjects of
							deep interest, but of which little notice was taken owing to the
							transcendent influence of the Slave representation— <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> with the aid of <persRef

								>Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> and <persRef ref="holmes-isaac"
								>Holmes</persRef>, but it was carried by yeas and nays 151 to 15.
								<persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> moved a

							amendment, but failed— <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner’s</persRef>
							motion to print 5000 extra copies of the two reports from the committee
							of commerce on the imprisonment of Southern coloured Seamen in
							South-Carolina was called up by me, and adopted without opposition:
							Rayner himself was not in the house— The bill for the relief of the
							inhabitants of West Florida came up— I spoke about half an hour against
							it and concluded by moving to lay it on the table. <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tiffany</persRef> read a small
							portion of the episcopal morning service, without the litany or any part
							of the communion—no singing— He read the chapter from the old Testament
							of the first lesson, and preached a very short Sermon, from Hebrews
							12.22 “But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living
							God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels,
							23. To the general Assembly of the church of the first born, which are
							written in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of
							just men made perfect.” The whole service was performed in less than an
							hour, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tiffany’s exposition of his
							text was very superficial— In commenting upon any passage in the
							Scriptures, taken for a text, it seems to me that the preacher should
							consider it, in its relations with the context, and the general scope of
							the whole chapter from which it is selected— This chapter for example
							contains a most solemn and fervid exhortation to steadfastness,
							endurance, patience, perseverance, under every persecution and every
							affliction— It appeals to the example of patient endurance given by the
							saviour himself—he likens the afflictions of the faithful to the
							chastisement of an affectionate parent to this child, and in exquisitely
							beautiful imagery paints the Christian in his pilgrimage as arriving,
							not at the terrific mountain of the wilderness Sinai, whence amid
							terrific thunder and lightening, and the sound of the trumpet, which
							mortal man could not abide, but at the mild and cheering foot of mount
							Sion, the permanent immovable seat of the holy temple, in the city of
							Jerusalem—then passing on to heaven, to the innumerable company of
							angels, to God, to the Spirits of just men made perfect—and afterwards
							to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant—what a lesson of more than
							Roman fortitude!— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the prayers for the third evening after the
							Epiphany, and preached from Isaiah 60.19. “The sun shall be no more thy
							light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto
							thee: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy
							glory.”— I had heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley on this text
							before— After Church I went over to see <persRef

						<p>The racking catarrhal cough which afflicts and oppresses me, abridges the

							dispirited, drowsy and lethargic I extinguished it, and took to my bed
							again, and by mercy got two hours more of sleep which refreshed me for
							the labours of the day; but I had on my table a mass of newspapers and

							into them absorbed hour after hour leaving me scarce ten minutes for
							breakfast, till meridian day summoned me to the capitol— My record of
							yesterday was untouched—several indispensable tasks of business were
							procrastinated— <persRef ref="newhall-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

							New-York Union, the <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> paper

							charging the Committee of Ways and Means, with having reported against

							contrary to the opinion and disposition of the moderate whigs and

							caucus held the night before at which a Letter from <persRef

							passage of any bill for settling the currency and restoring the credit
							of the country— Fillmore declared the whole statement an absolute

						<p><persRef ref="whitney-franklin">Franklin Whitney</persRef> came again
							this morning; and took his petition of impeachment against <persRef

							patents as he belongs to New-Bedford in <persRef ref="burnell-barker"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnell’s</persRef> district. I
							advised him to get him to present it, and have it referred to the
							committee on the judiciary— He said he had wished me to present it and
							have it referred to a select Committee, of which I should be chairman;
							but I told him that would be impossible; but if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Burnell should decline to present his petition, I would
							present it— He is bitterly resentful against the commissioner of patents
							Ellsworth, and believes him to have been in this case venally corrupt,
							which I cannot.— I attended the meeting of the Committee of foreign
							affairs— Present Adams, <persRef ref="granger-francis"

							and the other of 40000 dollars, to enable the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President of the United States</persRef> to establish the future
							commercial relations of the United States with China, on terms of equal
							reciprocity— I was authorised by the unanimous vote of the members
							present to report to the house the two bills as I had prepared them,
							which I did on the call of the Committee for reports— The Bills were
							read twice, referred to the committee of the whole house on the state of
							the Union, and with the report ordered to be printed— In Committee
							Granger made a verbal report on the claim of <persRef
								ref="ridgely-charles">Commodore Ridgely</persRef>, that two members
							thought it should not only be rejected, but that a report should be made
							to the house, exposing the conduct of the Commodore to severe censure,
							for daring to present such a claim. I prevailed on the majority however
							to consent to a simple report that Commodore Ridgely have leave to
							withdraw his petition— In the house, <persRef ref="russell-william"
								>William Russell</persRef> of Ohio offered a Resolution that the
							hour of meeting of the house after next Monday should be 11. O’Clock
							till further order. <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef>

							Russell shook his finger at Barnard, and said I’ll mark you— <persRef

							Tyler <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> Exchequer—
							Adjourned at 3. I rode home— Dusty gale— <persRef ref="newhall-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newhall</persRef> came, and I

							shewed me the papers of one claim on Amelia Island upon which between 5

							with his usual vindictive malignity eager to score Marshall return—
							Marshall was I suppose purposely absent, and Wise’s hot shot fell short
							of their object— He was cut short in a ludicrous attitude, with his arms
							expanded in the very delivery of a magnificent trope as he thought, by
								<persRef ref="atherton-charles">Charles G. Atherton</persRef>,

							heart.”— The reverend gentleman appeared not to understand his text, for
							he commented upon it as if the speaker was God—whereas it was <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>— The whole chapter is an
							affectionate paternal exhortation to temperance from sensuality—from
							eating—from drinking—from women— Temperance and moderation in the
							pursuit of wealth thriftiness and industry, benevolence and charity to
							the orphan poor, filial affection and observance of paternal precepts
							and example are all enjoined in this chapter—and the pathetic
							apostrophe, my Son give me thy heart is more impressive from the lips of
							the earthly parent, than in the gratuitous transfer of it to the Lord
							Jehovah himself. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s manner is cold
							and artificially emphatic— After church I went over and passed half an

						<p><persRef ref="morris-gideon">Gideon Morris</persRef> is one of the
							western pioneers who told me he had a Cherokee family, and has some
							interest in a bill now before the house for carrying into effect a
							Treaty with the Cherokees— He came to ask my influence to get it
							through, and referred me to <persRef ref="williams-joseph2">Joseph L.
								Williams</persRef> of Tennessee, for information concerning it—
							Williams spoke to me about it; but the confusion in the house was so
							great, and I was so much absorbed in the business before it, that I knew
							just as much of the Cherokee Treaty and Gideon Morris’s claim after he
							finished as before he began. I must wait till the bill comes up—
								<persRef ref="brown-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Brown</persRef> came with two gentlemen from Lowell named <persRef
								ref="u;u">Bixby</persRef>, and whom he introduced to me, and with
							whom I was talkative— At the house, this was the day to call the States
							for Resolutions, and I had prepared two—calling on the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for information respecting the
							exploit of <persRef ref="jones-thomas">Commodore Thomas ap Catesby
								Jones</persRef>, at Monterey in California—but <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> immediately moved to go into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, to take up their exchequer bill— The
							house taking no heed to my remonstrance, went floundering into Committee
								<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> in the chair. Wise
							moved to postpone the army appropriation bill, and take up his beloved
							exchequer— But <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Filmore</persRef>
							insisted upon taking up the army appropriation bill, and the Committee
							refused to postpone it by a vote of 71 to 82— <persRef
								ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> of Illinois moved an
							amendment of 20000 dollars, for a military survey from the council
							bluffs to the mouth of Columbia river.— After some discussion in which
							Cushing avowed his ravenous appetite for the occupation of the Oregon
							Reynolds’s motion was rejected, and Fillmore seeing that debate would
							waste time, moved that the Committee should rise for the sole purpose of
							voting that debate should cease and the bill be reported to the house
							this day at 3 O’Clock which he afterwards consented to extend to half
							past 3—all this was done as Fillmore proposed— In the interval while the
							house was resumed I offered my two resolutions—but <persRef
								ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> objected to one, and <persRef
								ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> to the other and they were
							not received— There was a snarling debate on the appropriations for West
							Point Academy; many proposed amendments rejected, and some trifles
							adopted— The Bill was at last reported to the house, and driven by the
							screws of the previous question to vote that the question should be
							taken on its passage <hi rend="italic">now</hi>—but then a motion to
							adjourn was carried in spite of <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Llandaff
								W. Andrews’s</persRef> stare, and yeas and nays— There had been two
							reports from the Committee of Ways and Means, against the Memorials for
								<persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson’s</persRef>
							200,000,000 of Land stock to pay the State debts— Cushing cram’d the
							reading of the majority report down the throat of the house, at the cost
							of many a curse— <persRef ref="whitney-franklin">Franklin
								Whitney</persRef> was here this evening.</p>

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs. Present Adams, <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef>— Absent <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepherd</persRef>— I read the Note of the
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> to me,
							suggesting the wish, that the restrictions on the application of the sum
							of 40000 dollars proposed to be appropriated for the mission to China,
							should be struck out from the bill—and after some discussion, I obtained
							authority 5 to 2 to move in the house to strike out the restrictions. I
							then requested to be instructed to move in the house, in the name of the
							Committee the two Resolutions, moved by me in the house yesterday; but
							objected to by <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> and not received,
							calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for
							information, correspondence, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
							instructions to <persRef ref="jones-thomas">Commodore Thomas ap Catesby
								Jones</persRef>, relating to his invasion of the Californias and
							capture of Monterey on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last
							October.— Question was made whether the usual exception of what the
							President might deem it incompatible with the public interest to
							communicate should not be inserted. I said I had left it out
							purposely—the act of Commodore Jones being avowedly War, and that being
							exclusively within the Constitutional power of Congress to declare, I
							thought the usual exception would be improper. Granger said that on a
							former occasion he had insisted on the insertion of the usual exception;
							but as this was a case of actual War the thought the exception should
							not be inserted— Cushing questioned what he calls the jurisdiction of
							the Committee—the subject not having been referred to them by the house—
							But my motion was carried 5 to 2. Holmes and Cushing voting <hi
								rend="italic">No</hi>— Cushing asked and obtained leave to move in
							the house to take the French claims bill out of the Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union next Tuesday.— At the house on the call
							of the Committees for Reports, <persRef ref="pearce-james">James A.
								Pearce</persRef> from the Committee on the judiciary presented a
							report on the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>
							fine case, which occasioned no small agitation— Pearce moved the
							printing of 5000 extra copies, and also of <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll’s</persRef> minority report
							of last Summer: but objection was made, and the order to print was only
							for the usual number— The morning hour expired, and territorial business
							was the special order of the day.— A bill to authorize the western
							States to sell their Lands reserved for schools was driven through
							against the warm remonstrances of <persRef ref="howard-jacob"
								>Howard</persRef> of Michigan, and after a heart-rending ovation of
							the younger <persRef ref="dodge-augustus">Dodge</persRef>, delegate from
							Ioway, a bill to pay Ioway Militia for battling against Missouri
							usurpation, rejected last Summer was now reconsidered and passed.— I
							delivered at the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk’s</persRef> Office,
								<persRef ref="whitney-franklin">Franklin Whitney’s</persRef>
							petition and papers, and asked their reference to the judiciary
							Committee—</p>
