                        <p>I had received last evening a Letter from <persRef ref="king-rufus4"
                                >Rufus King</persRef> President of the young men’s association at
                            Albany dated yesterday, and inviting me to that place, and to deliver a
                            Lecture to that association, any day this week which might suit my
                            convenience— I answered the Letter this morning by a declinature— I
                            attended public worship this morning, with <persRef ref="brooks-peter"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>, my grandson, and <persRef
                                ref="loring-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef>
                            with <persRef ref="loring-caleb2;loring-charles2">his two Sons</persRef>
                            and daughter <persRef ref="loring-jane">Jane</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aymar</persRef> with <persRef
                                ref="u">his wife</persRef> and her Sister, at the Baptist church,
                            within half a quarter of a mile of our hotel. <persRef
                                ref="bentley-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Bentley</persRef> went with us, and we filled his pew.— The preacher
                            was an orthodox congregationalist from New-York named <persRef ref="u"
                                >Hall</persRef>— His text was Deuteronomy 32.31. “For their rock, is
                            not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.”— The Sermon
                            was a discourse as regular and methodical as <persRef ref="claude-jean"
                                >Claude</persRef> himself could have composed— He began by stating
                            that in the pursuit of happiness, the natural impulse of all mankind, it
                            was necessary that there should be some foundation, and that in the
                            figurative language of Scripture, a rock was the emblem to denote a
                            solid foundation, and the sand to signify a frail and treacherous one—
                            The text is in the song of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>
                            pronounced immediately before he was ordered to go up to mount Abarim to
                            see the Land of Canaan, and to die. By our Rock in the text he means the
                            Lord Jehovah, and by <hi rend="italic">their</hi> rock, the false gods
                            of the Canaanites— The comparison is an exhortation against that
                            idolatry into which his prophetic eye saw that his countrymen would soon
                            fall— The conclusion to be drawn from it was, the superiority of the
                            foundation for the pursuit of happiness, of the believer, over that of
                            the unbeliever, as estimated by the infidel himself— This position he
                            maintained by seven distinct and successive arguments or heads of
                            discourse: in a plain and concise style with due gravity and cogent
                            reasoning— Earnest without vehemence, and sufficiently animated without
                            declamation— The church is very small, and the floor pews were well
                            filled, with a respectably looking and well dressed Auditory. The
                            singing from the Baptist hymn-book was by a small choir of men and
                            women, in which some of the tenants of the floor pews, joined their
                            voices— The preacher gave notices of two prayer meetings in the course
                            of the week— Also that the communion would be administered this day at
                            the usual hour; and to which the members of other <hi rend="italic"
                                >evangelical</hi> churches were invited— There is a presbyterian
                            church in the valley below the hotel at which we lodge—where I intended
                            to have gone this afternoon—but their service begins at One O’Clock, and
                            the dinner at the hotel, is served at 2. I expected a second service at
                            the church where we attended this morning; but there was none— Before
                            sunset, I <pb n="2" type="ms"/>took a warm bath, with the temperature of
                            the water at 100. but it was not so satisfactory as that of yesterday—
                            The baths are hot or cold tempered to the order of the bather— The
                            attraction to the place is a single cold spring, at 72 degrees of
                            <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef>, gushing from the side of the mountain, and collected in a
                            marble cistern in the front yard whence it is distributed by pipes to
                            several bathing closets below— In the course of the day I read the
                            pamphlet I had purchased at the Shaker shop— A brief exposition of the
                            established principles and regulations of the united Society of
                            Believers called Shakers—printed at Canterbury New Hampshire this year.
                            A second improved edition: the first having been composed for the
                            defence of the Society to arrest the passage of some persecuting bill,
                            introduced into the New-York Legislature— They complain that their
                            principles and practices have been very grossly misrepresented, but
                            their exposition veils under indefinite generalities all their most
                            exceptionable practices. Not a word is said about that mode of worship,
                            exclusively adopted by them which consists of an aukward and clumsy
                            fashion of dancing.— They utterly deny that they ever require the
                            separation of families desirous of admission into their Society— And
                            they give the following list of the virtues and graces of which they
                            require the preliminary pledge from every candidate for admission among
                            them 1. A life of innocence and purity; implying entire abstinence from
                            all sensual and carnal gratifications. (This is the monkish vow of
                            chastity) 2. Love—spiritual Love— 3. Peace 4 Justice. 5. Holiness. 6.
                            Goodness. 7 Truth— This is the perfection of the human character; but in
                            the application of these principles they discard all the sympathies of
                            nature to substitute the unbounded devotion of soul and body to the
                            artificial organized family of the Society— Outrageous as is this
                            sacrifice of all the ties of Nature to the paradoxes of fancy; it is not
                            a solitary instance of the abuse of reason— If the Shakers admit whole
                            families into their community, without formally breaking them up, it is
                            under the unqualified condition of inviolate chastity binding upon every
                            member of the family, the Parents as well as the children and this is
                            disingenuously gauzed over in the exposition— Another sharp question
                            between them and the world is the disposal of property conveyed to them
                            by converts who afterwards wish and demand to have it restored to them,
                            and to withdraw themselves from the institution— The other pamphlet by a
                            clergyman named <persRef ref="dunlavy-john">John Dunlavy</persRef> now
                            dead; and is a formidable and elaborate religious argument against
                            marriage, founded upon the scriptural authority of Jesus Christ and his
                            apostles.— It is an example added to numberless others of subtle and
                            ingenious absurdity—</p>

                        <p>I had a night not of undisturbed repose, which I attributed to the warm
                            bath of last evening. But the discomforts of it soon passed away.— I
                            went up on the Lookout on the top of the house, and saw the Sunrise
                            above the Eastern hill tops, at 5 minutes past five— He was shining on
                            the tops successively of all the surrounding hills for about half an
                            hour before his first beam met my eye. A person by the name of <persRef
                                ref="u">Spelman</persRef> came on to the Piazza, and spoke to me
                            from outside of my chamber window— He said he belonged to Albany and
                            happening to be for some days at Pittsfield, he had heard of my passing
                            through that Town and that I was here.— And that never having seen me,
                            and thinking it probable he might never have an opportunity of seeing me
                            again, He took his horse this morning and came over from Pittsfield with
                            the determination to see me, and thake hands with me; and having
                            accomplished that purpose he would detain me no longer, and took his
                            leave— After breakfast, with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi

                            <persRef ref="loring-caleb2;loring-charles2">two sons</persRef>,
                                <persRef ref="jackson-edward3">Edward</persRef>, son of <persRef
                                ref="jackson-patrick">Patrick Jackson</persRef>, and <persRef
                                ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>, I rode in a Barouche to
                            the tunnel of the Western rail-road, nine miles distant from Lebanon,
                            through the valley stretching from the Southern end of Columbia Hall.
                            The tunnel is a subterraneous excavation 40 feet wide and 200 feet long
                            through a rock of solid marble, like that of the coal mine in Silesia or
                            that of the catacombs at Paris except that they have no outlet, while
                            this pierces through the rock from side to side forming an arch about 12
                            feet high with a mass of earth covered with a forest of trees over it—
                            This is the most extraordinary achievement on the western rail-road; and
                            is said to have been projected and effected, by an Englishman and work
                            men in the compass of one year. The road to it is very good, partly
                            through the valley between the two ranges of mountains cultivated on
                            both sides with pasture and meadowlands, Rye, Indian corn, Potatoes,
                            Oats, and very little wheat with scattered groves of Chesnut, black
                            walnut, Sugar Maples—locust, Sycamore, Oaks black and white, hemlock and
                            pine trees— We returned, reaching Columbia Hall just before one. We had
                            expected a Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
                            by the mail this afternoon; but were disappointed; we concluded
                            nevertheless to depart at 7. to morrow morning; return to the Western
                            rail-road, and proceed to Saratoga— The Daily Advertiser of this morning
                            from Boston, brought the account of the Shipwreck last Monday of the
                            Cunard Steamer Columbia, on black ledge, near Seal Island on the coast
                            of Nova Scotia— Also the deaths of <persRef ref="allston-washington"

                        <p>My birth day—76.</p>
                        <p>We had been disappointed in not receiving a Letter yesterday from
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, with intelligence
                            from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> at
                            Washington; and we had strongly inclined to stay another day at Lebanon,
                            to take the chance of another Mail from Boston— But <persRef
                                ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef>
                            adhered to the determination upon which we had agreed, to start this
                            morning at 7.— We accordingly did so—but I rose at 4 and completed the
                            writing of my journal of yesterday which I had begun last evening, in
                            time to pack up my trunk before breakfast— Just as we were about leaving
                            the house, <persRef ref="bentley-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Bentley</persRef> delivered to me a Letter addressed to
                            me, covering one from my Son to <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
                                wife</persRef>, written on Saturday last, mailed at Quincy, and
                            which came this morning by the mail from Albany— It eased us of much
                            anxiety, and indicated that my wife proposed to come home this week— We
                            took leave of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Crocker</persRef> and rode in a carriage about 10 miles to Canaan a
                            depot of the Western rail-road one mile east of the tunnel which we had
                            visited yesterday. Here we waited nearly three quarters of an hour till
                            the train of Cars from Boston and Springfield came up, in which we took
                            our Seats and proceeded to Greenbush opposite to Albany, passing through
                            Chatham and Kinderhoek on the way. We passed through the tunnel; but it
                            was like leaping into a dark cellar, and in half a minute out of it
                            again— We should not even have seen what it was, but for our yesterday’s
                            visit— At Greenbush, we crossed in a Steam ferry-boat to Albany, and
                            immediately passed into another Steamer came up to Troy, which we
                            reached at one p.m. and where we stop’d at the United States Hotel kept
                            by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Watrous</persRef>— In
                            the Cars at Canaan, we had found among the passengers, <persRef

                            20, afflicted with rhumatism; and <persRef ref="duggan-william">Doctor

                            city of 33000 inhabitants and Troy, distant from it but 7 miles, with a
                            population of 25000 we met the crowd and bustle of a swarming hive of
                            bees— After a short visit to <persRef ref="dickinson-ann">M<hi

                            train of Cars for Saratoga, where after passing through Ballstown we
                            arrived at 6 O’Clock p.m. We took lodgings at the Union, said to be more
                            retired than the United States hotel—there being not more than 200
                            fellow travellers at the house.— Those at the other being much more
                            numerous— At one of the depots on the way from Troy we had met <persRef

                        <dateline>Saratoga Wednesday 12 July 1843.— Bemis’s heights.</dateline>
                        <p><date>12. IV.15. </date>Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>I have got into a great crowd of Strangers; a position always painful to
                            me, and for which from a perpetual want of presence of mind, I am not
                            fitted— After finishing the record of yesterday I walked out—took a
                            tumbler of Congress water, at the spring and found it a very weak
                            chalybeate, and walked along the public grounds to a hillock on the
                            summit of which was a circular railroad wheeled round the movement bein
                            effected by the person riding— Returning to the Hotel I met <persRef
                                ref="fletcher-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Fletcher</persRef> who conducted me to the<space/>Spring and Bathing
                            house. Before and after breakfast many of the visitors at the house,
                            strangers were introduced, neither whose names nor persons remain on my
                            memory. Two gentlemen belonging to the village came and said many
                            citizens of the place were desirous of paying their personal respects to
                            me, for which they asked me to fix a time; which I did for 10 to-morrow
                            morning. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Huntington</persRef> proposed to me to go out with him and some
                            other gentlemen to view the battleground between <persRef
                                ref="gates-horatio">Gates</persRef> and <persRef ref="burgoyne-john"
                                >Burgoyne</persRef>; and the place where the British army
                            surrendered— Accordingly, eight of us went out in two carriages, among
                            whom were <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Grinnell</persRef>, <persRef ref="breese-thomas">Captain
                                Breese</persRef> of the Navy, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Howard</persRef>, a member of the
                            Council of Massachusetts, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Russell</persRef> with two others 12 or 13 Miles, to
                                <persRef ref="bemis-jotham">Bemis’s</persRef> heights, which our
                            drivers had some difficulty in finding— On the way out we crossed the
                            Saratoga lake in a flat ferry boat, and shortly before reaching the
                            heights, we passed by a very small and mean looking hovel in front of
                            which stood an old man, who the driver told us was a hundred years old—
                            We turned back and enquired whether he had been at the surrender of
                            Burgoyne— He said no—he was at that time stationed in Connecticut; but
                            that he was a Canadian, born at Quebec one hundred years old last month—
                            That on the appearance of the American army before Quebec in 1776 he
                            joined them; was present at the death of <persRef
                                ref="montgomery-richard">Montgomery</persRef>, and served in the
                            American army through the whole revolutionary War— I perceived that he
                            spoke English with a French accent and spoke to him in French, which he
                            spoke with native familiarity— He said that on the death of Montgomery
                                <persRef ref="carleton-guy">Carlton</persRef> cried like a child— He
                            said also that he had been with <persRef ref="washington-george">General
                                Washington</persRef> in the campaign through the Jersies, and spoke
                            of a victory at Elizabeth town, at which 36 pieces of cannon, with 900
                            barrels of <unclear>flour</unclear> as many of rum, and as many hogsheads of wine had
                            been taken— On the heights we found a gentleman farmer named <persRef
                                ref="u">Neilson</persRef>, 54 years old, who told us <persRef
                                ref="neilson-john">his father</persRef> had lived in the house where
                            he now lives, and that <persRef ref="poor-enoch">Gen<hi
                                    rend="superscript">l</hi> Poor</persRef> and another had
                            quartered in his kitchen— He had two maps, upon which he pointed out to
                            us every position occupied by the several detachment both of Gates’s and
                            of Burgoyne’s armies in the two actions of 19. September and of 7.
                            October 1777 <pb n="6" type="ms"/>1777. We had with us the volume of
                                <persRef ref="marshall-john">Marshall’s</persRef> life of
                            Washington, containing the narrative of both those actions, and compared
                            it with the positions pointed out to us, by M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Neilson— He walked out with us to the house of a
                            neighbouring farmer named <persRef ref="u">Walker</persRef> a native of
                            Smithfield, Rhode-Island, but settled here these 38 years— Near his
                            house stands a Bass wood tree, from 20 to 25 years old—apparently from
                            an old stump, and surrounded by <unclear>successers</unclear>. It was under the original
                            stock of that tree then old and large that the British General <persRef
                                ref="fraser-simon">Frazier</persRef> received his mortal wound.—
                            Burgoyne had descended along the Southern banks of the Hudson river,
                            till he came to the spot where the village of the Springs now stands,
                            when he crossed the river to assail and disperse the force which was
                            then assembling on the Eastern banks to meet him— Burgoyne had assumed
                            his position in August and on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            September he made a general assault upon the American lines which
                            extended down to the river— The battle began at two in the afternoon,
                            and was -tinued until the darkness of night came on; when the two
                            parties remained in possession each, of their own intrenchments as
                            before— On the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October Burgoyne made
                            his second attack, later in the day, and that also was terminated by the
                            night when both parties again retired to their own intrenchments—but
                            that day decided the fate of the War— A post had been assumed by a
                            detachment of Gates’s army South and East of all the lines to outflank
                            the British, and commanded by <persRef ref="morgan-daniel">Col<hi
                                    rend="superscript">l.</hi> Morgan</persRef>— A corps of the
                            British army was despatched to force this position, commanded by General
                            Frazier— They met and a conflict of 52 minutes ensued. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Neilson conducted us to the stone wall
                            bounding the road, overshadowed by the Bass wood tree within the
                            enclosure: stretching his arm over the wall and pointing to the spot
                            where Morgan’s intrenchments had stood—here—said he—bloody work was done
                            on that day— Then pointing to a knoll about 30 rods from the tree, he
                            said, a rifle ball from that knoll, struck General Frazier and he fell.
                            His corps discouraged by the loss of their leader, retired to their
                            intrenchments, and the fortune of the day was decided— The next day
                            Burgoyne commenced his retreat and reached a place now called
                            Schuylerville distant from the heights about ten miles, pursued by Gates
                            and his army—swelling by daily accessions of militia, till Burgoyne with
                            about 7500 men left of his force, was completely hemmed in and on the
                                17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October surrendered by

                            also many other waifs and derelicts of War which have been found from

                        <p>Though I rise at 4. O’Clock and improve as well I can the morning hours
                            in writing I cannot find time for the daily record, and fall into
                            arrears. There is always so much to record, that the difficult is in the
                            selection, and the judgment in selecting right. At 6. yesterday morning
                            I had been startled by the sound of a band of Music, close to the
                            Congress Spring, within sight and hearing of my chamber window— They
                            played a succession of delightful airs for the space of an hour, while
                            at the same time a cluster of persons were coming and going to and from
                            the Spring, under a shed, where three or four boys were drawing from the
                            well tumblers, nested in tin cases the water, each of which was taken
                            and quaffed by the successive visitors who drank and departed. This
                            morning at precisely 6 the same Scene presented itself— I wrote and
                            listened to the music till 7. and then went and took a warm bath
                            <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 96. at the Hamilton Spring. But that as I afterwards found
                            was not the proper time for the bath; but at 11. or 12 before dinner. At
                            the bathing house, placarded a notification signed by <persRef
                                ref="walworth-reuben">Chancellor Walworth</persRef> and<space/>other
                            citizens of the village, that I would receive at the Union Hall at 10.
                            O’Clock, any visitors who wished to call on me— And accordingly from 10
                            to 11—about 500 persons, men women and children of both sexes and all
                            ages came; were introduced to me by Chancellor Wolworth, <persRef

                            of the house, or themselves— I shook hands with them all, and when the
                            stream was drained, I addressed a few words of thanks to those of them
                            who had remained in the drawing room where I had received them and they
                            departed— At noon <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Daniel D Barnard</persRef> who had visited me last
                            evening, and promised to come and go with me to return the visit of the
                            Chancellor, did come, with two other Gentlemen, and as the chancellor
                            had been with me, and requested me to dispense with the formality of
                            returning his visit we went to the flat rock, or pavilion spring, where
                            I took a tumbler of the water— Returning we stop’d at the United States
                            Hotel, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard lodges and I took
                            leave of him. At 2. we dined, and at 3. our party, with <persRef

                            assembled in front of the Union hall to witness our departure, and just
                            before 9 in the evening, arrived at the lake house, in Caldwell at the
                            head of Lake George 27 miles from Saratoga Springs. The road heavy and
                            tedious, deep sand most of the way and high hills— At 18 miles from the
                            Springs we stop’d to examine Glen’s falls, which are very
                            considerable.</p>

                        <p>Caldwell.— I was roused as daylight came on by the consultations of a
                            tribe of Swallows nested on the edges of the roof of the portico
                            fronting the east under my open chamber-window, who made a noise equal
                            to that of the hum of men, on the royal exchange at London— I saw the
                            Sun-rise, partially beclouded, over the mountain forests beyond Lake
                            George We breakfasted at the lake-house kept by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Shirrell</persRef>, and embarked, at a
                            landing at the foot of the garden before the house— We parted from the
                            landing, and shortly before noon at the head of Lake George, where it is
                            connected by a small brook with Lake Champlain— We rode in Carriages,
                            between two and three miles, to the ruins of the fort of Ticonderoga;
                            but on alighting to survey them were overtaken by a heavy shower, which
                            drove us from the ruined walls to an adjoining hotel where we stop’d and
                            dined— Lake George is 34 miles long, and at two or three places from
                            three to four miles wide; but on the average not more than one— Its
                            course is between two ranges of lofty mountains, ascending from the
                            border of the lake from 1200 to 2500 feet, covered with dark forests of
                            Oak and pine, but of trees neither remarkable for height or
                            circumference— On the sides of many of the mountains, there are frequent
                            spaces of precipices of 150 or 200 feet perpendicular like the wall of a
                            house or a fortress, some of them extending 800 or a thousand feet long
                            of solid rock—and there are several hundred, they say 365 islands
                            interspersed in wild confusion and infinite variety of form from one end
                            of the lake to the other. Some of them have fanciful names—others, of
                            their distance from the head of the lake, as 5 mile and 12 mile islands;
                            and others from memorable incidents in the two struggles for the
                            conquest of Canada in the seven years war and the war of the revolution—
                            Of the fort of Ticonderoga, nothing but outer dilapidated walls remain—
                            Here we dined and <persRef ref="burnet-jacob">judge Burnet</persRef>, an
                            ardent whig and intelligent, well bred and well educated politician,
                            introduced himself and several others to me and dined with us— At 3.
                            O’Clock the Steamer Whitehall came and took us up at the landing— This
                            was the lake Champlain Boat, <persRef ref="lyon-dan">Captain
                                Lyon</persRef>, of Burlington Vermont, substituted for the William
                            Caldwell which had transported us over Lake George— In the Whitehall I
                            met<space/>who reminded me that he had been a member of the 26<hi
                                rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress; and although I had then so
                            little personal acquaintance with him that I did not now remember him;
                            yet we now became very familiar with each other, and had much
                            conversation especially as he had now with him a very pretty little
                            daughter about 7 years old. He landed however this afternoon— Just at
                            Sunset we reached Burlington in the State of Vermont, where <persRef

                            landed and took a ride round the town— I remained on board the boat
                            where several of the inhabitants of the town, came and urged me
                            earnestly to give them a day— Among them <persRef ref="allen-heman"

                            a beautiful boat, with a most obliging and intelligent commander.

                            woman was on board yesterday; but landed at Burlington, whence we in the

                            Plattsburg in the Night— The Captain insisted upon giving up his cabin
                            to me, and I never passed a night in a more comfortable bed chamber.
                            About one in the morning the boat was moored to a wharf at Champlain, in
                            shallow water, opposite a small island, and hard by Rous’s point—the
                            navigation of the lake being about there so obstructed by shoals, that
                            the boats venture no further without daylight— We were to stop from one
                            to four in the morning— Soon af- that I saw the Sun majestically rise,
                            over Champlain, in the summer morning of a beautiful village, with the
                            spire of a Church peering up from its surrounding trees— But the boat
                            did not move, and by 5. O’Clock a fog arose and thickened till the Sun
                            was lost in gloom for the space of three hours— I retired to my cabin
                            and wrote till the Sun came out again; mean time the boat started, and
                            passed by the ruined fort on Rous’s point, and the land mark of Latitude
                            45. the boundary between the United States, and the British Province of
                            Canada, unseen by me. At the head of the lake the river Richelieu leads
                            to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s where it takes the name of the

                            passage from Whitehall at the foot of Lake George, where we landed
                            yesterday, adjoining Ticonderoga, to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
                            John’s in Canada is 160 miles, which we traversed in 19 hours. It should
                            have been in 16 or at most 17.— But our detention at Champlain by the
                            fog belated our arrival at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s at 7.
                            or 8. till near 10. The railway cars had started at 9.—and the next
                            train was to leave at a quarter before 2— Captain Lyon had dressed out
                            the boat in all the colours he had on board. The 85<hi

                            quartered at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s—we landed and went
                            to the hotel kept by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Morehead</persRef>— He introduced to us a Commissary of the army
                            named <persRef ref="lister-amos">Lister</persRef>, and he soon
                            introduced <persRef ref="french-thomas2">Major French</persRef> the
                            present commander of the Regiment. We visited with him the barracks; and
                            the regular exhibition of the parade was made, apparently in compliment
                            to us.— The heat was intense— The manoeuvres on the field, merely
                            good—not of ideal perfection— Major French himself gave the word of
                            command with adequate precision and accuracy. We returned to the hotel
                            and dined. We invited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lister to dine with
                            us, but he declined. A quarter before 2 we took the rail-way cars 17
                            miles to La Prairie— Major French was at the depot, to take leave— From
                            La Prairie a Steamer took us 9. miles to Montreal where we stop’d about
                            2 hours at <persRef ref="doolittle-matthew">Doolittle’s</persRef> hotel:
                            took a glance inside of the cathedral; embarked in the Steamer Queen

                            Sunday 16 July 1843. Quebec—</dateline>
                        <p><date>16. IV. </date>Sunday</p>
                        <p>The distance from Montreal to Quebec on the S<hi rend="superscript"
                                >t.</hi> Lawrence is 180 miles which we traversed in 11. hours— But
                            soon after we left Montreal, the night came on and we saw no more of the
                            Country. The Steamer Queen is a very fine boat, but met with an accident
                            some time since and was sunk— She has been very lately raised, repaired
                            and painted, the smell of which was very offensive— The hand or foot
                            could scarcely touch anything without sticking to it.— There was another
                            Steamer too, the Lord Sydenham, in competition with the Queen; and the
                            pressure of Steam, for this race was excessive upon both— That upon the
                            Queen at one time became alarming and they were obliged to stop the boat
                            and let off the steam for the space of at least ten minutes.— The
                            pinewood fire too threw out burning charcoal cinders in showers upon the
                            upper deck, and made it at once dirty and uncomfortable. I had to myself
                            however a good State room, with two berths but without a table, so that
                            I could not write and did not open my trunk.— Before 10. I turned in and
                            slept sound till day light— I rose at 4. saw the Sun rise from the upper
                            deck, opposite the village and church of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
                            Nicholas, 15 miles from Quebec where we landed precisely at 5. O’Clock—
                            The Ladies then rode, and the men walked up, like scaling the walls to
                                <persRef ref="u">Payne’s</persRef> Hotel on the Square where the
                            parade of the troops is held; adjoining the place d’Armes.— The first
                            thing I did was to sally forth in quest of a barber— I found one, named
                                <persRef ref="u">Tessier</persRef>, a native of Quebec, whom I
                            finally prevailed upon with not a little difficulty to shave me.— At
                            breakfast we met a gentleman named <persRef ref="u">Frazier</persRef>, a
                            Scotch Presbyterian, who offered us seats in his pew in the Scotch
                            church of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Andrew; which <persRef

                            and I accepted— The preacher was a <persRef ref="cook-john7">D<hi

                            Genesis 4.3. [“]And in process of time, it came to pass, that <persRef

                            to his offering he had not respect.” We dined at one O’Clock, and at 2.
                            attended the evening service of the English episcopal church for the
                            troops of the garrison.— The several regiments were marched in full
                            uniform accompanied by their Officers but without their firearms into
                            the church, where the chaplain to one of their regiments the 68<hi

                        <p>In our excursion yesterday afternoon we observed two monuments, upon
                            which I stop’d to read the inscriptions.— The first is an obelisk 65
                            feet high, adjoining the entrance to the glacis of Cape Diamond fronting
                            the river eastward— On the South side of the pedestal is carved in large
                            relief the name of <persRef ref="wolfe-james2">Wolfe</persRef>—on the
                            North side that of <persRef ref="montcalm-louis">Montcalm</persRef>. In
                            the front are the two following inscriptions—</p>
                        <p>Mortem Virtus. Communem Famam Historia Monumentum</p>
                        <p>Posteritas dedit</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> and below</p>
                        <p>Hujusce Monumenti, in Memoriam Virorum Illustrium Wolfe et Montcalm
                            Fundamentum P. C. <persRef ref="dalhousie-george">Georgius Comes De
                                Dalhousie</persRef>, In Septentrionalis Americae Partibus ad
                            Britannos Pertinentibus Summam Rerum Administrans; Opus per multos Annos
                            Praetermissum (Quid Duci Egregio Convenientius?) Auctoritate Promovens.

                            MDCCCXXVII, <persRef ref="george-iv">Georgio IV</persRef>. Brittaniarum
                            Rege.</p>
                        <p>The first of these inscriptions is good: and the simple names of Wolfe
                            and Montcalm at the opposite sides in good taste.— The second
                            inscription is a newspaper puff in honour of Earl Dalhousie, barely
                            noticing the names of Wolfe and Montcalm, but magnifying the Scotch
                            Laird Governor General Dalhousie, into an egregious chieftain, with the
                            word convenientius of very dubious latinity.— I could not help thinking
                            of the famous specimen of the bathos— And thou, Dalhousie, the great God
                            of War </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> Lieutenant Colonel to the Earl of Mar.</p>
                        <p>It is indeed highly creditable to this last Dalhousie, that he did
                            accomplish the erection of this monument, but he should not have
                            suffered this pompous panegyric upon himself to be inscribed upon its
                            front in substitution of some brief but pathetic allusions to the
                            illustrious rivals in life and death, themselves.</p>
                        <p>The other monument is on the plains of Abram— A plain stone broken column
                            about eight feet high from the ground, with a small square basement
                            surrounded by loose stones cemented together on a low gently rising
                            mound with the words deeply carved on the shaft</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">Here</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">Wolfe Fell</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">Victorious.</p>
                        <p>It is a sad eye sore <hi rend="italic">to</hi> monumental glory that this
                            inscription is so defaced by the chipping off from the Letters of the
                            word victorious, and from the name of Wolfe, that they are scarcely
                            legible— A person present said this defacemt had been made within the
                            last two years.</p>
                        <pb n="12" type="ms"/>
                        <p>On rising this morning, I went out to the platform
                            to see the Sun rise across the river— A solitary centinel was walking to
                            and fro on his guard, and as I passed by him said in a low desponding
                            tone—Sir—can you tell me what O’Clock it is?— I answered, half past 4.
                            The Sun was then about ten minutes risen—on returning from the
                            precipitous edge of the platform which looks down on the tops fifty feet
                            below of a street of houses, I asked the centinel the name of a point
                            across the river—he said he did not know. He had been here not more than
                            a month, and came last from Jamaica. I passed on to the next Centinel at
                            the wicket gate entrance to the glacis of Cape Diamond, and before the
                            obelisk and asked him the name of the point— He did not know— It was
                            point Levy—and at some distance beyond it was the Island of Orleans—
                            After Breakfast an Irish waiter at the Inn shewed me the way to the
                            residence, at the Artillery Barracks of <persRef ref="walker-pw"

                                >l.</hi> Campbell— It was cold but civil, as I have often found the
                            receipt of commendatory Letters— He invited me however to the Lunch at
                            the mess-room at one O’Clock, but I told him I was going to the Falls of
                            Montmorenci, and should not be back till later. He led me however to a
                            spot in the garden, where there was a ladder by which I mounted on the
                            glacis and had a beautiful view of the city below the rivers and country
                            around and the distant mountains. He asked me if I had called upon the
                            commanding officer of the city, <persRef ref="hope-james">Sir James

                            before us— After passing a clumsy wooden bridge over the river S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> Charles, the road is a turnpike, lined
                            with a continuous village of French cottages and chaumières,
                            interspersed with a few handsome and costly houses surrounded by
                            cultivated farms— The country has an appearance of general ease and
                            comfort— The houses of one story, deep slanting roofs with Lutheran
                            windows sometimes with a second set over them, built of wood or stone
                            bare or plastered over with shingled or thatched roofs, and the sides of
                            the houses sometimes of plank, perpendicularly laid— The population is
                            generally good looking and healthy; but we saw several women in the
                            kitchen garden adjoining every habitation, hoeing and digging the
                            vegetables, and others with the men making hay.— About half way to the
                            falls by the side of the road, was a column on a pedestal surmounted by
                            a corinthian capital with inscriptions on three sides of the pedestal,
                            imparting that the monument was erected by the inhabitants of the parish
                            of Beauport in gratitude to the blessed virgin, for the success of the
                            temperance reform in that parish—we viewed the falls first on the North
                            side then on the South, and lastly on the river strand below; the
                            descent to and ascent from which were so steep that the Ladies did not
                            attempt it— We returned to the city about 3. p.m and I received visits
                            from Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Walker, who agreed to accompany
                            us at 9. to-morrow morning to the Citadel, and from the English Bishop

                        <p>Heavy rain all night and this morning, subsiding to mist and fog, then
                            clearing up cool. <persRef ref="walker-pw">Col<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >l.</hi> Walker</persRef> came at 9. with <persRef ref="u">Major
                                Cole</persRef> the commandant of the Citadel— In consideration of
                            the rain we agreed to postpone our visit to the citadel till one
                            O’Clock, and then to meet the Officers there. In the meantime I had what
                            I sadly want on this journey, leisure to keep along the record without
                            running into irretrievable arrears.— When the weather held up I visited
                            with <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Grinnell</persRef> the Roman Catholic cathedral, a very large and
                            massive building where we found some enfans trouvés on their knees at
                            their devotions— There are numerous paintings suspended to the walls,
                            from the legends of the Saints, the subjects of which I did not
                            understand; but some of them ludicrous as caricatures. All indifferent
                            as works except one of the annunciation, which M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Grinnell pointed out to me, as a good picture— There was one
                            the <persRef ref="mary">virgin</persRef>, a full length with her arms
                            expanded, and streams of radiance from her hands like the tail of the
                            comet last February— <persRef ref="hope-james">Sir James Hope</persRef>
                            the present commander in chief of the place called on me, and urged me
                            with great earnestness to stay another day, and dine with him to-morrow—
                            We had engaged for our passage in the Steamer Montreal at 5 this
                            afternoon— Sir James was extremely polite, and profuse in his offers of
                            service. At one we visited the citadel accompanied by Lieut<hi

                            on horseback, and received by Major Cole with very engaging attentions—
                            The batteries of iron 32 pounders and brass 6 pounders are like those of
                            other fortresses; but the prospects from the several bastions, were
                            variegated beautifull and grand.— I went out in the barouche with M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell and two of the Ladies, to search
                            for the spot where <persRef ref="montgomery-richard"
                                >Montgomery</persRef> fell but could not find it— There are
                            different traditionary accounts of it, some saying it was on the spot
                            where now stands the <persRef ref="prescott-robert">Prescott</persRef>
                            gate, through which we passed. Others that it was close to the
                            custom-house, near the spot where we landed from the Steamer Queen— We
                            traversed the lower city upwards of a mile, along the margin of the
                            river; not so rich as Pearl Street in New-York and more like wapping. At
                            3 we dined and at 1/2 past 4. left <persRef ref="u">Payne’s</persRef>
                            Hotel and embarked in the Steamer Montreal, <persRef ref="armstrong-jd"

                            regret that the shortness of our stay at Quebec had deprived him of the
                            opportunity of rendering me any service in his power there. He said he
                            was a native of Virginia, and had somehow become a subject of <persRef

                            affection for his native Country was as warm, as it ever had been—was
                            inextinguishable— That he was proud of being one of her Sons; and then
                            he complimented me personally, and took his leave as the boat was about
                            to start— She parted from the wharf precisely at 5.— There was on board
                            as a fellow passenger a Philadelphia lawyer named <persRef

                            was introduced to me, and entered immediately into conversation with me,
                            which with the intervention of half an hour for tea continued with deep
                            interest till past 11. O’Clock, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Grinnell called me up on deck to contemplate the rising moon and the

                            she stop’d at the landing of trois rivières; but did not get up till
                            after she had left that place and was again on her way— At Sunrise the
                            weather was cold as with us is usual in the last fortnight of September
                            I found on the promenade deck aft of the gate between the deck and cabin
                            passengers two men lying stretched on the floor of the deck, without
                            bed, blanket sheet or coverlet; and on the forecastle ten or twelve
                            others in the same condition. They were all sound asleep— They rose
                            successively between 5 and 6. Then shook themselves stretched their
                            arms, yawned and were ready for the day. I could not but think what a

                            the opinion that it would be a great improvement in the education of
                            children to accustom them to coucher sur la dure, but after traversing
                            the deck up and down about 2 hours, I got chilled and retired to my
                            berth in my State room—till just at 7. O’Clock the Steamer was moored to
                            the fire stone wharf landing at Montreal— A man from <persRef

                            reached the Hotel I was accosted by <persRef ref="frothingham-john">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef>, whom I had met
                            in September 1840. in Nova-Scotia, and passed a day with him at
                            Kentville, and now loaded us with civilities and attentions— Two
                            Gentlemen, a Yankee by the name of <persRef ref="u">Lyman</persRef>, and
                            a Scotchman, name not remembered, as a deputation from the Mercantile
                            library association of Montreal, invited us to their rooms and urged me
                            to deliver a Lecture to them this evening, which I declined. Another
                            deputation from the New-England men settled at Montreal invited me also
                            to address them which I likewise declined. Many of them visited me at
                            the Hotel, of whose names I can give no account— We visited the convent
                            of the grey Nuns, at once an Orphan and a Lunatic Asylum— A foundling
                            baby not 3 days old was brought in, not an hour before our visit— Of the
                            maniacs we saw more than enough— We visited also the parade of the 71<hi
                                rend="superscript">st</hi> regiment of light infantry—Highlanders.—
                            A part of their band of music were 6 pipers with their appropriate dress
                            and feather— And we were visited after the parade by their commander
                                <persRef ref="u">Lieutenant Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
                                England</persRef>, and by <persRef ref="austen-he">Captain H. E.
                                Austen</persRef>.— Among our other visitors, were <persRef ref="u"

                            dinner we rode round the mountain stopping on the way at M<hi

                            us, and parted from them with regret.— My only visitors were the
                                <persRef ref="bourret-joseph">Mayor of Montreal</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="beaubien-pierre">Doctor Beaubien</persRef> a member of
                            the City Council both French Canadians, extremely courteous in their
                            regret that the shortness of our stay deprived them of the opportunity
                            of displaying their hospitalities— I took a last walk round the Streets,
                            and purchased as a lasting memento of Montréal a hatchet hammer— At Noon
                            we departed in a Stage— <persRef ref="u">Judge Day</persRef>, called to
                            take leave just as we entered the carriage— We came 9 Miles to La Chine
                            a small village where we found a Steamer which took us 24 miles to the
                            Cascades. In this boat we dined, and the ever varying beauties of the
                            river, were somewhat modified by swarms innumerable of flies first met
                            at La Chine— The Captain of the boat said they were called eel flies,
                            and were very troublesome for about a month— They were of five or six
                            different forms; one, the least numerous identical with the fish fly of
                            the Potowmac— One a large ant with wings double its own length; two of
                            the moth tribe one as large as the larva of a silk worm, the other that
                            of the common moth. None of these except the last had the impudent
                            familiarity of the common fly—none of them approached the person, but
                            they were crawling about the decks and swarms of them were flying in the
                            wake of the boat and in the air along the shores, all the afternoon till
                            Sunset— At the Cascade, a Stage was ready, and took us 16 miles to the
                            coteau du Lac, the whole distance on the bank of the river obstructed by
                            a constant succession of foaming rapids against which steam itself
                            cannot make head. From Coteau du Lac another Steamer took us after a
                            magnificent Sunset 41 miles to Cornwall, during two hours of this
                            passage we turned into our berths and slept. At 10 p.m, another stage
                            took us over a heavy road of deep sand to Dickinson’s landing where we
                            arrived at Midnight, having traveled by Stage and Steamer 102 miles
                            since noon. Here we found the Steamer Queen Victoria at the wharf
                            waiting for us, and <persRef ref="fine-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> John Fine</persRef>, who had come from Ogdensburg to
                            invite me to spend a day there. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fine had
                            induced the Captain to make special arrangements for the accommodation
                            of our party, and he gave up his own cabin to me for the Night— The boat
                            is moored to the wharf and is to depart at 4 in the morning.</p>

                        <p>I slept an hour beyond my time. And the boat had been an hour on her way
                            when I awoke— The Captains cabin was comfortable enough for sleeping;
                            but had no accommodation for writing, and I lost my morning.— The night
                            and the whole of this day the weather was as if specially made for the
                            enjoyment of travellers; but the morning was cold and the middle of the
                            day more than comfortably warm— Just below Cornwall commences the line
                            on the river S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Lawrence the Eastern side
                            of which forms the Counties of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Lawrence
                            and of Jefferson in the State of New-York, while the western side
                            continues the British Province of Upper Canada— On this Eastern side of
                            the river stands about 60 miles from Cornwall stands the town of
                            Ogdensburg—opposite to which on the British side is the town of
                            Prescott. We reached Ogdensburg between 8 and 9 this morning, and our
                            approach was greeted by the firing of 3 guns and the cheering of huzza’s
                            from the wharf.— <persRef ref="fine-john">Fine</persRef> said he had
                            forbidden the guns; but the people would fire them— I was unwilling to
                            land and go to the Hotel, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fine
                            informed the people on the wharf that if any of them inclined to shake
                            hands with me, I would receive them on the deck of the boat where I
                            stood; and about 300 of them, men and boys, came, shook hands with me,
                            and passed off. Fine then told me that there were a number of Ladies at
                            the Hotel who could not come to the boat, and yet wished to see me— I
                            went accordingly to the Hotel, where I found not more than a dozen
                            Ladies, and perhaps an equal number of men, except <persRef
                                ref="vanrensselaer-henry">Henry Van Rensselaer</persRef>, member of
                            the last Congress from this District, all Strangers to me. I shook hands
                            with them all wished them well, and returned to the boat, to which M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Rensselaer bore me company, and bade
                            me there farewell. We parted from the wharf with three cheers and three
                            guns— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fine continued with us to the next
                            stoppage of the boat at Morristown, where he took leave of me and
                            landed. We soon after entered on the passage through the thousand
                            Islands, and landed, half past 4. at Kingston at the head of Lake
                            Ontario—110 miles from Dickinson’s landing— Here we found the Royal-Mail
                            Packet Steamer Sovereign, of which to my great surprize my old
                                acquaintance<space/><persRef ref="elmsley-john">Elmsley</persRef> is the
                            Captain— She was to depart at 8 in the Evening, and in the mean time we
                            took a Carriage and with the Ladies rode round the City first stopping
                            at a Confectioners to take ice-creams— On our return there was a pause
                            whether we should proceed in the boat; a company of nearly 200 Irish and
                            Scotch emigrants having embarked in her, and occupying too much of her
                            cabin— The Ladies went to a Hotel and took tea, and satisfactory
                            arrangements being made returned to the boat— M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>The night was calm and beautiful. <persRef ref="elmsley-john">Captain
                                Elmsley</persRef> had ceded to me his own cabin, but for the
                            conveniencies of every kind and especially for writing it could bear no
                            comparison with that of <persRef ref="lyon-dan">Captain Lyon</persRef>
                            of the Steamer Whitehall on lake Champlain— On rising therefore I went
                            upon the promenade deck, and there beheld twenty-five women and ten or
                            twelve children, all half clad, in ragged and tattered garments,
                            stretched at full length on dirty rags and blankets, with here and there
                            a featherless apology for a bed or pillow—all locked up in sound and
                            quiet sleep.— The <hi rend="italic">Sovereign</hi>, was cleaving at the
                            rate of 12 miles an hour the glassy waters of Lake Ontario, close on the
                            British shore of the lake, and a boundless expanse of waters on the
                            other side— I walked upwards of an hour on the deck winding my way
                            between these happy Sleepers, without disturbing them, till the mate
                            came on deck, and speaking in a high tone of voice said come! come!
                            tumble up! tumble up! when they awoke—started upon their bare feet,
                            stretched their arms, shook themselves; packed up in the blankets or
                            sheets on which they had lain,—each the sum total of her bedding, and
                            went forward where was another company not quite so destitute of
                            Scottish emigrants— The others were Irish— The town of Cobourg soon came
                            in sight 110 miles from Kingston shortly before reaching it we passed by
                            a Light house seeming to float on the Lake. It stands on a Rock the peak
                            of which is just level with the surface of the water— The boat stop’d at
                            Cobourg and again 7 miles beyond at Port Hope at each of which places
                            several of the Scotch passengers with their luggage and furniture
                            disembarked— Between 2 and 3. Afternoon we landed at Toronto, and after
                            taking a ride round the town in which there was nothing remarkable to
                            remember we again embarked in the Steamer Queen Victoria. At Toronto,
                                <persRef ref="elmsley-charlotte">Captain Elmsley’s wife</persRef> a
                            handsome and elegant woman, the daughter he said of a judge, as he was
                            the son of another, and he introduced her to our Ladies— We left Toronto
                            at 5. p.m. and crossed the Lake to Niagara and Queenstown whence the
                            steamer passed over and landed us at Lewistown— The passage from Toronto
                            to Niagara is 35 miles to Lewistown 7 miles more, and thence by a horse
                            rail way seven Miles to Niagara Falls.— From Kingston to Toronto is 177
                            miles. We rode in the dark from Lewistown, and reached the Cataract
                            house at the Falls at 9 in the Evening 438 miles from Montreal in 2 days
                            and 9 hours. We found at the Falls, <persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi

                        <p>I slept to the sound of the Cataract, and on rising this morning before
                            the Sun I saw the foam of the rapids hurrying to the Falls, right under
                            my window. We breakfasted at 1/2 past 7. with about 150. other visitors
                            to the falls.— Immediately after breakfast <persRef ref="porter-peter"
                                >General Peter B. Porter</persRef> came over from his house nearly
                            opposite our hotel, and insisted with so much cordiality on my removal
                            to his house that I consented with great reluctance to part from my
                            company for the time— The houses being so near together that it is
                            little more than occupying a distant apartment of the hotel. I went
                            over, and he introduced to me <persRef ref="porter-elizabeth">his

                                Stow</persRef>, a Gentleman who some weeks since came to Quincy with
                            an earnest invitation from General Porter to me to visit him, which I
                            then declined, and expected never to be able to accomplish.— I enquired
                            for a church to go to for public worship, and found there was a
                            methodist, and a presbyterian church near the hotel, but that attendance
                            at church was not fashionable among the visitors at the falls— But
                                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silliman</persRef>
                            had formed a party to go to the Tuscarora Indian Settlement 7 miles from
                            the falls, and attend at their church service— General Porter took
                                <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph;grinnell-sarah">M<hi

                                Grinnell</persRef> and me with him in his carriage and we reached
                            the church while they were singing just before the sermon— An orthodox
                            Presbyterian Calvinist Missionary was the preacher, and in the pulpit
                            which was like the bench of a judicial Court, he and an Indian Chief
                            interpreter stood side by side— The text was from Luke<space/>the parable of
                            the Sower and the seed—the way side hearers and the Stony-ground
                            hearers.— The Indian chief interpreted sentence by sentence, what was
                            said by the missionary— A collection was taken up for a sick and
                            destitute Old woman— The Missionary at suggestion of Gen<hi
                                rend="superscript">l.</hi> Porter announced and the Interpreter
                            repeated that John Quincy Adams once President of the United States was
                            present; whereupon I made to them a short address.— Then at the request
                            of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Porter they sang an English hymn
                            and we departed— On the return we stop’d, and with M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell, and M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Silliman I went down the steps to the whirlpool—an arduous
                            performance— It was between 3. and 4 when we got back to the falls—
                            Dined at General Porter’s with his family and after dinner took a first
                            view of the falls, at the spot at which they are approachable to the
                            very edge of the precipice, and also upon goat or Iris Island. Then
                            returned to the Cataract house, and was detained by visitors till 10 in
                            the Evening when I came to Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Porter’s
                            for the Night.</p>

                                Grinnell</persRef> to a farm house and farm owned by him on the
                            brink of the river two miles above the falls, and to Schlosser a mile or
                            more higher up, and in 1837. the Scene of that memorable transaction,
                            the seizure and destruction by a party from the British side of the
                            river, of the Steamboat Caroline, an incident, which brought us nearer
                            to a British, border and civil war than any other since the Peace of
                            Ghent. At Schlosser there is only a single house but a landing place at
                            the rivers edge— In the middle of the river Navy Island, belonging to
                            the British, and Grand Island, to the United States and part of the
                            State of New-York, both covered with forests of primeval trees are so
                            narrowly separated by the channel of the river, that they seem at
                            Schosser to be one continuous island, and just below them commence the
                            rapids rushing to the falls render the river impassable in boats— There
                            is no trace of the tread of hostile feet remaining, and nothing
                            noticeable on the spot, save its reminiscences. We stop’d at the
                            general’s farmhouse and more solid and more costly lime-stone barn,
                            which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks thought would suit well at
                            Medford, and <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> thought a
                            very good house to live in— The house-wife of the place by a liberal
                            distribution of dough gathered round us a populous tribe of Turkies,
                            geese, ducks, and dunghill fowls among which the sable crested poularde
                            family from Normandy were conspicuous. The soil of the farm is rich, but
                            bound up in limestone of which the General has made durable and
                            substantial Stonewall fences. The cultivation is in the process of
                            défrichement, with a plenteous kitchen garden and a young orchard
                            surrounded by fields of wheat, barley, oats, corn and potatoes,
                            interspersed with lots of lofty, but girdled forest trees, and others
                            bestudded with stumps standing like the pins of a vast bowling green— We
                            returned to the Falls where M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Brooks and
                                <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
                                Charles</persRef> with her Son dined in family at General Porter’s;
                            and after dinner with all our party we again visited the falls upon goat
                            or Iris Island— There is a kitchen and fruit garden there through which
                            I passed with General Porter; and I went to the top of the tower, built
                            by General Porter at a point on the island whence the view of the falls
                            is on this side the river most grand and picturesque— Returning again to
                            the Cataract house several visitors at the falls were introduced to me
                            and among them <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            strange to me; and so flattering that I scarcely dare to think of it

                        <p>This morning I delivered to <persRef ref="mitchel-ormsby">professor
                                Mitchell</persRef> my answer to the Resolution of the Cincinnati
                            Astronomical Society of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> inviting me to lay the corner Stone of
                            the observatory which they propose to erect; and to deliver an Oration
                            on the occasion— I have accepted the invitation, and promised to perform
                            the duty; if in my power some day in the month of November next, to suit
                            the convenience of the Society. This is a rash promise, and in
                            faithfully analysing my motives for making it I wish I could find them
                            pure from all alloy of vanity, and self-glorification. It is an arduous,
                            hazardous and expensive undertaking, the successful performance of which
                            is more than problematical and of the event of which it is impossible
                            for me to forseee any thing but disappointment— Yet there is a motive
                            pure and elevated and a purpose benevolent and generous, at least
                            mingling with the impulses which in this case I obey, and upon which I
                            may without irreverence invoke the blessing of Heaven as I do, for
                            fortitude, energy and perseverance to accomplish what I have promised—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mitchell after receiving my answer,
                            took his departure to return to Cincinnati— <persRef

                            of Congress came this day, deputed from the City of Buffalo to invite me
                            to visit that place, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fillmore
                            delivered to me a similar written invitation signed by 13 citizens of
                            Syracuse— I went this morning with <persRef ref="porter-peter">Gen<hi
                                    rend="superscript">l.</hi> Porter</persRef> to Goat Island to
                            bespeak a warm bath at the bathing house just above the single sheeted
                            fall from which it borrows the stream that supplies the bath— They had
                            then no heated water, but promised to have some ready for me this
                            evening.— I then walked about an hour before breakfast with the General
                            to re-inspect all the points from which the cascades and the rapids are
                            seen to the best advantage— The sky was unusually clear, the Sun shining
                            in cloudless splendour and the snowy foam of the spray reflected the
                            burning beams in a constantly shifting rainbow adding exquisite beauty
                            to the awful grandeur of the falling flood.— After breakfast, General
                            Porter, with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            ferry, and crossed the river in a small ferry boat over a placid and
                            gentle stream scarcely conscious of the falling tempest so close above
                            them— The ascent on the western side, of the river, though steep and
                            rocky, is practicable, and we found at the landing two Carriages waiting
                            for us, in which we ascended the heights, and rode first to view the
                            scene of the Action at Lundy’s Lane on the 5<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> of July 1814. in the last War with Great Britain— We then
                            went to the Clifton house and ordered dinner— Then leaving the Ladies
                            there we proceeded to the plains of Chippewa, where General Porter
                            explained to us the movements on the battleground at that place, on the
                                25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of July 1814 of which day this is
                            the anniversary— Returning we stop’d and saw the phenomenon of the
                            burning spring and I drank a tumbler of its cool sulphuric water. Dined
                            at the Clifton house— Visited the table rock and the cavern under it—
                            Returned over the ferry. Warm bath— Evening party at Gen<hi

                        <p>My wedding day. 1797.—</p>
                        <p>Since I left home, I have been able hither to, to employ two hours of the
                            morning before breakfast in writing, and thus to keep along with the
                            current of time in my journal— But now commences a succession of days so
                            absorbed morning noon and night, that my record must run into arrears
                            very difficult, if not impracticable to retrieve— This morning <persRef
                                ref="porter-peter">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
                                Porter</persRef> took me over to see <persRef ref="porter-augustus"
                                >his brother the judge</persRef>, who within a few months has been
                            crippled by an accident in which his hip bone was broken, and he can
                            scarcely rise from his seat. At his house I found four clergymen of
                            different denominations who were introduced to me; but whose names
                            escape from my memory.— After a tour in his garden from one corner of
                            which there is a fine view of the falls, I visited with the General
                            their Saw Mill where they were sawing planks— There was also a machine
                            for sawing shingles, not working, but which had been seen and much
                            admired by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks. I enquired of one of
                            the workmen, how long the saw which the machinery drives through the log
                            in half a minute and turns out a plank. He said four months and was
                            entirely worn out in that time.— The train of Cars leaves the Falls for
                            Buffalo, at 2. P.M— But the Committee from that City had concluded to
                            take me up from Schlosser in the Steamer Bunker Hill— General Porter
                            took me in his Carriage to Schlosser, and there all our party met,
                            precisely at Noon, the time which had been fixed, the Committee from
                            Buffalo, with a numerous company of Ladies and gentlemen who had taken
                            this opportunity for an excursion of pleasure, and all cordially greeted
                            me and all our party. Here General Porter took leave of me, declining
                            from indisposition the earnest invition of the Citizens of Utica to
                            accompany me thither.— There was another Steamer the Cleveland with a
                            company of Ladies and Gentlemen, equally numerous on a separate
                            excursion, but joining us as in procession— The passage from Schlosser
                            to Buffalo occupied four hours; the banks of the river on both sides
                            presenting a succession of beautiful landscapes. Some of us landed on
                            Grand Island, and inspected the pyramid announcing in Hebrew and in
                            English the city of Ararat founded by <persRef ref="noah-mordecai">Moses
                                M. Noah</persRef>— We dined in the Steamer: a cold water dinner, and
                            at 4. O’Clock entered in beautiful Style, the harbour of Buffalo, at the
                            entrance of Lake Erie— We were received by shouting multitudes at the
                            landing. I was conducted in an open barouche to a Stage at the park
                            received a complimentary address from <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fillmore</persRef>, which was
                            answered by me addressing the People— After this I rode round the City
                            with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fillmore and the <persRef
                                ref="masten-joseph">Mayor</persRef>, then to the American Hotel, and
                            shook hands with some hundreds of men and women— Firemen’s torch light

                        <p>The splendid evening party and supper at Buffalo last Evening was at the
                            house of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi><space/>who had invited us the day
                            before at the Niagara Falls— The Editor of a newspaper at Buffalo, who
                            had been in the park when I answered the address of <persRef
                                ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Fillmore</persRef> was so distant from me that he could not hear me,
                            and requested me to write out my speech which was impossible. He then
                            offered to come at 5 O’Clock this morning and take it down at my
                            dictation, to which I agreed. He came accordingly precisely at 5 and
                            wrote by my dictation till half past 7. It was a full report of my
                            speech as correct as my memory could repeat what I said— Before
                            breakfast I received a note from <persRef ref="whittlesey-frederick"
                                >Frederick Whittlesey</persRef>, <persRef ref="kempshall-thomas"
                                >Thomas Kempshall</persRef> and <persRef ref="chapin-graham">Graham
                                H. Chapin</persRef> all three heretofore members, at different times
                            of the house of Representatives of the United States—requesting an
                            interview with me— They came as a deputation from the citizens of
                            Rochester to invite me to visit that city; which invitation I accepted.
                            At half past 8. A.M. we left Buffalo in the cars 35 miles to Batavia.
                            Here they stopped to take in wood and water— Here a crowd were assembled
                            with <persRef ref="tracy-phineas">Phineas L. Tracy</persRef>, heretofore
                            a member of Congress, who introduced me to them— A platform in front of
                            the door broke down from the weight of the pressure upon it, and one
                            gentleman who had accompanied us from Buffalo was so much hurt that he
                            was obliged to leave us. I was stepping from the platform into the house
                            when the crash happened and just escaped falling through— From Batavia
                            to Rochester is 32 miles— We arrived at Rochester between 2 and 3.—and
                            found Guns firing, Bells ringing and an immense crowd of People—
                            Shouting— <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            Cabinet, resigned to bring him again into the house.— I consented to
                            stop and dine to-morrow with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greig at
                            Canandaigua; to have an interview and hand shaking with the inhabitants;

                            Rochester. We dined at the Eagle Hotel— After dinner rode round the

                            Auburn superior to the original— At 6. p.m was the public meeting— The
                            Mayor <persRef ref="hills-isaac">Isaac Hills</persRef>, addressed me
                            from a stage in front of a public building— I answered him by a speech;
                            and Grainger being called out made a short one— Then came the shaking of
                            hands— In the Evening I received the Ladies at the Eagle Hotel, and made
                            them a short Speech. The firemen’s torch-light procession closed the
                            day.</p>

                        <p>I had about 2 hours this morning to retrieve one day of arrears, which
                            since I left Quebec have crept upon my diary, in spite of every possible
                            exertion— The lapse of unrecorded time constantly reminds me of that
                            irresistible current which hurries down and dashes over the cataracts at
                            Niagara— So am I hurried down the stream of time, and day after day,
                            turns over the precipice and is lost.— We breakfasted at the Hotel, and
                            as were about passing into the Cars, <persRef ref="hills-isaac">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac Mills</persRef>, the Mayor of
                            Rochester sent to our Ladies a basket of delicious black heart and white
                            heart cherries, perfectly ripe, and of a size such as I have not seen
                            for many years. <persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"

                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Jared Wilson</persRef> accompanied us
                            to Canandaigua whence they had been sent as a deputation to meet us— At
                            the entrance of the town we met a cavalcade in military uniform, with a
                            band of music and numerous carriages, all of which united in a
                            procession of a full mile, with bells ringing and a firing of cannon,
                            which left me in amazement to enquire of myself what all this was for—
                            The procession however led me to the brick church, where M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Granger, introduced me to all the
                            beauty and fashion of Canandaigua, in a highly complimentary address,
                            which I answered as best I could in a speech full of inanity and
                            gratitude— Shame-faced and awkward as I must always be in answering
                            compliments to myself— After the speeches and shaking hands with all the
                            men and women introduced to me in the church, I rode with M<hi

                            with a select party of his friends. He has a handsome library, and fine

                            the road, crowds were collected to shake hands with me; to hear me speak
                            a few words, and shout me onward— We arrived at Auburn between 9 and 10
                            at Night, and by the torch light procession of the firemen I was
                            transported to Governor W. H. Sewards house for the Night.</p>

                            Johnson, whom we found here on a visit to his father is a practicing
                            lawyer already of some reputation in the city of New-York— He was
                            obliged to return, and left us also at 10.— We then went, a party in two
                            Carriages, and viewed the Trenton Falls: distant 15 miles in a Northern
                            direction from Utica, in the County of Herkimer— The party consisted of
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef ref="johnson-eliza2"

                            The ride was extremely pleasant, and the country all around beautiful
                            and fertile. But the falls belong to a person by the name of Shepherd.
                            There is near them, also belonging to him, a house heretofore kept as a
                            tavern, but now closed and uninhabited. The descent to the falls is as
                            steep, and nearly as deep as that of the whirlpool at Niagara, and the
                            wooden flights of steps, laid to facilitate the descent are rotting into
                            spungy funk every step of which threatens to give way under the foot,
                            and to pitch the traveller into the abyss— The falls of which there are
                            seven within the compass of half a mile are each separately of not more
                            than 40 or 50 feet in sheets of water perhaps 200 feet wide rushing down
                            with terrific violence, and dashing over rocks in many cases turning
                            corners with a force of friction which would seem sufficient to fire the
                            rock— The passage between the two lofty and wood crowned ridges is like
                            a ruptured chasm made by an earthquake, and the concave sides of a
                            limestone wall descending to a level with the stream leaves an edge
                            barely wide enough for the foot of the passenger to step along with the
                            aid of an iron chain fastened to the side of the rock, and held by the
                            left hand as he slides along but wherever the edge of the rock under
                            foot is but a few inches wider the chain is intermitted and the pilgrim
                            staggers along as he may— Within these few years two females, a <persRef

                            plunged into eternity while visiting this Scene for curiosity— Near the
                            last of the falls there is a small shed inhabited as a dwelling house by
                            a <persRef ref="u">son</persRef> of <persRef ref="storrs-henry">Henry R.

                            benches on which we disposed of the basket of Sandwiches brought with us
                            from Utica.— We returned from this hovel in our Carriages to the
                            uninhabited house, where we met <persRef ref="vanderkemp-cuneira">Miss
                                Van der Kemp</persRef>, the daughter of the late <persRef

                                <persRef ref="u">Miss Mappa</persRef> a daughter of <persRef
                                ref="mappa-adam">his associate</persRef>.— They live with one of his
                            Sons, in a small house where he resided in a village now called Russia,
                            but which he called Olden Barnevelt— We visited them there; and returned
                            to Utica, between 6 and 7. in the Evening well wearied and worn out— The
                            visit to the Trenton falls is imminently dangerous— Yet the Johnson’s
                            trip over it, like Rope dancers on a tight rope.</p>
