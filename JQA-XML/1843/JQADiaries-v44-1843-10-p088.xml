						<dateline>Quincy Sunday 1. October 1843.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. IV:15. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>Sun rose 5.56. beclouded. <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit</persRef> 50.</p>
						<p>I walked up the hill to see the Sun rise— There was a thin border of
							cloud at the horizon, intercepting the first sunbeam; then a strip of
							clear sky from which his effulgence radiated for a transient moment, and
							then a thick body of cloud extending all over the sky, under which he
							disappeared, and was no more seen this day— I allowed myself but 20
							minutes of morning walk and before I got back to my table there was a
							sprinkling drop by drop of rain over my head. It increased to a moderate
							calm steady rain which continued the whole day till Evening when it
							freshened to a North eastern breeze and copious showers— I rode morning
							and evening to and from meeting. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached in the morning
							from Luke 7.47. [“]Wherefore, I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many,
							are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the
							same loveth little”— This is a mysterious part of the personal history
							of Christ— It follows immediately after the performance of many of his
							most stupendous miracles—the healing of the centurions servant— The
							raising from the dead of the widow’s son; and the answer to the
							messengers from <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John the baptist</persRef>
							with the enquiry, art thou he that should come— After all this, a
							Pharisee invites him to his table—and while there; a woman, <persRef
								ref="luke">Luke</persRef> says, a Sinner came in with a box of
							precious ointment, with which she anointed the feet of Jesus, kissing
							them and wiping them with her hair— The pharisee secretly taxes Jesus
							with keeping bad company, and of course being no prophet but an
							impostor. Jesus detecting his suspicions, tells him the parable of the
							two debtors and makes him acknowledge that the debtor to whom the most
							was forgiven will love the most—then compares the woman’s kindness to
							him with that of the pharisee himself; declares that of the woman much
							the best; and then because she loved much, her sins, which were many,
							were forgiven— Here are many sins forgiven for personal adulation; and
							the kindness of the pharisee roughly buffeted because it was not so
							obsequious as that of the woman— The <persRef ref="mark;matthew;john"
								>other three Apostles</persRef> tell the story with entirely
							different circumstances.— With them <persRef ref="simonthepharisee"
								>Simon</persRef> is not a pharisee, but a leper— The woman is
								<persRef ref="mary3">Mary</persRef>, the sister of <persRef
								ref="martha">Martha</persRef> and of <persRef ref="lazarus"
								>Lazarus</persRef>.— She is not mentioned as a sinner, nor are her
							sins forgiven; but <persRef ref="judas-iscariot">Judas</persRef> the
							Traitor, blames her for wasting the precious ointment, and she is
							justified by Jesus— This Mary passes somewhat dubiously for Mary
							Magdalen, but Luke does not name her. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt was severe upon the pharisee. So is <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon</persRef>— I do not exactly see why— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt administered the communion, and
							prayed for <persRef ref="lee-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lee</persRef>, who died of a Typhus fever this afternoon. She was
							the daughter of the late <persRef ref="baxter-catharine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Anthony W. Baxter</persRef> who died
							last Winter. A family sadly broken up— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s afternoon discourse was from 1. Thessalonians 5:23 [“]And the
							very God of Peace sanctify you wholly: And I pray God your whole spirit
							and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord
							Jesus Christ.”— He detained the members of the Church and read the
							Letter of invitation from the church at Jamaica plains, to the
							ordination of <persRef ref="allen-joseph3">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> Joseph H. Allen</persRef> the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> He proposed me as the delegate to go with him which was
							voted.</p>

						<p>The rain continued till after I rose this morning and the thermometer
							having risen to 56 there was thick fog, and lightening without thunder.
							In the course of the morning the sky cleared away. I am compelled to
							surrender the hours before breakfast to my preparations for the west,
							with drawing them from the service of bodily exercise and planting. Yet
							my progress in the labour before me is so slow that I shall certainly
							not be ready for the pledged address at Dedham—the Lecture at
							Springfield and the Discourse at Cincinnati—besides the unexpected and
							sudden calls to speak, which keep me upon the rack— Last evening and
							this morning I wrote two Letters to <persRef ref="hay-alexander"
								>Alexander Hay</persRef>, one as chairman of a Committee of 50
							citizens from a meeting of Friends of Liberty at Pittsburgh
							Pennsylvania, and the other as Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh—both
							being invitations to me to visit that place on my way to or from
							Cincinnati.— A gentleman beggar by the name of <persRef
								ref="sanderson-francis">Francis Sanderson</persRef> paid me a
							transient visit. <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H. Adams</persRef>
							dined with us, and assisted my granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary Louisa</persRef> in making up the Memorial of my July tour to
							Canada, and the Falls of Niagara—in many respects the most memorable
							period of my life— It consists of the Newspaper reports of the
							complimentary receptions which I met at Saratoga—Ogdensburgh; the Falls,
							Buffalo, Rochester, Canandaigua, Auburn, Syracuse, Utica, Herkimer,
							Little-falls, Schenectady, Albany and Pittsfield; which I pray God may
							not have turned my head. I have gathered the articles containing the
							notices of my progress—the addresses made to me and my answers, and now
							have the slips pasted into an old book for <persRef ref="wedgwood-ralph"
								>Wedgwood’s</persRef> copying press, which I have had these 50 years
							and never used— Among my troubles now is the multitude of Letters that I
							receive from day to day and have neither leisure, time, nor even often
							the ability to answer— This day 1. from <persRef ref="spooner-lysander"
								>Lysander Spooner</persRef>, with a pamphlet upon Constitutional
							Law, relative to credit, currency and Banking. 2 From <persRef
								ref="fay-theodore">Theodore S. Fay</persRef> U.S. Secretary of
							Legation at Berlin, 13. August 1843. with an enclosure from <persRef
								ref="hiester-john">John D. Hiester</persRef>, and 3 other papers
							relating to the claim of <persRef ref="flugel-johann">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Flügel</persRef>, U.S. Consul at
							Leipzig, 3. From <persRef ref="howard-tilghman">T. A. Howard</persRef>
							Rockville, Indiana 23. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1843. with
							perplexing enquiries concerning periodical journals. Howard was a worthy
							democratic member of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress 1.
							Session, from Indiana. 4. From <persRef ref="howard-samuel">Samuel
								Howard</persRef>, and 2 others—Committee of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> club. N. 2 New-York, Switzerland
							County Indiana 12. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1843. asking my
							opinion on a curious contested election question. I cannot answer these
							Letters. I called this afternoon at <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah Brigham’s</persRef> shop to see
							him, but he was gone to Weymouth— At <persRef key="adams-charles2">my

								Brigham</persRef> called on me this morning and I told him that
							having found it necessary to set out upon my journey to Cincinnati
							earlier than I had intended, I wished to change the day for my address
							to the inhabitants of Norfolk County, and of the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congressional District of Massachusetts, from Thursday the
								26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month to Tuesday the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi>— And I requested him to give notice of
							this change to the other members of the Committee; and in the Newspapers
							of the District, which he very cheerfully promised to do. He thought the
							hour we had agreed upon was 11. in the morning, and I now agreed to fix
							that as the hour; but 10 was the hour upon which we had agreed, and I
							should not have consented to change it— I have a fearful weight upon my
							mind to prepare at once for Dedham, Springfield and Cincinnati, to keep
							my Diary in the current of time, and not to neglect entirely my
							correspondence— I receive so many Letters, and upon subjects so
							multifarious, that even the memory of receiving many of them escapes me,
							and I propose now to endorse and file them first chronologically; and
							alphabetically at the close of each month— I answered last Night and
							this morning Letters from <persRef ref="burnet-jacob">judge
								Burnet</persRef> and <persRef ref="mitchel-ormsby">professor O. M.
								Mitchel</persRef> of Cincinnati; promising if practicable to reach
							that city by the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November; the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> being the day named by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mitchel for the ceremony. I wrote also. 1.
							to <persRef ref="kirkham-john">John B. Kirkham</persRef> of Springfield
							apprizing him, that the day of my departure from home is changed from
							the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of the next to the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of the present month, when I hope to
							reach Springfield in time to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum at that
							place. 2. to <persRef ref="lamb-john2">John F. Lamb</persRef>, at
							Frankford near Philadelphia, declining a renewed invitation to deliver a
							Lecture there. 3. To <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>, Philadelphia, who has twice transmitted to me
							these invitations to lecture at Frankford.— I return his courtesy with a
							lot of the same article. In political intercourse it may often be our
							duty to respect a man whom we cannot esteem; and in the encounter of
							partizan hostility we must ma<unclear>ke</unclear> large allowance for
							the possible injustice of our own prejudices and prepossessions. I
							received this day Letters 1. From <persRef ref="howard-tilghman">T. A.
								Howard</persRef>, Rockville Indiana 23 Sept<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> 1843. Another political adversary, asking good offices for a
							literary institution. Can I deny, or withhold them? 2. From <persRef
								ref="wakeman-thaddeus">T. B. Wakeman</persRef>—New-York—with a
							printed circular notice of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> annual
							Fair of the American Institute at New-York and a skein of black sewing
							silk. 3. From <persRef ref="wright-albert">Albert Wright</persRef>,
							superintendent of common schools, Washington County, New-York, 28
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1843. who is to write upon
							physical education, and asks for my experiences— How shall I answer <hi
								rend="italic">him</hi>?— There was this afternoon a very sudden
							thunder gust; and a beautiful double rainbow. Walk up the hill— <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

						<p>I devoted this day to labour and made my record of yesterday before
							breakfast— I thought I should have a long morning for writing, but
								<persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis</persRef> my Co-Executor of the Will of the late <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alicia
								Boylston</persRef> his widow came, and informed me, that last
							Wednesday M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston, who resides with
								<persRef ref="boylston-john">her son</persRef> at Providence
							Rhode-Island had a severe fit of palsy, which may be hourly expected to
							terminate fatally. That her right side is wholly impotent and she is
							speechless, though still in full possession of her mind. The event of
							her decease will impose upon him and me immediate and complicated
							duties, which will require our immediate and most assiduous attention—
							We read carefully the Will over together. The three Co-Executors are
							also constituted joint Trustees for the management of the Estate, real
							and personal, for the payment of sundry annuities, rents and profits,
							and of sundry bequests to take effect on the decease of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston— The Trust is almost a
							perpetuity, and the will requires that on the decease of either of the
							Trustees the survivors shall nominate a person to be appointed by the
							judge of Probate as the third Trustee, so that there may be always
							three, during the continuance of the Trust— A life estate was given to
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston, in all the real Estate,
							but the moment after her decease the Trust attaches to it all. We agreed
							1. That in the event of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston’s
							decease, we must immediately nominate a third Trustee for the
							appointment by the judge of probate, and that it shall be <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, if he will consent. 2. That
							from the moment of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston’s decease
							accounts must be opened by the Trusts with all the Estates specifically
							devised, and with all the annuitants and beneficiaries 3.— That the
							option must be offered to <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>, to
								<hi rend="italic">occupy</hi> the Princeton Estate, and to <persRef
								ref="boylston-thomas">Thomas Boylston</persRef> to occupy the
							Roxbury Estate; in which case the management of them will devolve upon
							themselves respectively; and if they decline occupying them they must do
							it in writing to be kept of record in the probate Office. 4. That an
							inventory should be taken of all the property, with which the Trustees
							will be chargeable from the day of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Boylston’s decease—and a list of all the persons to whom they will have
							bequests or annuities to pay. 5. That they must take possession of all
							papers relating to the Execution of the will or the trusts, which have
							been hitherto in the possession of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Boylston— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis has received also from
								<persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef>, by the Acadia,
							yesterday arrived one copy of the bond to be executed by us which he
							left with me. The other copy is to come by the Great Western. I promised
							to go next Monday to Boston, with an account for settlement between the
							Administrations of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas
								Boylston</persRef> and <persRef ref="gill-moses">Moses
								Gill</persRef>, of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis
							promised to give notice to <persRef ref="fuller-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Fuller</persRef>— I called at
								<persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brigham’s</persRef> shop, but he was gone to Boston.— I left at the
							Aurora Office a notice for publication to-morrow.</p>

						<p>Though I intermitted the morning excursion before Sunrise, and devoted
							the whole day to labour I was yet unable to complete my record before
							breakfast, and then the hours slip’d away: the noon bell rang, and my
							page was scarcely finished when I was called to dinner. The Quincy
							Aurora of this day has the notice that I left at the Office yesterday,
							that I will address the People of the County of Norfolk and of the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional district of Massachusetts
							on Tuesday the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month at 10.
							A.M. at Dedham— There is also a separate notification by the Norfolk
							County Committee to the same effect— I called at <persRef
								ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brigham’s</persRef> shop, and agreed with him about the hour, and
							said it would be important to me to come home that day to dinner to have
							half the day to prepare for my departure the next morning. I then called
							in at the Quincy Patriot Office and requested the republication in that
							paper on Saturday of my notification in this day’s Aurora; which was
							promised.— <persRef ref="green-john3">Green</persRef> the Editor of the
							Patriot is convalescent from a Typhus fever, but was not at the office—
							On my way, finding the grave-yard open, I went in, and saw the
							improvements they are making there. A strong cemented wall, with an iron
							gate and railing have been recently placed as a fence fronting the
							road—the old tombstone of the parish ministers has been rebuilt by the
							Ladies of Quincy, and the range of excavated tombs, with the names of
							their owners is carried round 3. sides of the square— But not a trace is
							to be found either of <persRef ref="quincy-john">John Quincy</persRef>
							or of <persRef ref="quincy-anne">Anna Fiske</persRef> his mother—nor of
								<persRef ref="quincy-elizabeth2">John Quincy’s wife</persRef>, all

							with <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef>; consulting
							about some inscription; and some improvement upon the family tomb, which
							belonged to <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and where his
							remains, and those of <persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef>
							were at first deposited— My Son came home with me, and I proposed to him
							in the event of <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Boylston’s</persRef> decease, that we should nominate

							created by <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas
								Boylston’s</persRef> Will— He asked my advice, and I advised and
							earnestly intreated him to accept the trust. He read over the Will and
							made no objection to my proposal.— He brought me a deed of a small strip
							of land for ten dollars to be conveyed to <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer4"
								>Ebenezer Adams</persRef>, which I and <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> signed and sealed— I

							the <persRef ref="jackson-henry3">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Henry Jackson</persRef> of New-Bedford in answer to enquiries about
							my eyes but I found not one half hour to write a Letter for this day—
							After dinner I read some pages of <persRef ref="bailly-jean"
								>Bailly</persRef> and some pages of <persRef ref="smith-adam">Adam
								Smith’s</persRef> History of Astronomy without ascertaining as I
							wanted the origin of the existing Zodiac, and Grecian Constellations— I
							bethought myself of <persRef ref="dupuis-charles">Dupuis’s</persRef>
							Origine de tous les cultes and supposing I might find there what I
							wanted, I borrowed the 11 volumes from the town Library and they engaged
							me till day light failed— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

							struck midnight.</p>

						<p>The whole hemisphere was covered with watery clouds, excepting a small

						<p>Stormy Night, and day. <persRef ref="francis-convers">Doctor Convers
								Francis</persRef>, Professor of Pulpit eloquence and the pastoral
							care at Harvard University preached, this morning from Revelation 2.7.
							“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
							churches.—[”] There is something so original, in D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Francis’s manner of treating his subject that I cannot
							follow the links of connection between his text and his discourse— There
							was commentary upon the words of the text, the meanin of which is rather
							obscure—he finally expounded them to mean a Message from the holy spirit
							to the Christian churches— The argument was intricate; and its drift not
							very obvious till it came suddenly to its conclusion—namely that
							whatever might be the doctrines preached in the name of the spirit none
							were genuine but such as led directly to the improvement of mankind in
							practical morality, virtue and benevolence— I did not expect that this
							would be the peculiar axiom, drawn from that text— Neither could I
							perceive the flaw in the thread— The first hymn which the Doctor gave
							out to be sung was 536. of <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef> Christian Psalter— My
							hymn for sabbath morning.— There are in that collection 22. Psalms and
							hymns of my composition; but the exultation of heart that I felt on
							hearing it read and sung as a part of the devotions of the day was
							preposterous and I own sinful vanity. I pray God to suppress in me, all
							pride at any manifestations of human applause that I may have recently
							receive, and to dispose me in the sincerity of my Soul, to see in them
							only lessons of humiliation— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis
							dined with us and preached this afternoon, from 1. Corinthians 15.10.
							[“]But, by the grace of God I am what I am”; another text which I should
							not have selected as peculiarly copious of instruction. But perhaps the
							perfection of the art of preaching consists in extracting a large nut
							from a small shell. The Doctor’s lesson was that all Christians should
							consider themselves to be what they are, by the grace of God; and it is
							doubtless the duty and the joy of a virtuous man, to live with God
							always in his thoughts D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis gave
							notice that from this time for the winter the morning hour of meeting
							will be half past 10. and the afternoon a quarter before 2— My most
							urgent labour necessarily lags behind— I consulted <persRef
								ref="sotheby-william">Sotheby’s</persRef> Georgics, for the line.

							Neither the original nor record of which could be found at the office at

								<persRef ref="bassett-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bassett</persRef> the Clerk of the U.S. Courts, where I borrowed a

								ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alicia

							and then make the appointment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis had

							Since which he has been prosperous in life and is now one of the

							without order or selection of seeds.— The morning was gone and I was
							called to dinner— It was scarcely over when <persRef

							between this and then, which would suit the Quincy Lyceum, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cummings thanked me for my former services

								<persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went to Boston, and

						<p>Rising an hour later than my time, precludes the making up of my record

							protract my journey beyond the absolute necessity required for the
							performance of the duty which I have engaged to perform; and that
							becomes more formidable as I approach the day of performance. Even now
							it brings me to the borders of distraction— There are numerous reasons

							deliver an address to the whigs at Boston upon the public Lands; about
							which he said the People were very much in the dark.— But I have already

							modern Astronomy in the North American Review of April 1825. without
							finishing it— A valuable Article to which I must if possible again

								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, Charles and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> went to Boston, and returned

								<persRef ref="quincy-samuel3">Samuel</persRef> was with him— My Son

						<p>An uninterrupted and yet an inefficient day— </p>
						<p><persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston and
							returned to dine— </p>
						<p>Great part of the day was consumed in packing up my files of Letters from
							1838 to 1842 inclusive in one of the rough hewn chests from Washington,
							which they fill.— All the files from 1829. to the close of the last year
							are now packed in these two chests but it would require a week of time
							to repack them in perfect order, and they might very advantageously be
							decimated for preservation, and nine in ten of them committed to the
							flames. I found upon the files sundry papers which I have long been
							searching for in vain Among them the bond of indemnity and release to
								<persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef>, which has been
							so long missing: five of my son Charles’s quarterly accounts, and the
							statement of the <persRef ref="gill-moses;gill-moses2">Gill</persRef>
							claim on the Administration of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas
								Boylston’s</persRef> Estate, which I drew up in June 1839. and which
							had so unaccountably disappeared.— I received this day Letters 1. from
								<persRef ref="sweet-samuel">Samuel N. Sweet</persRef>. 7. Oct<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Rochester New-York, with a narrative of
							my visit to Rochester, by a youth named <persRef ref="chumasero-john"
								>John C. Chumasero</persRef>, and some enquiry of my opinion
							concerning a book upon elocution of which he is the author and presented

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> enquiries and remarks upon Astronomy,
							with much highly interesting matter— All these Letters require answers,
							but where shall I find to write them.— I finished reading this day
								<persRef ref="smith-adam">Smith’s</persRef> posthumous fragment
							history of Astronomy to the time of <persRef ref="newton-isaac"
								>Newton</persRef>, and <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">D<hi

							Astronomy in the North American Review of April 1825.—both excellent
							summaries—the Article taking it up, where Smith leaves it, and the two
							forming together a complete and very useful abridgement of the history
							of the Science from its origin down to 1825.— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bowditch confines himself to mere matter of fact; indulging
							far less in philosophical speculation than the man of Scotland.—
							Bowditch’s Review is precious for the selection of topics which the
							modern Astronomers have chiefly discussed; and for the list of the
							recent Astronomical writers whose works he recommends with favourable
							notice. Among them is a History of ancient Astronomy in 2. 4<hi
								rend="superscript">to.</hi> Volumes Astronomy of the middle ages in
							1. and of modern Astronomy in 2. by <persRef ref="delambre-jean"
								>Delambre</persRef> which I have never seen— Charles brought me a

								ref="french-george">George French</persRef> said yes, and shewed me
							to a chamber up two pair of stairs, where was a mean looking woman, in a
							decent mourning dress. To shew me who she was she exhibited two
							certificates of good character and conduct one by the name of <persRef
								ref="u">Vinsen</persRef>, and the other signed by a minister of a
							church at Saybook in Connecticut attesting her admission as a member of
							the church there in 1836. She then told me a long story of her living at
							Washington from 1822 to 1828. of her subsequent marriage with <persRef
								ref="hovey-aaron">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hovey</persRef> and
							of their poverty and destitution— She wanted money.— I asked her if she
							lived with her husband? Sometimes.— But he had been for a long time

							refused to give her money, with some expression of indignation that she,
							a member of the church should come here to demand money of <hi

								<persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef> from Boston, who dined with us. While we were at

						<p>A pattern day. When I rose, the sky was beclouded with lucid spots in the

							40.</p>
						<p>Clear sky—whereupon I went up the hill and saw the Sun rise, and
							consequently could not finish my daily record before breakfast— Calisto
							was perpendicular to the horizon from my Northeastern window tail
							downwards, Benetnasch so far above the horizon that I assume Arcturus
							rose at 5. but I did not see him— At 5 the dawn is so far advanced the
							bright stars of the Bear herself have faded almost out of sight, and
							those in her paws are no longer visible.— They do not indeed properly
							belong to the Bear any more than Asterion or Chara.— My only domestic

							claret wine from the cask purchased last week of <persRef
								ref="williams-john7;williams-moses">John D and M. Williams</persRef>
							in my cellars.— I have taken this occasion to have the cellars
							themselves cleared out, which was needed; and which I have too long
							neglected. I had upwards of 200 of the bottles of claret deposited in
							the arch under west-end of the house and 6 dozen in the Arch under the
							East-end— In the central cellar I found 5 boxes of wines brought in 1829
							from Washington, and took out of one box 12 bottles of Vin de la Nerthe
							packed up at Tain—choice Hermitage— I must give it away. <persRef

							me day and night.— But I said I supposed there would be reporters there
							from the Boston Newspapers; and they must put up with their reports; for

							be impossible for me to deliver the address at Dedham; and if it should
							be so, I must rely upon the Committee to give notice to the People of

						<p>I asked <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript"

							conditional bequests to the amount of 3000 dollars to Harvard
							University, and 1000 to the inhabitants of the Town of Princeton, about
							which Letters must be written by the Trustees, and Charles has prepared
							a draught of a Letter to <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Nicholas

							to which the Executors must attend before I go hence.— I took to the
							Post-Office a Letter to <persRef ref="teal-hiram">Hiram Teall</persRef>
							and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> and worked like a pack-horse to
							finish the astronomical Oration without success— I found <persRef

							preached this morning from Galatians 5.22. [“]But the fruit of the
							spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness,
							faith.”— The discourse was a commentary—upon the Spirit, as producing
							the blessings enumerated, one by one in succession, dwelling much upon
							the spiritual character of Christianity contrasted as it is in the
							context with the works of the flesh, and of the law, that is the
							Levitical Law.— This contrast is very remarkably set forth in the
							chapter from which the text is taken, and towards the close of his
							sermon, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt adverted with great severity
							to the doctrines which represent the Creator of the universe as a cruel
							unrelenting tyrant making the race of man not for happiness, but for
							misery— His text in the afternoon was from 1. Samuel 30.24—“but as his
							part is, that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that
							tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.” I scarcely know how he
							brought this text to bear upon the excellence of Christianity; but upon
							whatever text M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt preaches, his argument
							always drifts into that the excellence of Christianity— His mind is
							copious of details, but not rich in variety of first principles. His
							sermons are almost always fitted to one frame, like the holy families of
							the Italian painters— I had counted upon the remnant of this day after
							meeting to write the peroration of my address at Dedham—as I wrote the
							exordium last Night. These two parts being all that I can prepare, and
							these being now excessively hurried— But I was scarcely seated at my
							table when I was called to two men from Watervil in the State of Maine,
							named <persRef ref="doolittle-orea">Doolittle</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="savage-esau">Savage</persRef>. Their only object was to see me
							as a curiosity—and they were scarcely gone, when <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Grand</persRef> came in from Boston and spent the Evening with us.
							He said that the Bank of England was every now and then in trouble—very
							much embarrassed to make good its payments. That he knew the cause of
							this, and the remedy; and in an hour’s conversation with <persRef
								ref="peel-robert">Sir Robert Peel</persRef> could put him in
							possession of a plan which would avert any such danger forever. He only
							wanted such an introduction to him as would induce Sir Robert Peel to
							listen to him one hour, and he could do no other than adopt his plan,
							and would pay him largely for it— And he asked if I would give him a
							Letter of introduction to Sir Robert Peel. I answered that my
							acquaintance with Sir Robert Peel was not sufficient to authorise me to
							give Letters of introduction to any one— Degrand is crazy.</p>

						<p>I was up till near one this morning, preparing for this day, and at half

							not half prepared— I wanted one week more.— At half past seven this
							morning, with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brigham</persRef> I rode to Dedham, and were met by a cavalcade at
							Paul’s bridge, who escorted us to the house of <persRef
								ref="sweet-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sweet</persRef>—
							There I received and shook hands with perhaps 200 men and 8 or 10 women
							from many towns of the congressional district— At 10. a procession was
							formed under the direction of <persRef ref="adams-thomas11">Major Thomas
								Adams</persRef> of Quincy, which wheeled round into the <persRef
								ref="burgess-ebenezer">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi

								ref="copeland-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Copeland</persRef>, chairman of the Norfolk County Convention’s
							Committee, read the Resolution of the Convention inviting me to address
							the whigs of the County— A song, tune of Auld lang Syne, highly
							complimentary to me was sung, and I delivered my Address of two hours
							and a half, to a house as crowded as it could hold—a miserable fragment
							of what it should have been; cut short by my observing the clock, close
							upon the stroke of one.— I gave <persRef ref="brewer-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brewer</persRef>, one of the Editors
							of the Atlas, the written part of my speech, and he promised a report of
							the whole in the Atlas, to-morrow. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brigham said he was obliged to stay sometime upon business with the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bass</persRef>.— Charles and I with
							his son <persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>, who had gone
							with us returned home to Quincy to dine— After dinner, <persRef
								ref="spear-william">deacon Spear</persRef> came with the ultimatum
							of <persRef ref="bass-josiah2">Josiah Bass jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> 1200 dollars for his two lots of woodland,
							which I declined accepting, but adhered to my offer of 30 dollars an

							about 50 Shag bark walnuts, and sundry peach stones and whole pears, in
							a hurried half hour but was again obliged to abandon all the plantations
							and transplantations that I had projected— While we were at the round

							to take <persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> with me.</p>

						<p>Yesterday was one of the most beautiful days of autumn, and was
							peculiarly favourable to the meeting at Dedham— The weather this morning
							was not promising; but after a hasty breakfast at a quarter past 5 I
							came in the Carriage alone to the depot of the Western Rail-road at
							Boston, which I reached at 10 minutes past 6. <persRef ref="benjamin2"
								>Benjamin</persRef> then took the Carriage to <persRef
								ref="bigelow-rufus">Bigelow’s</persRef> livery stable in Hawley
							place, and engaged a man to take the Carriage and horses out to Quincy—
							While he was gone I saw to the securing our trunks in the baggage waggon
							and took the keys— <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell</persRef> came soon, and
								<persRef ref="grinnell-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Grinnell</persRef> was with him. <persRef ref="stearns-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns</persRef> of Springfield
							accosted me, and said he had come to Boston to escort me to Springfield—
							At 7. the Cars started from the depot, and at half past 9. we reached
							Worcester <persRef ref="dalton-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dalton</persRef> the husband of <persRef ref="dalton-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grinnell’s sister</persRef> came also

							Car in which we had taken our seats, and left us at West Brookfield.— He

							from a newspaper slip, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Letter
							to the party which gave a public dinner to <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter</persRef>— We reached Springfield

									rend="superscript">r</hi> William B. Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="kirkham-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John B

								ref="bliss-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bliss</persRef>
							of Wilbraham, a person rather eccentric in his conversation, but very
							kind in his disposition who said he had come 12 miles from Wilbraham
							purposely to see me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morris was also
							warmly complimentary in his expressions of respect for my character We
							took lodging at <persRef ref="warriner-jeremy">Warriner’s</persRef>
							Hotel one of the best in the United States. He gave me an excellent bed
							chamber with a fire— We dined at 2. and after dinner I was so worn down
							with weariness, three almost sleepless Nights, and anxiety that my
							faculties seemed benumbed and I felt as if falling into a lethargy. I
							retired to my chamber, threw myself on a bed and had two hours of
							refreshing sleep— <persRef ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Howard</persRef> had been one of the first persons to greet us on
							our arrival— We took tea at his house.— His family consists of <persRef
								ref="u;u">two daughters</persRef> both invalids, one particularly in
							appearance healthy and handsome, but threatened with blindness.— At half
							past six we repaired to a meeting house, and I read my Lecture on
							Society and civilization—from a Stage in front of the pulpit, before a
							table with four wax candles— I read the manuscript with great difficulty
							and frequent hesitation— A crowded house, and listening auditory, an
							hour and a half.</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Lathrop’s</persRef> house was

							We returned to <persRef ref="warriner-jeremy">Warriner’s</persRef> took

								ref="dalton-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dalton</persRef>
							to depart a quarter of an hour later for Boston. We reached Greenbush as
							the Clock in Albany was striking six— The distance is one hundred miles
							Before the railway traveling, the journey from Boston to Albany occupied
							two days and a half. It is now daily performed from 7. in the morning to
							6 in the Evening. But the work on this road which cost about ten
							millions of dollars and was completed in six years is much greater than
							the pyramids of Egypt or the wall of China— About 15 miles west of
							Springfield, there is a stream branching out from Westfield river called
							the<space/>winding along the precipitous rocks, and over which in the
							space of a mile eleven bridges have been cast—one of them where the
							excavation was 70 feet deep, caved in last Monday, and made a breach
							which has been temporarily repaired with timber, and over which the
							passage is not without danger— In passing the Hudson, at Greenbush,
							Mercy saved me from a broken leg or neck. At Albany I met <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah">Josiah Quincy jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>In crossing the river last evening, I felt as if I was incrusted in a bed
							of snow— The sun had peered out just before going down, but set in a
							cloud.— We lodged at Congress hall, where I was surprized to meet
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah
								Quincy jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> and a young
							Englishman named <persRef ref="u">Crawford</persRef>, who two days
							before had been introduced to me at Dedham— The <persRef
								ref="dickinson-daniel">Lieutenant Governor</persRef> and Senate of
							New-York are in Session as the Supreme Court of Errors and most of them
							were lodging at Congress Hall— As was the U.S. District judge <persRef
								ref="conkling-alfred">Conklin</persRef> whom I met in the entry, and
							who told me he had been holding a court.— When I awoke this morning I
							heard a rattling of hail against the windows of my bed chamber, which
							continued and turned to snow. I wrote till half past 6. when I sallied
							out to the barber’s shop adjoining the hall and was shaved.— As I was
							putting on my coat after coming out of the hands of the shaver, another
							man who was sitting on the anxious stool, looking at me, says, who is
							that Stranger? said I, my name is John Quincy Adams, if you ever heard
							it before.— I thought so, said he—starting up, with his face covered
							with lath; came and shook hands with me, and said his name was <persRef
								ref="u">Weeks</persRef>— At 7. O’Clock we breakfasted, and at 8 were
							driven in a cab omnibus to the train of western cars, which were frozen
							to the ground so that it took half an hour of hard tugging, and
							scourging of horses to get them loose— Another half hour was lost in
							raising to its operative point the steam of the loco-motive, and the
							snow falling incessantly on the rail made it so slippery that great care
							was necessary to guard the wheels from slipping off the rail. The snow
							continued inexorably till we arrived at Utica, nearly two hours belated.
							Precisely such an accident had happened to me on the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st</hi> of Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1841.
							when I first attempted the Western rail-road from Boston to the Hudson

							October, but <persRef ref="u">Marshal Bertrand</persRef> had it last
							Monday the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>— And there was a snow storm
							which covered the ground on the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> My
							only resource this day was to adhere to my seat in the car, the whole
							way to Utica, with the windows closed, passing through Schenectady
							Amsterdam, Little falls and Herkimer, and the whole valley of the Mohawk
							as if in the dead of Night—at Utica, I found <persRef
								ref="johnson-charles3">Charles Adams Johnson</persRef> at the depot;
							but his brother <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William</persRef> had

							at Utica, during which <persRef ref="johnson-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander B. Johnson</persRef> came to
							bid us welcome and farewell— We started from Utica, just before sunset
							and reached Syracuse at half past 9 in the evening. The cars proceeded
							this evening to Auburn<space/>miles further, but we had our trunks taken
							out of the baggage waggon and took our lodging for the night here to
							take the morning train to-morrow.— <persRef ref="storer-john">M<hi

						<p>There is no uniformity in human more monotonous than that of traveling in
							rail-road Cars.— We traversed this day 180 miles of one of the most
							beautiful Countries in the world, presenting at this moment a dreary and
							desolate aspect like Nova Zembla in January one white sheet of snow
							covering two thirds of the way, and bare ground the
							remainder—interspersed with Orchards loaded with apples. It was the same
							country through which I had passed last July, with so many flattering
							testimonials of kindness and regard by the inhabitants— My passage now
							is silent and unnoticed— It is known only to <persRef ref="johnson-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> of Utica and his family that I am upon this road—
							At Geneva we found <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William Clarkson
								Johnson</persRef> waiting for us, and he came on with us. At Auburn,
							Canandaigua, and Rochester we met persons whom we had seen in the Summer
							but whose names all slip from my memory, excepting <persRef
								ref="granger-gideon2">Gideon Granger</persRef> son of <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Francis</persRef> at Canandaigua. The father
							is at New-York— During the short half hour for changing cars at Auburn,
							a gentleman went to give notice to <persRef ref="seward-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William H Seward</persRef> that I was
							there, but he was not at home. We reached Rochester just before 5. p.m.
							and had half an hour to go to the hotel, dine and return to the cars. We
							had yet 80 miles to travel, and night was coming on. At Batavia, where
							the platform broke down when we passed through before, there was
							solitude now—but the keeper of the house <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef> remembered me, and
							introduced to me his sister and his daughter— Of fellow travellers we
							had many changes through the day— Several of them recognized and
							conversed with me; but left no trace of themselves on my memory except
							the President of Geneva College, and I do not remember his name— At
							every station where the cars stop for wood and water, there is a large
							table spread with hot tea and coffee, bread and butter cakes, puddings
							and pies, of which any passenger may partake at his option for a cent or
							a dollar. From the rail-road depot at Buffalo to the American hotel we
							came in a double cab— At a quarter before one Sunday morning they gave
							me a small bed-chamber for the night, and at two I was in bed.</p>

						<p>The room in which I slept was so small, so cold and so dark, that they
							gave me another this morning, very comfortable, the same in which I had
							slept last July. Immediately after breakfast, <persRef

								Thompson</persRef>, <persRef ref="johns-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John’s</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dobbins-d">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dobbins</persRef>
							called on me, and informed me, that they together with <persRef
								ref="hunter-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="reed-charles">General Charles M Read</persRef>, member
							of Congress elect from the Eri District of Pennsylvania, had been
							appointed a Committee by the inhabitants of the borough to invite me to
							visit them on my way to Cincinnati—which invitation I accepted and it
							was agreed that we should embark at 8. O’Clock to morrow morning in the
							Steamer Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Wayne in which those gentlemen
							had come down to meet me— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fillmore</persRef> immediately after
							came in and invited us to tea at his house this evening, and offered us
							seats in his pew at the unitarian church which we accepted. The preacher
							was <persRef ref="hosmer-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hosmer</persRef> and his text was from Matthew 6.31. “What shall we
							eat? or, What shall we drink? Or, wherewithal shall we be clothed?” He
							left out the preceding words of the verse [“]Therefore, take no thought
							saying” so that the Sermon was not directly upon the negative precept,
							but upon the anxious cravings of mankind for the supply of these wants
							incident to their physical nature— The discourse was an earnest and
							affectionate exhortation to the auditory not to indulge this excessing
							anxiety for the necessaries of life, but to guard against them by
							industry moderation and frugality and most especially by suppressing
							their propensities to lavish and extravagant expense, which he denounced
							as the besetting sin of the age and especially of the place.— An
							excellent and eminently practical Sermon.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hosmer gave notice that the anniversary festival of the
							protestant reformation would be held this evening. I observed that the
							usage of the worshipers here is to be seated during prayer, and to stand
							at the singing of the hymns. They use the compilation of the late
								<persRef ref="greenwood-francis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenwood</persRef>— We dined at the Hotel and by invitation of
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rogers</persRef>
							attended the evening service of the episcopal church: where a stranger,
							read prayers for the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity and <persRef ref="hawks-cicero">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawkes</persRef>, the settled minister was the preacher— His text
							and his sermon have slipped from my memory, which is the fault not of
							his mediocrity, but of my lethargy. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawkes is a young man, a brother of the celebrated <persRef
								ref="hawks-francis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawkes</persRef>;
							and married a <persRef ref="hawks-anne">sister</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="stanly-julia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edward
								Stanly</persRef>. Returning from church I met in the street my old
							friend <persRef ref="tracy-albert">Albert H. Tracy</persRef>, and was
							visited at the hotel by <persRef ref="u">Lieut<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Williams</persRef> the engineer, and others— We
							attended a tea and evening party at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fillmore’s— <persRef ref="love-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Love</persRef> having insisted that I should first stop in at his
							house where <persRef ref="love-julia">his eldest daughter</persRef> sung
							and played on the Piano the old armed Chair— Conversation with

						<p>I wrote this morning till near breakfast time— No one can imagine the
							labour of my hands to keep this diary up with the current of time— It
							requires an average of two hours every day, and in the ordinary current
							of business at home, I have no difficulty in fixing the time—the hours
							before breakfast are always disposable, though not always applied. We
							embarked this morning before 8. in the Steamer Gen<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Wayne, Captain<space/>with falling snow which began about
							5.— We had many opinions of the great imprudence of going out in that
							state of the weather but the depution from Erie were impatient to get
							home and I was not less impatient to reach as soon as possible the point
							of my destination Cincinnati.— I made therefore no objection to
							departing, but thought it very reckless and absurd— By the time we were
							fairly upon the lake the storm freshened, and after heading the storm
							about an hour, and pitching as if the boat would come to pieces, the
							Captain lodged her at anchor under Point Abino, a small cove on the
							Canadian side of the Lake— I did suppose that it was only for an hour or
							two and that we should resume our progress, at least immediately after
							dinner but the storm continued and the snow howled the whole day, in the
							course of which, a small coasting vessel and the Steamers Buffalo, and
							General Harrison followed our example, and sought refuge under the
							point. As a harbour it is perfectly safe, and the gale was not very
							robusteous— But cold as Nova Zembla— Most of the female passengers, and
							no small proportion of the men were seasick, but my predominating
							sentiment was vexation, at meeting this rebuff on the first moment of my
							committing myself on the bosom of Lake Erie. The Captain insisted upon
							my taking his state-room for my berth, which I did, and lay down two
							hours after dinner.— I was not conscious of having steeped my senses in
							forgetfulness one moment, but <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell</persRef> thought I had taken
							a comfortable nap— I was extremely uneasy at the conscious imbecility of
							being wind-bound, and doing nothing.— I was in that state of mind which
							labours and produces nothing— I lost the day— There was a stereotype
							Bible without the Apocrypha, published by the American Bible Society,
							and presented by the young Men’s bible Society at Buffalo, to the boat.
							I disapprove the omission of the Apocrypha. There was also a volume of
							the Memoirs of the Life of <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Aaron
								Burr</persRef> by <persRef ref="davis-matthew">Matthew L.
								Davis</persRef>— I read several pages of it in confirmation of the
							opinion I have entertained of the trifling and profligate character of
							Burr— The character of his daughter <persRef ref="alston-theodosia"
								>Theodosia</persRef> was not so bad, and not much better.</p>

						<dateline>Point Abino. Tuesday 31. October 1843. Lake Erie.
							Erie.</dateline>
						<p><date>31. IV. </date>Tuesday.</p>
						<p>I went to bed last evening before 9. from merely having nothing to do;
							hoping that with this morning’s dawn the boat would be put under way;
							for the sky cleared off as the Sun went down, with the promise of fair
							weather this day— I rose at 4 this morning believing it was after
							sunrise; but on going upon the upper deck, found my mistake, and
							returned to bed. I could not sleep; nor could I endure to pass another
							day doing nothing— I had promised to write some verses for <persRef
								ref="foster-mary">Mary Foster</persRef>— She is in a deep decline;
							and will probably not live through this winter— She has lately through
								<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> reminded me of
							my promise, and seemed to take it much to heart. As I was ransacking my
							thoughts this morning to write something, it occurred to me to turn the
							incident of our voyage into verse for Mary Foster; and accordingly
							related it in seven four line Stanzas, which I composed—then rose, took
							my writing papers, inkstand and steel pens out of my trunk, wrote the
							verses, and a short Letter to Mary Foster which <persRef
								ref="johnson-william4">W. C. Johnson</persRef> copied into my
							Letter-Book.— At breakfast it was yet expected that we should remain
							wind bound at Point Abino all this day and night. The morning was
							clear—the Sun bright and the water at the point smooth and calm— But
							there was a heavy Northwester blowing on the Lake, and our captain was
							afraid to breast it— I sent for my Diary and wrote up the record of
							Sunday at Buffalo.— When just before 11 the captain determined to weigh
							anchor, and try his luck again upon the lake— The other vessels which
							had taken refuge at the point did the same, and we had a very pleasant
							day of Navigation to Erie in the State of Pennsylvania, where we
							arrived, about 7 in the Evening The crowd at our landing was very great—
							I was taken by the Committee of arrangements one of whom was <persRef
								ref="galbraith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Galbraith</persRef>, to the City Hall, where a complimentary address
							was made to me, by <persRef ref="sill-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sill</persRef> heretofore a member of Congress for this
							district. I answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sill by an address
							to the assembled multitude. I then passed into another hall where a few
							Ladies were sitting, and others were constantly coming in. I made a
							short address on taking leave of them, and with a military escort, a
							band of music, and a fireman’s torch light procession I returned to the
							Steamer and proceeded on my voyage. I had promised <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua R.
								Giddings</persRef>, to stop at Ashtabula, and to visit him at
							Jefferson his place of Residence, but my catarrhal cough with hoarseness
							and a sore throat has returned heavily upon me with symptoms of fever. A
							stoppage at Ashtabula, and Jefferson would delay me another day and the
							roads thence to Cleveland are excessively bad, not without danger. With
							extreme reluctance I determined to pass on to Cleveland.</p>
