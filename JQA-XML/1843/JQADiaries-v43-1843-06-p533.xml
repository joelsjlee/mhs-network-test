						<p>Sun rose 4:26. Sharp frost.</p>
						<p>I find myself already falling into idleness as always happens after I
							have completed a compulsive task, and am left without another bearing
							upon me— The luxury of my life is desultory reading, and my library
							furnishes irresistible temptation to variety of enjoyment— My first duty
							now is to answer Letters of invitation to deliver Orations, Lectures and
							Addresses, and I began with that of <persRef ref="curtis-benjamin">B. R.
								Curtis</persRef> for an Address to the Alumni of Harvard University
							on the day before the next Commencement— The next was from <persRef
								ref="barnard-robert">R. F. Barnard</persRef> President of the
							Berkshire County Agricultural Society, inviting me to deliver an Address
							to that Society at their annual meeting next October—to both these I
							wrote and despatched declining answers—but in addition to the Berkshire
							invitation there is a Letter from <persRef ref="sedgwick-charles"
								>Charles Sedgwick</persRef> and 49 others dated at Lenox, and
							another from Thaddeus Pomeroy and 22 others at Stockbridge which I ought
							to have answered this day but postponed till to-morrow— A man by the
							name of <persRef ref="rich-matthias">Matthias Rich</persRef>, blind,
							came, led by <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, a boy about 12 years of
							age came to beg. He had an old certificate of respectability and of
							indigence dated in 1839. and signed by <persRef ref="reed-john">John
								Reed</persRef> the former member of Congress from Barnstable County—
							He said that he had a family of several children to support, and no
							other means but the bounty of the charitable to assist him; which from
							time to time he went round to solicit, though it was a very mortifying
							occupation— <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tyler</persRef> too came again this afternoon and resumed his
							volunteer task of varnishing all over the house every thing upon which
							he could lay his hand— I rode out this afternoon with <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> and her Son <persRef ref="adams-charles7"
								>Charles</persRef>— We stop’d at <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef> and left a
							Letter from <persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> De Windt</persRef> to her in reply to condolence on the
							decease of <persRef ref="whittemore-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whittemore</persRef>— The Letter announces also the
							birth of a <persRef ref="u">Son</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="dewindt-julia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Van
								Wagenen</persRef>, who was Julia the third daughter of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> De Windt— We then round by the Railway
							Stone Church. After our return, <persRef ref="noyes-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas J. Noyes</persRef> with
								<persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> came to enquire what had been
							done in Congress on the petition of their Grandmother <persRef
								ref="pike-mary">Mary Pike</persRef> for a pension; of which I had
							taken charge, 14. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> last— <persRef
								ref="pike-simeon">Her husband</persRef> was killed at Bunker’s hill—
							I told them that a Bill in her favour had passed the house of
							Representatives, but I believe had failed in the Senate—but not having
							with me the Acts of the last Session of Congress I was unable to answer
							the enquiry with certainty— I attended this Evening at the town hall an
							anatomical lecture by a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Lambert</persRef>—chiefly against the compression of the chest, by
							straight-lacing—from 8 to 1/2 past 9—</p>

						<p>Sun rose 4.25. clear and pinching cold.</p>
						<p>I saw the sun rise from the S.E. corner of <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house. I answered the Letters of <persRef
								ref="sedgwick-charles">Charles Sedgwick</persRef> and Thaddeus
							Pomeroy, but continued idle with miscellaneous reading, and believing
							that I must prepare a Lecture for the next Autumn, meditated upon a
							biographical sketch of <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon</persRef>
							of <persRef ref="machiavelli-nicolo">Nicholas Machiavel</persRef>, of
								<persRef ref="stignatiusloyola">Ignatius Loyola</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="pascal-blaise">Blaise Pascal</persRef>, either of
							which seems to afford a good subject for a moral and entertaining
							Lecture— But if this is ever to be carried into execution it must be
							preceded by much reading. I took up the life of Bacon in the first
							Volume of the Quarto Edition of his works, and read about an hour. I met
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E.
								Price Greenleaf</persRef> in my garden, and walked round with him
							examining my seedling trees.— I mourned the number of various kinds and
							ages apparently killed by the recent frosts after putting forth their
							foliage with cheering promise— Of the Baldwin Apple trees from Medford,
							two at least have holes of the borer worm two or three inches above the
							ground— Several of them bore largely last autumn, and we have now as
							many as a peck of them in sound condition, daily on the dining table. Of
							the Shagbark walnut there are<space/>in the Nursery<space/>in the Garden
							and<space/>in the seminary which I have hope will outlive me more than a
							century— The peaches and button woods have a dreary and haggard
							appearance—many of them entirely dead.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greenleaf brought back a number of books that he had borrowed and asked
							for others—among which <persRef ref="montesquieu-charles"
								>Montesquieu</persRef> and Machiavel in French and Italian— This
							last I have not. but I found in the town’s library an English
							translation of Machiavel’s works, not including the plays; in 4. 8<hi
								rend="superscript">vo.</hi> volumes by <persRef
								ref="farneworth-ellis">Ellis Farneworth</persRef> published in 1775—
							I looked especially for the Prince and found it with a translation of
							the Anti-Machiavel, by <persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederic 2.</persRef>
							king of Prussia, printed alternately chapter by chapter— Several of
							which I read—first the cunning Italian, and then the royal German-French
							commentator. Charles went to Boston, and returned to dine— He brought
							information of the arrival of our chests and trunks and <unclear>boxes</unclear>, ship’d
							at Georgetown in the brig Elizabeth <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Baker</persRef>, but fraudulently landed at Salem— He brought me
							also a Letter from <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Savage</persRef>, President of the Massachusetts
							Historical Society, with a vote of thanks of the Society for the
							Discourse on the New England Confederacy, and a request of a copy for
							the press. <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tyler</persRef> was here varnishing— <persRef ref="turner-ruth">Ruth
								Turner</persRef> to work— <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth

								Tyler</persRef> continues to favour us with volunteer varnishing—and
							this day wrought almost a metempsecosis on the full length portrait of
							my great grandfather <persRef ref="quincy-john">John Quincy</persRef>,
							at two years of age, painted in 1691. and left by his Son <persRef
								ref="quincy-norton">Norton Quincy</persRef>, who died 29. September
							1801— He brought me also a Boston Notion of this morning, containing a
							report of the celebration of last Monday; with seven columns of my
							discourse from the Notes of the Reporter— There are many mistakes, of
							the meaning; but I believe it scarcely possible that a more correct
							report of a speech nearly two hours long, should be taken from the lips
							of the Speaker.— I despatched 3 Letters of apology, for declining to
							deliver the address before the Berkshire County Agricultural Society
							next October— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> came and returned more of
							the books that he had borrowed; and took from the Town’s library the 6.
							volumes of the works of <persRef ref="montesquieu-charles"
								>Montesquieu</persRef> in duodecimo and 2. volumes of Italian
							History. I read several chapters of <persRef ref="machiavelli-nicolo"
								>Machiavel’s</persRef> Prince, and the examen of the same by
								<persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederic of Prussia</persRef>.— I
							believe that a profound examination of both would form an instructive
							and entertaining occupation for this and the next Month—why should I not
							undertake it?— Machiavel, was a republican, Florentine Statesman of the
								15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Century— Frederic the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> a German Prussian King of the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
								>Voltaire</persRef> a French Man of Letters and universal Genius of
							the same age— Frederic wrote his Anti-Machiavel, while he was a Prince,
							and before he became a king.— He wrote in the French language, and the
							first edition of his work was published by Voltaire in Holland. The
							morality of Machiavel characterizes his Age and country; and is
							congenial to the doctrines of papal Rome at the time when <persRef
								ref="luther-martin">Luther</persRef> first raised the standard of
							religious reformation.— Machiavel was born 1469. and Luther 1483. and
								<persRef ref="stignatiusloyola">Ignatius Loyola</persRef> 1491.—
							Comparing the Chapters of the Prince with the Examen of Frederic, the
							Royal commentator has greatly the advantage—but Voltaire in the
							posthumous Memoirs of his own life, charges Frederic with practising on
							the doctrines of Machiavel, however indignantly denouncing them in his
							youthful writings— The infidel spirit of the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> century is apparent in the treatise of Frederic, though
							more gauze covered in the second edition published by himself, than in
							the first published by Voltaire.— The cold weather continues, but while
							we were at dinner there was a heavy shower of rain, accompanied with
							distant thunder— It deprived us of the afternoon, and kept me at work,
							writing— At evening twilight however I walked up the hill, but the roads
							were so muddy that I was obligated to abridge my walk and come in— I
							shingled this day my seedling English Oaks to save them from the
							Sun.</p>

							preached this morning, from 1. Corinthians 10.16. “The cup of blessing
							which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The
							bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?” It
							was a communion day Sermon, and after preaching it he administered the
							communion, of which I partook— There is a peculiar solemnity in this
							religious rite, which in the most impressive manner admonishes every
							sincere Christian of his duties to God, and to his neighbour; and
							especially of the duty of goodwill to all mankind— There is something
							strange and mysterious in the history of the institution of the Jewish
							Passover—and of the substitution of this sacrament in its stead— On the
							night of the going forth of the children of Israel from Egypt, the
							destroying angel had smitten all the first born of the Egyptians— There
							was not a house but had a dead body in it: but the angel had passed over
							all the houses of the Israelites, and in commemoration of that double
							deliverance, on the very night of the Exodus, <persRef ref="moses"
								>Moses</persRef> commanded that their religious year should commence
							with that month, and that every family should annually sacrifice a lamb,
							and feed upon it in remembrance of that wonderful event. Subsequent
							regulations of divine appointment had prescribed that this annual
							festival should be held at Jerusalem, and 1500 years after the
							establishment of the passover Jesus went up to that city to keep the
							passover with his disciples— There it was, while at supper that he
							disclosed the secret of his own destiny, and considering himself as the
							paschal lamb, sacrificed for the sins and deliverance of mankind—he told
							his disciples by a figure of oriental imagery that the bread was his
							flesh, and the wine his blood, which they must annually eat and drink in
							remembrance of him— And now after 3300 years, the Jewish Passover is yet
							annually celebrated in the form of an annual memorial of the ignominious
							death and glorious resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth— And once in every
							one or two months it is repeated by Christians even of the purest and
							most spiritual denomination. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
							announced and prayed for one new communicant, <persRef
								ref="white-samuel3">Samuel White</persRef>— After dinner he preached
							again from John 3.8. “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
							hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
							whither it goeth: so is every one who is born of the Spirit”— The
							spiritual nature of Christianity is a topic to which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt very frequently returns— After
							Meeting I rode with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef> and her child
								<persRef ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef> to Germantown, and was
							reminded by the name of Palmer Street of the <persRef
								ref="palmer-joseph">old General</persRef>, once settled there.</p>

						<p><date>5. IV. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>The wind came round yesterday to the South and this morning when I rose
							before the Sun; thin clouds were scudding across the sky from South to
							North, followed by a dense fog, which soon cleared off, for a forenoon
							of high Summer heat— I took the opportunity to visit my seedling trees
							in the garden, nursery and seminary.— The exercise and the thermometer
							soon urged me back into the house. Of the multitude of English Oak
							acorns sown last October five or six have sprung up, the last week in
							May.— None since—and there as many more slender stalks, three or four
							inches high which came up last summer, and have survived the winter, and
							opened their leaves, but shew no manifestation of growth, the present
							Season— To keep these alive through another winter is my present
							ambition; but the black jack Oak is again winter killed nearly down to
							the surface of the ground— It is putting forth new shoots, but doubtful
							whether they will get headway to survive the next winter— The most
							extraordinary growth of the present year is that of my shagbark walnuts—
							Then the cherries, and the black walnuts; which seldom thrive here.— I
							had scarcely returned to my chamber when the wind shifted to the
							eastward and the afternoon and evening were cold and rainy— I answered a
							Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and
							before closing it received another from her, dated the first of this
							month, which will require further answer. I received also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="hayden-william">William Hayden</persRef> joint editor
							of the Boston Atlas, offering to publish in that paper, my Discourse on
							the New England confederacy; which I declined, having promised a copy
							for publication to the Society— I had also received last week a Letter
							from <persRef ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef> at
							New-York enquiring if I would deliver an Address before the American
							Institute of New-York, next November— I answered this day and declined.

						<p><date>6. IV. </date>Tuesday.</p>
						<p>There was in the Night very heavy rain, with thunder and lightening which
							I neither saw nor heard—though I did hear the clock strike 3— I went to
							Boston this morning—with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> and daughter
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef>.— On
							alighting at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef> house I met my
							old friend <persRef ref="welles-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Welles</persRef>, who greeted me very kindly— He has just
							returned from an excursion Southward as far as Richmond in Virginia. On
							his way home he has been at pains to ascertain the cause of the
							universal blight which for the last two years has fallen upon the button
							wood or Sycamore trees— They were among the largest, soundest, most
							flourishing and longest lived trees of our forests; and the most easily
							propagated, for they grew from a twig or stake as well as from the seed—
							Last summer they foliated very scantily, and not till near midsummer—
							This Season they are but now beginning to put forth rare and stinted
							leaves; and look like one of <persRef ref="hayley-william"
								>Hayley’s</persRef> old maid’s a blasted tree in the middle of a
							heath—or they sadden the rich foliage of a surrounding grove, like a
							spot of desolation in a circle of beauty. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Welles thinks he has discovered the source of all this mischief, in an
							insect scarcely larger than a musquito— I went into D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s study, and had with him a
							literary conversation of about two hours— I spoke of my speculations
							upon the morality of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> century—and
							the Jesuits—and he referred me to an Article in the 152 number of the
							Edinburgh Review July 1842—on the spiritual exercises of <persRef
								ref="stignatiusloyola">Ignatius Loyola</persRef>: and <persRef
								ref="brooks-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Brooks</persRef> afterwards lent me the republication of the number
							containing that Article— From D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham’s I went and spent an hour with <persRef
								ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Parkman</persRef> and <persRef ref="parkman-eliza">his
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="parkman-harriette"
								>daughter</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="mason-cyrus">rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mason</persRef> of New-York, who came as a delegate from the
							New-York Historical Society to the celebration of the New-England
							confederacy— I met in the Street <persRef ref="buckingham-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Buckingham</persRef>, Editor of the
							Courier, and President of the Bunker hill Monument Association, who told
							me that the Directors hoped I should attend at the ceremony of the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> which is to be immortalized by an
							Address from <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, and
							the presence of <persRef ref="tyler-john">President John
							Tyler</persRef>— I answered doubtingly. Doctor Parkman returned with me
							to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s door. We dined at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Brooks’s, <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">his father</persRef> being the only other guest—
							At 1/2 past 4. Charles left us to go, by the Railway Cars to
							Worcester—to attend the great whig convention to be held there to
							morrow, to nominate whig candidates for the Offices of Governor and
							Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth for the year 1844— I purchased a
							crockery ware pint pitcher, and a Turkish sponge. At 5. P.M. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles and her daughter returned with me
							to Quincy—and I made up a fire again in my Study. And I wrote there two
							hours at the close of the Evening. <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi

						<p>Heavy showers of rain in the morning, and cloudy remainder of the day. I

							Yet they did not dare to break the seal to ascertain its contents, and
							my wife enclosed it to me with a request that I would return it to M<hi

							any application to make to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson, it
							would be advisable that he should make it through me— I enclosed

						<p>Showery Night. Thick fog this morning, and Summer heat. After some
							hesitation I concluded to go— Rode to Boston with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>, who is copying my
							Discourse on the New England confederacy of 1643. At my Son’s Office I
							found <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel Curtis</persRef> and two of the members of the Church,
							purchasers of the Tremont theatre— The land on which the theatre stands
							was sold to its proprietors by <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward
								Nicholas Boylston</persRef>, and it was part of the land on which
							the Boylston house was built fronting on school Street. The theatre
							fronts on Tremont Street and the portion of the lot sold by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston was the back garden of the
							Boylston house. The present purchasers of the Theatre want a small
							additional grant for completing a passage way through from Tremont
							Street which they propose to purchase or to exchange for a four foot
							passage way opening upon School Street, no longer of use to them— We all
							went upon the ground and examined the premises— Several questions arose
							about the precise title and bounds of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Boylston. and of his conveyance to the proprietors of the theatre, which
							I thought required an examination of all the title deeds— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Curtis undertook to look them up, and to
							answer the Committee men from the Church.— I found on looking over my
							file of papers relating to the demand by <persRef ref="vaughan-petty"
								>Petty Vaughan</persRef> for a bond of indemnity, that the bond
							proposed by him was not among them, so that a further search for it must
							be made: and I am also to state an account for the judge of probate, to
							close the administration of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas
								Boylston</persRef> Estate— This business being thus disposed of for
							the present, I <unclear>concluded</unclear> to leave the carriage at Boston and go to
							Medford by the Lowell railway cars— The Sun was out with scorching
							summer heat, and in walking to the depot, immediately after another half
							hour’s walk, I flushed my face almost into a fever— In 15 minutes we
							were at Medford, and dined at <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C. Brooks’s</persRef> with the
							members of the agricultural Society— While we were at dinner there was a
							gathering of thunder showers, which hastened us to the depot to which we
							were taken by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks’s carriage at 6
							O’Clock— There we waited till ten minutes before 7. when the Cars from
							Lowell half an hour belated took us up, and in fifteen minutes landed us
							at the depot in Boston. Benjamin the Coachman was there waiting for us
							with the Carriage and took us home to Quincy; through threatened thunder
							showers all the way, but only one slight sprinkling of rain— There was a
							drenching shower half an hour after we got home— Charles was quite
							unwell the whole day.</p>

						<p><date>11. IV. </date>Sunday—</p>
						<p>The night was so warm, and finding the thermometer in my study at 70 with
							a thick fog, and a South wind, I invested myself in summer garments, and
							threw open my windows. But before I was called to breakfast the wind
							wheeled round to the Northeast the fog resolved itself into a heavy
							rain, and I resumed my broad cloth velvet and flannel cloathing— The
							rain continued so that I went morning and afternoon to Meeting in the
							Carriage, but in the afternoon I walked home <persRef ref="lunt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached, in the
							forenoon, from 1. Peter 5.7. “Casting all your care upon him; for he
							careth for you.” The Doctrine of a special Providence seems to be
							congenial to that of guardian Angels; of Cherubim and Seraphim, and an
							innumerable company of Angels and Archangels— Ministering Spirits,
							intimated somewhat obscurely in all parts of the Scriptures, and blended
							with that of evil Spirits, the theory of which is organized by the
							poetical imagination of <persRef ref="milton-john">John
							Milton</persRef>, so that my old Law master <persRef
								ref="parsons-theophilus">Theophilus Parsons</persRef> used to say
							that he considered the Paradise lost, as a narrative of facts of equal
							authenticity with the Bible— But then if the universal cause, acts not
							by partial but by general Laws, in what sense can God be said to care
							for individuals? The argument of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts
							sermon was to urge from considerations of fitness the probable
							conjecture of a protecting Providence, which is scarcely reconcileable
							with the existence of evil— To this belief of a special protecting
							Providence, that of retribution in a future world is indispensable— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon text was from Matthew
							13.31. “Another parable put he forth unto them saying, The kingdom of
							Heaven is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in
							his field: 32 which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is
							grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the
							birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.” In this
							chapter it seems as if Jesus felt it necessary to guard against the
							imputation of revolutionary designs in his ministry— He speaks of the
							kingdom of Heaven, in eight several parables in complex imagery, which
							even his hearers did not understand— He likens his doctrines to seeds
							and plants, with various results, and in one instance explains his
							meaning— His object in this parable is to admonish his disciples that
							they must not judge of the results of his husbandry from the smallness
							of the seed sown by him. It was perhaps necessary to convey these ideas
							in figurative language, to disarm the jealously both of the Jewish and
							of the Roman Institutions which were to be subverted and demolished by
							the kingdom of Heaven— But I can pursue these subjects no further. I
							finished reading the article in the Edinburgh Review upon <persRef
								ref="stignatiusloyola">Ignatius Loyola</persRef> and his Associates,
							a bloated caricature portraiture of the men, but giving no idea of the
							Institution.</p>

							of Documents and pamphlets to be filed, assorted and bound—which took me
							not less than three hours to put into complete disorder— I went to the
							Bank and made a deposite there, but could not reach it before the Noon
							day bell had rung, when the morning business of the Bank is closed and
							the doors are shut— But the Cashier <persRef ref="bartlett-ibrahim"
								>Bartlett’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">Son</persRef> came and received my deposit and balanced
							my book. The grass in my front yard and seminary was mowed— <persRef

							and after dinner I rode with her, and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-arthur">Arthur</persRef> over Milton hill and bridge to
							Dorchester, returning by the upper bridge over the Neponset stream—
								<persRef ref="machiavelli-nicolo">Nicholas Machiavel</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="stignatiusloyola">Ignatius Loyola</persRef> have
							fallen into a Mesmeric sleep, but I received this morning a Letter from
								<persRef ref="walker-asa">Asa Walker</persRef> and two others a
							Committee of Correspondence for a public meeting of the citizens of
							Bangor and vicinity, holden on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							last month, and at which a Resolution was adopted to observe the first
							of next August as the Anniversary of West India emancipation, by a
							public address and other suitable exercises—and the committee appointed
							to carry the resolution into execution, invite me to deliver the
							address— The temptation is almost irresistible, but must be resisted— My
							time is not yet come— How shall I answer this Letter? The same question
							is of more than daily recurrence. I have for example an invitation dated
							the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April from a Committee of the
							Directors of the Bunker hill monument association, to unite with them in
							celebrating the completion of that monument, by a civic and military
							procession, and an Address, by the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Hon
								Daniel Webster</persRef>— Upon this pageant has been engrafted
							another to bedaub with glory <persRef ref="tyler-john">John
								Tyler</persRef> the Slave-breeder, who is coming with all his Court
							in gaudy trappings of mock-royalty to receive the homage of hungry
							Sycophants under colour of doing homage to the principles of Bunker hill
							martyrdom. I answered this invitation, declining to attend, with a
							struggle between inclination and decorum, to suppress the most
							imperative motive for my absence, the disdain to be associated with the
							mouth worship of Liberty from the lips of the Slave-breeder. I succeeded
							but indifferently in veiling my emotions, and touched upon the martyrdom
							of Bunker hill only by transparent generalities, which will yet provoke
							censure.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="taft-alonzo">Alonzo Taft</persRef> came this morning and
							enquired what had been done with a claim for reimbursement of money paid
							by him for his passage home from Gibraltar in 1825. when he had been
							discharged by <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rogers</persRef>
							from the Squadron commanded by him without provision for his passage to
							this Country— He reminded me that nearly two years since he had applied
							to me concerning this claim— That I had advised him to make a written
							statement of it fortified with his own affidavit, and such other
							testimony to the facts as he could procure, and send these papers to me,
							and I would attend to the claim at Washington. He said he had
							accordingly made the statement in writing and sworn to it— Had obtained
							the deposition of another man, and sent all the papers to me here at
							Quincy, since which he had not heard from me concerning his claim.— The
							whole subject had totally vanished from my Memory—and after a search of
							at least four hours I found only the entry in my diary of 7. October
							1841. confirming the fact that he did apply to me on that day, and that
							I gave him the advice precisely as now represented by him— But neither
							in my diary, nor in my voluminous files of papers can I find a trace of
							the papers which he says he sent to me, or that I ever received them— I
							believe I never did— This incident admonishes me that my minutes for
							remembrance of all the claims to which my attention is due have been
							sadly deficient in system— Is it too late to improve it?— I received an
							invitation from <persRef ref="buckingham-joseph">Joseph T.
								Buckingham</persRef> and 8 others Committee of Arrangements for the
							Directors of the Bunker hill monument association, to dine at Faneuil
							Hall on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and a Card of invitation

							poverty—of his self education of his pulmonary complaints which
							interdicted him from preaching; and intending a voyage to England where
							one edition of his work has been printed, he inquired with some
							solicitude whether it was held in Europe discreditable to an author to
							sell his own works— He said he was now preparing a great work on capital
							punishment— <persRef ref="sampson-rachel">Miss Sampson</persRef> is here

						<p>The first is by the rule of the American Almanac—counting from the first

							Register computes only the time when the whole disk is above the
							horizon; and there is a difference of 1 minute and 40 seconds between
							each of the two computations, allowing 3 minutes and 20 seconds for the
							rising, and the same for the setting of the disk— I was going to the
							gate for the afternoon ride in the carriage with <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> when <persRef ref="freeman-william">Col<hi

							detained me at home. He informed me that he is to be tried by a Court

							a charge of scandalous conduct unbecoming an Officer and a gentleman;
							and the specification is for treating contemptuously his superior by a
							paragraph, in a Letter to the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of
								the Navy</persRef>— He read to me the Letter containing the
							obnoxious passage, and the Letter from the Secretary of the Navy
							informing him that he had determined to bring him to trial: and the
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> asked me if I would assist him as
							his Counsel— I answered that I earnestly desired to do any thing in my
							power to befriend him— But that I had never practiced as an advocate
							before Courts Martial— Had long since ceased to practice in the Courts
							of civil jurisdiction, and apprehended I was not competent to do justice
							to his cause as his advocate— Besides which there might be doubts of the
							propriety of my appearing in that capacity— He did not press his
							request, but said he should want my testimony— I said I would cheerfully
							give that if it should be necessary for him, either by a deposition
							before the judge of the United States judge of the District Court at
							Boston or by attending in person before the Court martial at Middletown—
							He intimated his intention to apply to <persRef ref="choate-rufus">M<hi

								Armstrong</persRef> came to invite me to go to his house on Saturday
							after the return procession from Bunker’s hill, and before that from the
							State house to the dinner at Faneuil Hall— I thanked him for his

							the celebrations of that day. The political device of turning the
							Bunker-hill monument address into a sycophantic tribute of homage to
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> is <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster’s</persRef>, and Boston is of all the
							Cities in the world the spot to play it off to the greatest advantage— I
							saw the sun rise and set from <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house. It rose clear and the day was fine the
							Sun had just reached the border of the western horizon, clear when a
							dark cloud came over the disk as it was descending and eclipsed his

						<p>Sun rose 4.22.— Set 7:38.</p>
						<p>The Sun rose not quite clear but sufficiently so to mark the point of the
							horizon at which the first beam emerges, or rather at which the
							revolving orb of Earth brings him above the surface— I took an hour of
							exercise with my knife and handsaw, and examining my seminary seedling
							trees— The hay from the enclosure, mowed last Tuesday, was got into the
							barn just in time to save it from the heavy rain for which the clouds
							had been gathering all the morning and which continued till about 3 in
							the afternoon, when it held up, without clearing off: <persRef

								ref="tyler-john">President of the United States</persRef> by the

							of the Bunker-hill Monument association and Editor of the Boston

							an elegant Discourse— He is to deliver another— The object now is to
							glorify him— A formal invitation was sent to him last fall immediately
							after the completion of the monument inviting him to the performance of
							this service, which he then accepted; and the invitation and acceptance
							were published in newspapers all over the country— The invitation to the
							President and his Cabinet to attend is a political device of Webster’s
							own—a gull-trap for popularity—both for himself and for Tyler, by which
							he hopes to whistle back his whig friends whom he had cast off as a
							huntsman his pack, and who now threaten to hunt him like the hounds of
								<persRef ref="actaeon">Acteon</persRef>— The reception of the
							President this day had all the appearances of cordiality, not
							withstanding a drenching rain to cool it— He is lodged at the Tremont
							house at an enormous expense to the city; was entertained there with a
							sumptuous dinner, by the City Council, and went to the theatre and to an
							evening party at the Postmaster <persRef ref="gordon-george2"
								>Gordon’s</persRef> house— I was invited to the dinner, but sent an

						<p><date>17. IV. </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>Sun rose 4.22. Set 7:39.</p>
						<p>This was the day of the great celebration of the completion of the
							monument on Bunker hill; and never since the existence of the three
							hills was there such a concourse of strangers upon their sides as has
							been assembled on the banks of “Majestic Charles” this day— What a name
							in the annals of mankind is Bunker hill?— What a day, was the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1775? and what a burlesque upon
							them both is an oration upon them by <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Daniel Webster</persRef>, and a pilgrimage of <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> and his Cabinet of
							Slave-drivers, to desecrate the solemnity by their presence! And then a
							dinner at Faneuil Hall in honour of a President of the United States
							hated and despised by those who invited him to it, themselves as
							cordially hated and despised by him. I have throughout my life had an
							utter aversion to all pageants, and public dinners, and never attended
							one, when I could decently avoid it— I was a student at Cambridge when
							on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1786. Charles river
							bridge was opened— The colleges were emptied on that day of the Students
							who flocked to witness the procession and the pageant— I passed the day
							in the solitude of my Study, and dined almost alone in the Hall. I had
							then no special motive for my absence— But now with the ideal
							association of the thundering cannon which I heard and the smoke of
							burning Charlestown which I saw on that awful day, combined with this
							Pyramid of Quincy granite, and Daniel Webster spouting <hi
								rend="strikethrough">with a negro holding an umbrella over his
								head</hi>, and John Tyler’s nose with a shadow outstreching that of
							the monumental column; how could I have witnessed all this at once
							without an unbecoming burst of indignation or of laughter? Daniel
							Webster is a heartless traitor to the cause of human freedom. John Tyler
							is a Slave-monger—what have these to do with the Quincy granite pyramid
							on the brow of Bunker’s hill?— What have these to do, with a dinner in
							Faneuil hall, but to swill like swine and grunt about the rights of
							man?— I stayed at home and visited my seedling trees; and heard the
							cannonades of the rising, the meridian and the setting Sun—and answered
							a Letter from the <persRef ref="emerson-joseph">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Joseph Emerson</persRef> dated at
							New-London Connecticut making enquiries about a translation of <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef> philosophical
							dictionary, published under the name of John Quincy Adams, and secretly
							circulating as he says, about the country, as my work— I saw the Sun set
							from the front of <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							house, at the extremity of his northwestern declination, and as I heard
							the cannonade salute of the closing day, and saw the smoke ascending
							from the side of the pyramid, the top of which was full in view; then
							came in forcible impulse to my memory the cannonade, and the smoke and
							the fire of the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1775— I waited
							to see the revolving fire of the Boston Light house kindled, and then
							returned to my peaceful home</p>

						<p>The <persRef ref="kent-benjamin">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Benjamin Kent</persRef> now keeper of a school for girls at Roxbury
							preached for <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> this morning with a double text. Romans 7:24. “O
							wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
							death?” and Philippians 4.13. “I can do all things through Christ which
							strengtheneth me.” The doctrine of the discourse was that the will of a
							perfect Christian fortified by conscience is omnipotent. That nothing is
							impossible for it to atchieve; and to elucidate the principle, he
							presented a parallel between these two passages from the writings of
								<persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Paul</persRef>
							first in the epistle to the Romans in the agonies of despair and then
							four years later to the Philippians in the exultation of a glorious
							victory and triumph by the strength of Christ assisting him— The first
							written in the midst of the terrible struggle of his conversion, and
							while he was yet uncertain of its success. The last was written after
							his conversion was consummated, and his confidence in himself with the
							strength imparted to him by Christ his lord and master was unbounded.
							Upon this theme M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent amplified and
							dilated until he reminded me of the story which I once heard <persRef
								ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin</persRef> tell of a convent of monks who had a very
							inconvenient hill in front of their monastery, and upon their faith like
							a grain of mustard seeds being sufficient cast the mountain into the
							sea, set up a general onset of prayer to remove the mountain, which they
							perseveringly pursued till tired of the obstinate adherence of the
							mountain to its place one of the friars gave out that there was a
							mistake in the translation of the text, and that the true reading should
							be that with faith like a mountain it is possible to move a mustard
							seed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt dined with us— They were both at the Bunker-hill
							celebration yesterday; which went off admirably well. <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster’s</persRef> Oration was brilliant and
							eminently successful. Two hours and seven minutes— Suitable to the
							occasion, and often rapturously cheered— The dinner at Faneuil hall was
							also very well ordered and passed off agreeably.— The cheering of
							Webster was hearty and general—that of the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> feeble and cold— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Kents text this afternoon was from Proverbs 16.32. “He that ruleth his
							spirit is better than he that taketh a city.” The Sermon was
							supplementary to that of the morning, upon the extreme importance and
							excellence of the faculty of self-controul M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt gave notice that the <persRef ref="gregory-john">Rev<hi

							at 5 O’Clock this afternoon a Temperance Lecture and <persRef
								ref="tyler-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B. O.
								Tyler</persRef> would exhibit his design for a family temperance
							pledge— Some incident already forgotten turned my attention lately to an
							enquiry into the scriptural notices of Angels, and I looked into
								<persRef ref="basnage-jacques">Basnage’s</persRef> history of the
							Jews—Book 4. chapters 9 and 10. where I found more than I looked for,
							and more than was very agreeable.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 4.22 clear— Set 7.39—</p>
						<p>Visitors must account for the idleness of this day— I rose with a dull

							County of Green, and State of New-York on Hudson river, came and

								ref="adams-peter6">their father</persRef> some years after emigrated

							The passed an hour with me in conversation chiefly about the family, and
							after, they went away— Herman C. returned, and said he had a <persRef

							about 7 years old, and he requested me to write a few lines of advice
							that he might keep as an autograph; and I promised that I would—

							is not a man in the world more unfit for self-exhibition at public
							meetings and banquet dinners— When I go to them it is with feelings of a

							monumental celebration— The duties of his two departments prevented him
							from accompanying the President on his journey; but he left Washington
							so as to reach the Tremont house on Friday and was present at the dinner
							given to the President by the City Council at that house on that day— He
							was then much indisposed and the next day so ill, that he was unable to
							attend the celebration at the hill. His disease which was bilious colic
							continued increasing in violence, and inaccessible to all medical
							treatment till he expired. He was an able, and a very amiable man—by far
							the best of the Presidents present associates— Just as I was called to
							dinner, came in <persRef ref="goodale-reuben">Doctor Goodale</persRef>,
							a stranger from the Western part of the State of New York— He introduced
							himself, and asked numerous questions of whig politics, and particularly

							in part succeeded, and its total failure is certainly not yet

						<p>I saw the Sun rise and set—still at the solstice; clear the whole day,
							and the first unequivocal summer day we have had this Season. As I have
							given up almost entirely the exercise of walking, and believing as I do
							that strenuous exercise of the body is yet a necessary of life to me, I
							am devoting two hours of the morning, immediately after sunrise to
							labour for my seedling trees. I am ashamed that after fifteen years
							search for the secret of raising trees from the seed, I am as ignorant
							of it as before I began— I now despair of producing any useful result
							from my labours in this respect. But I have many trees at different
							stages of their growth, which I may cherish into useful trees. My most
							successful experiments have been in manuring the ground where the seeds
							are planted; and I am about to resume that occupation with another,
							sawing and cutting twigs for stakes. This is hard work and squeezes

							he thought a pane of painted glass— All which he dug out from the ruins
							of the house, for which he dug more than a century after it was burnt
							and found fifteen feet under the surface. He had also a small viol full
							of char’d wheat seeds of which he found a bushel at the same search— He
							gave me these relics, and left with me to examine it, a large volume
							with antient manuscript deeds and Letters, and three or four volumes of

						<p>A cloudless day of oppressive Summer heat. Two hours of the morning
							wasted in idle labour to keep alive the scanty remnant of my seedling

							grounds, or to those of <persRef ref="robinson-john5">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson</persRef> the Episcopal
							Minister— My record which I have kept from year to year of almost all my
							plantations, has fallen into inextricable confusion, from its very
							minuteness— Four fifths of the cherished seeds which came up and
							flourished for a time have withered and been extirpated so long that I
							have lost even the memory; while the Nursery gardens and Seminary, are
							now overstocked with seedlings which choak one another. I have trees
							now. Oaks, Apples, Shagbarks, pignuts, Ash, Maple and Cherry which will
							outlive centuries, unless cut down, uprooted or blasted by lightnings I
							take pleasure in watching their growth, and in the thought of leaving

							cultivation of trees not suited to the climate—Apricots, Nectarines,
							Cork, Willow and live Oaks: and he would have found the art of
							cultivating pears, plums, and cherries in perfection which I have sought
							in vain— My Philadelphia Seminary maple, seed sown 1. June 1835 measures

						<p>Sun rose 4.23. Set 7.40 beclouded—</p>
						<p>The declination of the Sun Southward is already perceptible since Tuesday
							last both morning and evening, though not marked in the American
							Almanac. I took off a limb from the black willow South of the bridge
							over the brook in the lane between my house and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> and slip’d from it several
							twigs which I stuck down as stakes, to ascertain whether any of them
							will take root. This experiment I have heretofore made with full success
							both with willows, and button woods.— But the button woods and red
							Cedars are now perishing all over the Country no one knows why or from
							what cause— I had a new hinge put on to a tool shed in the garden, which
							was there in <persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> time, and
							kept the tools— The lower hinge of the shed door was broken I believe
							when I came into possession—the door could not be closed and a spade and
							two hoes have disappeared— It is close to a spot which I have found
							favourable for raising delicate seedlings the first and second years
							till they are fit for transplantation. I began the manuring of my plats.
							My Seminary teems with apple seedlings from two six feet high, pushing
							up their plumelets with unusual rapidity, but meeting with two enemies:
							the aphis, and a green maggot worm which arrest their growth. There are
							three black walnuts in the seminary, one in the garden, and one in the
							Nursery, growing all with the same rank luxuriance but for which I dread
							the trial of the winter— The two Pennsylvania shagbarks in the Garden
							have to undergo the same ordeal— The budded cherry leaves are covered
							with rusty spots, and every cherry has an ugly speck upon it. The wild

							to the purchasers of the Tremont Theatre a strip ten feet wide, across

							five feet passage way and the use of a pump and well.— I approved and
							promised my assent to this arrangement— Charles went to Boston with

						<p><date>24 III.45. </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>Sun rose 4.23. Set 7:40. Last of the Solstice</p>
						<p>After an abridged excursion to see the rising Sun, and to visit and study
							my seedling plants and listen to the matinal minstrelsy of the bobalink,
							the spring-bird and the robin, with the chirping of the sparrow, and the
							new whistle of the quail, I think all the aerial music of this time and
							place, I returned to my library chamber, and revised the copy of my
							Discourse on the New-England confederacy of 1643, furnished me by
								<persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriett Welsh</persRef>, and which I
							made up and despatched by the mail to <persRef ref="savage-james">James
								Savage</persRef>, President of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
							at Boston— In revising this Discourse I had the opportunity of examining
							it with cooler judgment than I had while composing it.— I was then
							somewhat disqualified by the hurry, agitation, and severe disposition
							under which I was labouring: with a keen apprehension, that my Catarrh
							would disable me from delivering it, and extreme anxiety that it would
							if delivered be tedious and dull to the auditory— It was on the contrary
							happily delivered, and with as much favour from the auditory as I could
							have expected or ought to have desired— It is now a historical document,
							and a political disquisition; to be published by the Massachusetts
							Historical Society, and will pass to posterity as one of my
							contributions to the labours of that Institution.— I would it were
							wiser—more philosophical—more profound— I would the faculty had been
							conferred upon me to enlighten my brethren of the human race; to improve
							their condition upon earth—to rule them by the energies of the Soul—
							Perhaps one of the sins for which I may have to answer hereafter to
							answer is that of repining at the scantiness of the portion of intellect
							which I was endowed— The day differed from that of yesterday. A morning
							less intensely warm, but no east wind at noon to chill the atmosphere— I
							received a new packet of proposals for repairing the mill dam of the
							Columbian Mills, with a Letter from <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>, which I immediately
							answered— I received also, nearly a fortnight since an invitation from
							Bangor an invitation to deliver an anniversary address there on the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of August the day in 1838 of the total
							emancipation of the Slaves, in the British colonies of the West Indies—
							After much hesitation and deliberation I began this day an answer to
							this invitation: and I was occupied almost the whole afternoon in a
							fruitless search for the bond of indemnity to <persRef
								ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef>, which he requires that
							the Executors of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward N. Boylston</persRef>
							to execute before he will remit the monies held by him and belonging to
							the Estate. <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Charles</persRef> rode without me to Weymouth— After
							Sunset there was a threat of a thunder gust and shower, which evaporated
							in wind, and a mere sprinkling of rain. The Atlas of this day says that
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Websters</persRef> regret at my

									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Kendall</persRef> of Plymouth preached here for him—in
							the morning from John 1.18. [“]No Man hath seen God at any time; the
							only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the father, he hath declared
							him.” It was one of the sacred doctrines of the Jews that no man ever
							saw God or could see him and live— His voice was often heard, and his
							angels were often seen— He was made perceptible by fire, as to <persRef
								ref="moses">Moses</persRef> in the burning bush; and to <persRef
								ref="elijah">Elijah</persRef> when carried up in a chariot of fire—
							Moses had the hardihood to ask to see him, and he passed before him so
							as to shew his hinder parts—but it was only a storm of wind— By the
							incarnation God was made manifest in the flesh; and here the Messiah,
							said to be in the bosom of the father, it is further said had declared
							him— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall’s argument was that the
							gospel of Christ was the manifestation of God. I invited D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall to dine with us; but he asked to
							be excused He said he was turned of seventy and never dined between the
							services and that what he most needed was repose— But that he would
							cheerfully walk home with me after the second service—in which of course
							I acquiesced. After dinner, the text was from Hebrews 11.5. “By faith
								<persRef ref="enoch">Enoch</persRef> was translated that he should
							not see death: and was not found, because God had translated him: for
							before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.” The
							story and character of Enoch are among the most mysterious parts of the
							Bible— Scarcely any thing is said of him in the old Testament, except
							that which is noted in this passage of the Epistle to the Hebrews— That
							he walked with God, and was not because God took him; Why he was so
							privileged we are not told—nor how he was thus removed from Earth,
							exempted from the common law of human nature to die. <persRef ref="paul"
									>S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef> says it was by
							Faith; and because he pleased God. I scarcely can tell by what process
							it was, that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall made this text the
							theme for giving a brief historical statement of the ministers of the
							gospel who were settled in the old Plymouth Colony before the
							commencement of the present century—of whom only two or three still
							survive. He is himself the only one still in office as Pastor of a
							Church, and he has now a colleague settled with him— He paid a tribute
							of friendship and of honour to the memory of the late Senior pastor of
							the Quincy church, who died very suddenly on the<space/>of<space/>last, and he
							spoke reverently of <persRef ref="ware-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Henry Ware</persRef> whose Ordination as Minister of the
							first Church at Hingham I attended in September 1787. and who is yet
							living, emeritus professor of divinity at Harvard University. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall came home with me after the second
							Service—and after walking up the hill to see the Sunset from the front
							of <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, parted from
							us in peace.</p>

							shoot has put out from the mutilated stem and is now in the process of
							opening leaves— The same thing is happening to a second year seedling in
							the garden, which I accidentally cropped about the same time.— But the
							English white Oak seedlings of this Season have ceased to grow and the
							most thrifty of them is not more than 4 inches high. The Philadelphia
							maple continues to grow the whole summer One in the Seminary and one in
							the Garden from the seeds sown by me 1. June 1835 are 17 inches in
							circumference and 20 feet high— About noon I met <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> in the Garden and he inspected with me all my
							trees— He cautioned me against trimming the trees after the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of June; and he brought to my notice the
							depredations upon all my trees of insects and worms almost numberless—
							The thriftiest of my apple trees, in its tenth year and already bearing
							has half a dozen Gimlet holes just above the ground pierced by the
							borer— Another 14 years old and bearing freely has a worm in every
							apple. The Caterpillar and the Canker are angels commissioned for
							destruction. The beetle or dorbug nips the shoot in its prime, and
							invisible thieves in the darkness of the night strip the Oaks of their
							tender leaves, and yield them up to withering decay— The drought, the
							flood, the frost, the Sun, the gale, the blight, the field mouse at the
							root and the green louse or aphis at the germ, form such a host of foes,
							that it is as hard to raise a tree as a child— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> went this afternoon to
							Hingham in search of a School for <persRef
								ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7">their two eldest boys</persRef>— I
							continued without finishing my answer to the invitation from Bangor to
							deliver there an Oration on the first of August in celebration of the
							emancipation of Slaves in the British West Indies— This answer will be
							instead of the oration itself; but it is already too long and must be
							much longer to be worthy of the theme. I shall probably not send it
							after all, but I feel an irremissible duty to bear my testimony once
							more, before I go hence against Slavery. To select the time, the place
							and the manner is a subject of great consideration and must be neither
							precipitated nor too long delayed— My ideas are yet crude indigested and
							confused. I will begin to collect and assort them in this Letter, with
							the firm resolve to persevere in the pursuit. I began also this
							afternoon to read <persRef ref="ware-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Henry Wares</persRef> Inquiry into the foundation
							Evidences and Truth’s of Religion—of which he sent me last year a copy,
							the receipt of which I have not yet acknowledged.</p>

						<p>My Marotte gives me abundant exercise for two hours of the morning, and

								ref="white-peregrine">Perigrine White</persRef>, the first born of
							New-England— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mill said their buildings
							had been burnt down, and he was travelling to solicit contributions for
							re building them— I invited him to dine with us; but he was afraid of
							losing the afternoon stage to Boston, and declined— He made several
							enquiries to know if the college could obtain a collection of the
							distributable public documents to supply the place of those which were
							consumed in the fire— He was also desirous of procuring a complete
							collection of the publications of the Massachusetts Historical Society—
							And he spoke of the Representatives from Indiana in the last Congress,

								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> was here
							this afternoon. So intense was the heat that my afternoon was lost in

							neither sleep nor repose— I read two Chapters of <persRef
								ref="ware-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ware’s</persRef>
							Inquiry into the foundation, Evidences and Truths of Religion; but I
							could neither understand nor take interest in what I read. I was obliged
							to lay the book aside, and had no spirit or impulse to take up any
							other. I was not able to get through one page of my Letter to Bangor— As
							Sunset approached we all went up and saw it from the front of Charles’s
							house in cloudless splendor descend beneath the horizon— There was a
							refreshing breeze and we sat under the portico, till the town curfew
							bell of 9. sounded our retreat— In my concert of birds the other morning
							I forgot to mention the black-bird, blue-bird, and swallow, all of which
							join in the chorus.</p>

						<p>My morning exercise becomes tedious unless I fix my attention upon
							particular plants of which I have now a considerable number in the
							critical state of uncertainty between life and death— The summer house
							Apple tree, the growth of which has been so cheeringly rapid, is doomed
							to death by the borer worm— The tree in front of my study window, under
							the brow eastward of the old horse chesnut; after suffering from the
							Scythe in 1834. and the field mouse three or four years later has now a
							stock in circumference about the size of my thumb and six feet high; and
							if duly guarded from its foes will form a valuable tree— Upon almost
							every patch into which I gradually year by year since 1834 divided the
							seminary I have now growing young seedlings of different kinds together
							with others transplanted all with the intention of finishing by raising
							one tree on each patch.— On many of them I have peach trees some of
							which have borne, and others but last summer were of the fairest
							promise. They are now little better than totally destroyed— I shall be
							compelled to uproot them all.— I have very few pears, and not one of
							thrifty growth—few and very unpromising cherries— Three black walnuts,
							transplanted in 1840 from the garden, and now for the first time seeming
							likely to live— One solitary shagbark walnut first hopeful this
							year—perhaps 20 English white oaklings whose fate is dubious— One
							beautiful Apple tree now six feet high and a strait stem alongside of a
							stunted, transplanted but yet finely growing Philadelphia maple. The
							multitude of these trees furnishes me occupation for two hours every
							morning merely to look at them— The result of all my labours for the
							cultivation of trees from the seed will probably be lost; but if I could
							inoculate <persRef key="adams-charles2">my son</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4;adams-arthur">one of

							raise the most magnificent forest and the most delicious orchard that

								>Gillet’s</persRef> stage, to keep house for me till the arrival of
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> from
							Washington— This day was intensely hot; so that although I finished the
							record of yesterday before Noon I could accomplish nothing further for
							the remainder of the day. I attempted in vain to finish my Letter to
							Bangor, and was equally unsuccessful in attempting to make progress in
							reading <persRef ref="ware-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Wares</persRef> Inquiry. I find it however work of profound
							interest, and have determined if it please the great disposer to read it
							in the spirit of the Inquiry itself— As a subject which it is one of the
							great duties of my life to examine and to penetrate to the utmost extent
							of the capacity which God has given me</p>

						<p>I had sown in 1840 Apple and Pear seeds in a short row between the
							Eastern door and gale under an old Althaea tree which must soon be taken
							away.— They came up but have been cropped by the scythe every Spring
							with the grass, from which the mower could not discern them—when I came
							out here the middle of May I could not discover the trace of one of them
							in the grass— Yesterday I found three of them, with leaves put out since
							they were cut down—perhaps I may save one of them. I received a Letter
							from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> of the
								26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> last Monday advising me that she
							had postponed her journey home for a few days, <persRef

							Society. <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> went in with me— The meeting

								<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott;lawrence-katherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Abbott Lawrence</persRef>, whom I found in the bustle of packing up
							for a voyage to England— They are to embark in the Steamer Acadia, to
							sail next Saturday— The Voyage is for his health; and he says he
							proposes to return next October— While there he intends to sound the
								<persRef ref="peel-robert">Peel</persRef> ministers about a
							reciprocity Treaty; and to consult with <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Edward Everett</persRef> but he is not reconciled to the projects

								Webster</persRef>, and he thinks Webster’s great device of bringing
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> and his gang here as bobs
							to his Bunker hill monument kite a very small concern— I went with
							Charles to <persRef ref="wilson-h">H. Wilson jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> a Taylor and ordered a light waistcoat and
							pantaloons for summer wear.— The <persRef
								ref="codman-john;davis-isaac;felt-joseph;jenks-william;lamson-alvan;lowell-charles;mitchell-nahum;savage-james;willard-joseph3;young-alexander"
								>persons above named</persRef> with Charles and myself constituted
							the whole meeting— Several presents were received, and votes of thanks
							passed— My Letter to the President James Savage, with the copy of my
							discourse was read and placed on the files— The discourse itself he said
							was at the Printers, and he promised to direct that the proof sheets
							should be sent by the mail to me for revisal— I returned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Felt the books which he had lent me— At
							one; the meeting adjourned and with Charles and his wife returned to our
							respective homes to dine— Their daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3"
								>Louisa Catherine</persRef>, dined with <persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and me— In the afternoon there was a
							light shower merely of rain, but the heat before and after was totally
							disabling to read or write— I discovered broken ground on the seedling
							spot next to the kitchen— I went up the hill at Sunset which was deeply
							beclouded, and sat in the front of Charles’s house, with a fresh and
							delicious breeze till the bell at 9. called me home.</p>

						<p>My Morning exercise encroaches too much on my hours of labour; and rising
							as I do at half past 3 in the morning I am called to breakfast almost
							before I have seated myself at the table for daily writing— This morning
							I discovered three more cropped apple-seedlings, in the range between
							the Althaea and the old horse chesnut tree— One of the crops is a mere
							stem<space/>inches high without the trace of a bud or leaf upon it— I shall
							try the experiment if they can be revived, and hoed up partially the
							grass around them, watered the ground about their roots and gave them
							some refreshment of manure.— The cropd oakling in <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa’s</persRef> patch has put out a new
							stem and fair leaves, but the tender fresh leaves of that in the garden
							next the kitchen, as well as those of the shagbark, have had the borders
							of their leaves scorched to a black cinder by one day’s heat of the Sun.
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston and
							returned home to dine. The morning set in at high summer heat, and I
							expected a roasting day, but by 10 O’Clock there came a soft eastern
							breeze, which without obscuring the Sun cooled the atmosphere to a
							delicious temperature, and left me full power to read or write without
							interruption— Yet I read only a few pages of <persRef ref="ware-henry"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ware’s</persRef> Inquiry into
							the foundation, evidences and truths of Religion— He begins with the
							foundation of religion—that is he begins by stating the temper of mind
							in which the inquiry should be pursued— The first section of the
							introduction is an argument to prove that religion is an interesting
							subject of inquiry.— The second that there is no reason for entering on
							the inquiry with a wish to find its claims without foundation in truth—
							These are preliminaries— Now that religion is an interesting inquiry, no
							one will deny who is capable of making and pursuing the inquiry at all.
							The desire of continued existence is planted in the nature of man— The
							brute creation cling to life as tenaciously as man—more tenaciously—for
							they never commit voluntary suicide—but they have no conception of what
							death is or of a state of existence after death— Man learns by
							experience as a witness and by tradition what death is—he sees that it
							is the extinction of his being— He has hopes and desires but no evidence
							of continued existence after death— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ware’s first chapter therefore is with what evidence the inquirer ought
							to be satisfied on the subject.— That is—what he is to take for
							evidence, which is not evidence. All the Evidence is negative, and the
							only alternative for the inquirer is to abandon the enquiry and take his
							fate as it comes, or to put up with Faith as the substance of things
							hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.— The creation speaks for
							itself and discloses a creator or creators, one or more—no evidence to
							decide that question, but faith acknowledges only one God— I wrote two
							pages of my Letter to Bangor, and as Sunset approached I walked up the
							hill, and spent the evening under Charles’s portico, and in his Study.
							He told me <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef> proposed
							to visit me to-morrow.</p>
