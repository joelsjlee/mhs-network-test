						<p>I received yesterday a Letter from <persRef ref="thompson-daniel">Daniel
								Thompson</persRef>, <persRef ref="anderson-benjamin">Benjamin
								Anderson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="woodson-tucker">Tucker
								Woodson</persRef>, a Committee appointed by the coloured citizens of
							Utica, to wait on me, and return their thanks for my efforts, in
							protecting the right of petition, and promoting the abolition of
							Slavery, and proposing to come, if it would be agreeable to me, in the
							Evening. I accordingly received them about 8. O’Clock, and one of them
							addressed me in a short, but formal speech, modest and well delivered. I
							answered them with equal brevity: thanking them for their kind
							attentions to me; assuring them that I had no claim to gratitude from
							them for services in which I had performed no more than my
							indispensable— That I should still and ever be happy to serve them to
							the utmost extent of my power, and commend them to the protection of our
							common father and creator— My first visit this morning immediately after
							breakfast was to the female Seminary, where I was introduced to the
							assembled teachers and pupils, and addressed in behalf of the trustees
							of that institution by <persRef ref="spencer-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer</persRef> in a manner so
							affecting that it made a child of me. It consisted chiefly of extracts
							which he read from <persRef key="adams-abigail">my mothers</persRef>
							published Letters of 19. August 1774. to <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, and of June 1778 to me.— I actually sobbed as he
							read, utterly unable to suppress my emotion— Oh! my Mother! Is there any
							thing on earth so affecting to me as thy name? so precious as thy
							instructions to my childhood? so dear as the memory of thy life? I
							answered, I know not what— My thoughts were all upon my mother— My heart
							was too full for my head to think, and my presence of mind was gone— At
							the close of his address, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer
							presented to me, at the request of the Ladies 12 numbers of a monthly
							publication, from August 1842 to July 1843. called the Young Ladies
							Miscellany the original productions of the Utica female Academy— At 10.
							O’Clock the reception took place, on a stage erected in front of the
							Bleecker house; where <persRef ref="bacon-ezekiel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bacon</persRef> addressed and welcomed
							me in the name of the citizens of Utica: I answered him in a speech of
							about half an hour, sufficiently cheered for my hopes or wishes, but of
							mortifying inanity to myself— The shaking of some hundred hands then
							followed, and on my way, returning to <persRef ref="johnson-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s</persRef> I stop’d and
							four Daguerrotype likenesses of my head were taken: two of them jointly
							with the head of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bacon. all hideous— Then
							a visit to the dwarf. <persRef ref="stratton-charles2">C. F.
								Stratton</persRef> called General Tom Thumb. 11 years old—25 inches
							high; weighing 15 pounds. Dressed in a military uniform, mimicking
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>. Dinner party
							at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s. Ride after dinner to the
							Lunatic hospital. <persRef ref="niles-john">John M. Niles</persRef>,
							U.S. Senator from Connecticut is there. Thence we went to the York Mills
							Cotton Factory. where there was a crowd—a reception a procession, an
							address and speech; and a present of several pieces of the cotton cloth
							which I declined accepting. Elegant evening party and supper at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s.</p>

						<p>I have ceased altogether writing in the morning before Breakfast; and
							having no other part of the day at my own disposal, my diary has already
							run ten days in arrear— At 7. this morning <persRef ref="bacon-ezekiel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bacon</persRef> came and went
							with me to the Shadow shop, where three more Daguerrotype likenesses
							were taken of me, no better than those of yesterday. They are too true
							to the original— At 10. O’Clock I left <persRef ref="johnson-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s</persRef> house, and
							Utica; accompanied by <persRef ref="ostrom-john">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Ostrum</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seymour-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seymour</persRef>, who insisted in coming with me to Albany.
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> of all our original traveling party remains at
							Utica, proposing to move homeward next Monday, escorted by <persRef
								ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef>, and his sister
								<persRef ref="johnson-sarah">Sarah Adams</persRef>, whom I have
							invited to visit us— I had received yesterday from <persRef
								ref="gibson-alexander">Alexander C. Gibson</persRef>, mayor of the
							city of Schenectady, by the hands of <persRef ref="u">Alderman
								Benedict</persRef>, and <persRef ref="harman-joshua">Recorder
								Harman</persRef>, a pressing invitation to make a short stay at that
							place, and other deputations had come yesterday to Utica to give me like
							invitations to those places— An old German clergyman, was one of the
							deputation from Herkimer and reminded me with loquacious gratitude, that
							in 1822 when Secretary of State, I had been of some service to him in
							procuring for him a remittance from his native Country, of an
							inheritance which had there fallen to him in the right of his wife. From
							Utica to Schenectady the distance is 77 miles and from Schenectady to
							Albany 16— At Herkimer 14 miles— At Little Falls 22 from Utica, and at
							every place in the valley of the Mohawk where the Cars stop’d 5 minutes
							for wood and water, crowds of people were assembled, received me with
							three cheers, and manifested a desire to see and hear me, with which I
							complied with by descending from the Cars, shaking hands with as many of
							them as could reach me, and addressing them, till the passing bell
							called me back to my seat— At Little Falls, I was addressed and welcomed
							by <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxad Loomis</persRef> an ex-member
							of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress whom I did not
							recognize till after I had answered— In the valley of the Mohawk we saw
							the fortress dwelling house of <persRef ref="johnson-william5">Sir
								William Johnson</persRef>, and that of the Indian chief <persRef
								ref="brant-joseph">Brant</persRef>; said to be his Son— About an
							hour before we reached Schenectady the wind raised by the rapid motion
							of the Car, lodged on the ball of my left eye, beneath the underlid, a
							small sharp angled pebble of the entrance of which I was not conscious
							when it happened, but which fretted the eye to torture, produced
							considerable inflammation, and made it impossible for me to look in the
							face of those whom I was to address— A sumptuous dinner had been
							provided for us at Schenectady. I was in anguish unutterable— I retired
							to a private chamber and washed the eye in cold water without relief.
								<persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duane</persRef> who
							had observed my suffering followed me to the chamber; examined the eye,
							discovered the offensive pebble; wiped it out with the corner of a
							towel, and I was well.— <persRef ref="degraff-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> De Graff</persRef> a member of former
							Congresses presided at the Cold water dinner— After dinner an address of
							welcome from the porch of a dwelling house was answered by me, as the
							moment inspired. <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Daniel D. Barnard</persRef> and two other gentlemen from
							Albany, met us at Schenectady were at the dinner and accompanied us to
							their home— There we were received after sunset with firing of
							canon—ringing of bells, a procession and cavalcade of butchers, and many
							thousand citizens and after announcing from the steps of the capitol
							that I would meet them at 10. to-morrow morning, I came with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard to his house, and received an
							Evening Serenade.</p>

						<p>At ten O’ Clock this morning I met again the People of Albany, in company
							with <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef>, who addressed and welcomed me in their name, from
							the stoop of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gregory’s</persRef> house facing the Capitol Park— There was no
							public building in the City capable of containing a tythe of the
							assembled multitude. I answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard’s
							address, by a speech of about half an hour, well received and of which
							the only fault which I heard found with it was that it was too short. To
							myself it was but the crowning proof how unfit I am for such occasions,
							and a lesson at once of profound gratitude, and humility— When the
							shouts which followed its close had subsided notice was given to the
							citizens that I would repair to the <persRef ref="bouck-william"
								>Governor’s</persRef> chamber in the Capitol, and there shake hands
							with any one who would desire it— About 500 of them, perhaps one tenth
							of the whole number, went through this ceremony, after which there was a
							separate presentation to some 200 ladies assembled in the Senate
							chamber, and to whom I also made a grave, and not a flattering speech—
							After this I was conducted by the Committee of arrangements and viewed
							the public Offices of the State Government; and then in another building
							those of the City. Some of the most antient archives of the State, in
							the low dutch language were exhibited to me— Among the persons who now
							accompanied me was <persRef ref="flagg-azariah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Flagg</persRef>, heretofore the Comptroller of the
							State. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bouck</persRef>
							the Son of the present Governor was among the individuals introduced to
							me last evening and again this morning— He presented to me his father’s
							compliments with his regret that he had been obliged to leave the city
							upon private business yesterday morning. <persRef ref="marcy-william"
								>Governor Marcy</persRef> was among those who met and greeted me as
							was <persRef ref="crosswell-edwin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwin
								Crosswell</persRef> the somewhat celebrated Editor of the Albany
							Argus— <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van

							informed by <persRef ref="bates-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Isaac C. Bates</persRef> who came from thence last Evening;—and
							proceeded on his journey homeward this morning— After a retirement of
							two hours to my chamber at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard’s for
							repose, I met at his table a party of about 20. of his friends, among
							whom were the <persRef ref="humphrey-friend">Mayor</persRef> of the City
							and <persRef ref="lansing-gerrit">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lansing</persRef>—<persRef ref="king-rufus2">General Rufus

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter</persRef>, the Rector of the
							Episcopal church, at which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard
							worships, and others. strangers, whose names I could not retain— After

								<persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen2">eldest son of the same

									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bayard</persRef> received and
							treated us with great kindness. The house, about 2 miles out of the
							city, Garden and Green house are elegant and comfortable— We returned to
							Albany and the Evening closed, with a party of Ladies and gentlemen
							given by <persRef ref="barnard-catharine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Barnard</persRef>, and from which by a refinement of

						<p>At half past 6 this morning <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef> took me in his
							carriage to the landing place in the city of Albany—whence the Steamboat
							crosses the river Hudson to take the Cars of the great Western Railroad
							to Boston— He crossed the river with me and took leave of me at the
							Cars— <persRef ref="briggs-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								N. Briggs</persRef> had come deputed with an invitation to me, from
							the inhabitants of Pittsfield; and I had received a written invitation
							from <persRef ref="newton-edward2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								A. Newton</persRef>, to take rooms during my visit to Pittsfield at
							his house— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Briggs and another of the
							deputies accompanied me. The distance from Albany to Boston traversed by
							the Western Railroad is 200 miles— Pittsfield is 52 miles and
							Springfield one hundred from Albany— The cars reached Pittsfield at 10
							O’Clock in the morning— The road from Albany was the same we had
							travelled on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month, as far
							as Canaan where we then came from Lebanon Springs and returned to the
							train, we had parted from four days before at Pittsfield— We again came
							through the village of Kinderhoek, and again passed through the
							subterranean Tunnel.— We passed in sight of Lebanon, which I remembered
							with pleasure, and, and the spot was pointed out to me of the line which
							separates from each other the States of New-York and Massachusetts— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton’s carriage was at the depot in
							Pittsfield, and I was taken in immediately to his house— It was
							immediately crowded with visitors; till the citizens were informed that
							I would meet and exchange salutations with them at the presbyterian
							church at Noon— In the meantime the Berkshire County Medical
							Association, casually assembled here upon business of their own, came
							with their President—at their head—his honour <persRef
								ref="childs-henry">Henry H. Childs</persRef> Lieutenant Governor of
							this Commonwealth; who introduced them all to me, perhaps to the number
							of 120. and with them all I cordially shook hands— I found myself
							suddenly though not unexpectedly unwell, and retired for an hour of
							repose to a bed chamber. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton has among
							his pictures a portrait of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							upon which he asked my opinion. It was a copy, by <persRef
								ref="newton-gilbert">his brother</persRef> an eminent painter, who
							died in England, 3 or four years since, of one of <persRef
								ref="stuart-gilbert">Stewart’s</persRef> portraits of my father— At
							noon a procession was formed to the Church and there M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Briggs addressed and welcomed me, in a
							highly complimentary speech, which I answered with what ever of Spirit
							was left me, mortified, exhausted and ashamed— I then shook hands in the
							church, with all the men and women who presented themselves, after which
							we proceeded to the public house and partook of a plentiful cold water
							dinner— Among the guests to this were <persRef ref="shaw-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry<space/>Shaw</persRef> of
							Lanesborough, and <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Josiah Quincy jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> now abiding at Lenox.
								Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor Childs presided, and
							after dinner there was a quantum sufficit of toasts of sentiments and of
							flabby Speeches— They were succeeded by a ride of 8 or 10 of the party
							to the female Academy where we were met by a procession of the Lady
							teachers and pupils—an Address, a Speech; and a song by the young
							Ladies— At 6. P.M. we took the Cars for Springfield and arrived there
							after 9.— There was no room for us at <persRef ref="warriner-jeremy"
								>Warriner’s</persRef>, and we put up at the American Hotel.—
								<persRef ref="calhoun-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. C.

						<p>I was very much indisposed all night—and rose this morning worn out, and
							exhausted. <persRef ref="calhoun-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William C. Calhoun</persRef> had come in last Evening to arrange the
							reception which had been projected for me at Springfield— But the people
							had expected my arrival this morning, and by coming prematurely Calhoun
							said I had spoiled all the fun— The sight of me is no novelty at
							Springfield— They have seen me come and go time after time without
							exciting any interest or emotion: I thought a reception here would be
							flat and unprofitable, and concluded to make the best of my way home, by
							taking the morning Cars, and escaping from another repetition of a
							ceremony already satiated with repetitions.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun after urging me without importunity to stay,
							insisted, if I would go, upon accompanying me as far as Worcester.
								<persRef ref="briggs-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Briggs</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pomeroy</persRef> took leave of me, and at half past 6. departed in
							the morning Cars upon their return to Pittsfield, immediately after
							which I took my seat in the train for Boston, and among many other
							fellow passengers all strangers, met, my old pupil subsequent protégé,
							and now alienated friend <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef>, a political outcast, the wreck of his own ill
							woven ambition, and the envious and vindictive craftiness of another man
							more cunning and unprincipled than himself— At Worcester M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun took leave of me to return home,
							and I closed my journey alone.— I had often travelled between
							Springfield and Boston, and three times, since the opening of the
							railroads— The movements are so rapid that I am scarcely conscious of
							transportation from place to place— I had conversation upon topics of
							unimpassioned interest; as much as the jarring noise of the cars would
							admit and on recognizing the village of Natick I was reminded of my
							rides to and from that town in the frost and snow of last November, as
							well as of my passage through it with numerous friends on the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of last month. At a quarter before 12 we
							reached the depot at South Boston, and I parted from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett without a taking of leave on
							either side. I left my trunk at the depot and walked to <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> office N. 23 Court Street to
							enquire if he was in town—but neither he nor <persRef
								ref="spooner-allen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spooner</persRef>
							was there— I next enquired at the stable where he keeps his horse. He
							was not in town— I returned to the depot, and had a long search for my
							trunk which had disappeared; but was at last found in the baggage
							office— I met <persRef ref="brooks-peter2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Peter C. Brooks jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef> in Washington Street, and passed by <persRef
								ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Loring</persRef>, who did not see me— I returned to the Stable; took
							there a hack; stop’d at the Railway depot and took my trunk, and came
							out alone to my home at Quincy, precisely one Calendar month from the
							day when I left it— I found the family at dinner. <persRef

							dwelleth in me, and I in him.”— This was said in the Asiatic style of
							figurative language, and even when spoken shocked the multitude of his
							hearers in the synagogue at Capernaum, so violently that perceiving
							their astonishment and disgust he explained that he spoke the words in a
							spiritual sense—not withstanding which the Apostle says, “from that time
								<hi rend="italic">many</hi> of his disciples went back, and walked
							no more with him.” Nor is it surprizing—The source of all figurative
							language is the analogy between the operations of matter and of mind. In
							the expression of complicated ideas, there may be points of close and
							luminous analogy between flesh and spirit, associated with other points
							of the most abhorrent opposition— The Asiatic or Oriental style, seizes
							upon one striking point of analogy, and totally suppresses or disregards
							all other points not harmonizing with it— The Attic or Grecian styles
							shuns all these complicated analogies, which mislead or confuse the
							mind, with incongruous ideas and contradictory associations.— It
							requires harmony of thought—not expecting that the similitude should run
							upon all fours; but forbidding the attempt walk upon one or limp lamely
							upon two— When Jesus told his disciples that they must eat his flesh and
							drink his blood, his allusion was at once to the sacrifice of the
							paschal lamb, to the institution of the passover and to its connection
							with the wheat harvest by the eating of unleavened bread— But taken by
							itself, the declaration that he came from Heaven, commissioned to
							renovate the nature of man, and that his disciples must begin by eating
							his flesh and drinking his blood—who could hear him without believing
							that he was either a maniac, or an impostor— A Canibal, and not a
							teacher come from God?— The apostles however adhered to him, and
							afterwards when he kept the passover, immediately preceding his
							crucifixion, he instituted the perpetual memorial of his death and
							resurrection, by repeating the same figure—by breaking and distributing
							the bread as his body, and presenting the cup as his blood.— This
							incident is not noticed in John’s Gospel but is related in the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Chapter of Matthew—the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of Mark, and the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of Luke— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt administered the Communion, of which I partook in humiliation and
							prayer.— The text of the discourse in the afternoon was from Acts 5.1.
							[“]But a certain man, named <persRef ref="ananias">Ananias</persRef>,
							with <persRef ref="sapphira">Sapphira</persRef> his wife sold a
							possession. 2. And kept back part of the price, and brought a certain
							part, and said it at the apostles feet.” Jesus Christ himself required
							of his disciples the devotion of all their property to the propagation
							of faith in him, and in his religion— After his death his disciples, by
							a common voluntary agreement began by holding all their property in
							common— But this could not last long, and this case of Ananias and
							Sapphira was no doubt intended to prove that human nature was not yet
							sufficiently purified for the practical establishment of this principle,
							as a permanent institution.— The crime of Ananias and Sapphira, was in
							the deception which they attempted, to practice; and not in withholding
							their property.— That the Apostle <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>
							declared was optional, and after awful example of punishment inflicted
							upon the fraud, the community of goods was thenceforward abandoned—</p>

							The day after he was here on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							last May, he embarked for England, and has just now just returned— He
							attended the second World’s convention held at London from the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							of June, and gave me a brief and rapid summary of their proceedings— He
							said he had a Letter to me from <persRef ref="clarkson-thomas">Thomas
								Clarkson</persRef>, and sundry papers containing full and detailed
							reports of the proceedings of the Convention— But they were at Brookline
							and he would send them to me— He was to go for New-York this afternoon—
							He said he had told <persRef ref="gordon-george">Lord Aberdeen</persRef>
							of my distrust of the British Government on the subject of Slavery, and
							particularly on the surrender of fugitive Slaves. He said Lord Aberdeen
							was startled at the suggestion, and utterly disclaimed all intention of

								>Ashburton</persRef> Treaty to be made the instrument of reclaiming
							Slaves— This Article is a pattern example of diplomatic swindling— There
							is hope that its purpose may be defeated by the alarm of the English
							abolitionists and their remonstrances against it before the enact of it
							by Parliament as English Law.— A grosser fraud was never practiced upon
							nations than was intended by that article— The apologies for it, by Lord
							Ashburton, and by the British Ministers are lame and prevaricating—and
							from the statements of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan, all my
							suspicions of the duplicity of the British Ministers, on the subject of
							Texas and Slavery are but too strongly confirmed.— The policy of the
							British Government is to cherish sustain and protect the institutions of
							Slavery in our Southern States, and in Texas, and their task is to do it
							by humbugging the abolitionists in England into the belief that they
							intend directly the reverse— <persRef ref="greenleaf-richard">Richard C

							Nursery and seminary of seedling trees— Enough hower to discover the

							up all vegetation here since I left it flourishing on the 6<hi

						<p>Showery day, which still detained me from visitation of my grounds, and
							from exercise abroad— <persRef ref="barry-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Barry</persRef> was here with
							a bill for four years subscription to the common school journal. He
							asked me if I recollected that in the summer of 1809 just before I
							embarked for S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, the hatters of
							Boston applied to me to draw up for them a memorial to Congress— I
							remembered it well— He said he was the person who made the application
							to me— It is noticed in my Diary of 26 June 1809., but the name of the
							person applying is not reported and I did not now remember that it was
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barry.— <persRef ref="adams-isaac"
								>Isaac H. Adams</persRef> was also here and <persRef
								ref="white-franklin">Franklin White</persRef> the painter to whom I
							gave a second sitting of an hour— It must be extremely difficult for any
							painter to take a favourable likeness of me now—for I cannot sit five
							minutes or three or even one, with out, falling into a doze— This
							propensity which I have long observed grows upon me to such an extent,
							that I ought to be deeply alarmed at its progress—for its termination
							may overtake me every day, and every hour of my life— It benumbs every
							faculty of my body and soul. It portends a moment of Sleep from which
							there will be no awaking upon earth, and of which I am in constant
							expectation— When I ask myself why I do not make immediate and effective
							provision for instantaneous departure whenever that summons shall come,
							I have no answer to make other than the frailty of my nature— This
							irresistible spell has made it impossible to take a good daguerrotype
							likeness of me, and it baffles though not in equal degree the skill of
							the portrait painter, who cannot give life or animation to a countenance
							all the muscles of which are all the time lapsing into slumber— It
							deadens alike all the faculties of the mind, and is a continual warning
							to me of the decays of my powers native and acquired— Shall I ever take
							it?— This evening I visited <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas;greenleaf-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> my
							neighbours each four score years of age— I requested him to mention to
							their son <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price</persRef>, that I
							wished to see him— My time is now almost entirely consumed in bringing
							up the arrears into which my journal had fallen in the course of my
							month’s excursion; and with the most intense exertions, I cannot recover
							more than one day in a day. Many of the Newspapers have reported the
							proceedings at the places, where I was received with honorary notice— It
							began at Saratoga Springs on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							July— I escaped it not without difficulty at Burlington Vermont— Then
							after a suspension of one week in Canada, the display was recommenced at
							Ogdensburg and continued to Pittsfield in Berkshire County,
							Massachusetts.</p>

						<p>I rose at four, but the cloudy sky restrained me from sallying forth to

							yard fronting my windows between the gate and the porch, without
							knocking or ringing the bell at the door; and on going down found it was
								<persRef ref="leman-daniel">Daniel Leman</persRef>, the man from
							Charlestown, but this time without <persRef ref="leman-margaret">his
								wife</persRef>— He came on the same business as before, in terror of
							having his house taken off over his head. He remained here two hours
							complaining of the hardness of his fate which was neither more nor less
							than inability to pay his debts.— <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi

							paying his rent— <persRef ref="leman-daniel2">Leman’s son</persRef> was
							here in the afternoon anxious for the relief of his father, and I
							informed him of the manner, in which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Curtis and I proposed to effect it— <persRef ref="wilder-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilder</persRef> and <persRef

							receive a copy of the diplomatic correspondence published by Congress— I
							looked over the volumes of the Laws, but could find no such resolution I
							promised however to make further enquiry, and if I should find they have
							the right I will take care to procure the books for them— A person by
							the name of <persRef ref="piggott-george">George Piggott</persRef> came
							from Boston to make enquiry after <persRef ref="cumming-martha">Martha
								Cumming</persRef> a woman who served as cook, while I was absent,
							and took a leave of absence for a week and has never returned— Piggott
							says she boarded at his house, and has gone off in debt to him— She had
							left her trunk here; but we did not think ourselves authorised to let
							him have it— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> came, and examined some of
							my stocks of seedling Apple trees— This is the season for that
							operation, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf usually performs
							it for me. He promised to procure some buds of excellent apples, and to
							come and bud the trees next Tuesday afternoon, if by that time he can
							get the slips— I received this morning by the mail the Bangor Courier of
							the<space/>containing my Letter of 4 July last to <persRef ref="walker-asa"
								>Asa Walker</persRef>, <persRef ref="stackpole-charles">Charles A.
								Stackpole</persRef>, And <persRef ref="sabine-fm">F. M
								Sabine</persRef>. It is announced as a Letter from John Quincy Adams
							on Slavery—with a statement that it was read at the Meeting on the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of August and without one word of
							comment upon it— I have expected the publication of this Letter, and
							expect to be held to severe responsibility for writing it— Before my
							lamp is burnt out, I am desirous that my opinions concerning the great
							movement throughout the civilized world for the abolition of Slavery
							should be explicitly avowed and declared— God grant that they may
							contribute to the final consummation of that event— There are sundry
							errors of the press, and of the manuscript to be rectified, and to which

							Anti-Slavery Society; dated 7. July 1843. to <persRef
								ref="gordon-george">Lord Aberdeen</persRef>, and earnestly
							remonstrating against the annexation of Texas to the United states— The
							British and foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter of 14. 21. 28 June and 12 July
							and the morning Chronicle of 14 July. These contain a full exposition of
							the proceedings of the second World’s convention, at which no very
							conspicuous person attended excepting <persRef ref="howard-george2">Lord
								Morpeth</persRef>— His Speech to the Convention on taking the chair,
							was firm, moderate and discreet— The Resolution honorary to me which he
							offered, and which was unanimously adopted, is an indication of personal
							respect for my character beyond the Atlantic which ought to fill my soul
							with humility and with fervent gratitude to God— These events occuring
							at the same period with the manifestation of kindly feeling towards me,
							from the people of the State of New-York, and with the invitation from
							Cincinnati to lay the corner stone of their observatory, seem
							temptations of prosperity too great for frail human nature to resist or
							to bear with impunity. I pray for the calmness and sensibility suited to
							justice and to the true estimate of worldly honours.— And I received a
							Letter from <persRef ref="andrews-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Andrews</persRef> the young lawyer from Texas who
							visited me the day before he embarked with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tappan for England— He is encouraged in the hope of
							accomplishing with the aid of British influence the abolition of Slavery
							in Texas— But I perceive nothing as yet to relieve the deep distrust
							which I would fain discard if I could, of the British ministerial policy
							with regard to Slavery in Texas and in our Southern States— Her interest
							is to sustain and cherish Slavery there, and there is too much reason to
							surmise, that in the conflict between policy and principle, Slavery with
							bear off the palm.</p>

						<p>Sun rose cloudy.— The return to a sedentary life from a month of great

							the Constitution— It seems as if a hurricane had passed over my spirits;
							and now, when they have been a whole week settling down into the
							ordinary quiet current of rural Summer life, exercise is necessary to
							save them from falling into Syncope— My time for exercise is from the

								ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas

							<persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef>, and his

							of this morning republishes from the Bangor Courier my Letter of 4 July
							last to the Bangor Committee for celebrating the anniversary of the
							emancipation of Slaves in the British West India Islands; with all the
							errors of the Bangor, and several more. Not a word of comment upon the
							Letter is in either of the papers— I expected the publication of that
							Letter; and wrote it for the purpose of exhibiting in as brief a compass
							as possible my principles, feelings and opinions, relating to the
							abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade throughout the world— I meant
							it as a note of defiance to all the Slave-holders, Slave traders and
							Slave breeders upon earth. As the experiment of Summons to the whole
							Freedom of this Union in its own defence, I sent it forth alone, to try
							its Fortune in the world, and made it purposely bold and startling, to
							rouse if possible both friend and foe— The two publications without
							comment, give no promise of a rally for the support of Freedom. As yet
							there is no hostile notice of it abroad— It may remain altogether
							unnoticed, which is the worst fate that can befall it—for if I can but
							raise a controversy by it—that is; an adversary worthy of being
							answered, it shall be if my life and health will admit, a text book for
							future enlargement and illustrative for the whole remnant of my toilsome
							days.</p>

								Frothingham</persRef> preached, in exchange with <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>.
							His morning text was from Psalm 27.3. [“]Though a host should encamp
							against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me,
							in this will I be confident.” The turn of mind of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham is so original that from the
							enunciation of his text it is impossible to foresee what will be the
							purport of his discourse— You perceive it as he proceeds and when he
							comes to the close, you perceive an unbroken chain of close argument, of
							beautiful order, of lofty moral principle, and of pathetic sentiment
							pervading the whole composition— In this Sermon, after some general
							remarks on the character of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, and
							the prevailing spirit of his Psalms, he analysed the sources of his
							confidence, not in his own prowess, nor in the efficacy of the means in
							his own hands for extricating him from the troubles with which in his
							long and eventful life he had been surrounded, he drew from the text a
							lesson equally profound and impressive of unwavering confidence in the
							goodness and mercy of God; enlarging upon the independence with which it
							endowed the human character of time—of space of good or evil fortune,
							and even of one’s own errors and imperfections. There is a purity, an
							elevation, a grandeur in the elemental composition of a man whose
							confidence in God is thus inextricably rooted, which raises him to the
							level of angelic nature, and which adapted to the contingencies
							incidental to the ordinary course of human affairs, touch the heart
							until it overflows at the eyes: which it did with me this day, mastering
							all power of resistance. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham
							dined with us— His Son <persRef ref="frothingham-octavius"
								>Octave</persRef> who is about graduating at Cambridge was with him,
							but dined with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his aunt</persRef>
							<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> My Son himself and
								<persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef> dined
							with us— The text this afternoon was from Acts 23.11. [“]And the night
							following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, <persRef
								ref="paul">Paul</persRef>:”— There was a close analogy between the
							subjects of the two discourses; the incidents in the life and adventures
							of the Apostle Paul, being eminently suited to illustrate the efficacy
							of a stedfast confidence in the overruling Providence of God—
							Immediately after our return from the afternoon meeting; <persRef
								ref="elliot-william4;eliot-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eliot</persRef> of were here—
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eliot, returning from a visit to
								<persRef ref="eliot-william2">her son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cranch-abigail">daughter</persRef> at Saint Louis Missouri
							since last March. Then came <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> from Boston; and in
							the evening <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale</persRef>, Charles and his family. <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="foster-john;foster-frances2">John, and Fanny Foster</persRef>—
							A considerable company. Degrand brought out as usual a budget of
							Newspapers, and among them the Daily Advertiser of yesterday, containing
							copied from the Pittsfield Eagle, a report of my reception at
							Pittsfield, the closing scene of that series of receptions and
							processions which from the borders of Canada to my quiet retirement at
							home, have signalized the month of my recent excursion as among the most
							memorable periods of my life.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 5.5. over the barn on the top of the distant hill.</p>
						<p>Walk over the hill after observing the hazy Sunrise. I met a man, taking
							his morning walk; who accosted me, and said he had recently removed from
							Boston to this place for health and comfort— His name is <persRef
								ref="brummett-h">Brummett</persRef>, and he keeps a milleners shop—
							I observed this morning numerous ant holes on the ground with a circle
							of the soil surrounding each hole thrown out by the ants under the
							ground— I received this morning 4 copies of the Massachusetts Eagle of
							10. August, published at Pittsfield and Lenox—containing reports of my

							When I left home on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of last month it
							was in the printers hands—and I had revised two half proof sheets of it;
							and <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> afterwards revised

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Felt knew nothing about it, but promised
							to enquire of <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis C. Gray</persRef> chairman of the printing committee— I left

							and Trustees of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward N. Boylston</persRef>,

							Letter to <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef>, to be
							forwarded by the Steamer Acadia, the day after to-morrow— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis has purchased the mortgage of the
							house at Charlestown occupied by <persRef ref="leman-daniel">Daniel
								Leman</persRef>, and leaves him for the present in possession. I met
								<persRef ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

							render my account as Administrator of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2"
								>Thomas Boylston</persRef>; and to transfer to him the Bank shares
							for the payment of the debt due to the Estate of <persRef
								ref="gill-moses">Moses Gill</persRef>—but he was not ready for the
							production of his account, nor to state the amount of his claim as
							Gill’s administor against the Estate of Thomas Boylston— The <persRef
								ref="phillips-willard">judge</persRef> therefore postponed the
							further consideration of the case till next Monday. I called at the
							Emancipator Office, and enquired of <persRef ref="alden-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alden</persRef> the publisher whether
							he intended to republish my Letter to the Bangor Committee on Slavery—
							He said that nearly the whole of it was in type and struck off, on the
							first page of the paper to be published next Thursday.— He gave me a
							copy of the paper which I promised to revise. I returned home to Quincy
							to dine; and after dinner received visits from two black men, named
								<persRef ref="nelson-lewis">Lewis Nelson</persRef> from New-York and
								<persRef ref="avery-peter">Peter Avery</persRef> from Boston— The
							impression left by the two men was very different— That of Avery quite

							prose and manuscript, in my Bangor Letter as printed in the
							Emancipator.</p>

						<p>Rain all the morning: confined me to the house. <persRef
								ref="white-franklin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin
								White</persRef> had been here on Saturday, but found himself so
							unwell that he could not take a sitting at that time, but agreed to come
							again this day— He came accordingly: took a fourth sitting of an hour,
							and finished the portrait— He is a timid, unobtrusive man, who in the
							performance of menial services for <persRef ref="harding-chester"
								>Harding</persRef> himself a third rate portrait painter, acquired
							the talent of taking likenesses in Oil colours: but he can scarcely
							claim to be called an artist. This is about the 45<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> time that I have sitten for my pictures, and I question
							whether another man lives who has been so wofully and so variously
							bedaubed as I have been— There is no picture of my childhood but from
							the age of 16, when I was caricatured it crayons by <persRef
								ref="schmidt-isaak">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schmidt</persRef>
							for four ducats, down to this my 77<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year,
							when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White has lampooned me in oil,
							scarcely a year has passed away, without a crucifixion of my face and
							form, by some painter engraver or sculptor— A miniature, in a bracelet
							for <persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef>, painted at the
							Hague in 1795 by an Englishman named <persRef ref="parker-john5"

								ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="greenough-horatio">Greenough</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="powers-hiram">Powers</persRef>— The features of my old age are
							such as I have no wish to have transmitted to the memory of the next
							age— They are harsh and stern far beyond the true portraiture of the
							heart; and there is no ray of intellect in them to redeem their
							repulsive severity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White stretched the
							canvas over the frame of the portrait of <persRef ref="boylston-edward"
								>Edward Boylston</persRef>, which <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> B. O. Tyler</persRef> had loosened to
							spread over it a coat of his varnish. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tyler himself was here— He had written me a long and absurd Letter,
							proposing to me to lend him several hundred dollars to set him up in his
							varnishing trade and also to get up an engraving of a family temperance
							pledge, the sale of which is to make his fortune— I declined his
							proposal: desired him to spread no more of his varnish upon my house or
							upon any thing in it; and advised him to wait for the application to him
							from other persons wanting his varnish rather than to worry every one
							into the use of it against their will— This advice was not precisely the
							most palatable that could have been administered, but it was the best
							that could be given him— My garden has been this year so much neglected
							that we have not the common vegetables, Peas and Beans— Carrots and
							Beets; but must purchase them— I spoke of it to <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>Kirk</persRef> and enjoined upon him better husbandry for the next
							year.— Young evening party with music of the Piano and songs.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 5.7. First clear since my return</p>
						<p>In my morning excursion to see the rising Sun, I met again <persRef
								ref="brummett-h">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brummett</persRef>—
							For morning exercise I waste time in labouring on my seedling trees—
							Proof daily heaps itself upon proof of how useless these labours are,
							for want of orderly system, and ultimate purpose— I emptied a seedling
							pot, and weeded and manured 5 apple stocks in a row at the opening of
							the seminary gate, where I have proposed to raise, one apple tree that
							shall stand One of them is now 6. feet 6 inches high with a stem nearly
							straight to the top. Two others are from 3 to 4 feet high: and two not
							over 9 inches. All the seeds sown at the same time.— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> came this afternoon, and budded 10 seedling
							stocks in the seminary thicket. 2. Harvest 2 Rohan, 2. Spitzenberg 2.
							Amory and 2. Rhode-Island sweetings— Also 4 Spitzenberg on <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny’s</persRef> row—and 5 in the Orchard.
								<persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef> was here this
							morning and proposed to me to fix a day when I would go with him into
							the woods— I told him I would go upon any day convenient to <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, who is to go with us—and
							desired to agree upon it with him.— On my return home from Canada, I
							found among the newspapers on my table one with the title of Boston
							Investigator—devoted to the protection and development of infidel
							principles: Vol. 13. N<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> 13. Wednesday
							August 2. 1843— It had apparently been sent to me for a scurrilous
							article on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> page entitled, Another
							specimen of Christian Criticism; being a knavish commentary upon the
								<persRef ref="emerson-joseph">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Joseph Emerson’s</persRef> Letter to me, and my answer respecting
							the translation of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef>
							philosophical Dictionary—imputed to me because the title page announces
							it as printed and published by J. Q. Adams— The Article now states that
							it was published in 1836. at the investigator office and purports to be
							with additional Notes both critical and argumentative by <persRef
								ref="kneeland-abner">Abner Kneeland</persRef>— This man was an
							avowed atheist, and preacher of atheism; of which his translation of
							Voltaire’s dictionary was one of the gospels— He was shortly after
							convicted upon an indictment for blasphemy—imprisoned, and soon
							pardoned. His Atheist church was broken up, but it seems his weekly
							atheist Newspaper still continues.— Two or three days since I received
							an Octavo weekly Journal Edited by <persRef ref="vale-gilbert">G.
								Vale</persRef> at New-York 5. Aug<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Third series Vol. 1. N. 18. The Beacon—seventh year— A co-adjutor of the
							Boston Investigator in the propagandism of the atheistic church— In this
							paper there is an Article headed Voltaire and J. Q. Adams, containing my
							letter of 17. June 1843 to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Emerson, with
							one from him to the Editors of the New-York Observer, requesting them to
							publish it. The correspondent of the Beacon, extracts them from the
							Journal of Commerce, without noticing the offensive fraud of palming
							upon me the act of printing and publishing these excrements of Voltaire
							but with a malignant imputation of false pretences in my remarks upon
							the base and filthy infidelity of Voltaire— These periodical
							publications, the Investigator, and the Beacon indicate the pertinacity,
							with which this little atheistic club, pursue their will of the wisp
							over the low, swampy lands of Christendom.</p>

								>r</hi> Barnes became impatient to go in— Our clam bait gave out;
							and it fell calm, making it doubtful whether we should get in before
							Night: A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richardson</persRef> in a row boat of his own gave us a small
							additional supply of bait, some lemon juice, pears an Orange, Crackers
							and Claret wine; all which was unsatisfactory to the craving of the
							hungry. I staved off the call to go in about 2 hours, in which we caught
							about 70 of the haddock and then yielded, our bait being again
							exhausted. We went in after two, and the landsmen had already dined upon
							the chowder.— A second table was however got up for us and we fed— After
							dinner my companions and some others went out for a second fare— I staid
							and loitered under the shed in conversation with a motley group of 25 or
							30 strangers till past 5. when we returned to a tea and evening party of
							Ladies and Gentlemen at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s, till
							Charles came and said if I intended to return home this Night it was
							time to go. We came immediately home; and I received a note from
								<persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin’s</persRef> father; informing him
							that his mother was dying.</p>

						<p>Among the persons introduced to me yesterday, were two persons from

								<persRef ref="flint-jacob">former Minister</persRef> of Cohasset,

								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> N. L.
								Frothingham</persRef>— I had not received them—but they came this

							early and long-lamented friend <persRef ref="thaxter-john2">John
								Thaxter</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wilder-james;wilder-elizabeth"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"

							Wilder.— A <persRef ref="u">son</persRef> of Nathan Rice was also of the

							collection of Letters from <persRef ref="washington-george">General

							the preceptor of the Academy and <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							This morning <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef> went to Boston,
							and returned to dine with us as did <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac
								Hull Adams</persRef>, who with the three girls had made a party to
							Squantum.— I called at the Quincy Patriot Office to enquire if the
							publisher <persRef ref="green-john3">John A. Green</persRef> intended to
							republish my Letter to the Bangor Committee. He had it already marked on
							the Emancipator for publication next week; together with my Letter to
								<persRef ref="alden-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alden</persRef>, correcting the errors of the press, published with
							the Letter in yesterday’s emancipator. I spoke to M<hi

							folded in octavo form, and he promised to send me the proof sheet for
							revisal next Tuesday or Wednesday. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>President Quincy</persRef> was here with <persRef

							Directors of Neponset Bridge— I made sundry enquiries of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy respecting the erection of the
							Astronomical Observatory at Cambridge, and the subscription for
							procuring a telescope of the first class for its use— I want especially
							the names and purposes of the instruments to be procured—their cost— The
							time when it is expected they will be received The persons now employed
							upon astronomical observation and calculation, and what is expected to
							be the annual cost of the whole establishment— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quincy promised to communicate to me the correspondence on

						<p>I had the summer house cellar cleared out in the Spring for the reception
							of seeds and nuts and acorns. But while I have been absent it is
							overgrown with grass and weeds, upon which I operated this morning
							partially with the hoe— And I filled a seedling pot with earth from the

							in <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa’s</persRef> patch is Sun
							killed: and another has just come up in the adjoining southerly patch— A

							west of my neighbour <persRef ref="beale-george">G. W.

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring and 5 pear stocks. 3
							caplimonts and 2 Dix’s. 1 in the Seminary thicket, and 4 in the orchard.
							I went this evening to the town Hall, and heard an Anti-Slavery Address
							of about an hour delivered by <persRef ref="phillips-wendell">Wendell
								Phillips</persRef>; an intimate friend of my youth was his father
								<persRef ref="phillips-john">John Phillips</persRef> afterwards the
							first Mayor of Boston.— I had heard much of Wendell as an Abolitionist
							enthusiastic Orator, but had never seen or heard him. He was now
							introduced to me by one equally a stranger to me, but who introduced
							himself—named <persRef ref="pendleton-jw">J. W. Pendleton</persRef>.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips spoke to me about his
							fathers intimate acquaintance with me; which I confirmed; and assured
							him of the respectful and affectionate memory that I retain of him— He
							said he was so young when his father died that he had but a faint
							recollection of him; but that a friend of his who had known him had told
							him if his father had lived to this time, he would not have followed the
							course which he does— I said I thought that was probable; the great
							characteristic of his father having been prudence and discretion in the
							avowal of his opinions—and boldness that of Wendell himself— His address
							this evening was extemporaneous, and very handsomely delivered— Its
							topics were censure upon the church for coldness or lukewarmness to the
							cause of anti-slavery, and a fervid argument for the total and immediate
							abolition of Slavery throughout the world— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pendleton walked home with me.</p>

						<p>Rain, nearly all night—and Lightening this morning. <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							preached this morning from Psalm 91.2 “I will say of the Lord, He is my
							refuge, and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.” Confidence in
							God— The same subject treated by <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> last
							Sunday Morning, differently, but still well treated by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt— He said that in order to judge of
							the expediency or duty of reposing confidence it was necessary to
							consider the attributes suited to inspire confidence of the object to be
							confided in. And these were transcendent in God beyond all else— These
							attributes were 1. His power—Omnipotence— 2. His wisdom 3. His goodness.
							4 His unity. 5. The gift of Revelation— Upon each of these attributes he
							dilated as separately and in combination sources of confidence— He then
							alluded to the antient doctrine that the Gods take no interest in human
							affairs as a great and pernicious error destroying all confidence in
							God; and he glanced without dwelling upon a modern error equally
							destructive of confidence in God—the supposed existence of a rival or
							antagonist power to that of God; sharing with him in the government of
							the world; defying his power and disabling his goodness and outwitting
							his wisdom— God he said had no such rival or antagonist. After
							expatiating upon the inestimable <unclear>value</unclear> of this confidence in God to
							the happiness of man, he reminded his auditory that it was a trust
							forfeited by Sin, from which whether of commission or of omission it was
							incubent on every man solicitous for his own comfort and happiness to
							abstain— No greater calamity could befall a man than to lose his
							confidence in God— It was the enjoyment and consolation in this life,
							and the unwavering hope of a blessed immortality— The afternoon text was
							from Psalm 55—the latter part of verse 19.— [“]Because they have no
							changes therefore they fear not God.” The tendency of change in human
							affairs to inspire devotion, and of continuous prosperity to induce
							presumptuous indifference to the will of God, was connected in the
							Sermon with the recent death of <persRef ref="locke-caroline">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Locke</persRef>, a young woman of
							23. daughter of <persRef ref="nightingale-josiah">Josiah
								Nightingale</persRef>— Prayers were requested for him and <persRef
								ref="nightingale-joanna">his family</persRef>; and for the husband
								<persRef ref="locke-george">Locke</persRef>— The <persRef
								ref="nightingale-emeline">youngest daughter</persRef> was also
							prayed for being weak and low— I made this day a special effort of
							attention to the two discourses, with barely tolerable success in the
							morning, but with signal failure from drowsiness in the afternoon.—
								<persRef ref="leclerc-george">Buffon</persRef> considered Genius, as
							consisting of continuous application— There is something else. But
							involuntary slumber is a physical and mental infirmity under the
							operation of which observation and reflection are suspended.— Does
							Genius ever sleep? I wrote my two pages in the leisure of the day—but I
							sleep when I would not, and cannot sleep when I would— I seem to myself
							often an Idler; but I believe I tax my physical nature for toil beyond
							its endurance— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard Fletcher</persRef>, and

								ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George B.

							charge as administrator of the second <persRef ref="gill-moses">Moses

								ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef>— He has no evidence
							but that which I must furnish to support the charge, and the case was
							therefore again postponed till next Monday. At <persRef
								ref="brooks-charles2">Brooks’s</persRef> hard ware shop I purchased
							a spade which I mark as an epoch because it is to dig for exercise.
							Call’d at the Emancipator Office and saw <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> who returned
							in the Steamer Hibernia, from his Mission to the World’s convention for
							the abolition of Slavery— I had very little time for conversation with
							him but he said without hesitation that from all the observation he
							could make, he believed the suspicion and distrust of the sincerity of
							the present British Ministry, and especially with regard to the
							abolition of Slavery, which I had disclosed to him was well founded— He
							thought <persRef ref="gordon-george">Lord Aberdeen</persRef> at least
							lukewarm in the anti Slavery cause.— State policy controuls the
							abolition Spirit. At <persRef ref="mitchell-francis">Mitchell</persRef>
							the Engraver’s shop I took back the Seal with the Johnson arms. <persRef
								ref="buchanan-robert">Captain Buchanans</persRef> cornelian was at

							borrowed from <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> C. F. Adams</persRef> at Elm Street N. 9.—the house
							whence the Quincy Stage departs. Second Call at D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frothingham’s— I had enquired of him where the words
							laudator temporis acti were to be found— He traced it to <persRef
								ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Art of Poetry, and verse 173.— And
								<persRef ref="milton-john">Milton’s</persRef> old man eloquent is in
							the Sonnet 10. to the <persRef ref="ley-margaret">Lady Margaret
								Ley</persRef>— I had requested that Gillett’s Stage which leaves
							Boston at noon would call for me at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef> which was
							done at half past 12. I was there in waiting for it, and saw <persRef
								ref="foster-louisa;foster-mary">Louisa and Mary Foster</persRef>. I
							returned in that Stage to Quincy, and got home at 2. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham had given me a note for M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> C. F. Adams to notify her that <persRef
								ref="frothingham-thomas;frothingham-francis">Thomas and Frank
								Frothingham</persRef> were coming to dine with her, but when I went
							up the hill to deliver the note they were already there— They came over

							this morning, <persRef ref="kennedy-john;kennedy-elizabeth">M<hi

									>rs</hi> Brayton</persRef>, and another <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi

							the neighbourhood of Utica, and visitors merely for looking at the

							into new arrear, but not to make any progress in redeeming the past.</p>

						<dateline>Quincy. Wednesday 23 August 1843. Cambridge.</dateline>
						<p><date>23. IV. </date>Wednesday—</p>
						<p>Commencement.</p>
						<p>I attended at Commencement—the first time since 1831. Left home at half
							past 7. with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef>, went
							through Boston, and reached the tavern opposite the <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">Presidents</persRef> house at 9— Intending to
							pass the night at Cambridge, I applied for a bedchamber, but was
							informed that they took no lodgers. Precisely as we alighted, the
								<persRef ref="morton-marcus">Governor Marcus Morton</persRef>
							arrived preceded by an Escort of Cavalry; attended by three Aid de Camps
							in full military uniform; and followed by the Lieutenant Governor,
								<persRef ref="childs-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Childs</persRef>, and several members of the Council. The whole
							procession enlivened by the noisy music of the brass band— They
							proceeded immediately to the new Gothic Stone cloister to which the
							Library has been transferred, on the ground floor of which were
							assembled the President and faculty of the University, members of the
							corporation and overseers, and visitors invited or uninvited of all
							denominated— The President soon invited the members of the board of
							overseers into a side room, and there proposed in the name of the
							faculty 66 youths for admissions to the degree of bachelor of Arts— He
							read over their names, and the Governor put the question to the board
							who manifested their assent in the usual way; that is by holding up
							their hands— He went through the same process for conferring the degree
							of Master of Arts— After which the procession was formed and marched to
							the new parish church, and after a very short prayer by <persRef
								ref="walker-james">professor Walker</persRef>, the Salutatory
							Oration was pronounced by <persRef ref="frothingham-octavius">Octavius
								Brooks Frothingham</persRef>— Among his salutations was a very
							flattering one to me—my title to which if contested I should have been
							puzzled to vindicate. Then followed on the list of performances 14
							disquisitions 9 Dissertations 6 English Orations 1 Greek and 1 Latin
							Oration and a Poem, besides an English and a valedictory Latin Oration
							by candidates for the Master’s degree. About one third of the list were
							omitted: yet the performances were protracted to a sitting of nearly 6
							hours— No conference—no forensic no dialogue— The bachelors English
							Oration by <persRef ref="sargent-horace">Horace Binney Sargent</persRef>
							Son of <persRef ref="sargent-lucius">Lucius Manlius</persRef>— The
							Master’s English Oration by <persRef ref="allen-joseph3">Joseph Henry
								Allen</persRef> who visited me last fall at Quincy— The Latin
							valedictory, by <persRef ref="russell-william4">William Goodwin
								Russell</persRef> of Plymouth—jocular with much graceful action. The
							President then conferred the degrees first of bachelor then of master—
							Then Doctors of Medicine and then bachelors of Law closing with the
							honorary Doctors of Divinity— I dined at the College Hall. Visited with
							my Classmate <persRef ref="putnam-samuel">Samuel Putnam</persRef> the
							chambers of Sargent, of <persRef ref="lowell-john4">John
								Lowell</persRef>, and of Frothingham and spent the rest of the
							afternoon and Evening at President Quincy’s— My Son and William C.
							Johnson took the Carriage to Boston, and returned this evening to
							Quincy.</p>

						<p>I wrote this morning two hours by Lamplight, and met at breakfast the
							whole Quincy family; with the addition of <persRef

								Waterston</persRef>, father of <persRef ref="quincy-anna">Anna
								Quincy’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="waterston-robert">husband</persRef>— Immediately after
							breakfast I attended on <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy’s</persRef> study the meeting of the judges of the <persRef
								ref="boylston-nicholas">Boylston</persRef> prize-declamations. There
							were 19 names entered in competition for the 5 prizes 5 of the junior
							Class 6 of the Senior and 8 of the graduated Class— 5 however of the
							candidates did not appear— Among the judges were <persRef

								ref="saltonstall-leverett">Leverett Saltonstall</persRef>
							<persRef ref="loring-charles">Charles Loring</persRef>, <persRef

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rogers</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="young-alexander">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alexander Young</persRef>— The declamations occupied about 2 hours,
							and were on the whole superior to any that I had ever heard on these
							occasions before— We returned to the Presidents Study, and balloted for
							the two first prizes at once— I voted for <persRef ref="ladd-john"
								>Ladd</persRef> and <persRef ref="boyden-james">Boyden</persRef>—
							Only one had a majority and that was <persRef ref="dexter-samuel3"
								>Dexter</persRef>— His piece was a farcical Scene of Boz <persRef
								ref="dickens-charles">Dickens’s</persRef> Pick wick novel, and his
							merit was that of a comic actor, Ladd had a strong vote on the first
							ballot, and a majority, on the second— But the only vote given for
							Boyden on the first ballot was mine, and before the vote was taken for
							the three second prizes, I stated my reason for wishing to assign a
							prize to him, which was that he alone had selected the Latin of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> to speak and had spoken with
							articulation accent emphasis, modulation and pause not inferior to any
							of the rest— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gould objected that his
							pronunciation was not correct, and that he had missed the quantities, of
							several words— I thought that a venial Offence for a scholar fitted out
							of Boston, and at the first ballot for the second prizes <persRef
								ref="pike-robert">Pike</persRef> had 5 and Boyden 7. of 11. votes—
							At the second ballot Means had 6. and this completed the distribution—
							We returned to the Meeting house and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Quincy announced the names of the successful competitors, with a general
							encomium upon all the performances as unusually good.— Immediately after
							this I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy, <persRef
								ref="eliot-samuel3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel A.
								Elliot</persRef> and <persRef ref="peirce-benjamin">M<hi

								<persRef ref="craigie-andrew">Craigies</persRef> Summer house— Found
							the cellar dug, but not lined with Stone— The Meridian line is fixed and
							it is expected that the Tower will be completed before the next Spring—
							As we returned we met the procession of members of the Φ.B.K. Society,
							passing from the chapel to the meeting house and joined them. <persRef
								ref="hillard-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George S.

						<p>Last evening soon after my return home, <persRef ref="marchant-edward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marchant</persRef> a painter
							from New-York called on me, and enquired if I had received a Letter from
							a Committee of the New-York historical Society, requesting me to sit to
							him for my picture. I said I had; but that having been immediately
							afterwards been absent from home a month, and under some uncertainty
							whether it was the wish of the Committee that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Marchant should come here to paint the portrait, or wait
							till my passage through New-York, I had hitherto delayed answering their
							Letter. He said he had now come to take the time that might suit my
							convenience for the work— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marchant had
							already painted my portrait in November 1840. at New-York— But as I
							could then give him only three sittings in two days, he was not
							satisfied with his own work, and wishes to do it over again— He had now
							with him a miniature copied from his former picture, but <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">our Ladies</persRef>
							thought it bore No resemblance to me. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Marchant is at present engaged in painting certain portraits at
							Providence, and will come the week after next to take mine— This morning
							I made my morning excursion for observation and exercise but saw not the
							rising Sun intercepted as he was by a dense fog— But upon inspecting the
							self planted seedling wild cherry on the hill, I saw a white knob,
							thrusting itself up through the surface of the horse manure that I had
							gathered round the tree— It has put forth three or four plumelet leaves,
							while I was absent on my journey. So have many of the English Oaks—
								<persRef ref="lewis-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel

								>brother</persRef> brought me a Letter of introduction from <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua
								Leavitt</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis was formerly
							the Superintendent of common schools in the State of Ohio, and is an
							abolitionist— He expressed high gratification, at my engagement to visit
							Cincinnati next November— I conversed freely with him upon the subject
							of Slavery, but told him that I shall probably feel myself interdicted
							from discoursing or perhaps even speaking about it at Cincinnati— I
							received a Letter from Philadelphia signed <persRef ref="hedges-joseph"
								>Joseph Hedges</persRef>, covering a sealed Letter, not directed,
							and requesting me to forward it to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef>—alledging that it is on business and that the
							writer does not know M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster’s Post
							Office address— Without directing the Letter I enclosed it to him at
							Marshfield. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles F.
								Adams</persRef> with <persRef ref="adams-louisa3;adams-mary4">their

								<persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								>My Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C.
								Johnson</persRef> came home the evening of Commencement day, and
							yesterday morning took the Steamer took the Barnstable; to pass through
							Sandwich to Wood’s hole, and thence to New Bedford— On visiting again
							this evening the wild cherry seedling on the hill, I found the fungus
							mushroom or toadstool with its dark cap opened like an umbrella over a
							white stem four inches long.— I am not yet recovered from four
							successive days of dissipation.</p>

							article of the Constitution which requires the surrender of fugitive
							Slaves.— He assumes the position that <unclear>this</unclear> is null and void; as a
							compact contrary to the Law of Nature and of God— He thanked God that he
							was not a citizen of the United States—and goes the extremest lengths of
							the abolitionists— After his lecture he came and spoke to me, and <unclear>. .

						<p><persRef ref="motte-mellish">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Motte</persRef> was a Classmate and chamber mate of my dear and
							lamented son <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>— He is a
							native of South-Carolina, born of <persRef
								ref="motte-abraham;motte-mary">Episcopalian parents</persRef>;
							educated at Cambridge, and afterwards for an Episcopalian clergyman— His
							studies led him to the unitarian faith, and the congregational forms— He
							was for a year or two Minister of the unitarian church at Washington;
							and afterwards of the South Congregation, Washington Street, Boston— His
							talents are respectable, and his life and conversation blameless.— But
							his defect of character is want of energy— He travelled a year or two in
							Europe with the consent of his congregation for the restoration of his
							health, and returned to them again— But his manner of preaching is not
							attractive— It is languid and lifeless, and the substance of his
							discourses, though sensible and intelligent has no charm to redeem the
							dulness of a languid and listless delivery.— His congregation insensibly
							grew weary of his ministrations hardly knowing why— They drop’d off one
							by one from his Society— Those who remained became uneasy and
							discontented, till by mutual consent they agreed to part. He took his
							dismission in kindness and charity, and they elected in his place a
							young man named <persRef ref="huntington-frederick"
							>Huntington</persRef>, at whose ordination I assisted last October.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Motte continues to preach as occasion
							calls, and has now a summer residence at Cohasset— His Sermon this
							morning was from 1. Corinthians 15.45. [“]And so it is written, The
							first man <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef> was made a living soul; the
							last Adam was made a quickening spirit. 46. Howbeit, that was not first
							which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which
							is spiritual 47. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man
							is the Lord from heaven. 48. As is the earthy, such are the earthy: and
							as is the heavenly, such are they also, that are heavenly.” Here is a
							multifold repetition of one idea—the distinction between matter and
							spirit; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Motte made it the foundation
							of an enquiry into the nature of the enjoyments of Paradise, and why
							there is so much lamentation at their having been forfeited— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Motte dined with us, and his afternoon
							Sermon was from 2. Corinthians 4.18. [“]While we look not at the things
							which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things
							which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are
							eternal.” substantially the same subject as that of the morning.— And I
							found it impossible to follow the preacher into any train of impressive
							argument. The day was to the feelings the hottest of the season—Sultry
							and scorching. Towards sunset there came up a long though not very
							severe thunder shower— This evening I completed the recovery of the 12
							days of arrears which had accumulated in my diary, in the month of my
							journey to Canada and the Falls of Niagara and of Trenton.</p>

						<p>I rose before three this morning, an hour earlier than my regular time,

							10 minutes risen— I mark the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August
							as the day, and 40 minutes past 4 as the time of his emerging so far
							from his conjunction with the Sun that the Egyptian shepherds would have
							discovered him.— One of the obstacles to my morning labours now is the
							moisture of all grass covered ground, on which whether from dew or rain
							I cannot tread without getting wet-feet, from which no leather boot or
							shoe affords protection. The bare foot or the Sabot is the proper

								Frothingham</persRef> in passing by stop’d and spoke to me. At
								<persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.

								ref="foster-louisa">Louisa</persRef>. <persRef ref="foster-mary"
								>Mary</persRef> was quite unwell and kept her chamber. The Quincy
							Stage took me up there and landed me at home before 2.— As we were
							sitting down to dinner <persRef ref="bronson-parliament">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> P. Bronson</persRef> of Auburn,
							New-York called to see me— He had already called this morning with his

								William Blake</persRef> of Boston, just after I had left home in the
							Stage— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blake returned to Boston— M<hi

							Bronson was one of the Gentleman, who with <persRef ref="seward-william"

						<p>To keep up the current of my diary, I omitted the morning excursion to my
							garden and grounds. at 10. I rode with <persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef> to Boston, and left her at <persRef
								ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
								Foster’s</persRef>. Visited <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert C. Winthrop</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john;kennedy-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Kennedy</persRef> left the city
							yesterday morning for the Saratoga Springs. I spoke to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop of the removal by <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Levi Lincoln</persRef>, from the Office of
							Collector of the Port of Boston; and the appointment of <persRef
								ref="rantoul-robert">Robert Rantoul jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> in his place; and enquired whether the
							merchants of Boston would not as a body take some notice of this dirty
							trick of the accidental President. He said he thought it would be very
							proper, but although M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln is
							universally allowed to have discharged in exemplary manner the duties of
							the Office; there is little sympathy with him in the public mind on this
							occasion. At <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> office I
							found <persRef ref="spooner-allen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Spooner</persRef>, <persRef ref="flint-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Flint</persRef> of Louisville Kentucky
							and <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flint who
							proposes to depart to-morrow on his return to Louisville, urged on me
							again the acceptance of his invitation to me to visit that city, when I
							go to Cincinnati next November, but I told him it was exceedingly
							doubtful whether I shall be able to go even to Cincinnati, and if I do,
							whether I can extend my journey further.— I left him however with an
							assurance that I will come to Louisville if I can— I requested M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis to look over his papers to see if
							he has not among them some memoranda of the amount of the <persRef
								ref="gill-moses">Gill</persRef> claim on the <persRef
								ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef> administration— He
							shewed me a proposal from the present Tenant of the School Street house,
							that it be taken down, and a new one built on the site, for which he
							shall take a lease for 5. or 10 years at a rent of 1000 dollars a year—
							We discussed and referred it for further consideration. I signed a
							duplicate of the Letter of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> to <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty
								Vaughan</persRef>. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy</persRef> passing in his chaise in the Street, stop’d and
							spoke to me. I had received from him this morning sundry papers relating
							to the observatory.— He recommended specially <persRef
								ref="peirce-benjamin">Professor Peirce</persRef> to my attention—
							Going to visit <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Parkman</persRef> I met him in the Street, and
							went with him to his house where I saw <persRef
								ref="parkman-eliza;parkman-harriette">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> and Miss Parkman</persRef>, a <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Brown</persRef> and <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef>— The Doctor walked with me to <persRef
								ref="davis-john">judge Davis’s</persRef> house. There I dined with
							his daughters <persRef ref="goodwin-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Goodwin</persRef> and <persRef ref="sturgis-elizabeth"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></persRef><space/>widows <persRef
								ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P. Davis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="davis-susan">his wife</persRef>, Professor Peirce, and <persRef
								ref="lovering-joseph">Tutor Lovering</persRef>.— We had much
							conversation on Astronomy— I urged the judge to get up an Astronomical
							Society in Boston— At 5. pm the carriage came: I took up Louisa C Smith
							at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H Foster’s and we returned home.
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

						<p>Spading one hour— Loosened the ground round the Apple seedling in front

								Martha</persRef> is the widow of <persRef ref="burrell-lemuel"
								>Lemuel Burrell</persRef>, a Seaman on board the Macedonian frigate,

							January when she received 12 dollars as a final payment— She is in great
							want of a renewal of the pension, and desires to petition Congress for
							it. I advised her to petition jointly with as many other widows having
							the same ground of claim as her own, as she could find out, and I
							promised to present the petition and give it all the support in my
							power. She is a daughter of <persRef ref="beale-joseph2">Joseph

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond brought with him some papers
							additional to those which <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy</persRef> had sent me— The successors of <persRef
								ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauenhofer</persRef> at Munich are <persRef
								ref="merz-george">Merz</persRef> an Optician, and <persRef
								ref="mahler-joseph">Mahler</persRef> a Mechanician— The price of the
							duplicate of the Pulkova Telescope is 42000 German florins, or 16800
							dollars— On their Catalogue for sale there is a graduation of the prices
							of Refractors of inferior power—of 30,000. 22000. 15000— 8000. 4800.
							2200. 2000 1500. 900. and 750 florins— And a multitude of other
							mathematical and optical instrume<unclear>nts</unclear> the most costly of which is the
							Heliometer charged at 15000 florins. Of this there is one at Pulkova—
							The mural circle is the next dearest astronomical instrument, after the
							Refract<unclear>or.</unclear> Its chief use is for making catalogues of Stars, and it
							requires two observers to be constantly occupied at the same time— They
							do not propose to procure at present a mural circle, or to make that
							Class of Observations at Cambridge— The Perkins professorship of
							Astronomy and Mathematics is a new institution at Harvard, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Peirce has been this year appointed the
							first professor.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond left with me two

								Struve’s</persRef> report of his observations of double Stars, with
							Frauenhofer’s great Telescope at Dorpat from 1824 to 1837. Struve being

							had been transferred to the new Observatory at Pulkova; and with which
							there is appended a disquisition on the annual parallax of the Star
							[symbols] Lyrae— I collected from this interview much desultory
							information which I must tax my memory to retain, but which I cannot

						<p>Spading and hoeing 2. hours— The Pear tree first bearing in the centre of
							the garden next the red cherry tree, is a bergamot— I took up the
							diseased peach tree close to the fence at the kitchen garden gate— In
							attempting to trim the wild cherry seedling up the hill, I cut off the
							stem itself close to the ground.— Broke up the ground sloping down from
							the tool box towards the orchard— <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon

							Provincetown, Sandwich, Wood’s hole, Nantucket and New-Bedford— But they
							got home before dinner, and were here this evening.— <persRef

							said he had been to the grave yard to see to the repairing of his
							monument of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah3;quincy-abigail2">his

							I wrote the epitaph engraved upon it. It is already dilapidated, in

							boys— The cemetery has been much neglected, but more care of it is now
							taken— <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							now to be carved on it, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf
							enquired if I should wish to have that of Norton Quincy added to it. I
							said I should; and requested M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf to
							say to <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> that I would see him on the subject. I had further
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy concerning the
							observatory, and he is to send me some other papers accidentally omitted
							when he sent me the others— I read the french pamphlet report of
								<persRef ref="struve-friedrich">Struve</persRef> to the Minister of
							public instruction and President of the Russian Imperial Academy of
							Sciences <persRef ref="uvarov-sergey">Ouvaroff</persRef>, containing the
							narrative of his observations upon double stars at Dorpat from 1824 to
							1837. It is full of very interesting information, leading as usual to
							multitudes of further enquiries which I shall never have time to
							pursure—for see now the distribution of my time, through this month of
							August since the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> when I came home.</p>
