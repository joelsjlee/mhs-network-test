						<p>Meetings of the select Committee on <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W.
								Cost Johnson’s</persRef> plan for creating two hundred millions of
							dollars of 3 per Cent Stocks hypothecated on the proceeds of the sales
							of the public lands, to be distributed among the States to relieve them
							in the payment of their debts— Present Johnson, <persRef
								ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef>, <persRef ref="cravens-james"
								>Cravens</persRef>, <persRef ref="howard-jacob">Howard</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="cooper-mark">Cooper</persRef>, and Adams.— We were to
							meet at 9. but it was half an hour later before we formed a Quorum, and
							as the house met at 10. we had no time for discussion, nor even for
							reading the chairman’s report which was itself not finished.— We agreed
							to take some opportunity, while the house were in Session, to slip out
							of the hall, and meet again in the Committee room again which we did—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Johnson’s report was not yet
							finished—but he read what he had written, and it was agreed that he
							should finish it, and present it to the house to-morrow— It is to
							conclude with two Resolutions— 1. That It is expedient that the
							Government of the Union should come to the aid of the States to assist
							them in the payment of their debts, by the application of their common
							property in the public lands— And 2. That a Committee be appointed to
							prepare a Bill, for that purpose— But foreseeing that the first
							resolution, if a question be taken upon it in the house will certainly
							be rejected,—I offered three Resolutions as a substitute for it in the
							event of its rejection. 1. That repudiation by a State of a debt
							contracted with foreigners is a violation of the Constitution of the
							United States in the Article which prohibits every State from passing
							any Law impairing the obligation of contracts. 2. That if any State
							shall by such repudiation involve herself in War, Congress has no power
							to involve the Nation in that War. 3. That if any State should involve
							herself in such a War, she would cease to be a State of this Union, and
							would have no claim to the aid of the other States of the Union for her
							defence— No objection was made to my introducing these resolutions as a
							substitute; but they startled every member of the Committee present, and
							evidently disconcerted Johnson— He had blinked the question of
							repudiation and War, without the preliminary settlement of which his
							project is mere moonshine. At the house amidst the usual confusion
							always incident to the last three days of a Session of Congress,
							specially aggravated by the last agonies of a Congress itself, the day
							was almost wholly consumed in unprofitable debate on the amendments
							proposed by the Senate to the navy appropriation bill; the merits and
							demerits of <persRef ref="barton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barton</persRef> as chief of the medical, and surgical bureau, under
							the new organization of the Navy Department, and whether the chief of an
							other bureau should be a captain or a purser in the Navy. All the
							amendments of the Senate were acted upon in Committee of the whole on
							the state of the Union; <persRef ref="mcclellan-robert">Robert
								M’Lellan</persRef> in the chair— Adjourned after 5. Evening visits
							from <persRef ref="seaton-sarah2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Seaton</persRef>, with <persRef ref="hale-sarah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hale</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u"
								>her daughter</persRef>— Also from <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> who took
							leave, about to return to Boston.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 14. Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present
							Adams, <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>, <persRef ref="stuart-john2"
								>Stuart</persRef>, <persRef ref="meriwether-james2"
								>Meriwether</persRef>— We had the documents relating to the Republic
							of Hayti, and those relating to the occupation of Monterey by <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas">Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones</persRef> before
							us— They had been sent for to the printers, and not one of them had been
							printed—although the Hayti Message had been referred to the Committee,
							on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of December, and the papers had
							been at the printers ever since.— I offered a Resolution upon each of
							these sets of papers to be reported to the house. That a Consul ought to
							be forthwith appointed to the Republic of Hayti, to prosecute the claims
							of our citizens; and a strong declaratory Resolution against the
							invasion of the territory of a foreign State at peace with the United
							States, by any military or naval officer; but there being a bare quorum
							at the meeting, the questions were postponed in the expectation of a
							fuller meeting to-morrow— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett also
							proposed two Resolutions respecting the right of visitation at sea for
							consideration to-morrow. At the house <persRef ref="reynolds-john"
								>Reynolds</persRef> of Illinois presented several impertinent
							resolutions of the Legislature of that State— Illinois is one of the
							bilking States, and Reynolds is one of her accredited cheats; and these
							States just as they grow bold in spunging their debts, they become
							profuse of their advice to Congress— <persRef ref="white-edward">Edward
								D. White</persRef> of Louisiana, in his peculiar and somewhat
							ludicrous style, complained of having been personally insulted, by
							reflections upon the imputed disaffection of the people of Louisiana, at
							the time of the english invasion in 1815— Those imputations he said were
							utterly false, and he wanted to prove it—(<persRef ref="butler-william2"
								>W. O. Butler</persRef> had charged them in his speech.) White asked
							that the house should immediately after the morning hour go into
							Committee of the whole on the State of the Union to take up Senate Bill
							N. 12 to refund <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> fine— This was a spurt and came to nothing.—
								<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> called up the
							Resolutions appended to his report from the Committee of Commerce, on
							the oppression of coloured Seamen in Southern ports. <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved to lay the subject
							on the table yeas and nays 86 to 59.— A desperate struggle was made to
							recharter for ten years the District Banks—defeated by Cave Johnson,
								<persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef>. <persRef ref="johnson-william2"
								>W. Cost Johnson</persRef> presented his report and resolutions, on
							the two hundred millions of stocks project, which were ordered to be
							printed— A desperate effort was made favoured by Johnson himself, to
							exclude from reception my resolutions offered as a substitute for the
							first of his— They failed to exclude them from reception; but by yeas
							and nays, 72 to 108. they refused to print them— I defeated a Bill of W.
							O. Butler from the Committee of military Affairs, to restore the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> regiment of dragoons and much Artillery.—
							The Code for the Navy—reduction of postage, and the navy appropriation
							bill absorbed the time of the house till 7 in the Evening when sundry
							motions to adjourn, and a call of the house were rejected, and the
							adjournment at last carried by yeas and nays 89 to 76.</p>

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs.— Present Adams, <persRef

							Cushing was asked if he was ready to report upon the case of the Florida
							territorial bonds; and answered that he was not— Precisely so he did at
							the close of the last Session— Upon my Resolution that a Consul to the
							republic of Hayti, ought to be appointed the vote to lay it on the table
							was unanimous except my own— Everett, and Granger as well as Cushing
							voting in submission to the South— But my Resolution against the
							invasion of foreign territories by any naval or military Officer in time
							of Peace was voted for by every member present, except Caleb Cushing,
							who voted against it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett offered his
							two resolutions concerning the right of visitation at sea; but they were
							laid on the table by the vote of all the members present except Everett
							and me— I asked Cushing if he was acting as an Executive Officer or as a
							member of the house— He smiled and answered in good humour that he did
							not know. The Committee adjourned without day— In the house, the chaos
							of a closing Congress was more than usually magnificent— The 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> joint rule of the two houses enjoining
							that no new bill shall be sent from one house to the other on the last
							three days of a Session, and the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> that
							no bill shall be sent to the President for his signature on the last day
							of a Session were suspended first for particular bills, and then without
							limitation.— Committees of conference on the civil and diplomatic and
							the Navy Appropriation Bills and some others were appointed, and
							adjusted sundry differences of details— <persRef
								ref="williams-christopher">Christopher H. Williams</persRef> by dint
							of importunity got the house into Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union, upon a bill to divide the Country into two military divisions
							for the benefit of <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General
							Gaines</persRef>, but the bill failed— <persRef ref="atherton-charles"
								>Atherton</persRef> was in the chair— The house took a recess from 4
							to 6. O’Clock—and when the time for resuming the Session came Atherton
							and his gang attempted to transact business with less than half a
							Quorum—while <persRef ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> was leaping like
							a dog at a sop suspended over his head, to get up Senate bill N 12 to
							refund the fine of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>. He succeeded at last in getting a vote by yeas
							and nays, but the house refused 77 to 83 to take it up— <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> moved the vote of thanks to the
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>
							<persRef ref="brown-charles3">Charles Brown</persRef> in a huffy speech
							declared he would not vote for it. <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
								>Pickens</persRef>
							<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and Cushing, voted for it
							from professed magnanimity— Wise after asking to be excused— <persRef
								ref="marshall-thomas3">T. F. Marshall</persRef> asked to make a
							speech after midnight Not allowed. Adjourned without day at half past
							one A.M. leaving the Senate in Session, upon executive business. They
							sat till half past 2. and thrice rejected Wise and Cushing.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 21. Clear cold—</p>
						<p>The scene has changed; but I yet find time neither for repose, nor for
							profitable occupation— A succession of visitors absorbed the day. First
							came <persRef ref="brown-george">George Brown</persRef>, who informed me
							that he had received the appointment of commissioner to the Sandwich
							Islands— He told me that <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef> was appointed minister plenipotentiary to China—
							That <persRef ref="wise-henry">Henry A. Wise</persRef> was nominated
							three times to the Senate as Minister to France, and three times
							rejected. That <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef>, had
							been three times nominated Secretary of the Treasury with the same
							result, after which <persRef ref="spencer-john">John C Spencer</persRef>
							was nominated for Secretary of the Treasury, and confirmed by the
							majority of one vote— <persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W. Irwin</persRef>
							nominated chargé d’Affaires to Denmark was confirmed without much
							opposition— The vacancy in England by Edward Everett’s appointment to
							China, is the substitute for the special mission, which slumped through
							in the Committee of foreign affairs— It is the back door by which
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> skilfully secures to
							himself a safe retreat from the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>Tyler</persRef> cabinet. If Everett declines the China Mission,
							Webster can take it himself.— <persRef ref="claiborne-clement">William
								Claiborne</persRef> the rattle-brained keeper of the Marshall house
							at Richmond, came and took leave; and shewed me several of his Letters
							of recommendation: <persRef ref="freeman-william">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Freeman</persRef> of the Marine Corps
							came with a budget of grievance, but finding me engaged with others said
							he would call again on Monday— I met <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef> in the Street, as I
							was going to the Bank of the Metropolis— He spoke of the address to the
							people on the subject of Texas, which <persRef ref="gates-seth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seth M. Gates</persRef>, wished to
							leave with me, but finally took himself— Most of the other visitors came
							merely to take leave, save <persRef ref="lee-john3">Lee</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">Tompkins</persRef>, strangers, who came by the mere
							impulse of curiosity. <persRef ref="briggs-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Briggs</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="davis-richard">Richard D. Davis</persRef> came together.
								<persRef ref="connell-john">Connell</persRef> was desponding. I had
							helped his bill for the relief of the heirs of <persRef
								ref="fulton-robert">Robert Fulton</persRef> through the house, and
							he had sangwine hopes of its passage in the Senate—but its friends could
							not bring it up; though he says there were 30 members out of 50 ready to
							vote for it— <persRef ref="randall-alexander">Alexander
								Randall</persRef> came for the trunk containing the papers of the
							late <persRef ref="wirt-william">William Wirt</persRef>; but while I was
							looking for the key, hurried away for fear of losing the 4. O’Clock
							Cars; saying he would come for it again— Day lost.</p>

						<p>At the second Presbyterian church, morning and afternoon the services
							were performed by the <persRef ref="ely-ezra">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ezra Stiles
								Ely</persRef> formerly of Philadelphia, but now of some where in the
							State of Missouri; at once an aspirant to sanctity and hacknied in the
							ways of the world— In 1828 he prostituted his pulpit in Philadelphia, by
							presbyterian electioneering harangues to promote the election to the
							Presidency of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, a
							recorded adulterer a duel murderer, and a ruffian blasphemer, but a
							pious and exemplary member of the presbyterian church— At that time, by
							Doctor Ely’s creed all the sins of orthodox presbyterians from the
							beginning of time, and all that are to come have been washed white in
							the blood of the lamb— A sin more or a sin less is of no account, when
							the atonement sweeps them all in one lump away.— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Ely’s morning text was from Romans 10.11. [“]For the
							scripture saith, whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed”— The
							scripture quoted, he said was Isaiah 28.16. [“]he that believeth shall
							not make haste.” that is like persons who are ashamed— The whole sermon
							was an earnest and eloquent exhortation to the auditory, not to be
							ashamed of the belief in Christ— And there were many remarks on the
							nature of Faith, but without noticing its two fold meaning of mere
							belief and of fidelity— After the morning worship <persRef
								ref="snelling-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Snelling</persRef> called on me and I returned to him the Letter
							from <persRef ref="mann-horace">Horace Mann</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Massachusetts board of School commissioners which he had left with
							me, and in which he proposes a plan for the investment of the
							Smithsonian fund— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> D. D. Barnard</persRef> also called to take leave,
							intending to depart on his return home to Albany to-morrow.— This being
							the first Sunday in Lent, the communion was administered by <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church and there was no
							evening service there— I attended again at the 2<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Presbyterian church, where D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Ely preached from Titus 3.14. “And let ours also learn to maintain good
							works for necessary uses”—leaving out the remaining words of the
							verse—[“]that they be not unfruitful.” This was a very sensible and
							liberal discourse on the necessity of good works as the natural and
							universal result of faith, though of no avail whatever to salvation— The
							Doctor gave notice that he should preach again next Sunday morning and
							afternoon at the same church— His auditory this morning was very thin,
							but this afternoon the church was full, without being crowded— Four
							strangers in my pew— Evening visits from <persRef ref="kerr-john">J. L.
								Kerr</persRef>, ex-Senator from Maryland, and from <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard2">R. D. Cutts</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript"

							gave me a full exposition of the abusive treatment and persecution which
							he is suffering from <persRef ref="henderson-archibald">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l. </hi>Henderson</persRef> the commandant of
							the corps— He believes it originated in a loan of money which Henderson
							obtained from him in 1834. and the payment of which he procrastinated
							and evaded till Freeman was obliged to demand it in a tone so peremptory
							and menacing that Henderson made the payment, and declared that all
							personal intercourse between them other than strictly official would
							thenceforward cease.— Two days after Freeman received an order,
							transferring him from Boston to Pensacola from the healthiest to the
							most unhealthy station of the service— To accomplish this petty tyranny
							Henderson got the numbers of the stations changed— And so feeble is the
							state of Freeman’s health that he has certificates from <persRef
								ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>
							and another eminent physician at Boston that a summer residence in a
							Southern climate would imminently endanger his life— He has remonstrated
							against all this, first, with Henderson himself and afterwards with the
							Secretary of the Navy <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Upshur</persRef>, with
							the result only of another transfer from Pensacola to Norfolk Virginia—
							He now asked my advice, as an old friend of <persRef ref="freeman-susan"
								>his deceased wife’s</persRef> father <persRef ref="amory-rufus"
								>Rufus G. Amory</persRef> and of his kinsman, the late <persRef
								ref="freeman-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James Freeman</persRef>.— I advised
							him to see <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and to appeal directly to the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>. I went to the Capitol;
							returned books to the house and Congress libraries, and brought home the
							Letters and papers left in my draw— Took at the document chamber the
							sheets of the house and Senate journals hitherto printed, and one or two
							spare documents— At the clerk’s office I enquired for the Resolution,
							which I reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs on the last Night
							of the Session, against the invasion of foreign territories by a
							military or naval officer, and which the house by yeas and
							nays<space/>to<space/>refused to suspend the rules to receive— It was mislaid
							and not to be found. I had received a note yesterday from the National
							Intelligencer Office requesting a copy of it, but I had none. I called
							at the office, where <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> gave me three
							Arkansas State Gazettes of 18 and 25 January and 1. February last
							containing the <persRef ref="sevier-ambrose">Sevier</persRef>
							atchievements on the Smithsonian fund— This afternoon my neighbour

						<p>The assortment and filing of my Letters which have been two months
							accumulating, some of them unread, occupies now about two hours of my
							time every day— Four hours, for the recording of two days in this Diary,
							to retrieve every day one of the arrears, gives as much writing as I can
							perform— The tide of visitors is subsiding, and the newspaper and
							pamphlet reading is not now overcharged as it was during the Session of

								James C. Adams</persRef>, Secretary of the Baltimore Lyceum had
							written me a Letter from <persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef>
							hotel last evening, enquiring if I would deliver a Lecture before that
							institution; and he came this morning and renewed in person the
							invitation— I have no alternative, but to decline them all; and in every
							case it is a trial of temper to give a courteous negative answer. I
							walked this morning to <persRef ref="haas-philip">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Haas’s</persRef> shop, and he took
							from his camera obscura, three Daguerrotype likenesses of me— The
							operation is performed in half a minute; but is yet altogether
							incomprehensible to me. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Haas says it is a
							chemical process upon mercury, silver, gold and Iodine. It would seem as
							easy to stamp a fixed portrait from the reflection of a mirror; but how
							wonderful would that reflection itself be, if we were not familiarised
							to it from childhood.— I went to the Capitol, and on enquiry at the
								<persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk’s</persRef> office, found that my
							resolution reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs in the night
							of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March, but not received by the

								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef> for publication in the National Intelligencer— I met
							him in the Congress library.— There are no additional documents, or

								<persRef ref="danforth-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Danforth</persRef> came again to enquire if I would deliver a

								Ely</persRef> at the second presbyterian church last Sunday; I said
							I had; and he intimated that perhaps the Doctor would incline to be

							Philadelphia, reminding me of Letters received by me some months since
							from <persRef ref="lamb-john2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lamb</persRef> of Frankford 6 miles from Philadelphia, inviting me
							to deliver a Lecture there— Charles was a strange correspondent to urge

							and desired to be excused from delivering the Lecture— I wrote also to
							the <persRef ref="brown-obadiah">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>

							examine the papers and advise what portion of them should be published—
							A task which I have not been able to perform nor even to read more than

							very much being obliged now to give up the papers which are to be
							committed to <persRef ref="kennedy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John P. Kennedy</persRef>, for the same purpose. In looking over my
							papers I found several which required my attendance at the Departments
							of the Treasury and of War— I went first to the Treasury— The Secretary
								<persRef ref="spencer-john">John C. Spencer</persRef>, transferred
							from the War Department in the last hour of the late Congress after the
							thrice repeated rejection by the Senate of the nomination of <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef>, had taken possession of

							transcript of that of <persRef ref="mauro-joseph">Joseph
							Mauro</persRef>, which I had borrowed, for the illustration of <persRef
								ref="yulee-david">David Levy’s</persRef> bill, and which defeated

							of <persRef ref="drew-joshua">Joshua Drew</persRef> of Duxbury, for
							payment of the sum of 240 dollars granted for his relief by an act of
							the recent Session. No such application has been made, and I wrote to

								<persRef ref="ford-john">John Ford</persRef> making enquiries
							concerning a supposed claim of <persRef ref="sprague-elisha">Elisha
								Sprague</persRef> of Marshfield deceased of indemnity for property
							destroyed by the Seminole Indians but not a trace of the claim could be
							found at the Department— I had taken Treasury Notes redeemable this and

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Young informed me that they would be
							payable on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of July next at the

						<p>In the unceasing mill clapper talk of <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler</persRef> last evening,
							he asked me to introduce him to the new Secretary of the Treasury
								<persRef ref="spencer-john">John C. Spencer</persRef> which I agreed
							to do, and appointed this day at one O’Clock to go with him to the
							Department for that purpose— He came and we went accordingly— I
							introduced him, and almost immediately left them together; but not
							without perceiving the seeds of a conflict already germinating between
							two proud spirits, which bodes no good to the progress of the Coast
							Survey.— The recent act places Hassler under the controul of a board of
							Officers; and the whole operation under the superintendence of the
							Secretary of the Treasury— Hassler, already restive under the yoke
							fitting to his neck, said that the work being scientific must be
							conducted on scientific principles— The potentate answered in a subdued
							tone of voice but with the trenchant stubbornness of authority the Laws
							must be obeyed— The pride of Science clashed with the pride of place,
							and I left them together.— I had observed the same temper in Spencer
							yesterday in talking with him about the present condition and prospects
							of the Smithsonian fund— I supplicated him to take an interest in the
							restoration, preservation and application of the fund to the purposes of
							the testator— He promised to make a full report to Congress on the
							subject—to recommend the issue of 6 per Cent stock of the United States
							to the full amount of the dilapidated funds and the investment of it in
							trustees— The <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Chief Justice</persRef>
							of the United States and other Officers of the Government— But he
							thought the disposal of the funds should be left entirely to the
							Trustees, and he pronounced the prejudices against my plan of an
							astronimical observatory insurmountable because I had once called
							observatories, light houses <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the skies— My
							words were light-houses <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the skies, but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer sees no difference between the two
							phrases— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer turned up his eyes at
							the swindling speculation of the <persRef ref="sevier-ambrose"
								>Senator</persRef> from Arkansas, and shruged up his shoulders at
							the prospect of ever recovering the money from that State— I spent much
							of this day in transiently reading the report of the trial in the
							Supreme Court of the United States of the case of <persRef
								ref="prigg-edward">Edward Prigg</persRef> against the Commonwealth
							of Pennsylvania—otherwise called the fugitive slave case— <persRef
								ref="story-joseph;thompson-smith;wayne-james;daniel-peter;mclean-john2"
								>Seven judges</persRef>—every one of them dissenting from the
							reasoning of all the rest, and every one of them coming to the same
							conclusion: the transcendent omnipotence of Slavery in these United
							States, riveted by a clause in the Constitution that persons held to
							labour, escaping from one State to another shall be delivered up on the

						<p>The Note of <persRef ref="brown-obadiah">Obadiah B. Brown</persRef>,
							which I took this time last year secured by a mortgage of lots in this
							city, was payable this day. I had neglected to have the mortgage Deed
							recorded within six months from its date as the law here requires— Day
							before yesterday I wrote to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown,
							enquiring, if I might expect payment this day— Yesterday I received his
							answer, promising to pay the interest, but asking further indulgence for
							the principal— I had engaged <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major C. J.
								Nourse</persRef> to procure for me a Cincinnati 6 per cent bond for
							1000 dollars at 83 1/2 per cent and he came this morning to inform me
							that it would be delivered to me next Wednesday, to come from
							Philadelphia; but it was to be paid for this day— I therefore applied at
							the Treasury Department for repayment of two Treasury Notes of 500
							dollars each, due on the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month—
							The treasurer referred me to the Bank of the Metropolis, where they took
							my two Notes and gave me a credit of 1060 dollars and 49 cents— I then
							gave Major Nourse two checks—one for 835 dollars for the Cincinnati bond
							which he is to deliver to me next Wednesday, and one for 221.25 for
							which he is to deliver to me a city corporation note of 250 dollars—
							Upon all which I remark my own indiscretion in making the payments
							before the delivery of the stocks— An experiment somewhat hazardous, and
							not to be repeated— Upon my file of Letters which I am assorting I found
							two relating to Post Offices which required answers. One from <persRef
								ref="murdoch-jesse">Jesse Murdoch</persRef> of Carver; and the other
							from <persRef ref="boyden-john">John E. Boyden</persRef>, an aspirant
							for a Post-Office at South Dedham— I took them to the general

								>Wickliffe</persRef> was gone to escort homeward <persRef
								ref="wickliffe-robert">his Son</persRef>, recently married to a
								<persRef ref="wickliffe-anna">daughter</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="dawson-john2">Dawson</persRef> the amiable bully from

								ref="hobbie-selah">Hobbie</persRef> was also absent. But <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whittlesey</persRef> the auditor was there, and the second Assistant
							Postmaster General <persRef ref="bryan-john2">Bryant</persRef>, whom I
							informed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murdoch’s Letter,
							recommended <persRef ref="shurtleff-samuel">Samuel E.
								Shurtleff</persRef>, for the appointment of Postmaster at Carver—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant exhibited to me the papers in
							the Office relating to the application for an Office at South Dedham—
							There were two Letters from the <persRef ref="calvin-durfee">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Calvin Durfee</persRef> of that
							place, one to me and one to his uncle <persRef ref="tappan-benjamin2"
								>Benjamin Tappan</persRef>, Senator from Ohio, remonstrating against
							a new Office at South Dedham, because it would require the
							discontinuance of the existing Office at East-Walpole— I took the
							mortgage deed of Obadiah B. Brown to the City Hall and left it at the
							Register’s Office to be recorded— <persRef ref="brent-w">William
								Brent</persRef> said there was an act of Congress remedying the
							laches of a record not made within the six Months— Call at <persRef
								ref="haas-philip">Haas’s</persRef> shop and took the Daguerrotype
							likeness of me—a very good one— At the House <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk’s</persRef> Office in the Capitol— No
							further Documents or journals printed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> O.
							B. Brown came this afternoon and paid me a year’s interest on his note,
							and for recording the mortgage.— And hopes to pay the note itself before
							midsummer.</p>

						<p>I attended morning and afternoon at the second Presbyterian church and
							heard <persRef ref="ely-ezra">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ezra Stiles
								Ely</persRef>— His morning text was from Hebrews 5.9. “And being
							made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them
							that obey him.” This verse is in one of the most obscure and mysterious
							chapters of all the writings of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>—if indeed which I much
							doubt the epistle to the hebrews was written by S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Paul— The allusions to Christ as a Priest forever after the
							order of <persRef ref="melchizedek">Melchisedek</persRef>—are utterly
							unintelligible to me— The quotation is from Psalm 110.4. a reference to
							which furnishes no elucidation. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ely
							however took no notice of the context, but descanted largely upon the
							complicated humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ, a theme with which
							the most learned and accomplished gospel polemic never meddles but he
							finds no evil, in wandering mazes lost.— The Doctor’s afternoon text was
							from Proverbs 11.30.—“and he that winneth souls is wise[”]—omitting the
							first clause of the verse— The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life—
							He said that the word <hi rend="italic">winneth</hi> implied the natural
							depravity of mankind; for it must be some wickedness or evil propensity
							from which the soul was to be won.—and then he discoursed upon the <hi
								rend="italic">wisdom</hi> to be exercised in winning souls from the
							errors of their ways— Now came the atonement, and a slight touch at the
							doctrine of universal Salvation— He said he had not so read his bible.—
							And he undertook to declare with undoubting confidence, how the
							righteous on earth will meet and recognize and enjoy the Society of
							their old acquaintances in heaven—a pretension rather presumptuous.— The
							Doctor’s manner of preaching is agreeable— Without notes— In the style
							of familiar conversation— Not at all ambitious of oratory, without
							figurative ornaments— Argumentative—earnest—copious, without superfluity
							of words.—calmly eloquent, but never transporting—nor transported— The
							house as on the last Sunday was very thin on the morning, but well
							filled in the afternoon— He had been desired to request the members of
							the congregation to remain a few minutes after the service, which they
							did—at this meeting <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Lellan</persRef> proposed that D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Ely
							should be invited to settle as the Pastor of the Church.— It met with
							general assent, and a committee of 3 members was appointed to confer
							with him on the subject— If they can agree with him, notice is to be
							given at the Church next Sunday that an election of a Pastor will be
							held in the course of the then ensuing week. The Doctor is weary of
							Missouri, and peradventure Missouri is weary of him. <persRef
								ref="smith-stephen">Stephen D. Smith</persRef> and passed <persRef

								Freeman</persRef> came this morning, under great excitement— He had
							not been able to see the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>,
							but had received this morning from the Secretary of the Navy <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">Abel P. Upshur</persRef> an order in the harshest
							official style, saying that no change will be made in the stations of
							the Officers of the marine Corps—commanding him to repair to his Post at
							Norfolk and adding that at the end of the month he might renew his
							application for leave of absence if he saw fit. The Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> has certificates from <persRef
								ref="bigelow-jacob">Doctors Bigelow</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jeffries-john2">Jeffries</persRef> of Boston and <persRef
								ref="thompson-abraham">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> of Charlestown would endanger his life, and he
							thinks there is personal malevolence against him among the motives of
							the Secretary: he says that was the impression upon <persRef
								ref="peters-richard2">Richard Peters</persRef> who undertook as
							Freeman’s friend to expostulate with the Secretary in his favour.— The
							Colonel intimated that he might take his own leisure as to the time when
							he would go to Norfolk, and in the meantime would urge earnestly his
							appeal to the President— I advised him to be very cautious to do nothing
							that might be construed into a breach of discipline, remarking that the
							slightest colour of that, would be seized with avidity and turned
							against him. I promised to call immediately upon <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and endeavour to obtain his influence to mitigate
							the prejudices against him— I went accordingly forthwith to the
							Department of State and saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster— I
							returned to him a confidential despatch which he had lent me in January
							last; from <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>, dated
							in November 1842 immediately after the reception in England of the News
							of the Peace with China— And I said I had been much gratified with the
							appointment of Edward Everett as the Minister to China; deeming the
							mission of transcendent importance, and deeming him by his character and
							attainments peculiarly well suited for such a mission— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster appeared to be much delighted, and
							they appeared to be quite unexpected— He immediately said he would be
							greatly obliged to me, if I would write as much to Edward Everett
							himself, which I said I would do with pleasure— He asked me to send the
							Letter to him to-morrow, when the despatches would be made up to go by
							the Great Western, next Thursday. though her arrival at New-York is not
							yet known— After this I spoke to him of the complaint of Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l</hi> Freeman and intreated him to take an
							interest in it, so far as to obtain relief for him if possible; which he
							promised with apparent cordiality— He said he would speak this evening
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upshur and to-morrow morning to the
							President, but it will be to no purpose— Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Freeman was here again this afternoon and said he should go
							for Norfolk to-morrow.— <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> paid us a visit, and

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 20— </p>
						<p>A religious Monomaniac by the name of <persRef ref="miller-william6"
								>Miller</persRef> has been preaching and lecturing and prophesying
							the second advent of Christ and the end of the world or otherwise the
							kingdom of the Saints for many months, and as such insanities are always
							infectious, he has frightened multitudes, some to convulsions and death,
							others into piety and penitence—and many to uneasiness of mind more or
							less disguised— The first prediction was that the general conflagration
							would kindle on the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of April of this
							present year— As the day approaches he has become less precise in the
							indication of time, and announces the Catastrophe, as to be consummated
							on or within one year from that day.— To quicken the sensation of alarm,
							within the last fortnight, the portentous tail of a Comet, some sixty
							degrees in length, has swept the South western horizon, every clear
							evening after the setting of the sun— The nucleus has been here hidden
							behind the disk of that luminary, and has not been seen, though
							paragraphs of distant newspapers aver that it has been seen in broad
							day, near the sun, and in brightness equal to that of the planet Venus—
							My obstinate and inexorable catarrh awoke me this morning before 3. and
							delayed my rising hour till 6— The day was one of uninterrupted leisure
							and yet of no performance— I wrote last a Letter to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> to persuade him to
							accept the mission to China and sent the Letter this day to the
							Department of State.— I read the Message of the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to the Senate of 24. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> last in answer to two of their
							Resolutions, calling for the correspondence relating to the Quintuple
							Treaty, on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1842 The house
							of Representatives at my motion adopted a similar Resolution, including
							a copy of the Treaty—on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of that
							same month John Tyler answered the Resolution, refusing the
							correspondence at that time, declaring a hope and expectation that he
							will find it convenient to communicate it at an early day; and
							containing these words—“In answer to this request, I have to say that
							the treaty mentioned therein has not been officially communicated to the
							Government of the United States, and no authentic copy of it, <hi
								rend="italic">therefore</hi> can be furnished”— In this present
							message to the Senate the first Document is a Letter from <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Cass</persRef>, dated 5. April 1842 in which he
							says—the President has been closely attentive to recent occurrences
							in Europe connected with the treaty of the five powers, of which we
							received a copy soon after its signature in December— Is there an
							escroc in a penitentiary who could match that for prevarication? The
							correspondence between Webster and Cass is tart and curious enough—
								<persRef ref="guizot-francois">Guizot’s</persRef> Letter in answer
							to Cass’s absurd protest is a chef d’oeuvre— I walked to the Office of
							the National Intelligencer and held some conversation with <persRef

							Seaton</persRef>— Whiled away much of the day in assorting papers—</p>

						<p>Another restless, hacking, racking night— I awoke coughing before 3 this
							morning, and lay till a quarter past 4. without sleeping and impatient
							to rise; but for an idle and drowsy day. I walked to the shop of
								<persRef ref="haas-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Haas</persRef> where I found a young man with two ladies his wife
							and her companion whose likenesses he took in a group while I was there—
							He attempted also to take me, but did not succeed, because he said there
							was too much light of the Sun; and I promised to come again to morrow or
							the first fair day between 8 and 9 of the morning. I went to the
							document room, and <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk’s</persRef> Office
							of the House of Representatives, and found a few additional documents,
							of which I took some, but the printing both of journals of the recent
							Session is enormously in arrear; and the House Documents even of the
							Session before the last will not be completed for months— The two
							reports from the Committee of Commerce, on the treatment of coloured
							mariners in our Southern ports are at last delivered, and I addressed
							and despatched about 40 of them to friends in the late 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> and present 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> congressional district of Massachusetts— The
							correspondence about the quintuple Treaty and the right of search.; has
							at once amused and provoked me not a little.— Its illustration of
							character, is admirable— <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Cass’s</persRef>
							protest of 13. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1842. against the
							ratification by France of the Treaty signed and sealed by her own
							Ambassador, is a compound of yankee cunning, of Italian perfidy and of
							French legeraté cemented by shameless profligacy unparalleled in
							American diplomacy— <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler’s</persRef> approval
							of it is at once dishonest, mean, insincere, and hollow-hearted— Cass’s
							correspondence with <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, is
							insolent, inconsistent, sophistical, and prevaricating; and <persRef
								ref="guizot-francois">Guizot’s</persRef> answer of 26. May, to his
							protest of 13. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> is not only a complete
							refutation of its absurd assumptions, but a most contemptuous exposure
							of its glaring falsehood— It is a silent but not the less severe rebuke
							upon President Tyler’s approval of this preposterous counterfeit of a
							State paper.— It is wretchedly printed in the official document, and
							still worse translated— Coming home I met <persRef ref="baldwin-henry"
								>judge Henry Baldwin</persRef> of the U.S. supreme Court who told me
							that he just came from my house where he had called to pay a visit
							before returning home— The Court closed their annual Session yesterday;
							and this afternoon <persRef ref="young-henry">Henry Young</persRef> the
							Crier of the Court came to beg two dollars to save him from starving.—
								<persRef ref="thornton-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

						<p><date>16. III. V:15— </date>Thursday. </p>
						<p>Deep Snow—</p>
						<p>The progress of my Catarrh continues with increasing severity— After a
							foot bath last evening, I was roused from sleep before 3 this morning,
							by a fit of coughing, and after rising for about ten minutes returned to
							bed but not to rest till after 5— According to promise I walked up to
								<persRef ref="haas-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Haas’s</persRef> shop about 9. my hands in woolen lined gloves,
							bitterly pinched with cold. found <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace
								Everett</persRef> there, for the same purpose of being fac simileed.
							Haas took him once, and then with his consent took me three times—the
							second of which he said was very good—for the operation is delicate:
							subject to many imperceptible accidents; and fails at least twice out of
							three times.— I then left them and walked to the Capitol, a flake of
							snow falling here and there as I went. My first visit was to the office
							of the Secretary of the Senate—<persRef ref="dickins-asbury"
								>Dickins</persRef> was not there, but <persRef ref="hickey-william"
								>Hickey</persRef> was.— I asked to see the manuscript documents of
							the Message to the Senate concerning the Quintuple Treaty—especially the
							copy of <persRef ref="guizot-francois">Guizot’s</persRef> Letter to
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Cass</persRef> of 26. May 1842— I found
							that some of the errors in the printed copy were not in the manuscript;
							but other evident errors were— But the greatest and most disreputable
							errors were in the translation. I pointed them all out to Hickey who
							said they must have the document printed over again—but even that will
							not cover the shame of the false translation— From the Secratariat of
							the Senate, I went into the Congress library and returned the first
							volume of Peter Pindar, which I had borrowed—and I found there two other
							books charged to me; for which I must account— Thence I went into the
							military Committee room of the Senate where I found <persRef
								ref="edwards-jonas">J. M. Edwards</persRef>, another Daguerrotype
							likeness taker. I had received last evening a note from him, requesting
							me to come this day or to morrow between 9 and 3, as he wanted my
							likeness for a large picture of the Senate chamber, which he has
							projected and in which the Senators, judges of the Supreme Court, the
							President, and his Cabinet and others may all be assembled— But it was
							now snowing apace— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards said he could
							not take my likeness this day, but asked if I could not stop to be taken
							at New-York on my way home. I declined, and on inspecting many samples
							of the faces he had taken, I was glad to be released from being taken by
							him at all. I travelled through the driving snow to the Office of the
							National Intelligencer, where I saw <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>, and advised him to
							print in his paper the Letter from Guizot to Cass, correctly from the
							original I asked him also for the Intelligencer of the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> containing <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing’s</persRef> speech on the execution of the <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty, to which is
							annexed a copy of the Quintuple Treaty—which he gave me. I made my way
							home through the Snow, which continued to fall the whole day
							through—more than has fallen at one time for many years.</p>

						<p>The Snow fell, about one foot deep on the level and drifted in many

									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Freeman</persRef> whom I had

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> had brought the
							matter before the cabinet, though apparently without success— His own
							explanations had been with <persRef ref="webster-fletcher">Fletcher
								Webster</persRef>, the Secretary’s Son and Chief Clerk, who course
							has reported all the statements to his father—but the Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> has no relaxation from his order to

							as his final reply to the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>; and then his last appeal to the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>— He proposes then to go to
							Norfolk—remain there till the end of this month— Then to renew the
							demand to be restored to the post at Boston, and to return there without
							waiting for further orders— I advised him not to do that, but to wait
							for the President’s answer to his appeal, and if that should be against
							him to remain at Norfolk two or three months till the approach of the
							sickly season, and then to renew the application for removal to a
							northern station— I advised him also to leave out of his applications to
							the Secretary of the Navy and to the President every word that could
							possibly deemed disrespectful— He served in the Constitution frigate in
							the last War with Great-Britain; with <persRef ref="bainbridge-william"

							insupportable. The Doctor came and prescribed for this Night— I keep my
							chamber, and all my plans of studious labour, are indefinitely
							postponed— I read the strange Speech of <persRef ref="clark-john">John
								C. Clark</persRef> on the Bill appropriating 40000 dollars, for
							establishing a diplomatic intercourse with China; which is an invective
							of wormwood and gall against the Secretary of State— He has published it
							in a pamphlet, and it had long been studiously devised— The charges
							against him are stale and hacknied. His Treachery to the whig party, in
							refusing to resign with the other members of the <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> Cabinet in August 1841.—
							His adhesion to Tyler, and jobbing with him for re-election, with a
							condition that Tyler should support him for the succession, but above
							all the Faneuil Hall Speech, were the irremissible sins, for which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke administers this castigation.— I
							thought it in bad taste when delivered— It reads to me now inexpressibly

							Clinton and Livingston school—in comparison with that of <persRef

						<p>Twice up in the night, and convulsed the whole day in casting off phlegm
							from the stomach what a disgusting object to himself is a man? It is
							difficult to contemplate the infirmities of our physical nature
							philosophically— Every thing about sickness is odious to the sufferer

							of nursing friends; but the primary grief and self-reproach to me is the
							loss of time— I am idle— As the hours pass in succession I know, I might
							be working— I brood over projected labours and never commence working—
							As morning dawns, I have a long day before me, and think I shall use it
							to some good purpose— It slips away, I know not how— Approaching

								<persRef ref="clarke-mathew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthew
									S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair Clark</persRef> came to
							visit me, but I was accidently not informed of it, and did not see him.
							After tea, and a game of back-gammon, with <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Louisa</persRef>, and a rubber at whist with the three generations.
								<persRef ref="child-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David Lee
								Child</persRef> came in and spent the evening with me till past 11.
							He brought with him and shewed me an extract of a Letter in Spanish from
							a Mexican Commissioner; at La Guayra, on his way to attend a meeting of
							Envoys from the South American Governments and Mexico, to be held at
							Lima in Peru; and of which I had never before heard— The Letter is
							addressed to <persRef ref="almonte-juan">General Almonte</persRef>, this
							Mexican Minister here, who gave the extract to Child to use it, as he
							might think proper. Almonte had caused to be printed here at the
							commencement of the last Session of Congress two pamphlets, one
							containing the spicy correspondence between the United States and Mexico
							from 12. May to 10 September 1842. and the other entitled Texas,
							consisting of extracts from my address at Braintree, of 17. Sept<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1842, with translations of the same into
							French and Spanish— The Letter from La Guayra, acknowledges the receipt
							of this last pamphlet; speaks of the address in terms of high
							commendation, and says he will transmit it to the principal cities of
							the several South American Republics for circulation there— Childs
							further told me, that in the month of January last, <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> actually proposed to Almonte
							a cession to the United States by Mexico of a portion of territory on
							the pacific Ocean, including the Port of San Francisco: so as to allow
							the British Government to stretch their territory down to the mouth of
							the Columbia river.— This is a ray of light—serving to explain Webster’s
							desire that <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>
							should go to China, and he himself to England. Child says Almonte told
							him that Mexico had no disposition to part with any portion of her
							territory.— Webster’s political profligacy is gigantic.</p>

						<p>I have this day been debarred by my disease from the privilege of

							intermitted the duty of that attendance— Of this I charge myself
							especially when in Holland, in Berlin, in S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Petersburg, and last in France— I have lost by it rich
							opportunities of obtaining instruction; not only religious, but worldly,
							moral, political, intellectual— For this I blame myself; but the
							importance of regular attendance upon the duties of the Christian
							Sabbath in social communion has impressed itself more deeply on my mind
							in proportion as I have advanced in years.— I had neglected to become a
							member of the church, till after the decease of <persRef

							regret I have at all times been a sincere believer in the existence of a

							mission of the crucified saviour, proclaiming immortal life and
							preaching peace on earth, good will to men, the natural equality of all

							omnipotent Spirit, I entertain involuntary and agonizing doubts, which I
							can neither silence nor expel, and against which I need for my own
							comfort to be fortified and sustained, by stated and frequent
							opportunities of receiving religious admonition and instruction— I feel
							myself to be a frequent sinner before God; and I need to be often
							admonished of it and exhorted to virtue. This is administered in all the
							forms of Christian worship, and I am sure of receive it with whatever
							denomination of Christian worshippers I associate to obtain it— Of late
							years I have deemed it my duty to attend the weekly morning performances
							of the Chaplains of Congress in the Hall of the House of
							Represenentatives; and I hold pews at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							John’s episcopal church and at the second Presbyterian church, at which
							I attend alternately when Congress are not in session, and in the
							afternoon when they are— This forms a regular portion of my habits of
							life, and I cannot feel the privation of it without painful sensibility—
							My time hung heavy upon my hands. <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H.
								Adams</persRef> dined with us and <persRef ref="cutts-richard2"
								>Richard D Cutts</persRef> was here in the afternoon.— After tea my

								<persRef ref="pericles">Pericles</persRef>, and some pages in
								<persRef ref="maxcy-virgil">Virgil Maxcy’s</persRef> life of
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef>— The contrast
							between an antient, and a modern Statesman— I have also been reading a

						<p>Extract from <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles</persRef> Register of
							March 11. 1843. In a debate in the British house of Peers<space/>Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1843. upon the <persRef ref="victoria"
								>Queen’s</persRef> speech, the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke
								of Wellington</persRef> spoke of the War and its origin. In answer
							to the <persRef ref="pettyfitzmaurice-henry">Marquis of
								Lansdown</persRef> he said; [“]I beg the noble marquis to recollect
							that I was almost the only individual in this house who stated that the
							real ground of complaint against the Chinese government was its conduct
							towards persons employed in the service of her majesty and representing
							her majesty, upon the occasion when a motion upon the subject was made
							by my noble friend near me. I was almost the only person in the house
							who defended her majesty’s servants in China, and I say the war was a
							just and a proper one on the part of her majesty’s government. (Cheers.)
							I go further and I say, that if it had been a War solely on the score of
							the robbery of the Opium, finding that her majesty’s Government was
							engaged in that War, and finding that the interest, and honour of the
							country were involved in that war, I should have considered it my duty,
							to make every effort to carry it on with the best means.”</p>
						<p>My distempered, secluded and confined condition has left me no
							interesting occurrences for the materials of a Diary record, and
							despondency creeping over me threatens the disruption of this journal to
							be resumed only when my unclouded reason shall return to me by the will
							of the supreme disposer. The above extract from a Speech of the Duke of
							Wellington I have copied to keep on hand, in defence of my roughly
							handled Lecture of Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1841. on the War
							between Great Britain and China— This day I find in a subsequent number
							of Niles Register, that of last Saturday Reports of a Speech of <persRef
								ref="brougham-henry2">Lord Brougham</persRef> on the Right of Search
							and our abortive Treaty with England of 1824—and of long debates in the
							French Legislative chambers recently resumed on the right of Search,
							between France and England; their treaties of 1831 and 1833, and the
							quintuple Treaty of 20 December 1841. yet unratified by France— There is
							much matter for curious observation and grave meditation on these recent
							controversies relating to the right of visitation and of search— Would
							it not be well to enquire into the right of maritime visitation and
							search, 1. by the Law of Nature? 2. by the practice of Antient Nations
							and as modified by the practice of piracy 3. By the practices of modern
							Nations, as modified by the doctrine of the mere clausum— 4. The new
							question started by the Negotiations of Great Britain to obtain the
							right the right of search for the suppression of the African Slave
							trade— 5. To mark the mistakes of both parties in precision of ideas
							bearing on the subject 6. The motives to dissension 7. The pretexts for
							opposition. 8 the political bearings of the subject— I received also
							this day a Letter from <persRef ref="beasley-reuben">R. G.
								Beasley</persRef>, at Havre 24 Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>
							1843. with a pamphlet, to decry the English emancipation of Slaves, by

						<p>Still confined to the house, and under medical discipline Having
							undertaken to produce a general perspiration last night, by a warm foot

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howard</persRef> of
							New-York were morning visitors—Strangers— Merely wishing to see me— And
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch</persRef>, my cousin my
							boy companion, school and college mate and friend, came to compare notes
							of decrepitude between us.— The judge is my junior by two years, but
							suffers by the infirmity of years still more than I, and the sight of
							him is one of those admonitions which multiply upon me, and which I
							struggle in vain to discard— The controversy between <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, about the <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty, the rights of

							the zodiacal light and the <persRef ref="miller-william6"
								>Millerite</persRef> prediction of the second advent of Christ, and
							the end of the world within five weeks from this day continue to absorb
							much of the public and of my attention.— The intelligencer of this day
							announces another Letter from Cass to Webster who in his last Letter
							declares the correspondence closed— This strange correspondence— The
							debates in the French Legislative chambers, and in both houses of the
							British Parliament and in both houses of Congress but especially in the
							Senate— This Slave trade and right of search complicated with the
							quintuple Treaty, with Texas—Mexico, California, Oregon, and the next
							Presidential election, breed teeming fancies in my brain till I grope to
							find my way out of the thicket— I looked up this afternoon <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun’s</persRef> 3. Resolutions of the
							U.S. Senate of 4. March 15. April 1840. the preposterous claims of
							indemnity for the liberated slaves of the Enterprize—voted unanimously
							by 22 slave breeders and 11 craven democrats—with 15 more craven spirits
								<hi rend="italic">absent</hi>, skulking from the questions upon
							which they dared not vote either yea or nay. I looked also into <persRef
								ref="ward-robert">Ward</persRef> and <persRef ref="vattel-emer"
								>Vattel</persRef> to ascertain the right of visitation and search
							upon the Ocean.— The right of visitation is by the Law of Nature, an
							intercourse of mutual benefit, like that of strangers meeting in a
							wilderness— The right of search is for pirates in peace and for enemies
							in War— But I must look into the Mare Clausum and the Mare liberum. The
							right of property in the Ocean and upon the shores— Its extent and its
							limitations— And especially remember that—the present disputes about the
							right of search are all now questions all originating in the measures
							devised by the British Government for the suppression of the Slave
							trade— Night coming on arrested me in my consultations of Ward and
							Vattel, and in my search to trace the fortune of the claim for indemnity
							for the slaves of the Enterprize, from its belligerent claim by Calhoun
							in March 1840 to its tacit surrender, merged in the Negotiations of the
							Ashburton Treaty, and the more critical case of the Creole— <persRef

						<p>The progress of my disease is obviously much affected by the various

							walked to the Capitol for exercise, my practice of which has for the

							impairing of my health— I walked from the Capitol to the National
							Intelligencer Office, and afterwards thence home, last Thursday, through
							the severest Snow-storm that has been witnessed here, for perhaps seven
							years— Having then upon me a racking catarrh of several weeks standing.
							I have been confined from that day to the house: against my own will,
							for I should have preferred to be two or three hours of every day
							abroad, and the average of the weather has marked the temperature of
							January rather than that of March.— Last Night, and this day it had
							become milder, and was approaching the spring like; the masses of
							drifted snow in the Streets gradually settling into puddles, till about
							noon; when a sudden turn brought back the Northwester with another
							flight of snow; and then a clear sky, a bright Moon, a brisk gale, and a
							hard frost. I still keep house. <persRef ref="freeman-william">Col<hi

							An outrage upon Law, Justice, humanity, and all the principles of
							freedom, defeated in the last Congress and to be perpetrated in the
							next.— I reviewed also the two Volumes of Documents relating to Texas
							and Mexico—with reference to the late invasion of California, to the
							defeated bill for the occupation of the Territory of Oregon, and to the
							future Negotiations with England—upon all which I have much to learn, to

						<p>Another Letter from <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass</persRef> to

								<persRef ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty, the
							right of visitation and search, and the offended dignity of the

							State in the previous part of this correspondence— I am thinking if
							there is any thing parallel to this correspondence in our diplomatic
							history. <persRef ref="deane-silas">Silas Deane</persRef> came home from
							France and made a rumpus (that word is not in <persRef
								ref="webster-noah">Webster’s</persRef> Dictionary—what a pity!) for
							several years; blew up a flame which kept this union long in a phease
							(another Websterless word) and has left a large claim of his heirs and
							legal representatives, against the United States of which not a dollar
							is due, but which on some lucky day they will recover— <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James

								>President Washington</persRef>, through <persRef
								ref="pickering-timothy">Timothy Pickering</persRef>, wire worked by
								<persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe published a volume of his
							correspondence—against the administration of Washington by whom he had
							been appointed and recalled—which book largely contributed to the fall
							of Washington’s Administration as continued by his successor— It helped
							to bring in the <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>
							Administration, which laid the foundation for the dissolution of the
							Union. Cass and Webster are both New-Hampshire adventurers, who have
							made their way in the world, by mere dint of talents, <persRef
								ref="figaro">Figaro</persRef> fashion, making a trade of politics,
							and a Lottery prize of their Country— Cass has got along by a series of
							Executive appointments, from Marshal of Ohio in March 1807 and 11.
							Colonel and Brigadier General in 1813. Governor of Michigan in 1814 and
							continued untill appointed Secretary of War in 1833 and Minister to
							France in 1836. While Governor of Michigan, by successful land jobbing
							he is said to have realized a fortune of more than 800000 dollars, which
							on the occasion of his mission to France he withdrew from the falling
							chances of speculation, and which has enabled him to live in France in
							the Style of an Ambassador, and to ingratiate himself with <persRef
								ref="louis-philippe">Louis Philippe</persRef>, which he had done by
							servile sycophancy till this protest of 13. Feb<hi rend="superscript"
								>y.</hi> a perfect <persRef ref="joab">Joab</persRef>-like stab
							under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> rib, as perfidious towards
							Louis Philippe and his Minister <persRef ref="guizot-francois"
								>Guizot</persRef>, as it was rash and desperate, with regard to his
							own Country, and hollow-hearted and treacherous as a man.— Webster too
							has the soul and manners of a parvenu. In this controversy Cass is
							outrageously wrong from beginning to end: but in permitting <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> to approve Cass’s protest, Webster
							put into Cass’s hand a scourge which Cass now plies against him with
							merciless dexterity.— The fragment end of the 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> column of the National Intelligencer is a short note from
							Webster to Cass repelling <hi rend="italic">an imputation</hi> that he
							had reserved his fire till after Cass was gone home and sent the shot
							after him— Webster says the President has directed that the
							correspondence here after must not be official— Cass sent three copies
							of this enormous lampoon at once; one to Webster himself, one to the
							Globe and one to the National Intelligencer; the two last for
							publication— The life of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.
								Calhoun</persRef> cooled me down, and <persRef

						<p>Eighth day of confinement to the house, and of time if not entirely
							wasted; lost for the purposes to which I had devoted it, and leaving a
							blank for all useful purposes— I intended to have called this morning at
							the Department of State; but I wasted so much time in looking up the
							traces of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> Negotiations
							with Mexico for Texas and San Francisco that the hour for visiting the
							public offices upon business passed away, and I must wait another day.—
								<persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler’s</persRef> mission to
							Mexico was chiefly to obtain the cession of Texas— His Letter to Jackson
							dated Mexico 15. April 1830. (Omnibus 3. 323) contains the first promise
							of success— His next Letter of 25 May 1831. (p. 381.) is apologetic and
							less encouraging.— The next despatch of 16. July 1832. to the then
							Secretary of State <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Livingston</persRef>
							encloses minutes of two conversations of Butler with the Mexican
							Secretary of State <persRef ref="alaman-lucas">Alaman</persRef>, after
							which a written proposition dated 15 July 1832. was delivered to Alaman,
							but has never been made public— From that time till 26. February 1835—
							Butler was mistifying Jackson, as he boasted he was doing with Alaman,
							promising nothing, but leaving him not without hopes. The Letter of 26.
							February 1835. (p. 555—) is the crowning mystification; about 2 months
							after which Butler came to Washington where on the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June he made his proposals— They also
							are among the missing papers— There are two subsequent instructions from
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">John Forsyth</persRef> Secretary of
							State to Butler of 2 July and 6. Aug<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> 1835—
							In the first of which he is told that from his own accounts no
							confidence is entertained of the success of his negotiation: but that as
							he is sangwine of succeeding in a very short time he may go and try his
							luck again—but that he must despatch his whole business with expedition
							and have the result ready to be laid before Congress by the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of December then next— And that it is
							expected he will himself immediately after return home. He goes
							accordingly back to Mexico— Writes two <unclear>dalling</unclear> despatches to notify
							that he cannot finish his business in quite so short a time as he had
							expected; and on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1836
							(p. 573) receives notice dated 16 December 1835 apprizing him that he
							has been superseded by the appointment of another person— It was in a
							despatch of 6. Aug<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> 1835. That Forsyth
							instructed him to propose the Rio Bravo to the 37<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> parallel of Latitude, and along that parallel to the
							pacific—the main object being to secure within our limits the whole Bay
							of San Fransisco.— Butler tells him he has mistaken the Geography, and
							that the place he means in called Puerto Antonio Nuevo, within which is
							a Small town called San Francisco—and this is the San Francisco, for

							debates in both Houses of the British Parliament and both chambers of
							the French Legislature upon the right of Search; and especially to a
							speech of <persRef ref="brougham-henry2">Lord Brougham</persRef> on the
								7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month in the British house
							of peers contesting statements just before made by <persRef
								ref="dupin-andre">Monsieur Dupin</persRef> in the French Chamber of
							Deputies concerning this identical Convention— The main object of the
							Article is to show, that the Senate of 1824 did in the most unequivocal
							manner concede this right of search— It gives the yeas and nays in the
							Senate on the question of advice and consent, with the names of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">A. Jackson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef> in the affirmative— I
							asked to see the manuscript copy transmitted by <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">General Cass</persRef> to the Department of
								<persRef ref="guizot-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Guizot’s</persRef> Letter of 25. May 1842 to him, in answer to his
							protest of 13. February; and he made up a packet of it; with a despatch
							to <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> prepared, but
							not yet forwarded, to be read to <persRef ref="gordon-george">Lord
								Aberdeen</persRef> and a copy of it to be furnished him if he
							desires it: being the quip modest, to the Letter from Lord Aberdeen,
							which <persRef ref="fox-henry3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fox</persRef> by his order read to Webster in his Office about a
							month ago— This despatch to Everett is in Webster’s best style, and
							makes a direct issue with Lord Aberdeen and <persRef ref="peel-robert"
								>Sir Robert Peel</persRef> on the point that there is by the Laws of
							Nations no clear, explicit and avowed distinction between the right of
							visitation, and the right of search. Also a long Letter of Instructions
							dated 15 March 1843. to <persRef ref="perry-matthew">Commodore Matthew
								C. Perry</persRef>, going out as commander of the eighty gun
							squadron to be kept on the coast of Africa— To these he added the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> volume of <persRef ref="wheaton-henry"
								>Wheaton’s</persRef> Reports containing the adjudged case of the
							Mariana Flora in 1826— I spoke of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
							Cass’s recent outbreaks against him, but he did not appear inclined to
							discourse upon that subject— It was clear he remembered the Call of the
							house of the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June last year for
							copies of the Quintuple Treaty with Cass’s Correspondence, and the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> refusal of them on
							the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> It is curious that Cass’s despatch
							with Guizot’s answer to the protest, was received on the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of June— I spoke of the Senate Bill for
							the occupation of the Oregon Territory, of <persRef ref="jones-thomas"
								>Ap-Catesby Jones’s</persRef> exploit at Monterey; of the movements
							in and about Texas, and I suddenly asked him if <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> had been instructed to
							negotiate for the acquisition of California— He faltered and said he did
							not know whether he could answer that question consistently with his
							official duty— I told him his declining to answer was answer enough for
							me, and we had warm and almost, not quite, angry words— I kept my
							temper, but pressed him more closely upon his declining to answer <pb
								n="465" type="ms"/>answer my question, than was comfortable to him—
							He had begun by professing profound confidence in me—and in
							communicating his own instruction to Edward Everett, and <persRef
								ref="upshur-abel">Upshur’s</persRef> to Commodore Matthew C. Perry,
							had said he would open to me Administra Secrets— Why he should now stop
							short and roll himself up in mystery upon the plea of official duty he
							did not explain— I saw he was deceiving me, and the danger of trusting
							him, and that it behooved me above all things to be upon my guard. I
							said I would not press him to divulge any administration secret that he
							was inclined to withhold— That he had volunteered the confidence of
							administration secrets; and I could not see why they should be tendered
							on one point of the system of foreign affairs and denied on another— I
							considered all the questions about the right of search—the bill for the
							occupation of the Oregon territory. Captain Jones’s movement on
							Calefornia, and all the movements for the annexation of Texas, were
							parts of one great system looking to a War for conquest and plunder from
							Mexico, and a War with England—and alliance with France— And I referred
							to <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> Speech of 14. April last
							avowing this project of a War with Mexico for conquest and plunder
							together with a War with Great Britain— I said Wise had blabed the whole
							project last April; and it could not pass without notice that that same
							Henry A. Wise had in the last hours of the late session of Congress been
							three times nominated to the Senate as Minister to France. It was also
							not less remarkable that Wise had been the confidential correspondent of
							Commodore Jones and had stated on the floor of the house that he had
							received from Jones himself a Letter in justification of his occupation
							of Monterey— Webster said I was wrong in all this— That Jones’s movement
							on Calefornia, was a freak of his own brain without any authority or
							instruction whatever That Wise’s speech (<hi rend="italic">of</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">which</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">he</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">had</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">no</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>) was a vain and senseless bravado— That
							with regard to the annexation of Texas, his decided opinion against the
							measure had long been public—he had not changed it, and it never could
							be effected by him, or with his consent.— I replied with warmth, till at
							last he told me that he had talked over the Oregon question with
								<persRef ref="baring-alexander">Lord Ashburton</persRef>— That
							England wanted to come down on the Coast of the Pacific, to the mouth of
							the Columbia river— And that the question had been put to him, whether
							if a cession from Mexico South of our present boundary 42, to include
							the Port of San Francisco could be obtained, England would make any
							objection to it—and Lord Ashburton thought she would not— I thanked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, for thus much of communication,
							and said I would now press the enquiry no further— I propose to visit
							the Department again next Monday.— But what an abyme of duplicity? We
							had a very small take leave evening party to <persRef
								ref="roosevelt-james;roosevelt-cornelia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Roosevelt</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="seaton-sarah2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

						<p>At the second Presbyterian church this morning the <persRef
								ref="gurley-r">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> R. R.
								Gurley</persRef> Secretary of the Colonization Society, preached
							from Luke 17.20. [“]And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the
							kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of
							God cometh not with observation: 21. Neither shall they say, Lo here! or
							Lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”— The discourse
							had a slight allusion to a popular panic extensively prevailing at this
							time and in this Country—raised and propagated by a man named <persRef
								ref="miller-william6">William Miller</persRef>; who by a profound
							study of the bible prophesies has patched up a prediction of his own,
							that the end of the world is at hand— I have received I know not from
							whom several pamphlets and hand bills on this subject and among them a
							small duodecimo Volume entitled Evidence from Scripture and History of
							the second coming of Christ about the year 1843. exhibited in a course
							of Lectures, by William Miller. The Lectures are 19. in number, and have
							been repeatedly delivered by Miller in various parts of this Country— On
							the covering page of the Book is a printed notice that the Vision began
							457. years B.C. and ends in 1843.— There is in the book a profuse
							expenditure of ingenuity of close logic, of biblical criticism, of
							sacred and profane history; like the Russian palace of ice, built to
							celebrate a marriage of dwarfs— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gurley
							did not make much of his text; nor is it very clear what is meant by the
							kingdom of God, in this passage— It would seem to be the same thing as
							the days of the Son of man, afterwards repeatedly used in the same
							chapter— But the close of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
							verse—the kingdom of God is within you, seems to have no connection
							whatever with the second advent of Christ— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gurley gave notice that there would be no service at that
							church this afternoon; and I collected from his prayer, that the
							congregation have given a call to <persRef ref="ely-ezra">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Ezra Stiles Ely</persRef>, which he
							has accepted— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for the fourth Sunday in
							Lent, and preached from Isaiah 30.26. [“]Moreover the light of the moon
							shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
							sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth
							up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound” It
							is not always easy to discern the connection between M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s text and his discourse, nor
							especially his propensity to select his texts from the Book of Isaiah—
							This Chapter itself and the text as a part of it is abundantly obscure—
							It begins with imprecations against the people of Judah who relied upon
							the aid of the Egyptians, to protect them from being conquered and
							oppressed by the Assyrians; and finished by a dark prediction of
							redemption from the Assyrian yoke— And a declaration that Tophet is
							ordained of old—for the king—deep and large—the pile, fire and much
							wood—and the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone kindles it—
							This is generally understood to be the Bible description of Hell; but
							who can form a distinct conception of what it is.— Certainly not the
							place nor the condition adverted to in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley’s text— My time was much absorbed in recording the double diary
							of yesterday, much of my conversation with <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>D. Webster</persRef> being omitted.</p>

						<p>The <persRef ref="weems-jesse">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi

							this morning to request of me a certificate of facts relating to a
							controversy between him and <persRef ref="weaver-william">William A.
								Weaver</persRef>, who was the superintendent clerk at the Department
							of State for printing the census. Weaver, under cover of this
							appointment to superintend the printing of the census had undertaken a
							private job to prepare a compendium or abridgment of it for which he had
							contracted with <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef> that they should pay him
							3500 dollars. On the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1841. The
							House of Representatives at my motion passed a Resolution calling on the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for a return of the
							aggregates by Counties and Cities— I called at the Department of State,
							where Weavers work as far as it was finished was shewn to me by <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster’s</persRef> order, and I said that was what I wanted and I
							was told it was nearly finished— But no answer to the Resolution was
							returned by the President, at that Session, nor until the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1842. when a Report from the
							Secretary of State, with a totally different document was sent to the
							House— Weems had told me that Weaver was secretly bargaining with Blair
							and Rives to give the printing of the document unlawfully to Blair and
							Rives, and wished me to insist with the Secretary of State that the
							printing should be done by <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> the Printers of the
							house; but not chusing to meddle with that question I declined speaking
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster about it— Weaver succeeded in
							his bargain of plunder with Blair and Rives— <persRef
								ref="allen-thomas5">Thomas Allen</persRef> the Printer of the Senate
							screwed out of Webster another bargain for printing the same
							document—and counter memorials and a select Committee of investigation,
							and scurrilous counter pamphlets will, terminate by payment of all the
							printers bills, and the complete fleecing of the public— Weems says that
							Weaver has falsified the printing of his testimony before the
							investigating committee and then presented his own falsification as
							evidence to support a charge against Weems of perjury before the grand
							jury.— He asked me again for a certificate, which I promised to write,
							and to have ready for him to-morrow— I called at the Department of
							State, and returned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster his Letter
							of Instructions to <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward

								>Louis Philippe</persRef> the king of the French, setting forth
							certain services of relief, kindness and humanity which in the year 1813
							to numerous French Officers returning from the wreck of <persRef

								>Niles</persRef> Register published in 1820. containing a narrative
							of these transactions and bearing the most authentic and unqualified
							testimony to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell’s services at that
							time, at considerable inconvenience and expence to himself— He said that
							he had recently met with so many misfortunes in his private concerns
							that he was reduced to great distress, and had been advised by some of
							his friends, particularly by <persRef ref="smith-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Spear Smith</persRef>, to address
							this memorial to the king of France, who upon this state of facts would
							feel himself under obligations to remunerate those services.— I told him
							that I would very cheerfully give him a Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pageot; but that I could scarcely say I
							was acquainted with him— There was no personal intercourse between him
							and me, and had been none between his predecessor <persRef
								ref="fourier-louis">Bacourt</persRef> and me, since I questioned in
							a public Lecture, Louis Philippe’s title to the crown— This fact I knew
							had been reported to the king, and therefore a Letter of recommendation
							from me would do him harm rather than good— Connell did not seem to be
							satisfied, but did not insist— My morning wasted away till it was near
							2. O’Clock P.M before I reached the Department, and immediately went
							into <persRef ref="hunter-william7">Hunter’s</persRef> chamber. I made
							an abstract of the Letter from <persRef ref="slacum-william">William A.
								Slacum</persRef> a purser in the Navy, (since deceased,) to the
							Secretary of State <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, dated
							Alexandria 1. August 1835.— This was the Letter which kindled the

							the 37<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> line of Latitude from the river
							Arkansas to the South Sea—to include the river and Bay of San

								ref="butler-anthony">Butler</persRef> of 6. Aug<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> 1835. authorizing him to offer 500000
							dollars more, than he had received authority to offer before.— There is
							another long Letter from Slacum, relating to the commerce of the several
							South American States— Both prove him to have been an observing man— I
							had not time to begin the abstract of Butler’s Letter to Forsyth of 17
							June 1835— The substance of which is a proposal to purchase the cession
							of Texas by bribing a priest named <persRef ref="hernandez-ignacio"
								>Ygnacio Hernandez</persRef> with 500000 dollars, and he encloses a
							note signed Hernandez assuring him that with 500000 (he says not what)
							he will certainly obtain his object— There is an endorsement on this

						<p>The months of January and March for the present year 1843. changed places
							in the atmosphere, the first having been so springlike, that the buds on
							the fruit trees were bursting into blossom, and I remember no month of
							January at Washington so frost benumbed and snow clad as has been this
							expiring month of March— This day however it relented, and seems
							preparing according to its proverbial character to go out like a lamb.
							My cough is apparently subsiding, but my plan of occupation is broken
							up, and I am irretrievably spellbound in idleness— The day was fair and
							the temperature mild; but my vis inertiae so insuperable that it was
							near one when I got to <persRef ref="hunter-william7">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter’s</persRef> chamber at the
							Department of State— I took up again the Volume of <persRef
								ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler’s</persRef> despatches to the
							Department of State and to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef> during his mission to Mexico, and began the
							abstract of his Letter to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>
							of 17. June 1835.— But I made little progress, my attention being
							diverted from that Letter to other parts of the correspondence, and to
							the reading of numerous other Letters— I found that I could not
							understand the subject thoroughly but by a rigorous chronological
							examination of all the documents— The appetite for Texas was from the
							first a Western passion, stimulated by no one more greedily than by
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>.— He had denounced
							the Florida Treaty for fixing the boundary at the Sabine; and held and
							preached the doctrine that we should have insisted upon our shadow of a
							claim to the Rio del Norte— <persRef key="monroe-james">President
								Monroe</persRef> actually preferred the line of the Sabine, thinking
							that the extension of the boundary woaken us for defence— And Jackson
							expressly approved the line of the Sabine— The first act of the Mexican
							Government after declaring their Independence was to claim the boundary
							as settled by the Florida Treaty and we had consented to it. But with
							the commencement of my administration I appointed <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef> Minister to Mexico and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay instructed him to propose the
							purchase of Texas— This they declined but two years after the
							proposition was renewed— They then rejected it resentfully.— But Jackson
							was so sharp set for Texas, that from the first year of his
							administration, he set his double engines to work of negotiating to buy
							Texas with one hand and instigating the people of that province to
							revolt against Mexico with the other <persRef ref="houston-samuel"
								>Houston</persRef> was his Agent for the rebellion, and Anthony
							Butler, a Mississippi Land-jobber in Texas, for the purchase— Butler
							kept him five years on the tenter hooks of expectation—negotiating,
							wheedling, promising and finally boasting that he had secured the
							bargain by bribing a priest with half a million of dollars— Jackson at
							last found him out and dismissed him rather abruptly. But he carried off
							some of the most important documents of the negotiation— They exchanged
							the ratifications of a new convention this day at the Department of
							State. <persRef ref="child-david">D. L. Child</persRef> spent the

							Resolutions in Committee and was at his request excused from voting on
							them in the house because they did not contain the exception. The
							Message adverting to the omission of the exception, assumes a
							discretionary power in the executive to with hold any documents called
							for by Resolution of the house, but says that in this case all are given
							because he sees no necessity for withholding any.— I believe that at the
							next Session of Congress, it will be my duty to move some action of
							Congress on this document, though I have no hope of succeeding in that
							or in any thing else— Never in my life was there such an array of
							discouragement before— Never despair!— Returning from the capitol I
							stop’d at the National Intelligencer Office and obtained from <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">W. W. Seaton</persRef> the four papers
							containing the correspondence relating to <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Cass’s</persRef> protest against the ratification of the Quintuple
							Treaty; and the subsequent controversy between Cass and <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> about the <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty— After my return
							home, a dull headache, and overpowering lassitude disabled me for the
							rest of the day, till late in the evening when I made out to finish a
							statement for <persRef ref="weems-jesse">Jesse E. Weems</persRef>, about
							my call for the aggregates of the census returns, and the rascally job,
							perpetrated between <persRef ref="weaver-william">William A.
								Weaver</persRef> and <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef> for the printing of the
							compendium.— I received a Letter from <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>, with a note from the
							Miller <persRef ref="u">Speakman</persRef>, informing me that the snow
							and rainstorm of Tuesday Night carried away the milldam, and that of
							course the rent from that day ceases— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> received also a
							Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">our Son</persRef> dated that
							same Tuesday Evening at Stonington where he had been with <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> since the Evening before,
							detained by the storm— She was coming here—but from fear of embarking on
							the Sound, they concluded to return the next morning to Boston.</p>

						<p>A person by the name of <persRef ref="russell-fa">Russell</persRef>, an
							inventor of some astronomical instrument came and requested of me a
							certificate of its usefulness. He had some time last year brought it to
							my house and exhibited it to me, but I did not understand its mechanism
							or its operation sufficiently to judge of its usefulness— I declined
							giving him a certificate upon my general rule— He had one from the
								<persRef ref="ely-ezra">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ezra Stiles Ely</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="child-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Child</persRef> was
							here this morning; and I gave him a copy of the reprinted Executive
							Documents N. 40 and 42 of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Session
							of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> congress 1837. containing the
							most important papers of our relations with Mexico and Texas. I desired
							him to ascertain from <persRef ref="almonte-juan">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Almonte</persRef> whether the paper
							delivered by <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="alaman-lucas">Lucas Alaman</persRef>, on the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July 1832, and another paper
							afterwards delivered by Butler to <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa
								Anna</persRef>, and never answered by him are not among the Archives
							of the Mexican Government, and if they are to obtain copies of them— I
							requested him also to endeavour to procure the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Louis Newspapers containing <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Benton’s</persRef> Essays under the signatures of Americanus and La
							Salle in 1829. which he promised to do. I called to see <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson</persRef>, who is afflicted with a paralytic disease; the
							issue of which may occur from hour to hour, and yet may linger along for
							years— Thence I went to the Department of State, and put into the hands
							of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> the last Letter received from <persRef
								ref="flugel-johann">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flügel</persRef>
							of 25. November last, imploring my aid to obtain an allowance of his
							charges in an account for expences not authorised by Law, but which he
							was ill able to bear, and had incurred without knowing that they were
							not allowable.— I told him that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flügel
							was an entire Stranger to me, but that <persRef ref="wheaton-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheaton</persRef> had recommended him
							to me, as a very poor but respectable man of Letters— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster took the papers and said he would
							see what he could do for the Doctor— He sent me also the London Globe
							and Times Newspapers received down to the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> of this Month— We said something about the North eastern
							boundary maps, and I mentioned one to him as being in the Department
							which he had not seen. I then passed into <persRef ref="hunter-william7"
								>Hunter’s</persRef> chamber, and made a short further abstract from
							Anthony Butler’s Letter to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">John
								Forsyth</persRef> of 17. June 1835— Hunter had the first number of a
							Texan Newspaper Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> last. containing a list
							of the members of the Executive Government— Also a list of the Masonic
							Government— A Royal Arch Chapter, of which Anthony Butler is the Grand
							High Priest. Without finishing my abstract, I came home at 4 O’Clock in
							the Rain which continued steadily all the afternoon and evening.
								<persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef> was here, and
							also <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef>— This afternoon
								<persRef ref="morsell-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richard I. Morsell</persRef> came and made his annual payment of 300
							dollars for the purchase of the house and lot in square 214— In the
							Evening <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-mary4">her
								daughter</persRef> read for me in the London Globe of 1. March a
							curious debate in the house of Commons on the subject of education.</p>
