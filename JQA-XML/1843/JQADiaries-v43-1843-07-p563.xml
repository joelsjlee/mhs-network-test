						<p>Sun rose 4:26. Set. 7.10.</p>
						<p>In ranging round my grounds every morning, not a day passes, but I meet
							with some new phenomenon of vegetation, the observation of which ought
							to be accompanied and immediately followed by examination and
							meditation— It never is, and however mortifying to my self-conceit it
							may be, I am constrained to confess that the faculty of combining ideas
							and brooding over them till they fructify, <unclear>hasn</unclear> if not totally denied
							to me, imparted in scanty measure.— I took <persRef ref="kirk-john">John
								Kirk</persRef> round my seedling nurseries this morning and shewed
							him the trees that are, and those that are not to be taken up— I have
							now from the acorn, the black, white, red, and chesnut Oaks of
							considerable size, besides the English white Oaks which bear acorns in
							profusion. None of the native trees have yet borne fruit— Our red
							cherries are now so far ripened that we had yesterday and this day tarts
							made of them— The trees throw up suckers which bear transplanting and
							are of rapid growth, but I have never raised a cherry, except the
							mazzard, or a plum from the stone— This day there was a very light
							easterly breeze which made the day comfortable. I wrote further upon my
							Letter to Bangor, but did not finish it— Read a chapter in <persRef
								ref="ware-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ware’s</persRef>
							inquiry. His second chapter is on the sources from which the proofs of
							Religion and its truths are to be drawn.— These are Nature, and
							Revelation.— “The being of God, including all his attributes—the moral
							government of God, and a future life of righteous retribution”— To these
							articles may be reduced, and in them included—[“]all that we know of
							religion by the light of Nature.”— Creation is indeed to the mind of man
							evidence of a creator—but is it evidence of his moral government— This
							is not clear— Still less is it evidence of future righteous retribution—
							The visible creation evinces order—but not moral government, or future
							retribution— In the progress of human reason man conceives the idea of
							justice; and the family relations teach sympathy— With the idea of God
							therefore is connected in one indissoluble chain those of power, justice
							and mercy; and from them are deduced those of moral government and
							future retribution— Still the continued existence of man after death is
							so contrary to all the evidence of the senses, that it must rest forever
							on the pillars of Faith— I have too long intermitted the monthly summary
							of my daily occupations— In the month of June just expired I have risen
							at an earlier average than 4— Go up the hill to see the Sunrise from the
							South-east corner of <persRef key="adams-charles2">my son’s</persRef>
							house with one of the most magnificent spectacles of nature in the
							scenery before me— I then loiter about my grounds two hours or more.
							Return to my chamber and receive the mail except on Sundays. Breakfast
							at 8. Read newspapers and Letters, and write till 1/2 past 2.
							dine—Siesta—ride with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">my
								daughter</persRef> in the carriage—up the hill to see the Sunset— No
							Evening</p>

						<p>Sun rose 4.27 Set 7:40. beclouded</p>
						<p>A day of intense heat. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> who has been with
								<persRef ref="lunt-ellen">his wife</persRef> upon a fortnights
							excursion into the Country returned home yesterday, and preached this
							morning from Ephesians 6 13 “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of
							God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done
							all, to stand.” The discourse was a very earnest exhortation, to resist
							all manner of temptation— It was a very serious and sensible
							dissertation upon a duty which every Christian is called very frequently
							called to perform— The Lord’s prayer supplicates the almighty not to
							lead us into temptation; which implies that temptation itself comes from
							the agency of God himself, and seems to imply that from the weakness and
							frailty of our Nature we are not able to resist a temptation when it
							comes.— The Scripture says that the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh,
							and in another place that the Lord gave the children of Israel Statutes
							that were not good. But if the Lord leads men into temptation, who can
							redeem them from it?— This is one of the mysteries for future solution—
							It cannot be accounted for here— <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> came out from
							Boston, and dined and spent the day with me. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from Psalm 101.1. [“]I will sing
							of mercy and judgment; unto thee, O Lord will I sing.”— The Sermon was a
							sort of critical and historical Essay upon the book of Psalms— A subject
							upon which there is much to be said— I would consider it first as the
							only model of Hebrew Lyric Poetry. 2. compare it with the Lyric Poetry
							of the Greeks and Romans. 3. It exclusive character devotional— 4.
							connected with the religious worship of the tabernacle and afterwards of
							the temple— The musical establishment of <persRef ref="david"
								>David</persRef> connected with the composition of the Psalms. 5.
							The effect of music, vocal and instrumental, upon religious worship. 6.
							Peculiarly suited to the worship of one God— Creator and Preserver of
							the world— The adaptation of sacred music and Psalms, to Christian
							worship.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave out to be sung after
							the Sermon his 57<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> hymn, which is <persRef
								ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> version of the 33<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> psalm—one of the poorest that Watts ever
							composed—in which he makes ways rhyme with grace, loves with proves,
							spread with made, and seas with place; all in three Stanzas— It ought
							not to have been admitted into his collection— There was a collection
							taken up according to the annual usage for the Sunday school library.
							The S.S. Westerly gale, burning hot blew till the going down of the Sun,
							and then came on a very light thunder shower M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Degrand left us to return to Boston shortly before nine— I
							attempted a versification of the 33<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Psalm
							but only accomplished it in part— The Great Western Steamer arrived
							yesterday at New-York from Liverpool, and brought News from London to
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 4.27. Set 7.40.</p>
						<p>The Sun rose beclouded, and the weather was nearly as warm, as last
							evening immediately after the shower which was very light— I visited my
							seedling trees and wasted two hours in digging round them, manuring the
							land; and coaxing the small ones to grow— In the meantime a fresh breeze
							from the Northwest swept off all the clouds and compelled me to resume
							my winter garments. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Caleb Cushing</persRef> Commissioner Plenipotentiary to

								Samuel K. Lothrop</persRef>, with <persRef ref="bacon-ezekiel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ezekiel Bacon</persRef> of Utica
							New-York— Cushing’s visit would have surprized me, but that he had told
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> last Friday that he
							intended to make it— He has not made his Court to <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">Captain Tyler</persRef> in vain. His obsequiousness
							and sacrifice of principle lost him the favour of his Constituents who
							repudiated him at the recent elections, but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tyler had more precious favours in his gift, and he has
							lavished them in profusion upon Cushing. He is to embark in a few days
							for Alexandria in Egypt—to proceed thence overland to Bombay; where he
							is to find the Steamer Missouri, which is to take him to Canton— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Vance has within a few years experienced
							also the fickleness of popular favour— He was originally a poor
							labourer, but rose by his eloquence to Congress and to the Government of
							the State, and then was dropped into his primitive obscurity— <persRef

							tale— He was a member of Congress from Berkshire, Massachusetts at the
							time of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> embargo.
							Afterwards moved into the State of New-York, and engaged deeply in her
							politics—but has been many years an invalid; retired altogether from
							public life, and writing verses in a sick chamber at Utica— My
							correspondence with him began in 1808. and I have several Letters from
							him with enclosed poetry within the last year— I had not seen him since
							I went to Russia, and did not know him even when named to me by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop till the course of conversation
							disclosed who he was.— <persRef ref="archibaldmacon">Archibald

						<p>Sun rose 4:28. clear. Set 7:40 beclouded—</p>
						<p>Independence day. 67—</p>
						<p>I saw the Sun rise from the corner of <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house and marked its bearing, in the centre of
							the valley between the two hills.— I took the usual morning range round
							my grounds with no new observations on my trees—save the appearance of 8
							or ten seedling English Oaks within a circle of 6 feet round the spot in
							the garden where one of those trees had been set out and grew and bore
							last year many acorns— It was taken up last Autumn, and these seedlings
							are from self-planted acorns which had fallen from the tree, and were
							left unnoticed on the ground—</p>
						<p>My only surviving Son, Charles Francis, delivered the annual Boston City
							Oration on the Anniversary of Independence; an incident of the most
							intense interest to me, it being this day fifty years, since I performed
							the same service to the town. At half past 8 this morning we left my
							gate, and went into Boston; alighting at the city Hall in School Street,
							where we found the Mayor of the City, <persRef ref="brimmer-martin"
								>Martin Brimmer</persRef>; and the Aldermen, common council with the
							other City Officers were assembling for a procession— <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="percival-john">Captain John Percival</persRef> were among the
							persons whom I met there— Soon after 10. the procession moved escorted
							by two military companies to Faneuil Hall, where for the first time this
							celebration was held. It has usually been at the Old South Church, and
							was there in 1793 when I performed— The order of performances this day
							was 1. Music. 2 An Ode, by a select choir of pupils of the public
							schools, under the direction of <persRef ref="mason-lowell">Lowell
								Mason</persRef> 3. Prayer, by the <persRef ref="hague-william"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hague</persRef>. 4. Selections from the Scriptures by the <persRef
								ref="gray-thomas2">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gray</persRef>.— 5. Ode written by <persRef
								ref="sigourney-lydia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> L. H.
								Sigourney</persRef>. 6. Oration by Charles Francis Adams 7. Prayer,
							by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gray. 8. Hymn—To the tune of God save the king. 9. Benediction by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hague. The Oration occupied one hour and a
							quarter in the delivery; and was received with great, repeated and long
							continued applause— The hall was crowded to its utmost capacity, with a
							very respectable and highly intelligent auditory. There was a station
							assigned in the procession to the members of the Massachusetts
							delegation in Congress; in which I walked with <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C. Winthrop</persRef>. Neither <persRef
								ref="morton-marcus">Governor Morton</persRef> nor any member of his
							Council was present.— About a quarter past one, the ceremonies were all
							over— I went with Charles and <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> to his house,
							where our Carriage soon came and took Charles and me home to Quincy.
								<persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> with <persRef ref="u;u">two of her
								sons</persRef> and <persRef ref="frothingham-ann2;frothingham-ellen"
								>two daughters</persRef>, came from Boston, and dined at Charles’s—
							I dined with only <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>.
							The last time I had been in Boston on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of July was in 1809. I went up the hill at Sunset. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frothingham returned with her children to
							Boston— We witnessed the fireworks on the Common of Boston. No language
							can express the agitation of my feelings, and the remembrances of this
							day [symbols]</p>

						</list>
						<p>Sun rose 4.28. Set 7.39. clear</p>
						<p>The morning was cloudy, and there were copious showers in the forenoon.
							But soon after the sky was swept clear with a Northwest wind rather cold
							than cool. In my morning visitation to my trees I still found something
							to observe. I took off a girdle of suckers round an old Russet apple
							tree in the lane between my house and <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef>; and I tied to the old dead stem two shoots of
							a black Jack Oak which has been growing twelve years in the Nursery;
							which throws up every summer shoots four or five feet high, and die down
							almost to the ground every winter— I have thus nearly ascertained that
							the Cork, Willow, and live-Oak, will not bear this climate— I fear the
							blackjack, will share the same fate; but I hope the English white-Oak
							may be propagated by the Acorn to any extent. Of a dozen acorns from the
							nursery trees, which I sowed last October, in a row close to the kitchen
							garden gate, last Thursday I perceived that one was breaking through the
							surface of the ground, and now at the end of a week, the plumelet is
							about half an inch above ground in the form of miniature leaves— This
							morning I perceived a second and this afternoon a third of the same row
							piercing through the soil— I sowed about the same time last autumn a
							number of shagbark walnuts, not one of which yet appears. Probably the
							reason why so many seedlings from this hard nut are winter-killed the
							first season after they come up is because they come up so late in the
							summer that they have not time to harden into wood before the sharp
							frosts set in—and I propose a double experiment to see if the vegetation
							of them cannot be hastened or retarded; by sowing from the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							of October 3 rows of one dozen each 1. of nuts in the shell. 2. of nuts
							with the shell cracked. 3. of nuts in the drupe.— Another experiment may
							be to sow one row on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of October and
							another on the first of November— I find a multitude of new hatched slug
							worms eroding the surface of my cherry tree and pear tree leaves— Fresh
							spurs are putting forth from button-wood trees and stakes which were
							apparently dead— There came a man apparently 60 years of age, in very
							coarse apparel with red hair and a weather-beaten face, who said he was
							a Virginia named <persRef ref="randolph-richard2">Richard Bland
								Randolph</persRef>— That he had received in 1798 a midshipman’s
							warrant from <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>; had been one
							of the captors of the French frigate L’Insurgente; and had been
							dismissed from the service at the reduction of the Navy by <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> in 1802. That he had now a petition before
							congress for prize money of which he had never lifted the first cent;
							that he had made himself odious in Virginia by expressing opinions in
							favour of abolition; and that he had not bread to eat— I rode this
							afternoon to Milton with <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C
								Smith</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi

						<p>Sun rose 4 Set 7.</p>
						<p>I emptied this morning one of my flower pots; filled it with fresh earth
							from the garden and sowed in it the seeds of a Baldwin apple which had
							been kept sound through the winter, but which has been decaying since my
							return home on my library mantle piece—and with them I sowed one dozen
							red cherry stones of cherries just now ripe and which I picked from the
							trees— My last experiment to see if they will vegetate.— I leave my
							trees. <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> went this morning
							to Cambridge to attend a greek examination. At 10. O’Clock, I left home
							with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, and her Son
								<persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>—we went into
							Boston, and dined at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef>; meeting there
							her father <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peter Chardon Brooks</persRef>— Immediately after dinner we
							proceeded to the depot of the Western Railroad, where after taking leave
							of Charles who had just come in from Cambridge, we started in the Cars
							at half past 3.— The weather was fine—clear sunshine yet comfortably
							cool— We passed through the towns of Natick, Southborough—Westborough,
							Worcester, Brookfield— Charlton and several others which I neglected to
							ascertain, and at a quarter before 9. landed at <persRef
								ref="warriner-jeremy">Warriner’s</persRef> United States Hotel in
							Springfield 96 miles from Boston— Among our travelling companions were
							the <persRef ref="young-alexander">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Alexander Young</persRef>, Minister of the New South Church, Boston;
							going by the way of Hartford and New-Haven, to preach two Sundays at
							New-York. <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph;grinnell-sarah">M<hi

								ref="sargent-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Sargent</persRef>, going to visit <persRef ref="sargent-henry2">his
								son</persRef>, settled at Newburgh opposite to Fishkill landing on
							Hudson’s river— The Season is delightful. The face of the Country like
							the garden of Eden— It is the Season of hay-making and throughout our
							way, the mower with his scythe, the cocking of the grass, or the
							spreading it from the cock to dry, followed in alternate succession, and
							the atmosphere was charged only with varieties of fragrance— Fields of
							Indian corn, Rye, Potatoes and Oats interchangeably with pastures
							covered with grazing cattle, neat and comfortable houses and kitchen
							gardens and Orchards laden with ripening fruit, attested a genial
							climate a fruitful Season and a region of Peace, plenty and contentment—
							As the cars flew along from Boston till we passed through Natick the
							contrast of the Seasons crowded upon my observation between the present
							aspect of the country, and that which I witnessed last November when I
							went to deliver the Lecture, with the ice glazed road to <persRef
								ref="wilson-henry5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilson’s</persRef> house, and the falling snow of the next morning
							as I returned to Boston— At Springfield we took our lodging for the
							night at Jeremy Warriner’s United States Hotel, one of the most elegant
							houses of public entertainment that I ever visited— This morning, I
							called at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								James H. Foster’s</persRef>, and invited his daughter <persRef
								ref="foster-mary">Mary</persRef> to go out to Quincy, and pass a few
							days with her Aunt <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>
							till my return, but her health is so bad that she declined going from
							home.</p>

								Young</persRef> departed at 7 this morning in a Steamer for
							Hartford— <persRef ref="sargent-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sargent</persRef> disappeared in another direction for Hudson’s
							river. I rose with the Sun, and wrote in my bed chamber till breakfast
							time at 8. having no time to examine a narrative of an expedition to the
							Oregon territory in 1835, 36 and 37. by <persRef ref="parker-samuel2"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Parker</persRef> or the
							life of the <persRef ref="haynes-lemuel">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> Lemuel Haynes</persRef> a Mulatto minister of the
							gospel, born in 1753 and deceased in 1833. of whom I had never heard
							before; but who was many years eminent as a preacher in Connecticut and
							the western part of the State of New-York. Books which I found on the
							table at which I wrote— After breakfast, <persRef ref="u">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Howard</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ashmun</persRef> called to see
							us; and accompanied <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Brooks</persRef> and myself with <persRef
								ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> to the Arsenal and the
							armoury. At the Arsenal we saw 30000 stands of arms, and were told that
							there were 150,000 ready for use in case of need— At the armoury
								<persRef ref="ripley-james2">Major Ripley</persRef> went round with
							us, and we saw the various processes of making the gun barrels, and the
							black walnut gun stocks— I had seen these processes in 1828, but they
							are constantly making improvements in the manipulation of the musketry—
							They are now substituting the percussion lock and cap for the flint lock
							and <unclear>pan</unclear>—but Major Ripley told me that unless an appropriation should
							be very shortly made to repair or rather to rebuild the house over the
							water fall, in which they make the gun barrels and stocks he apprehends
							it will crumble into ruin and carry the workmen employed in it with it—
							On our return to <persRef ref="warriner-jeremy">Warriner’s</persRef> we
							had a visit from <persRef ref="calhoun-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William B. Calhoun</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="grinnell-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Grinnell</persRef> was visited by her two Sisters <persRef
								ref="dalton-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dalton</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bentley</persRef>—
							We had a magnificent collation dinner, and at one O’Clock rode to the
							depot and resumed our seats in the railroad Cars— There was a light
							sprinkling of rain but the clouds gradually dispersed and the Evening
							was fine— <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Grinnell were
							still with us to Pittsfield 54. miles, through a country contrasting
							with that through which we had passed yesterday— A wild region of dark
							forests and stupendous rocks, through many of which deep cuts and
							inclined plains, have been made for the Western railroad, which has cost
							ten millions of dollars. At Pittsfield we quitted the railroad and bid
							farewell to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Grinnell and our new acquaintance <persRef
								ref="porter-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Porter</persRef> of Lee a member of <persRef ref="morton-marcus"
								>Governor Marcus Morton’s</persRef> Council—we took a Carriage and
							came in two hours to Lebanon Springs over a heavy mountainous road. Here
							we are to pass three or four days, for the sake of the baths, said to be
							salubrious. We expected to have met here my old Classmate <persRef
								ref="putnam-samuel">judge Samuel Putnam</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="loring-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caleb
								Loring</persRef> of Boston, but were disappointed. They went away
							this morning— <persRef ref="loring-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles G. Loring</persRef> is here with <persRef
								ref="loring-mary">his wife</persRef>, a daughter of judge Putnam,
							and a <persRef ref="u">son</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"

						<p>The Columbian Hall at the Lebanon Springs, the house at which we have
							taken our lodgings, is a Hotel kept by <persRef ref="hull-henry"
								>Hull</persRef> and <persRef ref="bentley-william2"
								>Bentley</persRef>, with about 120 bed chambers on four low Stories
							of a wooden mansion with a wide piazza round three sides of the house on
							the second and third Stories— A large dining hall on the ground floor
							with a reading and bar room over which ascending a flight of steps there
							is also a large drawing room— The house is built on the eastern side of
							a high and steep hill, in the form of a half rectangle the short side of
							which fronts the street, and the long side a very extensive valley
							between two ranges of lofty mountains chiefly covered with Oak, chesnut,
							beech—birch, black walnut and especially sugar maple trees, interspersed
							with willows and sycamores of respectable size and stature but none of
							them very large or tall— The sumach, and locust are also very common
							among them.— On rising this morning and walking round the piazza, I was
							much struck by the successive lights and shades of the Sun rising in a
							crystal clear sky, gilding the tops of the mountains successively in
							proportion to their respective elevations piercing through interstitial
							passages between the hills into parts of the valley, and casting long
							dark shades of solitary trees in one direction before them—for three
							quarters of an hour the peaks of the mountains were taking one after
							another the golden tinge, before the sunbeam became visible from the
							piazzo, on which I was walking, and listening to the morning concert of
							the birds. This was very little varied by the spring and yellow birds,
							with the king-bird, wren, swallow and robin— None, but what I hear at
							Quincy, and no sound either of bobolink or quail.— I wrote till
							breakfast time at 8 and soon after with all our party, a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aymer</persRef> and two
							Ladies from New-York, and <persRef ref="jackson-edward3"
								>Edward</persRef>, a son of <persRef ref="jackson-patrick">Patrick
								Jackson</persRef> I rode in two Carriages up the hills to a tower
							about 50 feet high on the loftiest summit of this neighbourhood, whence
							we had a range of prospect round the compass with a radius of fifty
							miles.— The line between the States of New-York and Massachusetts is on
							the road from Lebanon to the tower which is in Berkshire County, and
							whence parts of the States of Massachusetts, New-Hampshire, Vermont and
							New-York are visible at one view— Returning from the tower, at Noon, I
							took a bath: Water at 90. not warm. After dinner I had a visit from
								<persRef ref="dunham-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dunham</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hayden</persRef> of Pittsfield to invite me there; but I declined—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dunham brought with him his daughter
								<persRef ref="dunham-helen">Helen Maria’s</persRef> Album for me to
							write my name in it— We next rode, taking with us a small boy a <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin3">son</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef>, to the village of the Shakers, and visited
							a man named <persRef ref="mantle-john">John Mantle</persRef>, and a
							woman living in two rooms of one house, where they keep a small shop of
							Shakerism, at unconscionable prices. we saw also their dairy, and
							cheeses and cow-yard with two women, milking 25 cows— Returned, and
							after tea, spent the Evening on the Piazza, in converse with a cluster
							of Strangers.</p>
