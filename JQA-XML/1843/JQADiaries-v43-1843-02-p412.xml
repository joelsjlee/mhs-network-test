						<p>There was a party of 7 or 800 last Evening at <persRef
								ref="wickliffe-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles A
								Wickliffe</persRef> the Post-master General’s, to which we were all
							invited, but only <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> went—
							It was what in London is called a rout; and here a jam an overflowing
							multitude treading upon one another’s heels and toes, and forming a
							consolidated mass, without room for motion. At the house this morning
							the hour allotted to the call for reports from Committees was delayed
							nearly an hour by senseless or malicious resolutions, among which
								<persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi the
							repudiator moved a reconsideration of the vote of yesterday passing the
							army appropriation Bill— His pretended purpose was to make large
							retrenchments; and he expatiated largely upon the emptiness of the
							Treasury, the deficiency of the revenue, and the absolute necessity of
							great reductions of expenditures. <persRef ref="granger-francis"
								>Granger</persRef> answered him in a speech of cutting sarcasms, and
							the motion was laid on the table by a seemingly unanimous vote— But
							Thompson will go home and make capital on the stump by his motion— The
							call on Committees for reports followed and when the foreign affairs
							were called <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> reported the
							resolution to take the French claims bill out of Committee of the whole
							on the Union next Tuesday—which started a most cankerous debate of half
							an hour bristled with points of order and at last a mention by <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> to lay the whole subject
							on the table—lost by yeas and nays 90 to<space/>Then the previous question,
							seconded and a vote not to take the main question now— I then offered
							from the Committee of foreign Affairs my two resolutions of call upon
							the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for information,
							correspondence and instructions, relating to <persRef ref="jones-thomas"
								>Ap Catesby Jones’s</persRef> exploits in California— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> objected, and said he had a Letter
							from Captain Jones himself, which would explain the whole affair to the
							satisfaction of the house. Granger had moved the previous question, and
							offered to allow the reading of Captain Jones’s Letter, but declined
							withdrawing his motion, without which Wise would not have Jones’s Letter
							read— The previous question was seconded 93 to 70. Wise asked if he
							could move to postpone the subject—the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> said no, but he could move to lay it on the
							table— Wise asked if the morning hour was expired. The speaker said yes—
							Wise called for the orders of the day— The territorial bills were then
							taken up and debated, in Committee of the whole <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> in the Chair
							till the time for adjournment— Two confidential messages were received
							from the President and referred without reading to the Committee on
							Indian Affairs— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Frye</persRef> dined with us, and <persRef

						<p>I have no respite from the anxieties of attendance upon the business of
							the house— On Monday last one of the days specially assigned by the
							rules of the house for the reception of resolutions I had prepared two,
							calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for
							information, correspondence and instructions relating to the invasion of
							California, by <persRef ref="jones-thomas">Commodore Thomas ap Catesby
								Jones</persRef> last October— Two abortions of attempt had already
							been made to call partially for this information one by <persRef
								ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> of Mississippi; a blunderer, too
							stupid to see the issues of his own movements, and another by <persRef
								ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef>, who was immediately arrested by a
							hint from <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>— The duty of the
							house to call for this information was in my belief so transcendent that
							I could no longer forbear to initiate the call myself.— But on Monday
							Wise contrived to get a vote of the house superseding the reception of
							Resolutions, by going into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union; though he failed to get up the exchequer bill for which he had
							made the motion— I nevertheless presented my Resolutions; but a single
							objection sufficed to exclude them from reception, and <persRef
								ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> objected— My Resolutions
							were returned to me from the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew"
								>Clerk’s</persRef> table— I reproduced them the next morning in the
							Committee of foreign Affairs; and obtained an instruction from them to
							report them from the Committee— But <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing’s</persRef> motion to fix a time for taking the French
							claims out of Committee occupied the whole morning hour of Tuesday— It
							was not till yesterday that I could report the two Resolutions, and then
							Wise by chicanery, still kept off the decision till there had been
							announced a second to the previous question— This morning a desperate
							attempt was again made to supersed the morning hour by going at once
							into Committee of the whole on the territorial business— But I insisted
							on the question upon my resolutions— Cushing asked to be excused from
							voting, because the usual exception was omitted, and was excused— Wise
							asked to be excused, and after a trifling speech withdrew his motion and
							voted— The resolutions were adopted by yeas and nays 118 to 69. of which
							last at least ten dough faced democrats changed their votes from ay to
							no after the roll had been called through.— The came the votes on
							Cushing’s motion to take the French claims out of Committee— Motion to
							lay the whole subject on the table lost 94 to 104— Motion to take the
							main question now—lost 94 to 100. After this, the territorial bills
							consumed the remainder of the day— I got involved suddenly and
							unexpectedly in the discussion of one of them to provide payment for an
							illegal meeting of the legislature of Wisconsin, which dragged on till
							the committee rose twice for want of a quorum, and two motions to
							adjourn had been rejected by yeas and nays; and at last the house
							adjourned with out taking them— <persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Richard D.
								Cutts</persRef> and <persRef ref="cutts-mary">his Sister</persRef>
							were here this Evening. Cold weather— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> this morning 18.</p>

							and Blacks, in reply to a German Orthodermist by <persRef
								ref="abdy-edward">E. S. Abdy</persRef>—M.A which he said was a
							specimen of the working of American Slavery to pervert the public
							opinion upon the merits of American Slavery in Germany.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt rode with me to the capitol— At
							the house among the Reports from Committees was one by <persRef
								ref="mason-samson">Samson Mason</persRef> from the Committee of Ways
							and Means, to refund the balance due to the State of Massachusetts for
							disbursements during the last war with Great Britain—a harbour Bill by

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Underwood</persRef> Chairman of

							that the same voters who elect the Council shall also elect the Mayor
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> began some stir
							about an amendment to impart universal suffrage; but Underwood reminded
							him of my motion upon the bill of the last Session, to strike out the
							word white, from his universal suffrage, and he was quiet as a mouse and
							let the bill pass in silence— <persRef ref="pearce-james"
								>Pearce</persRef> called up his motion to print 5000 extra copies of
							the Report of the judiciary committee on <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson’s</persRef> fine, but could not get a vote upon it.

							Private and territorial business followed <persRef ref="yulee-david"
								>Levy</persRef> who had the floor by assignment upon the bill for
							the relief of the inhabitants of Florida, made a show as if he was very
							anxious to make his speech upon it, but suffered it to pass over for
							other bills to be taken up. I went down to the room of the Supreme
							Court, where <persRef ref="crittenden-john">John J. Crittenden</persRef>
							was arguing a Kentucky land cause— I was recalled by a message from
								<persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Giddings</persRef>, upon another demonstration of Levy that he
							wished to speak upon his West-Florida bill; but before I got back to my
							Seat, his impulse had subsided, and other business had succeeded— The

							on the education of the blind, to-morrow evening at the Unitarian

							deliver another lecture on the same subject next Monday, and asked me to
							make the motion to that effect in the house, to which I reluctantly
							agreed— I did accordingly make the motion, and it was adopted without
							opposition— <persRef ref="summers-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Summers</persRef> of Virginia, came with a more aukward proposal— He
							is charged by <persRef ref="washington-samuel">Samuel T.
								Washington</persRef> to present to Congress the sword used by
								<persRef ref="washington-george">General George Washington</persRef>
							in the Revolutionary War— And he intends to make a sentimental patriotic
							speech on presenting it— And he requested me to offer the joint
							resolution accepting the sword and proposing the disposal of it— His own
							opinion was to direct that it shall be deposited in the hall of the
							National Institute for the promotion of Science— I intreated him to
							excuse me from this service, but he pressed me till I gave way and
							consented to undertake it— The house went into Committee of the whole on
							the state of the Union <persRef ref="allen-elisha">Elisha H.
								Allen</persRef> in the chair, and took up the Navy appropriation
							bill— <persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> of Georgia

								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> objected that
							this amendment was not in order. Fillmore appealed from the decision,
							but the Committee 73 to 60 sustained the chairman— Then came up a stiff

							without deciding and the house adjourned. At 6 O’Clock I dined with
								<persRef ref="hulsemann-johann">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>There was a fall of Snow last evening which covered the ground with a
							white garment complete this morning but it melted, leaving scarce a
							trace behind in the course of this day I attended public worship at the
							hall of the house of representatives— The <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M
								Caulay</persRef> of Cincinnati officiated, at the request he
							announced of <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tustin</persRef> who was indisposed— The auditory was
							very small. The service of not more than one hour beginning by the
							reading of a chapter— No singing— A Sermon of 40 minutes from Psalm 77
							19—[“]Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
							footsteps are not known.” This is a Psalm of <persRef ref="asaph"
								>Asaph</persRef>, and addressed to the chief musician <persRef
								ref="jeduthun">Jeduthun</persRef>.— In the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> and 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> chapters of the first
							book of Chronicles, is the account of the institution by <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef> of the Choir of Musicians vocal and
							instrumental, on the occasion of the final bringing up of the Ark from
							the house of Obed-Edom; and of the appointment of Asaph and of Jeduthun
							as leaders of the Choir— David then delivered to them a psalm of his own
							composition to be sung with an accompaniment of Harps, and Psalteries
							and Cymbals— This institution appears to have been supplementary to the
							Levitical ritual ordained of Sinai— Asaph’s instrument is expressly said
							to have been the cymbal—and several of the sublimest Psalms are
							announced as his but whether composed by him may be questioned.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Caulay’s exposition of his text was a
							dissertation upon the mysterious and incomprehensible ways of divine
							Providence; a theme very easy to amplify by illustration. The ignorance
							of man with regard to all the dispensations of the divine government
							were fully proved, and the consolation administered for it by the
							preacher was the promise of more enlarged views, and more comprehensive
							knowledge in the future spiritual world; of the enjoyments of which he
							drew a vivid and delightful portraiture Thus it is to live upon hope and
							upon this subject, during our pilgrimage here be indulged with nothing
							more.— After dinner I went to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns
							Church, but there was no service performed there. I then went to the
							second presbyterian church, and heard the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sheldon</persRef>, who supplies for a time the pulpit there, preach
							from Malachi 3.16. [“]Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to
							another. and the Lord hearkened, and heard it: and a book of remembrance
							was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought
							upon his name.” This was a scolding discourse— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							took tea and spent part of the evening cleared off cold—</p>

							laudatory of the two worthies who were to dignify the ceremony of this
							day, and at 10 this morning attended the meeting of the Committee of
							foreign Affairs— Present Adams, <persRef ref="everett-horace"
								>Everett</persRef>, <persRef ref="granger-francis"
							>Granger</persRef>, <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine"
							>Shepperd</persRef>, <persRef ref="caruthers-robert"
							>Caruthers</persRef>, <persRef ref="stuart-john2">Stuart</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef>— We had
							memorials from Fredericsburg V<hi rend="superscript">a.</hi> and from
							Alexandria; praying for the establishment of a line of packets to
							Chagres, in connection with a Mail conveyance over the isthmus to
							Panama— They were after some discussion referred to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Shepperd. There was a Letter to the
								<persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>
							from some officer of the colonization Society, claiming an appropriation
							of 5000 dollars for the support of Slaves, who may be taken by our
							squadron on the coast of Africa— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forward
							had sent the letter to the chairman of the Committee of ways and means,
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>, at whose motion
							it had been referred by the house to the Committee of foreign affairs—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett drew up a section which I was
							instructed by the Committee to move in the house, as an amendment to the
							navy appropriation bill now in Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union— His first motion was that it should be introduced into the
							bill for carrying into execution the <persRef ref="baring-alexander"
								>Ashburton</persRef> Treaty—but on discussion it was concluded that
							although the Treaty stipulates that we shall keep for five years a
							squadron of 80 guns on the coast of Africa, for the purpose of capturing
							American Slavers, yet it has no reference to the disposal of the
							captured slaves— By a report from the Secretary of the Treasury on a
							resolution of the Senate, it was estimated that the cost of keeping this
							squadron will be for the first year half a million of dollars, and for
							the four others 300000 dollars a year. At the house, during the morning
							hour Fillmore moved a Resolution to take the Naval Appropriation Bill
							out of Committee of the whole on the State of the Union at 2 O’Clock
							to-morrow, and carried it by moving the previous question, which
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> in vain moved to
							lay on the table, and lost 68 to 95, and <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold</persRef> obtained by a suspension of the rules an<hi
								rend="strikethrough">d</hi> order to make his bill N. 548 the
							special order of the day for next Tuesday by yeas and nays 131 to 53.—
							At 12 O’Clock <persRef ref="summers-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Summers</persRef> rose and presented from <persRef
								ref="washington-samuel">Samuel T. Washington</persRef>, the sword of
								<persRef ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef> and
							the cane bequeathed to him by <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">Benjamin

						<p>The winter after an excursion of five or six weeks has returned upon us

								<persRef ref="summers-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>James A. Pearce</persRef> the reporter from the judiciary Committee
							against the refunding of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General

							<persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M Saunders</persRef> and

								<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop’s</persRef> report on the

						<p>The cold weather produces perturbation in my daily occupations, and

							my rising hours, and when risen I cannot write until the chamber is

							double labour to redeem it— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> called on me, and
							spoke of the underhand movements to carry by springing a mine, the

							against it. <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"

							that I had no confidence in the firmness of any one member from the free
							States, to put their names to any such address.— I was belated this

							of a debate on a question about the reception of a report of one member
								(<persRef ref="aycrigg-john">Aycrigg</persRef>) of the select

						<p>My business crowds upon me beyond endurance, and almost every day, from

							five minutes in reaching the house and found <persRef ref="dawson-john2"
								>Dawson</persRef> of Louisiana struggling for the floor on the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> fine Resolution—
							Several members had moved resolutions of reconsideration on votes
							yesterday taken— Among them was one referring to the Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, a bill surreptitiously smuggled into
							the house by <persRef ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> of
							Illinois; being the same bill, which <persRef ref="linn-lewis">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Linn</persRef> of Missouri has been
							worming through the Senate for the benefit of <persRef
								ref="benton-thomas">Tom Benton</persRef>— The Senate Bill had after

								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> now moved to
							reconsider the reference of Reynolds’s bill to the Committee of the
							whole on the State of the Union, and that it be referred to the

								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> from the

								ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to re-issue

								>Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> brought up quite mal a propos his

							against <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson’s</persRef>
							project of issuing 200,000000. of stock at 3 per Cents hypothecated upon
							the proceeds of the public lands.—both reports are ridiculously
							shallow—and very uncourteous to Johnson, and to his Committee— Dawson
							was in the agonies of parturition upon the fine, so I thought I would
							start new game; and opposed the printing of any extra copies of the two
							reports— This was perfectly desparate as to success—taking the stud upon
							both the great parties of the Country— They will vote down my objection
							by a nearly unanimous conclusion, but I proved them wrong and taking
								<persRef ref="mcnutt-alexander">governor M’Nutt’s</persRef> letter
							and the State of Mississippi to task for repudiation, struck flint and

								<persRef ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> and <persRef

							to-morrow. Ingersoll was touched and angry but I disclaimed all personal
							imputation. The house passed for the remainder of the day to the
							District business. I invited the Massachusetts members to meet at my
							house at 7. tomorrow evening— <persRef ref="young-augustus">Augustus

							responsibility of the Government of the United States for a debt
							contracted by the territory of Florida, which was again referred to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing, as it had been at the last
							Session when he made no report. The Senate Bill for the occupation of
							the Territory of Oregon was then read; and Holmes instantly moved to
							report against it— There was no discussion of its merits or of its
							details; but I was desirous of leaving some record of the vote— I polled
							the Committee—Granger, Stuart, Shepperd, Caruthers and Holmes, voted
							against both bills. Meriwether, for the Senate Bill— Cushing for it,
							with an amendment which he said he would offer— I moved to be instructed
							in the event of the house’s refusing to accept the report against the
							bill, to move an amendment that there should be neither Slavery nor
							involuntary servitude, except upon conviction for crime, throughout the
							territory—and I asked that the yeas and nays on this proposition should
							be taken and recorded on the minutes— It was finally agreed that the
							Chairman should move in the house that the Senate bill should be
							printed, and that the question upon reporting the bills be postponed
							till next Tuesday— In the house, <persRef ref="gwin-william"
								>Gwin</persRef> of Mississippi—disgorged his swindler-spleen upon me
							for exposing his knavery, and that of his <persRef
								ref="mcnutt-alexander">Governor M’Nutt</persRef>— He gave also a
							blast to Granger who repaid him in his own coin— <persRef

							for the next morning hour; the extra printing of the reports of the
							Committee of Ways and Means wedged out the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"

							Florida had been made the special order for this day. I had moved to lay

							and renewed the motion to lay the bill on the table lost by yeas and
							nays 73 to 77. <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Landaff W.

							Tiffany gave notice for him that he would preach next Sunday. The whole
							service was of not more than three quarters of an hour. The auditory
							thin—the seats of the members perhaps two thirds of them filled— The
							text was from Hebrews 2.10—“for whom are all things and by whom are all
							things”— This is about half of the verse, and the verse itself, is only
							a fragment of an argumentative discussion upon the nature attributes and
							powers of Jesus Christ, which forms the subject of the epistle to the
							Hebrews— It begins abruptly, without naming the writer as all the other
							new Testament epistles do, by declaring that Jesus as the <hi
								rend="italic">Son</hi> of God is superior to all the prophets and
							all the angels— That God appointed him heir of all things, and by him
							made the worlds. There is a confusion of phraseology, and a blending of
							persons in the first three chapters of this epistle in the english
							bible, which I cannot disentangle— It speaks throughout of Christ as a
							created being, a begotten being, a Son and yet as pre-existing, to the
							creation of the worlds, as creating them himself, and as taking upon
							himself the nature of man, inferior to the angels for the deliberate
							purpose of being persecuted and put to death for the salvation of the
							whole human race, before and after him— Is not this a clumsy scaffolding
							for religious faith? Give me the Sermon on the mount and I am a
							Christian— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tiffany’s discourse did not
							advert to the peculiar character or composition of the Epistle to the
							Hebrews; nor enquire who was its author— It passes for the work of the

						<p>First Meeting of the select Committee on the Memorials praying for the
							creation of two hundred millions of Stocks hypothecated on the proceeds
							of the sales of the public lands, called by <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef>, chairman, was
							held at 10 this Morning in the Committee room of the Committee of the
							District of Columbia— The members present, besides Johnson were <persRef
								ref="morris-calvary">Calvary Morris</persRef> of Ohio <persRef
								ref="cravens-james">James H. Cravens</persRef> of Indiana <persRef
								ref="casey-zadok">Zadok Casey</persRef> of Illinois and at last,
							just as we were going up to the house, <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3"
								>Thomas F. Marshall</persRef> of Kentucky, who came into the
							Committee room, puffing out a lighted segar.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Johnson read the memorial referred to the Committee, and
							there were several others— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson moved
							that the Committee should chuse a Chairman; but I decidedly objected to
							that and he acquiesced.— Our conversation was of a general character,
							and I said that from the all but universal prejudice against the plan,
							There could be no possible expectation of its being even listened to at
							this Session of Congress. That I dared not even hope that we could
							defeat <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll’s</persRef>
							motion to print and circulate 10000 copies of these two reports from the
							committee of Ways and Means, crushing in the bud the very conception of
							the plan— That I believed all that could now be done, would be for the
							chairman to prepare an elaborate report shewing the impossibility of the
							federal governments escaping from responsibility for the debts of the
							States—analysing those debts; demonstrating that the great mass of them
							have been contracted for useful and national purposes; that the ultimate
							result of them when completed would vindicate them even as measures even
							of sound economy, and refuting with sound argument both the reports from
							the Committee of Ways and Means— That I believed such a report could be
							now made, and left as a germ for future enlargement and improvement—and
							this was all that could be done, to any useful purpose now— We agreed to
							meet again next Thursday morning— In the house the day was a convulsion—
								<persRef ref="moore-john3">Moore</persRef> of Louisiana made a gasp
							to go into Committee of the whole on the bill to refund the fine of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> but it
							failed.— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> made a noble
							hour speech against our base patronage of the Slave trade—on a bill to
							pay out from the Treasury, money received from the British Government
							for the Comet and Encomium— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> the sycophant answered him, and <persRef
								ref="dawson-john2">Dawson</persRef> the drunken bully insulted him—
							The house tamely passed it over— A beggarly message was received from
							the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, upon which <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> bullied the chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means, a full hour, without disturbing his
							serenity. All this I witnessed with boiling indignation but in silence—
							I foresaw a day shortly to come, for an explosion from which I cannot
							flinch.</p>

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs; Present Adams, <persRef

								>Everett</persRef>, <persRef ref="granger-francis"

								<persRef ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="meriwether-james2">Merriwether</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>—the whole Committee— As soon as
							the Committee was formed (by a Quorum) while waiting for the other
							members, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing’s report on the <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty was taken up, and
							he read a large portion of it. The reading was suspended as soon as the
							Committee was full, and I read the minutes of the proceedings of the
							Committee last Saturday on the two bills for the occupation of the
							Oregon Territory— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett agreed with the
							majority to report against both the bills— But they unanimously rejected
							my motion to instruct me to move the amendment excluding Slavery from
							the new territory forever as it was from the Northwest territory—
							Granger said I could move it, as an individual member, and he would vote
							with me for it— Everett said he voted against my motion on the same
							ground taken by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Granger. The rest
							including Cushing all voted directly, and without assigning any reason
							against my motion— After some discussion I was instructed to move the
							reference of the two Bills to the Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union, where they said no more would be heard of them at this
							Session— In the house, after a long jumble of Petitions presented out of
							order and privileged motions for personal explanations, <persRef
								ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> of Mississippi got the floor on a
							pretence of personal explanation, but it was for the purpose, of
							replying to the charges of Granger against the fraudulent repudiation of
							her debts by the Legislature of the State of Mississippi— Granger
							rejoined upon him and proved by unquestionable documents the
							responsibility of the State upon her bonds, and the dishonesty of her
							refusal to pay them— At last <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold</persRef> succeeded in worrying the house into an order that
							they would take his bill N. 548 out of Committee this day at 3. O’Clock,
							and then twice into Committee of the whole, first <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> and then <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> in the Chair, and a Babel
							of amendments were offered, with inextricable confusion till 3. O’Clock—
							Then the debate no part of which had been upon the provisions of the
							bill, ceased, and questions were taken upon amendments till past 4
							O’Clock when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— This evening I
							was visited by <persRef ref="guild-samuel">Samuel Elliot Guild</persRef>
							son of <persRef ref="guild-benjamin">Benjamin Guild</persRef> of
							Brookline, near Boston. He has been here only a few days, and departs on
							his return home— <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler</persRef> who is yet in
							conflict with the Committee on the Coast survey, and teazes me much
							though I can be of little service to him— And a Hollander by the name of
								<persRef ref="u">Rypma</persRef>, who teaches music, and came to
							have a talk with me because I had been in Holland.</p>

								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>— Cushing resumed and concluded
							the reading of his report on the <persRef ref="baring-alexander"
								>Ashburton</persRef> Treaty— The part of the report relating to the
							boundary questions was all unexceptionable; but all the remainder, and
							particularly the part relating to the Article of compromise, with regard
							to the suppression of the African Slave-trade was so full of bad temper
							and absurd reasoning, that I objected to it, altogether; and said if it
							was to be presented to the house at all, I should move many amendments
							to it, and to strike out nearly the whole of it— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Meriwether also objected to it, and said he had written out
							his views on the execution of the treaty, also in the form of a report—
							We had no time for further discussion, and adjourned to Friday Morning
							10. O’Clock— Before going to the house, I had a quarter of an hour’s
							conversation with Cushing, and told him there was a War now in
							parturition between Freedom and Slavery, throughout the globe— That it
							would be a War for the abolition of Slavery—at the head of which would
							be Great Britain. That in this War I could take no part— I was going off
							the Stage; but he was coming on to it—and I conjured him, as he
							cherished his own and his Country’s honour, not to commit himself in
							this great controversy to the side of Slavery— And to return to the
							cause of liberty from which he had not yet irrevocably strayed— He heard
							me without taking offence, but apparently without conviction— I found
							the house in Session taking the questions upon the amendments to
								<persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold’s</persRef> retrenchment bill N.
							548. In Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> in the chair— Twenty-six
							members in succession proposed amendments some of them 3 or 4, almost
							all of which were rejected. That which bore on the compensation and
							attendance of the members of Congress was offered by <persRef
								ref="mckennan-thomas">T. H. M M’Kennan</persRef> and was adopted—
								<persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> moved to report against
							the Bill. only 38. by tellers voted for that—as soon as the Bill was
							reported Cushing moved to lay it and all the amendments on the table
							lost by yeas and nays 42 to 167. The bill was forced through this day by
							suspension of the rules moved by <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef>— Yeas and nays 166 to 48. <persRef

							Absent <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall</persRef>, <persRef

								>th</hi> member.— There was further conversation upon the general
							topic, but it is evident nothing specific can be done at the present

							prepare an argumentative report urging the transcendent necessity of the
							interposition of Congress for the relief of the People of the States
							overburthened with debt—closing with a resolution declaratory of that
							principle— A second Resolution declaring that there is not time at the

							the Committee from the further consideration of the subject— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson appeared desirous of presenting
							his own bill, which may do as well to lay on the table as any thing
							else— We agreed to meet again at ten Saturday Morning— At the house
							after an abortive attempt of a Pennsylvanian dunce named <persRef
								ref="read-almon">Almon H. Read</persRef>, to get a silly motion of
							his made and rejected yesterday upon the journal, the Committees were
							called for Reports— When the Committee of Foreign Affairs was called I

								<persRef ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> of Illinois in the

							and <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>— I returned to
							Meriwether, his manuscript report on the execution of the <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty, which he had lent
							me, and which I had carefully read— He now read it to the Committee— It
							is bitter and rancorous against Great Britain beyond all example; and
							excessively violent against the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article
							of the Treaty. It is a pure effusion of wormwood and of gall. I declared
							my dissent to its opinions from the first to the last line— And my
							dissent quite as explicit to all the report of Cushing, except what
							related to the boundary I proposed to abandon the idea of making a
							detailed report, and to confine it to a short statement of facts, merely
							glancing at the stipulations which we have engaged to fulfill and
							requiring the action of Congress for their fulfilment— As there was a
							bare majority of the Committee present we adjourned to Tuesday morning
							for a final decision on this subject— At the house after a prelude for
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> to report the
							civil and diplomatic appropriation bill for the new fiscal year from 1.
							July 1843 to 1. July 1844 and a struggle by <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> to go into Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union on the exchequer bill, <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> obtained the floor
							for the morning hour against <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
								Ingersoll’s</persRef> motion to print 10000 extra copies of the two
							reports from the Committee of ways and means against the issuing of 200
							millions of stock hypothecated on the proceeds of the sales of the
							public lands—when he finished <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Jacob
								Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi took the floor to reply. Johnson’s

							took little or no notice of the minority report of <persRef
								ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>— The regular business of the
							day was on private bills, but Fillmore moved to fix this day at 1/2 past

							and then to go immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union which was done— <persRef ref="stuart-alexander2">Alexander H H
								Stuart</persRef> in the Chair— The Senate amendments and others were

						<p>Meeting of the two hundred Million Stock select Committee. Present
								<persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef> of Kentucky,

								Howard</persRef> of Michigan. absent <persRef ref="cravens-james"
								>Cravens</persRef> of Indiana, and <persRef ref="casey-zadok"
								>Casey</persRef> of Illinois— The conversation was still general,
							and excepting Johnson and Gentry, all the members are scary upon the
							question of the assumption of State debts— Marshall, the most popular
							speaker in the committee, dreams of nothing but his own very doubtful
							re-election, and is afraid of encountering the odium of State debt
							assumption; and dares not look in the face the issue of foreign War
							waged in defence of repudiation— The memorials all urge the creation of
							two hundred Millions of 3 per cent stocks to be distributed among the
							States a measure impracticable now, and which never will be practicable;
							but no other will now be proposed— The Committee cannot now be brought
							to agree upon even any general principle of relief. The Chairman said
							that he would on Monday morning present a specific measure for the
							consideration of the Committee. I found the house 20 minutes in session,
							and in full squabble, about the removal of <persRef
								ref="roberts-jonathan">Jonathan Roberts</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="blythe-calvin">Calvin Blythe</persRef> successively as
							Collectors of the customs at Philadelphia.— <persRef ref="toland-george"
								>Toland</persRef> had moved a call on the <persRef
								ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for the
							causes of the removal of Jonathan Roberts— <persRef ref="brown-charles3"
								>Charles Brown</persRef> by way of countercheck had moved for the
							causes of the removal of Blythe— The Secretary of the Treasury answers
							that there was no charge against either of them; and here was Charles
							Brown growling at Toland and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>
							howling at <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>, to bully
							down the enquiry.— Wise howled himself so hoarse that he lost the power
							of articulation; and as for Toland’s small and feeble voice, not a word
							of it could be heard The expiration of the morning hour came to suspend
							for a moment the din of pandemonium <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
								>Barnard</persRef> made a struggle to get into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, upon his own substitute for <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing’s</persRef> exchequer, but failed— The
							bill for the relief of the heirs of <persRef ref="renault-philippe"
								>Philip Renaut</persRef> was rejected by yeas and
								nays<space/>to<space/><persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>
							cried aloud to take up the District and Territorial bills— I prevailed
							upon him by mere dint of intreaty to let the Bill for the relief of the
							heirs of <persRef ref="fulton-robert">Robert Fulton</persRef> to be
							taken up. A motion to lay it on the table was rejected<space/>to<space/>The
							previous question was called, sustained and carried— The Bill was passed
							89 to 59. <persRef ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef> moved the
							reconsideration to foreclose it and the bill was sent to the Senate—
								<persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Broad day light— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 25.</p>
						<p>At the Representatives Hall this morning <persRef ref="tustin-septimus"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston</persRef> preached from
							the whole parable of the rich man, and <persRef ref="lazarus"
								>Lazarus</persRef> which I therefore here repeat Luke 16.19. “There
							was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and
							fared sumptuously every day 20. And there was a certain beggar named
							Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores 21. And desiring to
							be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table: moreover the
							dogs came and licked his sores. 22. And it came to pass, that the beggar
							died, and was carried by the angels into <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham’s</persRef> bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried
							23 And in hell, he lifted up his eyes and being in torments, and seeth
							Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom 24. And he cried and said,
							Father Abraham have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the
							tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue: for I am tormented in
							this flame 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
							receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he
							is comforted and thou art tormented 26. And besides all this, between us
							and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from
							hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us that would come from
							thence. 27. Then he said I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
							wouldest send him to my father’s house; 28 For I have five brethren:
							that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of
							torment 29. Abraham saith unto him They have <persRef ref="moses"
								>Moses</persRef> and the prophets; let them hear them. 30. And he
							said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they
							will repent. 31. And he said unto him, if they hear not Moses and the
							prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the
							dead.”— This is a melancholy parable, and there is much to be said upon
							it which I will not say. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tuston dwelt
							upon it chiefly as fixing beyond all peradventure the irredeemable
							eternity of future punishment— The auditory was very thin. After dinner
							at St John’s Church the evening prayer for sexagesima Sunday was read by
								<persRef ref="harris-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel Sayre Harris</persRef> heretofore an Officer of the army,
							and a teacher at the West Point Academy— His text was from Matthew
							11.30. “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”— The Sermon was a
							very ingenious dissertation against the practice of dueling, raised on
							the basis of a position that the yoke of the world was harder and its
							burden heavier than that of Christ— He contrasted with great ingenuity
							the code of honour with the law of Christian forgiveness of injuries— I
							called at <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s</persRef> after church, but he was
							asleep and I could not see him <persRef ref="murray-james">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Murray</persRef> of New-York was here
							this evening.</p>

						<p>Met the select Committee on <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost

								<persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef>, <persRef

								>Casey</persRef> absent— Casey has never attended, since the first
							meeting.— Marshall will do nothing to prepare or mature the plan—give
							him his theme and he makes a flashy gaudy speech; but he has neither
							stedfastness, nor perseverance for any thing. Johnson was not yet
							prepared with his specific proposal, but was forming sanguine hopes and
							calculations of the overwhelming popularity which gather round his plan
							hereafter, and very soon—of which I have no hope whatever.— The
							Committee still came to no conclusion. At the house the great <persRef
								ref="latimer-george">Latimer</persRef> petition signed by 51863.
							citizens of Massachusetts was in a frame on my table. It was the regular
							day, for the call of the States for petitions— The moment the journal
							was read I addressed the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> to
							call for the order of the day; but <persRef ref="gwin-william"
								>Gwin</persRef> of Mississippi had caught the Speaker’s eye, and
							moved to go into committee of the whole on the state of the Union to
							take up the bill to refund <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> fine. At the same time <persRef
								ref="gustine-amos">Amos Gustine</persRef> a usually silent member
							from Pennsylvania asked and obtained leave to present Resolutions from
							the Legislature of Pennsylvania urging the renewal of the act of 1838.
							allowing 5 years of pension to the widows of revolutionary soldiers; and
							he and <persRef ref="mathiot-joshua">Mathiot</persRef> of Ohio, made an
							appeal so pathetic to the good feelings of the house that they actually
							discharged the Committee of the whole house on the state of the Union
							from a bill for that purpose referred to them, and actually passed the
							bill, through all its stages by an unresisted impulse— I then urged the
							motion to call for petitions, and called the yeas and nays on Gwins
							motion to go into committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							which was carried 114 to 71— Of the majority 54 were members from the
							free States— Of the 71 only 5 were from the Slave States— When in
							committee of the whole, a struggle ensued what bill should be taken up.
							Gwin’s motion to take up the Jackson fine bill was rejected 67 to 91—a
							bill for collecting monies into the Treasury was first agreed to—then
							the bill for re-issuing treasury notes was taken up upon which <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> hung his currency bill and
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> his exchequer bill as
							amendments. Barnard and Cushing made hour speeches, Cushing’s amendment
							was twice voted on by tellers first 28 to 80. no quorum—then 38 to 98.
							then Barnard’s amendment was rejected 34. to 105—the bill was reported
							to the house, and passed by yeas and nays 111 to 51. Adjourned 88 to 75—

							<persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>. Cushing came in just as
							the Committee was about to adjourn— They examined the claim of <persRef
								ref="dewolf-john">J. J. De Wolf</persRef> for compensation. He was
							appointed Consul at<space/>in<space/>in the island of Cape-Breton, in December
							1837. and instructed to act as commercial agent, if he could obtain
							authority from the <persRef ref="campbell-colin">Governor of Nova
								Scotia</persRef>, till he should receive his exequatur from England—
							In May 1838. he obtained this authority from the Governor, a
							notification of which he has transmitted published in the royal Gazette
							of Halifax— But a few days later early in June an order issued from the
							Secretary of State <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>
							enjoining him not to act as commercial agent until his exequatur as
							consul should be received—whereupon he came home, and now claims
							compensation for his time, and indemnity for his expenses. There was
							some discussion of the claim but no conclusion— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cushing agreed to withdraw his report on the execution of
							the <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty—and there
							was a decided vote against allowing that of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Meriwether to be reported to the house at all— I was charged
							to move again in the house to take the french claims bill, out of
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— In the house I made
							another effort to obtain leave to present my petitions without success:
							not even so far as to obtain the yeas and nays against it— <persRef
								ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi made an hour
							speech formally upon <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
								Ingersolls</persRef> motion to print extra copies of the Reports
							from the Committee of Ways and Means on the State debts and Land loan,
							but really a swindler speech in honour of the State of Mississippi, for
							bilking her creditors. <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pope</persRef> then got the floor for the next morning
							hour, and gave notice that he should offer his bank-tariff, currency,

							finally got the house into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C. Winthrop</persRef> in the
							chair— I claimed Fillmore’s promise to allow the China-bill to be taken
							up— I moved the amendment desired by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, striking out the
							restriction upon the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> in
							the application of the money and this started a debate of three hours,
							and a rivalry of black guard supremacy in reviling Daniel Webster,
							between <persRef ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gordon-samuel">Samuel Gordon</persRef>— Meriwether, Everett,
								<persRef ref="bronson-david">Bronson</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>A very bad night— Severe catarrh—splitting headache—restlessness and

							rattling off his own life and adventures, and especially his
							misadventures, and his blow up with John—he always calls him familiarly
							John—the day before last Christmas— He came here last October in pursuit

							that he would turn Tylerite, and he was a whig to the core, and he would
							live and die a whig:—and had told John, that he would never like him
							turn a Somerset and prove a traitor to the whig cause— While he was

							There was some personal explanation about nothing between <persRef

							Southern Review, published at Charleston South-Carolina, came to solicit
							my subscription, and if agreeable, my contribution to it; both of which

								Gurley</persRef> came with a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Saunders</persRef>, who keeps a small select classical school, and
							wished to have leave to refer to me as to its character and his
							qualifications— I have not yet learnt the art of gracious denial, and as
							they evidently thought harshly though far otherwise intended by me
							referred to my invariable rule of never giving recommendatory
							certificates or testimony, to persons or things of which I have no
							knowledge of my own— These visitors, and a call at the Bank of the
							Metropolis, retarded me a half an hour at the meeting of the Committee
							of foreign Affairs, which I had called yesterday for this morning—
							Present Adams, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepperd</persRef>, indisposed, and
								<persRef ref="stuart-john2">Stuart</persRef>, whom I had not been
							able yesterday to notify— He was absent from the house— Cushing had
							shewn me yesterday a confidential Letter with enclosures, to be
							communicated to me: urging as a wish of the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> an appropriation for a special and
							extraordinary mission to Great Britain— There were militant resolutions
							of the Legislatures of Illinois and of Missouri, relating to the
							Territory of Oregon, upon which I took occasion to move an instruction
							to me to propose this amendment to the appropriation bill— Holmes, was
							very warmly for it—with Cushing and myself; But Everett and Granger
							peremptorily—Meriwether bitterly, and Caruthers with his bland and
							courteous smile all opposed it— The final decision was postponed till
							next Tuesday at 9. I offered two Resolutions against the annexation of
							Texas, upon which Holmes said he should at once pronounce his veto— At
							the house about two hours were consumed in a movement of <persRef
								ref="williams-joseph2">Joseph L Williams</persRef> to drive through
							a joint Resolution authorising the <persRef ref="forward-walter"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to pay 100000 dollars to
							contain claimants under a Cherokee Treaty—and he succeeded. <persRef
								ref="campbell-john7">John Campbell</persRef> had found that the vote
							yesterday on the bill to suspend the single district Section of the
							apportionment bill had been not 90 and 91 as reported by the <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk</persRef>; but 91 and 91. and that there
							had been a mistake in counting <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Landaff W.
								Andrews’s</persRef> vote in the negative, he not having voted at
							all, which he confirmed—but Campbell did not succeed in reversing the
							decision against his bill. Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, <persRef ref="fessenden-william">Fessenden</persRef> in the chair
							on the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill, which was mangled, till

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray</persRef> lent me a
							London paper containing the debates on the meeting of Parliament.</p>

						<p>Attended public worship at the Hall of the house of Representatives,
							where <persRef ref="tiffany-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tiffany</persRef> read a small part of the episcopal morning service
							and preached from Luke 15.22. [“]But the father said to his servants,
							bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand
							and shoes on his feet.”— It is a perilous thing for a preacher in the
							English language, to take his text for a discourse from a chapter, and
							especially from a parable handled by <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne</persRef>— His Sermon upon this parable of the prodigal Son,
							has left an indelible impression upon my mind—and a sensible judicious
							discourse upon this story does but bring to mind the exquisite
							composition of pathos and of humour which <persRef ref="parsonyorick"
								>Yorick</persRef> brought to bear upon it— After the service I went
							into the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk’s</persRef> Office, where I
							found <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burche</persRef> and one or two of the subalterns— I enquired for a
							message from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> with
							sundry documents relating to memorials praying for the recognition of
							the republic of Hayti. The Message was received on the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of December last and referred to the
							Committee of Foreign Affairs— It was in answer to a Resolution of the
							house of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February 1841. calling
							for these documents— On search now made neither the message nor the
							documents could be found— Burche said they must be at the printers, and
							he would send for them to morrow morning. I went in to the Chamber of
							the Committee of foreign Affairs, and made up the minutes of the last
							two meetings of the Committee— After dinner the service, first for this
							Season at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church began at 4
							O’Clock— Yet, I was belated. <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening
							prayers for Quinquagesima, on the Sunday before lent, and preached from
							Philippians 4.19. [“]But my God shall supply all your need according to
							his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.” After church I went over and
							passed half an hour with <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas B. Johnson</persRef> who is
							partially recovering from his last paralytic shock, but is yet scarcely
							able to speak with distinct articulation, or to stand upon his feet.— I
							received an evening visit from <persRef ref="starkweather-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Starkweather</persRef> a native of
							Massachusetts, settled in New-York, who said he had been some
							twenty-five years since, shortly after my last return from Europe
							introduced to me— He is a sound whig, and like others of that party
							absolutely desponding of public affairs. I never was so much so myself.
							The disappointment is bitter inasmuch as only two years since we had
							symptoms and expectations of better things— It seemed as if the People
							were becoming sober and rational— And benevolent—alas! for the recoild—
							We are now surrendeered to the wildest and foulest democracy— The only
							hope for the Country, in the divisions among themselves will I fear
							prove delusive—</p>

						<p>Awaked about 3. O’Clock this morning by a fit of coughing, after rising
							from bed, lighting my lamp and finding what was the hour I returned to
							bed and lay dosing till 7. I had prepared resolutions to be offered to
							the house with a view to call the attention of the people of the free
							States to the disproportion of slave-holding judges on the bench of the
							Supreme Court of the United States—and an acrostic for the album of
								<persRef ref="morris-mary2">Miss Mary Jewett Morris</persRef>— It is
							one of the grievous miseries of my life to be perpetually beset with
							albums, and for autographs with a few lines of poetry; with which having
							complied in a few instances heretofore, it has brought down upon me such
							a shower, or rather such a waterspout of applications that my ship sinks
							under them— At the house, the first hours were consumed in chicanery, by
								<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef>, pettifogging about
							the error of the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">clerk</persRef> in the
							count upon <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John Campbell’s</persRef>
							palinodial bill to suspend that is to repeal his own single district
							section, of the apportionment bill— The Clerk had reported the count 90
							to 91— It proved to have been 91 to 91—a tie, by which the bill was
							still lost— Campbell had already wasted time in a vain struggle to get
							the decision reversed— Hopkins this morning raked up the rule that in
							case of a tie the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> shall
							vote—upon which the Speaker said, he had no sort of objection— The chair
							votes in the negative— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>
							moved to print 3000 copies extra, of a post-Office report. <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> objected and snarled for
							half an hour but Briggs finally carried it— <persRef ref="toland-george"
								>Toland</persRef> moved for leave to the select committee on the
							removal of <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">Jonathan Roberts</persRef> to
							sit, during the Session of the house— <persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W.
								Irwin</persRef> a subaltern of the corporal’s guard, objected, and
							then parleyed, and jockeyed him out of the vote— <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved to go into Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the civil and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill— I called for the regular order of the
							day— The call for Resolutions.— The house decided to go into Committee—
							I asked leave to present my Resolutions respecting the Slave-holding and
							free State judges on the bench of the Supreme Court. Multitudes of
							objections were heard. I asked a suspension of the rules and the yeas
							and nays— The Speaker said the house had voted to go into Committee, and
							my Resolutions were returned to me. I gave them to <persRef
								ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury</persRef> to be published in the
							National Intelligencer.— The day was consumed in debate on the civil and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill— <persRef ref="fessenden-william"
								>Fessenden</persRef> in the chair— The Bill was at last reported by
							the house with many amendments, one of which introduced at my motion was
							an appropriation of 3000 dollars for a Commissioner to the Sandwich
							Islands.— Adjourned about 5 O’Clock. There was a Message received from
							the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> in answer to the call
							moved by <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> last
							week for the correspondence with the British Government relating to the
							right of visitation— The issue between Captain Tyler and <persRef
								ref="peel-robert">Sir Robert Peel</persRef>.</p>

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs at 9: this morning— Present

								>Meriwether</persRef>, <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>,
							the whole Committee— I presented again the motion that the chairman be
							instructed to move an amendment to the civil and diplomatic
							appropriation bill still under consideration of the house, an
							appropriation for a special minister to Great Britain— Cushing, Holmes
							and myself voted ay— Everett, Granger, Shepperd, Stuart, Caruthers and
							Meriwether voted nay— I then again presented two Resolutions to be
							reported to the house, on the reference of the Resolutions from the
							Legislature of Alabama, in favour of the annexation of Texas to this
							Union, and of sundry petitions against that measure— My first Resolution
							denying the Constitutional power of Congress, or of any Department or
							Departments of the Government of the United States to annex any foreign
							State or people to this Union; and the second, that any attempt by act
							of Congress or by Treaty to annex the Republic of Texas to this Union
							would be a violation of the Constitution, null and void, and to which
							the free States of the Union and their People ought not to submit—
							Meriwether moved as a substitute for my two resolutions an instruction
							to the chairman to ask to be discharged from the further consideration
							of the subject. Stuart, Shepperd Caruthers, Meriwether, Holmes and
							Cushing voted for the substitute— Everett and Granger against
							it—declaring their willingness to vote for the first of my two
							Resolutions— The vote was partizan sectional, except Cushing’s which was
							northern servile or doughface— In the house the first thing done was to
							pass a resolution to meet for the remainder of the Session at 10 O’Clock
							A.M— A great mass of business was transacted, in much of which I took
							part, but cannot even notice it here. <persRef ref="kennedy-john">J. P.
								Kennedy</persRef> from the Committee of Commerce made a report upon
							our African Colonies— In to which I made some enquiries to be seriously
							followed up hereafter. <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">R. M.
								Saunders</persRef> from the judiciary reported a substitute trickery
							bill to naturalize <persRef ref="yulee-david">David Levy</persRef>, the
							Jew delegate from Florida by confirming under a mask an Ordinance of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, annulled by
							Congress when first reported to them—at my motion the substitued bill
							was laid on the table— I asked from the Committee of foreign Affairs,
							the house to discharge them from the further consideration of the Texian
							Annexation Alabama Resolutions and the counter petitions.— And I offered
							my own two Resolutions—which were read. <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> objected, and they were not received.— The bill for
							executing the <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Ashburton</persRef> Treaty
							was called up by Cushing; carried through the Committee of the whole,
								<persRef ref="summers-george">George W. Summers</persRef> in the
							Chair, reported to the house, and passed by yeas and nays 137 to 40—
							Adjourned at a quarter past 5.— This evening a Virginian abolitionist
							named <persRef ref="bryant-joseph">Joseph Bryant</persRef> was here; but
							I have no room to record his sayings and doings</p>
