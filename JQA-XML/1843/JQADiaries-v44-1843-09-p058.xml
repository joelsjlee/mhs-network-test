						<p>Sudden change of weather last Evening from sultry dog day heat with
							swarms numberless of musquitos to a chilling Northeaster— Spading and
							hoeing two hours— The English acorns planted last October continue to
							come up from the ground one after another so late in the Season that the
							stems cannot acquire a consistency to survive the winter without
							protection from the frost. Summer and winter are equally fatal to them—
							And for this I should discover a remedy.— A man by the name of <persRef
								ref="butters-samuel">Butters</persRef> came as a mendicant with a
							recommendatory Letter from <persRef ref="ripley-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ripley</persRef> the minister of
							Waltham. His apology for beggary was that he had lost his property and
							must raise 150 dollars to recover it. He said he had got nearly the
							whole, but wanted a few dollars more and enumerated sundry of my friends
							who had given him 5 dollars each. I thought one quite as much as he
							deserved— <persRef ref="hardwick-george">George W. Hardwick</persRef>
							brought honey in the comb for sale 25 cents a pound.— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="johnson-william4">W. C. Johnson</persRef> went to Boston and

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef>, and the
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-louisa3;johnson-sarah">three
								girls</persRef> went also, and got home just in time to hear the 9
							O’Clock bell— I called this evening on <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> the minister and spoke
							with him of the inscription to be made on the ministerial monument of
							the name of <persRef ref="quincy-norton">Norton Quincy</persRef>, who
							was buried <unclear>in it</unclear>— He promised to attend to it— <persRef
								ref="struve-friedrich">Struve’s</persRef> report on double stars was
							published by order of the Russian Academy of Sciences says that stars of
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> magnitude can be seen with the
							naked eye, and none below the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> magnitude
							can be seen by the most powerful Telescope— The bright star of Lyra,
							Vega is a double star and Struve observed its annual parallax— There are
							two classes of double stars, optical, one behind the other, and
							physical—stars composing a solar system with Satellites— The observation
							of the double stars give by their changing distances furnish the means
							of ascertaing the parallax of the brightest of the two Stars— <persRef
								ref="herschel-william">Herschel</persRef> in 1780 and 1800 was the
							first of double stars in 1813 Struve began the observation of them at
							Dorpat— In 1824. The great Telescope, the masterpiece of <persRef
								ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauenhofer</persRef> was received and from
							that day the observatory of Dorpat took the lead of all others for the
							observation of double stars. The multitude of observations is almost as
							surprizing as that of the Stars. There are only 120 nights in the year
							when observations can and only 80 when the micrometrical observations
							can be pursued with large magnifying powers.— With a magnifying power of
							1000. the 100<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> part of a second is a
							discernable quantity— The Mira Ceti or whale wonder changes from a Star
							of being of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> magnitude till is
							diminished till it disappears— There are stars of all the colours of the
							rainbow— There are triple and quadruple stars— The distance of stars of
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> magnitude is estimated at 16
							millions of times the distance of the earth from the Sun.</p>

						<p>Spading and hoeing two hours. Planted in seedling pot N. 2. filled with

								<persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> and <persRef ref="dennis"
								>Dennis</persRef> broke up and manured most of the seminary plats
							which I had not cleared out— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> called on me to enquire
							of the time of the birth of <persRef ref="quincy-norton">Norton
								Quincy</persRef> of which I had told him I thought I had a record;
							but on making search I found it not, though I had of his marriage in
							1746. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt spoke also of his design to
							prepare and deliver a course of Lectures upon English Literature; and
							supposing I was one of the directors of the Lowell Institute intimated a
							wish that I would propose him as a candidate for the appointment, to
							deliver his course there—and asked for the use of books in my library
							which he may want in the prosecution of his work—which I very cheerfully
							promised—as well as to do any thing else in my power to serve him;
							though I have no connection with the Lowell Institute— I saw the Sun set
							from <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> porch— I made up
							a parcel of 25 of my printed miscellanies and gave them to my brother
							Charles’s grandson—<persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C.
								Johnson</persRef> and gave him two others for his brother <persRef
								ref="johnson-alexander2">Alexander</persRef> to whom I had promised
							my argument in the case of the Amistad captives.— The search for
							scattered pamphlets and other nameless absorptions of time stole away my
							morning hours—and dinner came before my record of yesterday was
							completed. After dinner the labour of writing is too drowsy, and my
							tribute to the address for Cincinnati was of only one page— <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							was here this Evening. I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>, enclosing sundry
							Letters from Astronomical observators to <persRef ref="cranch-joseph2"
								>Joseph Cranch</persRef>, London, and one from him to <persRef
								ref="peirce-benjamin">Professor Peirce</persRef>, all written in
							1842. and relating to Astronomical Instruments and their makers.— Of
							these more hereafter</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><persRef ref="struve-friedrich">Struve</persRef>.</p>
						<p>His catalogue of double stars, discovered by the great Telescope of
								<persRef ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauenhofer</persRef> in the space
							of 2 1/2 years 120000 stars of magnitude from the first to the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> and a little beyond; of which 3112 were
							physical double—and of these only 340 were on the list of <persRef
								ref="herschel-william">Herschel</persRef> and 447 on a former
							catalogue of Struve, before Frauenhofer’s great refractor was made.
							Struve considers the double Stars as Solar systems with planetary
							Satellites like those of our own Sun— The relative movements of these
							double stars are ascertained, and he gives a list of 7. whose periods of
							revolution in their orbits are from 43 to 573 years— The deepest
							impression left on my mind by these observations of Struve is the
							immense increase of visual power conferred upon mankind by the invention
							of these new instruments, which may be called Titanic Telescopes.</p>

						<p>Visited my grounds— Two hours— Heavy dews and wet feet. Discovered a
							swarm of black oak caterpillar worms clinging round two twigs of the 13
							years old shagbark walnut tree at the bottom of the Nursery. <unclear>Cut</unclear> off
							the twigs and consigned their occupants to the fire. Heard <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							this morning from the Genesis 49.4. “Unstable as water, thou shalt not
							excel.” This was an admirable discourse, on stability of character— The
							sentiment thus expressed in the English Bible is incomparable as a maxim
							of morals, but is not a correct translation of the original. <persRef
								ref="thomson-charles">Charles Thomson’s</persRef> translation from
							the Septuagint, mutilates the thought, and substitutes little better
							than nonsense in its place— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt began by
							relating the occasion upon which the words were spoken, by <persRef
								ref="jacob">Israel</persRef> on his dying bed, in what is called his
							blessing upon his children.— It is rather the prediction of the future
							fortunes of their descendants— The lot of <persRef ref="reuben"
								>Reuben</persRef> the first born was any thing but a blessing— It is
							reproach for more than instability. It is a charge of criminality and a
							declaration that its punishment shall be visited on the descendents of
							Reuben by the forfeiture of his right of primogeniture. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt merely glanced at this view of the
							subject— His Sermon was a comment upon the sentiment that instability of
							character is fatal to all excellence.— He pointed to the sources of
							stability the consciencious estimate of right, and religious faith— I
							believe that a loose faith is the surest indication of wavering
							integrity, and can have no confidence in the honesty of a philosophical
							unbeliever— Immediately after my returning from the morning meeting,
								<persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef> came in from Boston—dined with us, and kept me in
							attendance till 10. in the evening. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from John 15.5. I am the vine, ye are the
							branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth
							much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing— The argument of this
							discourse was that the Christian religion is addressed more to the heart
							than to the head— That it deals little in abstractions—that it
							personifies all the virtues, and that all its efficacy depends upon the
							personal character of Jesus Christ, without whom his disciples can do
							nothing.— He incidentally gave a side blow to the transcendental
							doctrines of <persRef ref="emerson-ralph">Ralph Waldo Emerson</persRef>
							and the scarcely disguised infidelity of <persRef ref="parker-theodore"
								>Theodore Parker</persRef>, which is shaking the faith of the sons
							of the New-England Pilgrims— It had been advertised in the Quincy
							Patriot of yesterday that <persRef ref="quincy-edmund4">Edmund
								Quincy</persRef> woul deliver a Lecture upon Slavy in the town Hall
							at half past five O’Clock this afternoon— I went with De Grand and found
							that <persRef ref="quincy-lucilla">his wife</persRef>, and their Son
								<persRef ref="quincy-henry">Edmund</persRef>, a boy of 5 years old
							were with him. I invited them all to take tea with me after the Lecture
							which they did. The Lecture delivered without notes was about an hour

							16 acres at 75 dollars an acre— My land borders on the road: his lies
							back, which shews his astuteness in the proposal to <hi rend="italic"
								>give</hi> or <hi rend="italic">take</hi>— We made our way through a
							narrow and tangled path across the lawyer’s common; where in 1829 I sold
							off the burden of Pine and hemlock wood, and which is now thickly
							covered with a growth of black, white, and scrub oaks, with a portion of
							white birch, white and pitch pine and sundry others— From the South side

							preached this morning from Mark 10.15. “Verily I say unto you,
							whatsoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he
							shall not enter therein.”— The affectionate attachment of Jesus Christ
							to little children is one of the peculiar characteristics of the
							Christian religion— A century later the Roman Poet <persRef
								ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef> had said maxima debetur puero
							reverentia, and that noble sentiment like many others of the same poet,
							betoken the silent influence of Christianity spreading over the heart of
							man, while it was yet proscribed and persecuted by the Roman Emperors—
							The Affection for children was a part of that doctrine of universal
							benevolence which pervades the new Testament, and which is ever one and
							the same— It is remarkable that Christ gave no instructions to children—
							His apostles taught them nothing but obedience to their parents and
							guardians, and the parable of the prodigal son teaches only to the
							parent the lesson of forgiveness for transgression— The virtues of
							children are docility, simplicity, credulity, and sensibility to
							kindness— This he says is precisely the temper in which the gospel must
							be received or it cannot be received at all.— He took them up in his
							arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them— There was more teaching
							in that action than there would have been in a volume of discourse— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s Sermon was eloquent and pathetic;
							but for the last two Nights, between three and four hours of sleep each
							night have been my portion— Scattered Spirits, dull and slow conceptions
							flagging attention and a torpid state of body sinking unconsciously into
							slumber; follow me through the day, and steep my senses in
							forgetfulness. These are the decays of nature, and are continual
							admonitions to prepare myself for the time at hand. <persRef
								ref="lothrop-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel K
								Lothrop</persRef> Minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston
							preached this afternoon; from John 16.32. last part of the verse: “and
							yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me[”]— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop’s manner is in perfect contrast
							with that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt, and yet is very
							pleasing. He began by remarking that there is among the generality of
							mankind a decided aversion to being left alone—and then he descanted
							upon the peculiar inconveniences of being left alone— Some of the views
							which he presented of this thought were striking— He referred to the
							desertion of Jesus by all his disciples, and to the awful but all
							sufficient consolation and support which he derived from the
							consciousness that his father was with him—and he solemnly exhorted his
							hearers to remember that the same trial may await themselves; and they
							must be prepared to meet it alone, but having the father with them—

						<p>First fire for the Season in the dining room, and the Summer has

							irksome—third quart of wild cherries from the garden seedling to steep
							in rum. Planted 18. Bergamot pairs in a row, in the small nursery at the
							northern corner of the garden, and a row of steeped mazzard cherries in
							the Summer house cellar— Of the seedling Apple stocks transplanted from
							the Nursery to the orchard there are several flourishing and deserving
							attention which I have neglected— The seedling English White Oaks, self
							planted under the trees, are so numerous that all question of their
							reproduction is removed; and now remains only to devise expedients for
							saving them and the shagbarks from the winter frost— <persRef
								ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> was here and spoke of that
							portion of my land which he proposes to purchase; but we cannot agree
							upon the terms— He offers me five thousand dollars for 32 acres for
							which I ask 20000— He proposed to sell me his dwelling house and about

							knew where to find the money to pay for the purchase— <persRef

								Ernst</persRef> of Cincinnati, Ohio, paid me a visit with <persRef

								ref="otis-george">George A. Otis</persRef> of Boston— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ernst is by birth a German, but came to
							this Country, a child, more than 40 years since— He says that when
								<persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> settled at Cincinnati there
							were but three houses in the place; it is now a city with 60000
							inhabitants— He speaks our language so entirely like the people of our
							Western section, that not withstanding his name I had not a suspicion
							that he was born a foreigner, till his wife mentioned it— There was an
							earnestness and warmth in his manifestations of kindness to me which is
							never shown by natives of my own Country— There is a consciousness of
							equality and often of superiority, which interdicts all appearance of
							obsequiousness in our native Americans, even when they come as beggars—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ernst asked to visit my garden and
							nursery, and took some nuts, acorns and flower seeds, because they grew
							in my garden— And he and his wife both invited me to stay at their house
							when I come to Cincinnati— My time is frightfully shortening to make my
							preparations for that journey. I answered <persRef ref="webster-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. G. Webster’s</persRef>
							Letter, and offered to present his memorial asking Congress to purchase
							the Synopsis of <persRef ref="webster-noah">his fathers</persRef> great
							dictionary, if he concludes to send it— I intend if possible to write
							one Letter every day for the next six weeks. But in preparing my
							astronomical discourse I am much distressed for want of time to read
							with attention <persRef ref="bailly-jean">Bailly’s</persRef> history of
							antient Astronomy; and <persRef ref="goguet-antony">Goguets</persRef>
							chapters on the same Science— I want 6 months for Bailly’s book alone—
							In the history of Grecian Astronomy I find the names of <persRef
								ref="thales">Thales</persRef>
							<persRef ref="anaximander">Anaximander</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="anaximenes">Anaximenes</persRef> all of Miletus— I look for
							them in the Dictionnaire Historique and find accounts of them, worthy of
							meditation. Thales was the first of the wise men of Greece, and like
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, though 800 years later learnt
							his wisdom from the Priests of Egypt— He founded the Ionic school of
							Philosophy. He was never married saying when young that it was too soon,

							Millville in this Commonwealth, called to see me for mere curiosity, and
							in the afternoon <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">D<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="boylston-alicia">his Grand mother</persRef>, which has
							perplexed me much— <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> W. N. Boylston</persRef>, by his Will directed that he
							should be buried at Princeton, and provided for the erection over his
							remains, under a building which he proposed to give to the town on
							certain conditions.— He was accordingly buried, there, but the town has
							not complied with the conditions of the grant— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Boylston has purchased a tomb in the cemetery at Mount
							Auburn, and wishes to have the remains of her husband deposited there.
							Her Letter to me was to enquire my opinion, whether she could not by Law
							have them taken up and removed, without consulting or considering the
							dispositions or desires of the people of Princeton. I doubt if there is
							any human Law applicable to the case; and still more whether under the
							circumstances she could cause the body to be removed without the consent
							of the People of Princeton. I requested the Doctor to say so to her, and
							to advise her in my name to do nothing without first attempting to
							obtain their consent.</p>

						<p>Spading and hoeing perhaps for the last time this Season— The laborious

								rend="superscript">th</hi> of May when I came out to Quincy has been
							greatly conducive to the restoration of my health, but the cold weather
							will master me: and I fear the consequences, if I undertake to meet it

							which I had hitherto left unanswered— Also the Letter of <persRef
								ref="lawn-james">James J Lawn</persRef>, and 4 others a Committee of
							the Baltimore Mechanics Lyceum, inviting me to deliver a Lecture before
							them, which I declined— But this effort to retrieve the arrears of my

							my evening till close upon midnight— <persRef ref="wade-margaret">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Margaret Wade</persRef> a widow of a
								<persRef ref="u">revolutionary soldier</persRef> 78 years of age and

							pension to widows married before the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							January 1794. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wade was married in June
							of that year and failed to obtain her pension for that reason— She
							wishes now to renew her claim and to have her old petition called up, or
							if necessary to have a new petition presented for her— I promised to
							call up her old petition if to be found on the files of the house, and
							if not to write to her that she may prepare and forward a new one— My
							own list of petitions presented at the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>

							find—and upon the House Journal of that Session I find only a petition

						<p>My spading is rather abruptly terminated, having by over eagerness of

						<p>Fahrenheit 60 75.</p>
						<p>The temperature of the air had been relaxing all night and the

							extreme, and brought me its usual accompaniment a rhumatic head ache. I
							strip’d my wild cherry tree of a fourth quart of its fruit, and barely
							finished when it came onto rain and there was a succession of heavy
							showers through the day; growing warm all the time to 75 degrees. I
							marked this morning a shoot coming out from the stem of the wild cherry
							seedling which I carelessly crop’d sometime since— Some of my self
							planted English white Oak seedlings are still putting forth their
							plumelets— But the Ash, horse chesnut and shag bark walnut have long
							ceased to vegetate for this year. <persRef ref="marchant-edward">M<hi

							wasted again much of this afternoon in a fruitless search for papers,
							and dipped into <persRef ref="mitford-william">Mitford’s</persRef>
							history of Greece for his account of the Grecian Philosophers; but found
							it extremely meagre. <persRef ref="bailly-jean">Bailly</persRef> on the

							to day with one page of my astronomical address, and this evening
							completed my task at 11 O Clock— If I should intermit the labour but for
							one day, it is doubtful if I should ever resume it— I should certainly
							not be ready for the performance of my promise— I see by the Newspapers
							that at the Convention of whigs of Norfolk County at Dedham last
							Saturday the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> among their Resolutions,
							they appointed a Committee consisting of <persRef

								Alicia Boylston</persRef>, and I read a few pages of <persRef
								ref="bailly-jean">Bailly’s</persRef> history of Antient Astronomy.
							His theory of an antedulivan People highly civilized, and possessed of
							the Science of Astronomy, very nearly if not quite equal to the progress

							sustain him— I cannot but suspect that it is merely a device to
							discredit the cosmogony of the bible, and especially the <persRef
								ref="moses">mosaic</persRef> account of the deluge. He professes
							throughout the most profound reverence for the scriptural history but he
							takes no notice of the confusion of tongues after the flood and insists

							discoveries in astronomical Science including even the laws of <persRef
								ref="kepler-johannes">Kepler</persRef> and the gravitation of
								<persRef ref="newton-isaac">Newton</persRef>— There is indeed no

							Gannett) minister of the federal Street church in Boston and sometime a

									rend="superscript">r</hi> W. E. Channing</persRef> preached
							here, this morning from Romans 1.16. [“]For I am not ashamed of the
							gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation”—omitting
							the remainder of the verse—“to every one that believeth; to the Jew
							first, and also to the Greek.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gannett
							enjoys a high reputation as a preacher. He must therefore abide a
							severer scrutiny than others— The text did not promise much— It was well
							for <persRef ref="paul">St Paul</persRef> standing before hosts of
							inveterate foes, Jews and Gentiles; to say he was not ashamed of the
							gospel of Christ; and to assign for it the reason that it is the power
							of God unto salvation— But for a protestant divine of this age, and in
							this Country should boast that he is not ashamed of the gospel of the
							Christ, has a ludicrous aspect— Who is ashamed of it?— But it is not at
							this day the power of God unto Salvation <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to
							the jew and also to the Greek— That stage of its existence has passed
							away; and I could not <unclear>see</unclear> the useful application to the present times
							or the sentiment in the text— The Sermon did not much relieve me. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gannett dined with us; and when we
							returned from meeting we found <persRef
								ref="downing-andrew;dewindt-caroline2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> A. J.
								Downing</persRef> of Newburgh at our house. They dined with
							us—visited at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Sons</persRef> and at
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams’s</persRef>—took tea at <persRef ref="miller-caroline">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edwards Miller’s</persRef>, and
							returned this evening to <persRef ref="guild-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin Guild’s</persRef> at
							Brookline—whence they are to depart tomorrow afternoon to return home.
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gannett’s afternoon sermon was from
							Luke 9.23. “And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let
							him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”— This
							discourse made amends for the deficiencies of that of the morning.— It
							was perhaps not better but more suited to my taste— The Christians <hi
								rend="italic">daily</hi> cross; dwelling with great emphasis on the
							word <hi rend="italic">daily</hi>— There is in this excellent morality.
							The argument was that the Christian is called to suffer and to act in
							the performance of duty every day— The profound conviction of this and
							vigorous exertion for the fulfilment of the duty, constitutes the
							Christian, and the pattern of the perfect man— There is no more useful
							sermon than this. Two men calling themselves <persRef
								ref="luther-ebenezer">Luther</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Eaton</persRef>, professing to come from Fall river, and to be
							going to Brighton stop’d here and said that they had come so far out of
							their way for the sole purpose of seeing me— Their looks were not
							prepossessing. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> returning from Boston brought me a Letter
							from <persRef ref="davis-john">judge John Davis</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="middleton-james">Middleton’s</persRef> celestial Atlas— I
							examined it with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, and found it
							more convenient for recognizing the constellations and fixed stars than
								<persRef ref="bode-johann">Bode’s</persRef> Uranographia which is
							too unwieldy for convenience.</p>

							propagating apple trees by slips or twigs— I made preparation for
							doctoring an apple-tree in the alley beyond <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, surrounded by Weeds,
							Blackberry vines and suckers— It will make me a week’s hard labour for

						<p>In search of laborious exercise I undertook this morning with my Spade,
							hoe and Saw to clear out an apple tree close to the wall in the ally
							leading over the hill, beyond <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house— It is overrun with suckers and the
							ground over its root is hard bound almost as stone, and covered with
							blackberry vines; unapproachable— With my spade and hoe, I broke up the
							ground; about one half surrounding the trunk and took off a couple of
							the suckers nearest to the surface of the ground— It was a sweating work
							of two hours; the remainder of which I left for to-morrow— The wild
							cherry seedling that I crop’d off some time since has put out two or
							three buttons, and close under the crop two leaves.— And this morning
							for the first time I saw 2 pears on the sucker tree near the dwarf apple
							tree. It is a bergamot and must be at least 25 years old— I thought it
							never would bear— <persRef ref="crosby-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript"

							the Temperance funds— <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Loring</persRef> came to renew
							the proposal for another fishing party. I agreed to meet him at his
							house on Thursday Morning at 7. O’Clock, if the weather promise to be
							fair; and if not, either of the following days Friday or Saturday.— I
							find it impossible, taking three hours of exercise a day, to write the
							page of Journal, two or three short Letters, and even one page of the
							Astronomical Discourse—and having yesterday written three short Letters,
							I was last night, spell bound, and physically unable to write more than
							three or four lines— This day I made an effort and got through my
							journal page by 11. but then fell to searching for files of Letters and
							papers, which took up the time till dinner— I received a second Letter
							from <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Giddings</persRef>, with one of the same date (13 September) from
							him, <persRef ref="bloss-james">James M Bloss</persRef>, and <persRef

								John</persRef>, as a Committee of the People of Ashtabula County,
							Ohio inviting me to visit them on my way to or returning from
							Cincinnati— This afternoon I answered the invitation and the Letter from
							Giddings; but it left me in the evening only the power to finish the
							page I had begun yesterday of my discourse. In the distribution of my
							time, it is distressing to be so exceedingly straitened for hours to
							read; and I feel it cruelly now—when I want to compress a history of
							Astronomy into a discourse of three hours delivery. My task is to turn
							this transient gust of enthusiasm for the Science of <unclear>astrono</unclear>my at
							Cincinnati into a permanent and persevering national pursuit which may
							extend the bounds of human knowledge, and make my country instrumental
							in elevating the character and improving the condition of man upon
							Earth— The hand of God himself has furnished me this opportunity to do
							good— But O! how much will depend upon my manner of performing that
							task? and with what agony of soul must I implore the aid of almighty
							wisdom for powers of conception, energy of exertion and unconquerable
							will to accomplish my design.</p>

							be in my power to deliver a Lecture or an address at Springfield on
							Wednesday the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of November, and the
							thought occurred to me of making my expedition to Cincinnati itself the
							subject of that Lecture.— This suggestion pleased me so much that I
							began and wrote one page of such a Lecture; but it kept me up till past
							midnight—lost me a second day for the astronomical discourse, and
							agitated me too much. Miss Bigelow gave us a delightful evening of
							performance on the Piano.</p>

						<p>The excitement of the invitation last Evening from Springfield, of the
							design formed in consequence of it with the engagement previously
							undertaken by me to address the People of Norfolk County on Politics, on
							the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next month, and the thoughts
							which rushed upon me in connection with these manifold engagements was
							so great that I was not conscious of sleeping a wink the whole night— I
							rose convinced that I had not slept a moment— But I heard the Clock
							strike 12 and 4. The intermediate hours 1. 2. 3. I did not hear and when
							it struck 4. I was expecting to hear it strike 1.— I slept therefore
							between two and three hours, believing all the time that I was wide
							awake: a state of existence bordering I fear upon insanity; and which I
							contemplate with some alarm. I rose however at 4. and after an hour
							occupied in washing scrubbing and dressing, I went up the hill and
							roused <persRef key="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>, came back and
							roused the cook and <persRef ref="benjamin2">coachman</persRef> of my
							own family. Benjamin tackled with one horse— I returned to Charles’s
							house to see the Sun rise, on this the equinoctial day; but there was a
							thick border of haze just over the eastern horizon, and the rising sun
							could not be seen— My son drove me in the Carryall to Hingham; whence we
							went with <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							a due proportion of Pollock, flounders and one Tautaug—at half past 12
							we returned to the shore, and then with <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit’s</persRef> Thermometer at 90 to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Loring’s house at Hingham— There we had a dinner of Chowder

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Quincy Thaxter</persRef> with a

								ref="willmer-charles">Charles Willmer’s</persRef> American
							News-Letter of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month,

							proroguing Parliament in person—after which she went to visit the
								<persRef ref="louis-philippe">king of France</persRef> at the
							Chateau d’Eu. At 4 O’Clock we left M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Loring’s house at returned home, with the Sun in our faces all the way.
							We reached home at 5. O’Clock, but I was so heated, so weary, and so
							heavy with the sleepless drowsiness of last night that I was disabled
							for all useful toil, and could not even write the journal of yesterday I
							found on my table, a Letter from <persRef ref="burnet-jacob">judge
								Burnet</persRef> and from <persRef ref="mitchel-ormsby">professor O.
								M. Mitchell</persRef> of Cincinnati, requesting me to fix the day
							for the ceremony of laying the corner stone of the Astronomical
							observatory there; and proposing Tuesday the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of Novembe<unclear>r.</unclear> Also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="reed-william2">W. B. Read</persRef> of Philadelphia reminding
							me of a conditional engagement which I had contracted last May, to
							deliver a discourse upon some historical subject, before the historical
							Society of Pennsylvania, next November. I had already received a Letter
							of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> from <persRef
								ref="armstrong-edward">Edward Armstrong</persRef> a similar Letter
							he is the Secretary of the Society— When I promised professor Mitchell
							at the Niagara Falls to go to Cincinnati next November I totally forgot
							this engagement to the Pennsylvania Society; and it now comes upon me
							with grievous pressure and I know not what to do— This Evening was
							partly clear, and with <persRef ref="middleton-james"
								>Middleton’s</persRef> celestial Atlas, I pointed out to my two
							Granddaughters <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa Catherine</persRef> most of the
							Constellations visible in the hemisphere now over us from the setting

						<p>I finished the trimming of the Apple tree in the alley on the hill beyond
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, and took
							off a bush of suckers.— The shoot from the cropped seedling wild cherry
							has put out a third leaf— I rubbed off an incipient leaf from a bud
							below. I first observed yesterday emerging from the soil the leaves of a
							seedling English white oak, in the row four of which came out about the
								1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of July. I suspect that the
							difference in the time of subterranean vegetation before they come up
							depends upon the depth at which they are planted; and that the safest
							from the fatal hand of frost may be those which go over the second
							winter before they come up.— The self planted on the spot in the garden
							where the tree was taken up last fall, have four out of the 16. a third
							spindle shoot now expanding leaves, and the tallest of them is 12 inches
							high, and the leaves have yet time for full developement before the
							frost will set in and suspend all vegetation for the winter— From this
							size down to two inches high I have every variety of the English white
							oak seedling of the present year. <persRef ref="newcomb-george2">George

							of the owners of the Schooner Rosanne, and after about an hour of search
							I could find nothing about it, either in the Journal of the last Session
							of the house, or in my own minutes or diary. So I must turn it over for

							to me, dated September 1841. from his now deceased father <persRef

							repeating the wish for an interview and enclosing another pamphlet; I
							answered that I would receive him immediately and he came— But he had
							nothing to say to me, except that he was now going to Canada to claim of

							of Dedham preached this morning from Proverbs 3.17. [“]Her ways are ways
							of pleasantness, and all her paths are Peace”— The discourse was upon
							the pleasures of religion, but I was in a lethargy and unable to listen
							with attention— There was a great change last evening in the atmosphere
							to sultry damp, the effect of which upon my body was to produce a dull
							heavy headache, and a sluggish sulky rhumatic uneasiness all over me. I
							went to bed soon after 10 and to sleep— I awoke at the stroke of the
							clock with an excruciating cramp in my right leg— I supposed the clock
							was striking 4. but it struck 12— My cramp passed off but the head ache
							remained— I slept no more, but lay and heard the clock strike 2 and 3.
							during which the relieving perspiration came on. At half past 3. I rose,
							dressed. wrote a page of my astronomical address and as Sun rise
							approached went up the hill and saw it from the Eastern corner of
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— I returned
							and wrote with the interval for breakfast till the second bell for
							meeting was ringing whereby my indispensable days work was done; but I
							was in a state of torpor the whole day— The weather was of the very
							hottest of the Summer. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White dined with

								>Herod</persRef> favored <persRef ref="johnthebaptist"
								>John</persRef>, knowing that he was a just man, and an
							holy.”—omitting the remainder of the verse— The discourse was upon the
							duty and the blessing of an holy life. An excellent theme, but I had the
							malady of not listening as in the morning; altogether involuntary, and
							the unfailing consequence of a headache and sleepless night.— I had
							barely returned home from afternoon meeting, when <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>
							came in from Boston, with his nephew named <persRef ref="u"

						<p>While he was an apprentice at <persRef ref="weichselberger-philipp"

							a machine for grinding glass, and made experiments with it in the
							leisure of holidays, without success. He resorted to Treatises upon
							Optics, but found they required previous elementary mathematics, for the
							acquisition of which he was obliged to steal holiday hours out of his
							masters house, for in it the use of Books was interdicted to him— He had
							been very imperfectly taught even to write— In despite of all these
							obstacles and discouragements, he persevered indefatigably in pursuit of
							the science of optics with the unconquerable will which cannot be

						<p>Showery, Foggy, Misty. Rainy—</p>
						<p>A pattern day— After a night of sound sleep I awoke free from head ache—
							My washing, scrubbing—dressing took an hour of gentle exercise— Then two
							hours with the Spade and hoe to clear the ground about the stump of a
							mazzard cherry tree on the hill, eastern side of the alley opposite
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> gate; and to
							enlarge the plat round a seedling mazzard in the Seminary. This is hard
							and ungrateful work— The rest of the day with the intervals for
							breakfast, dinner, tea, and an hour of relaxation with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary;adams-mary4">my
								family</persRef> and Charles, and about two hours of wilful
							idleness, a waking substitute for sleep was employed on my daily labour
							and produced. 1. The page of yesterday’s diary— 2 A page and a half of
							Astronomical discourse. 3. An Answer to <persRef ref="curtis-cyrus"

								>Potter’s</persRef> Grecian Antiquities— In search of <persRef

							Dictionary; and all for enquiries not one of which was satisfied.— In
							tracing the history of Antient Astronomy, especially that of the Grecian
							schools I get entangled in details of speculative opinions held by
							numerous individuals most of whose names are scarcely remembered, and
							they dog my progress so that I shall be hard put to it to get rid of
							them— But how shall I collect in a focus all the rays of human
							intelligence gathering to shed light on the Science of Astronomy?— The
								<persRef ref="pythagoras">Pythagorean</persRef> square of the
							hypothenuse—the polarity of the magnet—and last of all the telescope—the
							glass lens! which brings me again to</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><persRef ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Fraunhofer</persRef>—</p>
						<p>With the remainder of the <persRef ref="maximilian-i">king of
								Bavaria’s</persRef> donation, he purchased of <persRef
								ref="weichselberger-philipp">his master</persRef> the last half year
							of his apprenticeship, and sought to earn his livelihood by engraving
							visiting cards— This proved but a precarious resource, till by a lucky
							chance, <persRef ref="utzschneider-joseph">Utzschneider</persRef>
							engaged him as an Optician— Here was the field for the display of his
							powers. His first labours were the making of objective glasses for
							astronomical observatories. In 1809. Utzschneider erected with him <unclear>and</unclear>
								<persRef ref="reichenbach-georg">Reichenboch</persRef> the optical
							institute at Benedictbeurn. In 1811. he introduced a new and improved
							mode of melting glass. In 1818 he undertook the whole direction of the
							establishment. Of his optical discoveries he communicated an account to
							the Bavarian royal Academy of Sciences, and published a French
							translation in <persRef ref="schumacher-heinrich">Schumacher’s</persRef>
							periodical. One of his theories was first published in the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> number of the Nachrichten. His Telescopes
							surpassed any that had ever been made before. The largest yet known was
							made for the observatory at Dorpat. He left another of the same power
							nearly finished— A larger one of 12 inches aperture was begun.</p>

						<p>The day was occupied like that of yesterday, and with similar progress,

							cherry-tree stump in the alley on the hill nearly opposite <persRef

							But he found a worm at the root of the tall seedling at the seminary

							planted in flower pot N. 3. the core of a Bartlet pear and a row of
							rotten pears and peaches in the garden and orchard corner— I had an
							afternoon visit from <persRef ref="duggan-william">D<hi

							understand that he had made at Saratoga many minutes for Letters to
								<persRef ref="green-john3">Green</persRef> the Editor of the Quincy

							do me honour. But he had himself been very sick at Saratoga, and had not

						<p>A change comes over my whereabouts, if not over the spirit of my dream— I
							had my journal of yesterday written when I was called to breakfast, and
							that was all that I could accomplish—and rising at four, it is all that
							I ever can accomplish— From breakfast till 1. p.m. I was constantly
							occupied, with the interval of a visit from <persRef ref="thayer-minot"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Minott Thayer</persRef>, with a
							young man named <persRef ref="u">Ides</persRef>, in packing my small
							black trunk for a journey to New-Bedford—to be gone two days. Such a
							mountain must I make of a molehill. My astronomical Discourse, and my

							could barely find time to read <persRef ref="bacon-ezekiel">M<hi

							visit to the Niagara Falls and to answer the enquiries of the <persRef
								ref="harrington-benjamin2">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>

								<persRef ref="brooks-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks</persRef> at dinner— It was but a quarter past 3. I made a
							short visit to <persRef ref="davis-john">judge Davis</persRef> and found
							him with <persRef ref="sturgis-elizabeth;goodwin-ellen;davis-susan2">his
								three daughters</persRef> a grand daughter and a great grand
							daughter.— I had a short conversation with him upon <persRef
								ref="middleton-james">Middleton’s</persRef> celestial Atlas, and
							hurried back to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Brooks’s, at whose
							door <persRef ref="brooks-peter">his father</persRef> was stopping in to
							my Carriage and we drove to the depot of the New-Bedford Railway, which
							we reached on the stroke of four; step’d into the Car and were off, with
							scarcely time to greet <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell</persRef> who was waiting for
							us there— At half past six we alighted from the cars and step’d into
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell’s carriage at New-Bedford—
							They call it 55 miles. It may be 50— The road is half the way the same
							as that to Providence; but the movement is so rapid that there is
							scarcely time to count the towns we pass through on the road. There was
							a cavalcade of firemen with lighted torches at the depot who escorted us
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell’s house, and a crowd of boys
							followed us shouting to the great consternation of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell’s horses; to no small personal
							danger and great annoyance of us all— Yet it was meant in honour to me,
							of which I was duly sensible in gratitude to him who disposes of the
							minds of men. Numbers of visitors course in to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Grinnell’s in the course of the evening among whom the
							selectmen of the town, the chairman of whom <persRef
								ref="congdon-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="grinnell-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Grinnell</persRef>, an old Lady of 82. also of the Society of

							with a profusion of flowers and of fruits—grapes, pears and peaches— We

								>Congdon</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Howland</persRef> and <persRef

							where the Selectmen have their Seats M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Congdon addressed me in a speech carefully composed and handsomely
							delivered, of about 20 minutes—and introduced me to the Meeting composed
							entirely of men— I answered him in a speech of half an hour, like all
							the other extraordinary and extemporaneous speeches that I have been
							doomed to deliver a source to me of deep mortification from the
							consciousness, how flat and impotent is every effort of mine of this
							kind—and I was on this occasion more than usually dull— After the

							unexpectedly <persRef ref="robbins-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript"

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="elliot-william4;eliot-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Elliot</persRef> of Washington,
							and <persRef ref="durfee-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durfee
								(Nathan)</persRef> a representative in the Legislature of the
							Commonwealth from Fall-river in 1841— At the depot in Boston I parted
							from <persRef ref="brooks-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell; stop’d
							at the shop of <persRef ref="mitchell-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Mitchell</persRef>, Seal engraver and took the Seal
							ordered for <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Captain Buchanan</persRef>— I
							found <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> at his office, and
								<persRef ref="spooner-allen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Spooner</persRef> came in while I was there— I hurried to <persRef
								ref="bowditch-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Bowditch’s</persRef> in Otis place. Neither he nor <persRef
								ref="bowditch-sarah">his wife</persRef> was at home, and I had no
							small difficulty in obtaining, but did obtain access to the library. I
							was an hour and a half intensely engaged in searching for the volumes of
								<persRef ref="schumacher-heinrich">Schumacher’s</persRef>
							Astronomische Nachrichten, containing the accounts of the erection by
							the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Russian Emperor Nicholas</persRef> of the
							Astronomical Observatory of Pulkova— I found two of them at last—Volumes
							11. and 13.— Numbers 264. August 1834. and 290. 291. 292 18. Nov<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> 1835. I took out the Books and entered my
							name as the borrower. I next called upon <persRef ref="davis-john">judge
								Davis</persRef>, and had a further conversation of half an hour with
							him. He lent me the companion to <persRef ref="middleton-james"
								>Middleton’s</persRef> celestial Atlas, and also, a <persRef
								ref="mercator-gerardus">Mercator’s</persRef> map of the Starry
							heavens comprehending the whole equinoctial and terminated by the polar
							Circle, published many years ago by <persRef ref="croswell-william2"
								>William Croswell</persRef>, a college associate of judge Davis.
							This is an aid to the study of the constellations of which I had never
							before heard. At one O’Clock I met by previous agreement with my Son,
							him and his daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa
								Catherine</persRef>, at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef> where the
							Carriage was at that time ordered. Neither the Doctor, nor <persRef
								ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> was at home— But we met there at the time—
								<persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef>, the driver was punctual
							to the time with the Carriage, and we came home to Quincy to dine— I
							came home, burdened more than I ever was before, but with spirits too
							much dissipated to resume at once the broken thread. A <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef> of Newton with
								<persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef> a daughter of <persRef
								ref="jackson-william2">William Jackson</persRef>, returning from an
							excursion to Plymouth, called to see me for curiosity— <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marsh</persRef> teacher of a
							school at Milton came with a subscription paper for a contribution to
							purchase an apparatus for lect<unclear>ures</unclear> on Natural philosophy: to cost 500
							dollars. I went up the hill at Sunset to see <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Char<unclear>les</unclear></persRef> but she was out on a visit to <persRef
								ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef>— She
							and Charles afterwards came and spent a short evening here— I could
							accomplish nothing more than the diary of yesterday though I began with
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, the companion to
							Middleton’s celestial Atlas, comparing the book with the maps; and both
							with the real spangles in the skies which were never arrayed in brighter
							splendor than this Evening. I recognized several old acquaintance among
							the constellations.</p>

						<p>Light frost. I wrought with my spade and hoe upon the hill; but found
							work which can only be done with the plough— The mornings are becoming
							so cold, and the pressure of my indoor work so excessive that I must
							henceforth renounce my excursions before sunrise, or limit them to a
							quarter of an hour. My visitors this day were <persRef
								ref="childs-lovell">Lovell Childs</persRef>; a young man who said he
							resided at Andover; had some business in this part of the country, and
							came to see me, from mere curiosity— Next <persRef ref="aldrich-peleg"
								>P. Emory Aldrich</persRef> of Prescott, Massachusetts, <persRef
								ref="baker-william">William Baker</persRef> of Newark, Ohio and
								<persRef ref="atchison-daniel">Daniel D. Atchison</persRef> of
							Lexington Kentucky, Students at the Law-school in Cambridge, told me
							that they came to Quincy to see me and the quarries.— After a short
							conversation they asked for my autograph— I wrote my name on 3 visiting
							cards with the date, and asked them, much to their amusement, for their
							autographs in return; which they gave me, all on one sheet of Letter
							paper— Then a young man, named <persRef ref="warren-george3">George
								Warren</persRef>, came from Boston with a recommendatory Letter from
								<persRef ref="hayden-william">William Hayden</persRef> senior editor
							of the Atlas, and accompanied by another young man named <persRef
								ref="u">Turner</persRef>, to invite and urge me to deliver a Lecture
							before the mercantile library association, which I was constrained to
							decline— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> was here this evening, wanting to borrow <persRef
								ref="u">Eliot’s</persRef> biography for some notice of the death of
								<persRef ref="hoar-leonard">Leonard Hoar</persRef> sometime
							President of Harvard College— The book was at <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> up the hill— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt found it there, but not what he
							wanted in it— I strip’d the remainder of wild cherries from the garden
							seedling, about half a pint, but a full quart had been borrowed while I
							was at New-Bedford— I picked up a dozen English white oak acorns fallen
							from the trees; but they all floated. Five or six that I gathered sunk
							and are plantable— I bought in a wool clad worm with the twig and leaf
							on which I found him— Charles’s sons <persRef ref="adams-john17"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles7">Charles</persRef>
							were brought home from Hingham, and <persRef ref="sampson-rachel">Miss
								Sampson</persRef> was taken home to Braintree this afternoon. I read
							in <persRef ref="schumacher-heinrich">Schumacher’s</persRef>
							Astronomische Nachrichten N. 264. August 1834. the first notice of the
							Pulkova observatory; and made some further progress in reading <persRef
								ref="bailly-jean">Bailly’s</persRef> history—but not half a page in
							writing my own address; though I wrote myself more than once asleep.—
							Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> were here
							in the evening. I read with <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef> two Sections of the Companion to <persRef
								ref="middleton-james">Middleton’s</persRef> celestial
							Atlas—comparing them with the maps and with the stars in the sky— The
								<persRef ref="mercator-gerardus">Mercator’s</persRef> map of
								<persRef ref="croswell-william2">Croswell</persRef> is not of much
							use— I was compelled by mere heaviness of spirit to retire to bed
							immediately after ten.</p>
